we went in and sat down at the booth , and the wa@@ it@@ ress came over , made a big com@@ motion over T@@ ip@@ per .
( la@@ ughter ) She took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much , I had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
and he was w@@ aving a piece of paper , and he was y@@ elling , " Call Washington ! call Washington ! "
and I thought to myself , in the middle of the night , in the middle of the Atlantic , what in the world could be wrong in Washington ?
I update the slide show every time I give it .
it 's like beach @@@ -@@ @ comb@@ ing , you know ?

the sign is wrong .
and with what Vin@@ od , and John Do@@ er@@ r and others , many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this we@@ dge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it .
you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are , and then you will be given options to reduce .
and if they judge how much they 're going to get paid on your capital that they 've invested , based on the short @@@ -@@ @ term returns , you 're going to get short @@@ -@@ @ term decisions .

and it comes out in May .

once it becomes a closed system , with U.S. participation , then everybody who 's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
the market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this .
because presently , the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done .
let 's re @@@ -@@ @ brand global warming , as many of you have suggested .
I like " climate crisis " instead of " climate collapse , " but again , those of you who are good at bran@@ ding , I need your help on this .
this is an opportunity .
so there 's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people , and practice preventive medicine on a global scale .
and in the M@@ RI and M@@ R spec@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ y here , the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year .
many neuro@@ scientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis .
there 's 10,000 ne@@ ur@@ ons here .
first , it 's clearly a non @@@ -@@ @ invasive , wireless form of communication .
now let 's take a look at these mirac@@ ulous recei@@ vers up close .
so in this cartoon , the bl@@ u@@ ish white cell in the upper @@@ -@@ @ left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light @@@ -@@ @ activated por@@ e .
Sus@@ ana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light @@@ -@@ @ activated por@@ e .
you 're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustr@@ ate you when you try to sw@@ at the fly .
( la@@ ughter ) An@@ y@@ way , as you 'll see in a moment , Sus@@ ana was able to turn on the flight motor of what 's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the head@@ less bodies to actually take off and fly away .
each odor acti@@ vates a different combination of sensors , which in turn acti@@ vates a different odor detector in the mush@@ room body .
so the pilot in the cock@@ pit of the fly , the Ac@@ tor , can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LE@@ Ds lights up .
in the experiments I told you about , we have lifted the identity of the Cri@@ tic , but we still have no idea how the Cri@@ tic does its job .
well , there 's lots to talk about , but I think I 'm just going to play to start off .
that 's what it feels like to me .
it 's not pleasant .
and B@@ erti@@ e County is no exception to this .
so it sounds like I 'm painting a really bl@@ ea@@ k picture of this place , but I promise there is good news .
but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there , there is a huge need .
you come in , you face the wall , you take your test and you leave .
and the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing .
this is R@@ yan .
and going out into the community and inter@@ viewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that 's a home@@ work assignment .
for nearly two decades now , the news has been bad and the images have been ha@@ unting .
but hang on , this talk is to be about the good news .
despite the up and down since then , the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points downward for the past two decades .
to put it differently , for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war , there is no good war and there is no bad peace .
cru@@ cially , for the long @@@ -@@ @ term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland , he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations .
subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments , who never wa@@ vered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland .
it needs to help them reach an equitable compromise , and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local , regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement .
thank you .
the following is a time line of treaties made , treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles .
the execution was ordered by President Lin@@ col@@ n , only two days after he signed the E@@ man@@ cip@@ ation Pro@@ clamation .

a long time ago , a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me , by wa@@ si@@ ch@@ u , eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills .
it 's not your business what they do with them .
these places , these origins , represent governance gaps .
and right now , that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us , that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption .
in fact , about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore , particularly China and India , and we don 't have a governance system .
we can do it . the technical solutions are there .
ask yourself , is this company be@@ having in a socially responsible way ?
I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can 't get used to the idea that somehow we can 't get them to do their jobs .
but there are companies .
poor people , people whose human rights have been violated -- the cru@@ x of that is the loss of dignity , the lack of dignity .
and I study that in the natural world , the inter@@ connec@@ tedness of species .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the inter@@ connections of habitat patches for endangered species in Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite National Park .
so let 's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government .
it was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago .
I don 't know about this , but this is what I can deci@@ ph@@ er from this diagram in 24 seconds .
so what 's the problem , why has this ch@@ asm opened up , and what can we do to fix it ?
and in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
what is it that we want to ask ? what is it we 're trying to find out here ?
so there 's another thing that comes up with basics .
this one kind of anno@@ ys me , I must say .
I don 't think so -- quite the opposite .
it did not evolve for natural survival .
it 's women who actually push history forward .
the trees , by the way , are often preferred if they for@@ k near the ground , that is to say , if they 're trees you could sc@@ ram@@ ble up if you were in a tight fix .
their sym@@ metry , their attractive materials and , above all , their me@@ ticul@@ ous work@@ manship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes , even today .
all you have to do is play with it , change it a little bit , and come up with something that does help , that does work .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And one of these principles is focus .
you have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen .
you know , perspective is one of these critically important life @@@ -@@ @ coping strategies that mountain bi@@ king can really teach you .
this was the first place where we got some water and supplies . "
and he goes on saying , and everyone looks at him like a hero , probably for the first time in his life .

when the turbine drops in , it will produce 8,000 wat@@ ts of electricity , day and night .
and you know what these are .
there 's nowhere to fl@@ ush .
these are com@@ post toilets , and nobody at the school wanted to know about them , especially the principal .
and they work . people use them . people are ok@@ ay .
I met a father the other day ; he looked a little cra@@ zed .
I said , " Welcome to Green School . "
it 's becoming a community .
we had to look at everything .
all the f@@ ences at Green School are green .
they took the tap@@ i@@ oca roots up to the kitchen , s@@ lic@@ ed them thin@@ ly and made delicious chips .
local Bal@@ in@@ ese women cook the food on sa@@ w@@ dust bur@@ ners using secrets that only their grand@@ mothers know .
green School is a place of pione@@ ers , local and global .
but you also learn other things .
( la@@ ughter ) We 've done a lot of ou@@ trage@@ ous things in our lives , and we said , ok@@ ay , local , what does " local " mean ?
local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be Bal@@ in@@ ese , and this was a really big commitment .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
it may not be the biggest b@@ ambo@@ o building in the world , but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful .
the " high seas " is a legal term , but in fact , it covers 50 percent of the planet .
some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example , shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore .
what I 'd also like to convey is that it is not all do@@ om and glo@@ om that we are seeing in the high seas .
in 2009 , when the U.@@ N. reviewed progress , they discovered that almost 100 million square @@@ -@@ @ kilometers of seabed had been protected .
it 's provided us data like this , of tiny , little so@@ o@@ ty sh@@ ear@@ waters that make the entire ocean basin their home .
so stay tun@@ ed for further information .
now , I 'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shou@@ ld@@ n 't support , but I am going to tell you that , if it matters to you , your legislators need to know that .
should V@@ ander play football ?
this is my story .
it 's too painful . you don 't want to think about it .
that 's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me .
this is the language of ster@@ ility .
or , as we speak now , hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mu@@ til@@ ated .
these just become numbers that we refer to .
do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going ?
there is a side that fights , and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open .
in order for us to understand what actually peace means , we need to understand , as one Sudanese woman once told me , " Peace is the fact that my to@@ en@@ ails are growing back again . "
are there good news ? of course , there are good news . there are lots of good news .
so , we have companies and non @@@ -@@ @ profits and ch@@ arities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort .
it seems like it 's perfectly reasonable to ask that .
I just did tasks .
and this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that do@@ es@@ n 't work when you 're interrupted , and that is sleep .
I did the sleep thing -- I went to bed , I laid down , but I did@@ n 't really sleep . "
if you talk to certain managers , they 'll tell you that they don 't want their employees to work at home because of these distr@@ actions .
I mean , is this China ? what the hell is going on here ?
and managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people .
because the offices are well @@@ -@@ @ equipped ; everything is there for them to do the work .
but they don 't want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
if you try that , I think you 'll agree , and hopefully you can do it more often .
( la@@ ughter ) Then , looking up in the tur@@ ret , you see there are bul@@ ges and po@@ kes and s@@ ags and so forth .
( la@@ ughter ) This is a laundry ch@@ ute .
it 's a two @@@ -@@ @ person tub .
( la@@ ughter ) And sure enough , we 've had no problems with bull ele@@ ph@@ ants .
put it in the shower , or in the clos@@ et , but not in the fo@@ yer .
then , somebody gave me a bi@@ de@@ t , so it got a bi@@ de@@ t .
what does that mean ?
but you 've never seen this one before .
it only r@@ att@@ les that expected pattern and unity of structural features .
because Ge@@ st@@ alt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern .
if I have 100 of these , 100 of those , it makes no difference what these and those are .

we 're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya . "
there are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East .
no , it 's because of the story , because we feel personally involved in that story .
what 's the origin story of the Middle East ?
so in that sense , he 's the symbolic third side of the Middle East .
now , think about that for a moment .
that 's the essence of the Abraham Path .
he said , " It was like a light that went on in our lives -- it brought us hope . "
because as people walk , they spend money .
and this woman right here , U@@ m Ahmad , is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan .
it simply depends on us .
that 's a third @@@ -@@ @ side act .
that 's walking Abraham 's Path .
there 's an old African pro@@ ver@@ b that goes : " when spi@@ der@@ web@@ s unite , they can halt even the lion . "
capitalism , fundamentally , is a series of market@@ places .
and all of these things have to happen sym@@ bio@@ tically .
the operating system needs to keep getting more and more advanced to keep up with innovation .
but if we would count all the individuals , and we take an average weight of them , it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth .
and here you see me in a small , provincial town in China , Li@@ jiang -- about two million inhabitants .
and that 's your view of a tom@@ ato .
the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing expon@@ entially .
in the developing world it 's much lower .
they 're even models in medicine , and we can even trans@@ plant organs from a pig to a human .
and even in terms of cal@@ ories , it is very good .
on the right @@@ -@@ @ hand side you see a gra@@ s@@ shop@@ per .
Mar@@ cel Dic@@ ke : it 's all protein .
well don 't talk rat , but we have a cl@@ ick@@ er , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
thank you very much .
it 's the notion that all people in a society deserve fair and equitable rights , opportunities and access to resources .
everything they experience in our rooms is bound up in historical context , and so if we insist that education happens in a vacuum , we do our students a dis@@ service .
what matters is that we 're helping students have those conversations with each other .
and that means that as adults , we need to learn how to become effective facilitators of our students ' activis@@ m .
so on the morning of June 16 , 1976 , thousands of kids from the town@@ ship of So@@ we@@ to walked out of schools .
the kids who chose to stay spent that afternoon in class .
and 75 percent of those kids said that helping other people who are having difficulty was a " very important " or " essential " goal for them .
and some , including some students ' families , were really angry that the school had@@ n 't done more to prevent them from leaving .
their power will help them make tomorrow better .
when we put together a brick of Leg@@ o , it 's very strong but very easily manip@@ ulated .
but in order for us to efficiently recycl@@ e a jacket like this , we need to be able to easily remove these items and quickly get down to just the fabric .
but d@@ ye@@ ing clothes naturally this way would allow for us to make sure they 're more unique and environmentally friend@@ lier .
but we can get started by designing clothes with their death in mind .
so I 'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that 's that I 'm a phil@@ os@@ op@@ her .
and he says , you know , " Phil@@ osoph@@ ers love rational argument . "
they think , " No , there can 't be any sort of natur@@ alistic explanation of consciousness . "
if there 's time at the end , I 'll show you the much more dramatic case .
it 's the same thing .
yes , it 's possible to do that .
but the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
you just know that you have certain beliefs .
we don 't have any trouble seeing the cu@@ be , but where does the color change ?
2.9 seconds .
there are a few more really dramatic ones , and then I 'll close .
that 's a lot .
I want to take something rather humble to discuss .
and it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime .
it grows and is nur@@ tured .
there are different types of waste .
if you can see this orange tree , it 's actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and se@@ wn up .
this is the kitchen , which is in the same room .
ok@@ ay , it 's a small kitchen . it 's about five square meters .
but this story 's not about eliminating it , it 's about minimizing it .
in here , I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable .
I put my food waste into this de@@ hydr@@ ating , desi@@ cc@@ ating mac@@ er@@ ator -- turns food into an inner material , which I can store and then com@@ post later .
all of the soil you can see there is basically my food , which is generated by the restaurant , and it 's growing in these tu@@ bs , which I made out of storm @@@ -@@ @ f@@ elled trees and wine c@@ asks and all kinds of things .
a couple of wor@@ mer@@ ies in there too .
it was like vegetable jer@@ ky , and killed all of them .
it literally is Water@@ house .
he 's growing all his own fruit , and that 's fantastic .
ac@@ or@@ n House is the element of wood ; Water@@ house is the element of water ; and I 'm thinking , well , I 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine ac@@ up@@ un@@ c@@ ture specialities .
so I 'm committing to potatoes ; I 'm committing to milk ; I 'm committing to le@@ e@@ ks and bro@@ c@@ col@@ i -- all very important stuff .
they 're here . you can see I 've done three so far ; I 've got a few more to go .
and I hope you all take part .
I grew up outside of Chicago , and I was an athlete and I was very lucky to get recruited to play football at Harvard University .
and then after graduating , like most Harvard graduates , I decided I wanted to join the WW@@ E .
and I was@@ n 't getting the answers I needed from doctors , and so I started dig@@ ging into the medical literature .
and I said , " Great ! "
so when we started this , only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease that had been studied in brain banks .
those older people were not going to be able to make the crossing with them .
and even if there had been , many of the people that they were leaving did not even have telephones .
or , " Your mother is very , very ill .
but it turned out that the South did not take kindly to this po@@ aching of its cheap labor .
we know that because that is what they and their children and now their grand@@ children and even great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ children have often chosen to become once they had the chance to choose for themselves what they would do with their God @@@ -@@ @ given talents .
but one person added to another person , added to another person , multiplied by millions , were able to become the advance guard of the civil rights movement .
much more -- ( Dr@@ um sound ) and I just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
so there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
if I asked you to cla@@ p -- maybe I can do this .
( no sound ) See , you 're awa@@ ke .
( light cl@@ apping sounds ) E@@ G : ( laugh@@ s ) Not bad . not bad .
so we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
you know , I need to say something .
but I don 't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
but thank you very much for having me !
but in the last couple of years we 've become in@@ famous for a couple of things .
why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm ?
and , although we do work in the financial sector , where Excel is king , we believe in emotional capital .
so what do you get ? you get better decision @@@ -@@ @ making , and you get less her@@ d behavior , and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results .
will government change ?
they 're 11 and 12 .
there was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tam@@ mi@@ e -- and I , we just got real busy and whi@@ p , ba@@ m , boom : K@@ end@@ all and J@@ ay .
why are you c@@ rying ? "
I think back to my father .
my mother , my sister , my a@@ unti@@ e , they all get out , but my father and I stayed in the lim@@ ous@@ ine , and no sooner than the women got out , he burst out c@@ rying .
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
he was a troubled k@@ id .
but I 've got to tell you , we young guys , we looked up to this du@@ de , man .
so one day , I 'm out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around , doing something -- I don 't know what .
" He@@ y Anthony , come on up@@ stairs . "
John@@ ny call , you go .
two things : one , I never had sex .
for everybody else , we go around like we 've been having sex since we were two .
we had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her .
anyway , John@@ ny had just gotten through having sex with her .
well actually , he raped her , but he would say he had sex with her .
so now I 'm no longer trying to figure out what I 'm going to do ; I 'm trying to figure out how I 'm going to get out of this room .
but I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
this fear , getting outside the man box , totally envelop@@ ed me .
let me begin with my parents .
my family , in my city , and almost in the country , was unique .
we were four of us , not one , and fortunately no boys .
my father de@@ fied his own grand@@ father , almost to the point of dis@@ inheritance , because he decided to educate all four of us .
he sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education .
so this is the foundation time which I got .
I don 't know if he really meant [ that ] , but it happened .
since I 'm a product of this philosophy , of 90 / 10 , and secondly , " life on an incl@@ ine , " that 's the way I grew up to be valu@@ ing what I got .
why I said this , is the background .
but I decided no , it 's a power to prevent , because that 's what I learned when I was growing up .
how do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
what you see , if you see the title called " PM 's car held . "
obviously , it was .
terrorists , ra@@ pi@@ sts , bur@@ gl@@ ars , gang@@ sters -- some of them I 'd sent to jail as a police officer outside .
and then how did I deal with them ?
and I said , " Do you pray ? " when I looked at the group , I said , " Do you pray ? "
they saw me as a young , short woman wearing a Pa@@ than suit .
and they did@@ n 't say anything .
friends , this has never happened , where everybody in the prison studies .
I started this with community support .
it was one of the finest , largest volunteerism in any prison in the world .
this was initiated in Delhi prison .
I think that 's the bigger change .
it was the beginning of a change .
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
this was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor .
and this is what transformed .
you want to know more about this , go and see this film , " Do@@ ing Time , Do@@ ing V@@ ip@@ ass@@ ana . "
because crime is a product of a distorted mind .
not by preaching , not by telling , not by reading , but by addressing your mind .
and you see , everybody 's busy . there was no time to waste .
secondly is about the anti @@@ -@@ @ corruption movement in India .
not a lot of women did .
I was reading head@@ lines about the recession just like anyone else , and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women .
and I realized that two things were different this time around .
so they spread out all the census data , and what they found , the guy described to me as a sh@@ ock@@ er , which is that in 1,9@@ 97 out of 2,000 communities , women , young women , were making more money than young men .
it means that the economy is dividing into high @@@ -@@ @ skill , high @@@ -@@ @ wage jobs and low @@@ -@@ @ skill , low @@@ -@@ @ wage jobs -- and that the middle , the middle @@@ -@@ @ skill jobs , and the middle @@@ -@@ @ earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy .
the men sort of stagn@@ ate there , while the women zoom up in those high @@@ -@@ @ skill jobs .
if you look at management theory these days , it used to be that our ideal leader s@@ ounded something like General P@@ att@@ on , right ?
you would be issuing orders from above .
but that 's not what an ideal leader is like now .
to see what 's going to happen , you can 't just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce .
and what 's even more disturbing is what 's happening with younger boys .
is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum , and little girls are better at that than little boys ?
and some people say it 's because , in 9th grade , boys start dropping out of school .
because I 'm writing a book about all this , I 'm still looking into it , so I don 't have the answer .
( video ) No@@ a : the girls are obviously s@@ mar@@ ter .
No@@ a : why ? they were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nic@@ ely .
in India , poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India .
in China , a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses , small businesses , faster than men .
but over the ' 7@@ 0s and ' 8@@ 0s , the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industri@@ alize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the workforce .
and we have a lot of skill and experience , but it 's a trick , so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?
there 's no hole in the middle that you 're going to fall through .
I have been teaching for a long time , and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students .
in 1931 , my grand@@ mother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade .
but the information was closer to me .
but I knew that the kids would show up , and I believed it , and I told them every week what I expected out of them .
and they will step up .
the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary .
we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
in Philadelphia we have a one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information .
so we did this project , and this is one of the arti@@ facts of the project .
they can talk -- they 're very smooth , and they can write very , very well , but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them .
the reason I can remember them is because they are creatures of habit .
so if you think about what the problem is with your strong ties , think about your significant other , for example .
we do this automatically . we can 't even help it .
at another university I worked at , there was only one mail room , so all the faculty from all over that building would run into each other in that social hub .
they tell me when they 're doing pic@@ k@@ up basketball games , or my favorite example is when they go to a dog park .
and you 're creating that random@@ ness , that luck that is going to cause you to widen your travels , through your social universe .
but in fact , there 's more to it than that .
sometimes we actually buy ourselves a second @@@ -@@ @ class ticket to travel our social universe .
this one is passive , being a passenger on that train , and it 's quite linear .
it seems to us that when people start dis@@ sem@@ bling , people start lying about things , that 's when it gets really interesting .
the baby was coming , and I was ready for this M@@ ack truck of love to just kno@@ ck me off my feet .
we have char@@ ted our love for our child over time .
( la@@ ughter ) This , as you know , is an act of he@@ res@@ y .
so I 'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life , this ch@@ asm of happiness that we 're driving our pro@@ verb@@ ial convertible straight into .
it can 't possibly be that bad .
there 's another factor in our case .
can we move that up a little bit ?
I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us .
given a scene like this , a modern computer @@@ -@@ @ vision algorithm can tell you that there 's a woman and there 's a dog .
the thoughts , memories and stories that a scene like this might ev@@ oke for humans .
and that same bias , that same blind spot continued well into the ' 9@@ 0s .
in contrast , artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate .
we already see and know this in the technology that we use today .
we use smart phones and digital assistants and Ro@@ om@@ bas .
we set into motion that dom@@ ino effect that car@@ ves out AI 's evolutionary path .
but in this case , it is@@ n 't a self @@@ -@@ @ driving car without any destination .
there 's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become .
and you 'll have to decide which one you find more attractive .
Bec@@ ka : the smile , I think .
I like the sm@@ ir@@ ky look better .
but what you all want to know is of course does this extend also to more complex , more meaningful choices ?
then we asked them to answer 12 of these questions .
some go from being uncertain to clear voting intention .
but we show there is a much larger number that would actually consider shifting their attitudes .
so be@@ ware when you ask people the question " why " because what may happen is that , if you asked them , " So why do you support this issue ? "
we can change our minds .
our attitudes are not set in stone .
but it 's one thing to talk about the brain , and it 's another to see it .
and I shou@@ ld@@ n 't be mis@@ erable .
but what I noticed is that after every swe@@ at @@@ -@@ @ induc@@ ing workout that I tried , I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost .
and finally , you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time .
WS : new move -- up@@ per@@ cut , right and left .
can 't see all the hands , but it looks like all of you , right ?
now I 'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm @@@ -@@ @ up to the sequ@@ el coming out next week .
over the next minute , you 're going to see a bit like a conceptual fire@@ works display of all the do@@ ts that went on in my head .
I believe also , our generation , our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation .
and this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption .
Far@@ ai begins , her eyes s@@ welling with tears .
three weeks pass .
now , suicide is not an unusual event in the world of mental health .
but there was something about Eric@@ a 's death that struck me at the core of my very being .
and I thought , grand@@ mothers are in every community .
there are hundreds of them .
they will reduce the treatment gap for mental , neuro@@ logical and substance @@@ -@@ @ use disorders .
but this did@@ n 't happen .
in addition to the poverty problem we were confronted with as the local urban poor , we were facing challenges due to our refugee status , such as a language barrier .
in Congo , the official language is French .
now I 'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique , very , very special , individu@@ alistic and often se@@ duc@@ tive female characters .
so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name .
we were perhaps taking her for granted , and maybe she did@@ n 't like that that much .
Be@@ ver@@ ly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is , and I 'm on the other side where my space is .
but at the same time , we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else 's car , it might not turn out the same way -- she might get shot for that .
it was like watching a graduation ceremony .
but only when we saw the tiny baby Bab@@ oon cl@@ inging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Leg@@ ade@@ ma .
because she is a cu@@ b wanting to play , but she was also a pre@@ dat@@ or needing to kill , and yet conflic@@ ted in some way , because she was also an emerging mother .
she had this maternal instinc@@ t , much like a young girl on her way to wom@@ an@@ hood , and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality .
B@@ J : so you have to know , looking into the eyes of lions and le@@ op@@ ards right now , it is all about critical awareness .
what is a bird ?
that was one sentence .
Henry James would be proud .
so what are our intentions , and what would our intentions be -- if we wake up in the morning , we have designs on the world -- well , what would our intention be as a species now that we 're the dominant species ?
but I don 't know that that 's the common debate .
if the end game is global warming , they 're doing great .
( appl@@ ause ) So , the question is , how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families ?
our goal is a del@@ ight@@ fully diverse , safe , healthy and just world , with clean air , clean water , soil and power -- economically , equitably , ecologically and eleg@@ antly enjoyed , period .
is there anybody here who do@@ es@@ n 't breathe ?
we see that companies acting eth@@ ically in this world are out@@ performing those that don 't .
on the other hand , we 're working with Berk@@ shire Ha@@ th@@ away , W@@ arre@@ n Bu@@ ffe@@ t@@ t and Sha@@ w Car@@ pet , the largest carpet company in the world .
you can 't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries without understanding nutrient flow .
if we look at the world of architecture , we see with M@@ ies ' 1928 tower for Berlin , the question might be , " Well , where 's the sun ? "
and this might have worked in Berlin , but we built it in Houston , and the windows are all closed . and with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use , this is actually a vertical gas chamber .
in 1984 , we did the first so @@@ -@@ @ called " green office " in America for Environmental Defense .
we started asking manufacturers what were in their materials .
they said , " They 're proprietary , they 're legal , go away . "
and yet , N@@ OA@@ A has now shown us , for example -- you see that little blue thing above Hawa@@ ii ?
that 's the Pacific Gy@@ re .
does it work ? do I like it ?
we 're adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
it means the way Olympic athletes train with each other .
we have since datab@@ ased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing , and we 're releasing this database into the public in six weeks .
so the biological nutrients , the first fabrics -- the water coming out was clean enough to drink .
the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever , some of the materials go back to soil -- it 's all solar @@@ -@@ @ powered .
they 'll have cities with no energy and no food .
we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .
the transportation is all very simple , everybody 's within a five @@@ -@@ @ minute walk of mobility .
but all that aside , we still have a problem , and it 's a real problem .
a recent study in the U.S. showed that , of married senior managers , two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the married men had children and only one @@@ -@@ @ third of the married women had children .
and I realized he do@@ es@@ n 't know where the women 's room is in his office .
and he said , " No , we 've been here about a year . "
I don 't have the right answer .
one , sit at the table .
two , make your partner a real partner .
when I was in college , my senior year , I took a course called European Intellectual History .
Don 't you love that kind of thing from college ?
and then Carri@@ e reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin , goes to all the lectures .
women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
I put my hand down , and I noticed all the women did the same , and then you took more questions , only from the men . "
and I don 't think Sunday football @@@ -@@ @ watching and general la@@ z@@ iness is the cause .
we know that two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of them are going to go back .
now , I 'm going to take you to Los Angeles , and lots of people know that L.@@ A. has its issues .
but the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father 's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
when we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little c@@ ough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners , but everybody .
but her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy .
( appl@@ ause ) But these three people don 't know each other , but they do have an aw@@ ful lot in common .
I haven 't created it , and it 's not happening by accident .
( la@@ ughter ) But during that time , I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
and I tell you , being on the TED stage and winning a Mac@@ Arthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived .
but since then , the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TE@@ D@@ 2006 Talk became this little thing .
and we love this , because I love construction now , because we 're watching these things actually happen .
home@@ town security is next on my to @@@ -@@ @ do list .
and she called , and she said , " I 'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little fl@@ yer . "
so I think what I 'll do is just call you a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er . "
why don 't you just say I 'm a researcher @@@ -@@ @ stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er . "
and she went , " Ha ha . there 's no such thing . "
I want to h@@ ack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see .
so where I started was with connection .
and it turned out to be shame .
and so I thought , this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick .
( la@@ ughter ) You know this .
but here 's what I can tell you that it bo@@ ils down to -- and this may be one of the most important things that I 've ever learned in the decade of doing this research .
at one point , people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years .
they believe they 're worthy .
so I wrote at the top of the man@@ ila folder , and I started looking at the data .
the other thing that they had in common was this : they fully embraced vulnerability .
they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful .
( la@@ ughter ) A spiritual awak@@ ening sounds better than breakdown , but I assure you , it was a breakdown .
Don 't bring your measuring stick . "
my first meeting with her , Di@@ ana -- I brought in my list of the way the whole @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted live , and I sat down .
and I said , " I 'm great . I 'm ok@@ ay . "
and this is a therap@@ ist who sees therap@@ ists , because we have to go to those , because their B.@@ S. meters are good .
and I think I have a problem , and I need some help . "
and I said , " But here 's the thing : no family stuff , no childhood sh@@ it . "
( la@@ ughter ) For me , it was a year@@ long street fight .
I lost the fight , but probably won my life back .
so this is what I learned .
we num@@ b vulnerability -- when we 're waiting for the call .
and then , we are mis@@ erable , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of be@@ ers and a ban@@ ana nut mu@@ ff@@ in .
this is what politics looks like today .
there are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction .
if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that .
and most important , a wise person does this impro@@ vising and rule @@@ -@@ @ bending in the service of the right aims .
if you are a rule @@@ -@@ @ ben@@ der and an impro@@ vis@@ er mostly to serve yourself , what you get is ru@@ th@@ less manipulation of other people .
and the family was united .
we identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call cann@@ y out@@ laws .
no one wanted non @@@ -@@ @ violent offenders -- and especially non @@@ -@@ @ violent offenders who were veterans to boot -- to be thrown into prison .
and K@@ en and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want .
they want to have permission to do the right thing .
rules and incentives don 't tell you how to be a good friend , how to be a good parent , how to be a good spouse , or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher .
( appl@@ ause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new femin@@ ist issue .
it 's gardens wat@@ ered by running streams .
and I 'll tell you that most scientific studies of music , they 're very dense , and when you go through them , it 's very hard to recognize the music in it .
I ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this .
so this is a 12 @@@ -@@ @ bar bl@@ ues , and I 've broken it down into four @@@ -@@ @ bar groups , so you would know how you would trade .
so what am I showing you here ?
he had it also hom@@ olog@@ ous on the right .
so I told my lab members that I would rap for TED , and they said , " No , you won 't . "
you 've got major cere@@ bel@@ lar activity , which is involved in motor coordination .
I am not a breast cancer survi@@ vor .
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
the factor most responsible for that fire is breast density .
think about iP@@ ods compared to stere@@ os .
one M@@ RI scan costs 10 times what a digital mam@@ mo@@ gram costs .
now gam@@ ma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart , and it had even been tried to image the breast .
but the potential advantage was that gam@@ ma rays , unlike X @@@ -@@ @ rays , are not influenced by breast density .
after we had demonstrated that we could find small tum@@ ors , we used these images to submit a grant to the Sus@@ an G. K@@ omen Foundation .
the digital mam@@ mo@@ gram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue , but the MB@@ I shows an area of intense uptake , which correlated with a two @@@ -@@ @ centi@@ meter tumor .
but I recognize -- ( Appl@@ ause ) I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the sound@@ ness of the science .
the MB@@ I unit has now been FDA approved , but it 's not yet widely available .
so the Aw@@ es@@ ome story : it begins about 40 years ago , when my mom and my d@@ ad came to Canada .
and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be .
and Monday morning , I found out that he disappeared .
over the last few years , I haven 't had that much time to really think .
I 'd like to pause my TE@@ D@@ Talk for about 10 seconds right now , because you don 't get many opportunities in life to do something like this , and my parents are sitting in the front row .
( la@@ ughter ) When I was five years old , my d@@ ad used to take me gro@@ cery shopping , and he would st@@ are in wonder at the little stic@@ kers that are on the fruits and vegetables .
I mean , we 're the only ones with architecture and agriculture .
we 've got books , bu@@ ffe@@ ts and radio waves , wedding bri@@ des and rol@@ ler@@ co@@ aster ri@@ des .
and that 's the sad part .
and I am not a complete pac@@ if@@ ist like some of my really , really heavy @@@ -@@ @ duty , non @@@ -@@ @ violent friends , like M@@ ai@@ read Mc@@ Gu@@ ire .
and I 'm trying harder and harder .
we need that in the world .
the Mil@@ lion Signat@@ ures Campaign of women inside Bur@@ ma working together to change human rights , to bring democracy to that country .
and what would happen is -- and the Gold Rus@@ h went on for years .
by about 18@@ 52 , they 're thinking , " A@@ m I the stup@@ id@@ est person on Earth by not rush@@ ing to California ? " and they start to decide they are .
they would take a ship down to Panama , across the is@@ th@@ mus , and then take another ship north .
same thing happened on the Internet . you get Dr@@ Ko@@ op@@ .com.
announ@@ cer : could be a really big deal to you . husband # 1 : is that your wife ?
now , here 's where our analogy with the Gold Rus@@ h starts to diver@@ ge , and I think rather severely .
and that was , of course , the very common story .
with the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they 're both sort of thin , horizontal , enabling layers that go across lots of different industries .
there 's a bun@@ ch of things that are interesting about electricity .
so the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure , and then home appliances started coming into being .
so it was@@ n 't a big seller .
on the left @@@ -@@ @ hand side , this was the so@@ apy water .
so we really haven 't progressed that much since 1908 .
so we 're not -- we 're pretty kl@@ udge @@@ -@@ @ y ourselves .
and suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape rec@@ orders .
so we have this thing called ambient intim@@ acy .
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
thank you .
I went and knoc@@ ked on the door of the Rio T@@ into Chair of Advanced Mineral Ex@@ traction at the Royal School of Mines and said , " How do you make steel ? "
and so this is after a day and about half a night smel@@ ting this iron .
so , my next -- ( Appl@@ ause ) The next thing I was trying to get was copper .
and the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of aci@@ dic and will start picking up , dis@@ solving the minerals from the mine .
so kind of out of desper@@ ation , I decided that I could think l@@ aterally .
so there was 240 vol@@ ts going through these hom@@ em@@ ade copper wires , hom@@ em@@ ade plug .
if you are a Republican , you can take a Democ@@ rat to lunch .
and then , before you get together , agree on some ground rules .
and what might happen at your lunch ?
I 'll meet you there . "
and so we should .
guess what ?
the first is zero tolerance .
and little moments in my life .
you tell a teacher that , and they 'll ask you , in all seriousness , " Should we send this child to the psych@@ ologist ? "
and the answer is no , he 's just a boy .
and so they say , I guess this really is@@ n 't a place for boys .
the answer to that question changes depending on who 's sitting around that table .
when you 're three , you better be able to write your name legi@@ bly , or else we 'll consider it a developmental delay .
by the time you 're in first grade , you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture , maybe not , in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages .
have you seen the ads ?
all of those conversations need to be happening .
they say , " Oh , ye@@ ah . they 're always talking about that stuff .
but if it were your culture , think of how that might feel .
they 're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies .
this is the boat we were on , by the way .
and what they 're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispers@@ ants can be highly toxic to phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
because none of us -- at least in the global North -- neither men nor women , are fully exempt from this message .
the amount of oil and dispers@@ ants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . "
now the problem is that the story was always a lie .
in environmental circles , we often hear that , rather than shifting to rene@@ wa@@ bles , we are continuing with business as usual .
it 's worth taking a moment to understand this practice , because I believe it speaks to reck@@ lessness and the path we 're on like little else .
my point is that this is not oil drilling .
a new frontier has been found .
most importantly , we don 't have to change our lifestyles after all .
thank@@ fully , I met Re@@ da Gir@@ g@@ is , who is dry as to@@ ast , but he and his team at John@@ s H@@ op@@ kins did@@ n 't just want me to survive , they wanted me to live a meaningful life .
well , the altitude exacerbated my symptoms .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't walk as much as I used to , so I opted for five @@@ -@@ @ inch he@@ els .
I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to f@@ aint .
if you get a bubble in your medicine -- because you have to mix it every morning -- and it stays in there , you probably die .
within a few days , I could walk again .
a few days after arriving , I met this wonderful , old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles .
and before long , I was commu@@ ting between Budapest , Milan and Florence .
I thought stem cells were a good option , but they had@@ n 't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet .
I finally decided it was time to take my doctor 's advice .
they were from Texas .
I fell into this ap@@ oc@@ aly@@ p@@ tic dream world .
they left my chest open for two weeks .
he said it would kill me .
( appl@@ ause ) [ S@@ inging : French ] Than@@ k you .
I had already been turned down by Google and several other firms and was getting frustrated .
( la@@ ughter ) The principal asked my parents into a meeting , asked my mother if there had been complications at birth and suggested I meet with a school psych@@ ologist .
what if the oil actually got where it was trying to go ?
so oil and petro@@ chemicals are not just a problem when there 's a spill ; they 're a problem when there 's not .
poor people also suffer at the point of use .
those of us who earn a certain income level , we have something called choice .
often , we think we 're doing a good thing : you 're in your office , drinking your bott@@ led water or whatever it is , and you think to yourself , " I 'm going to throw this away .
and it 's the idea that we don 't have disposable anything .
but if we want to make something hard , we say , " I know ! I 'm going to make a hard substance .
but guess what ?
and really , they fundamentally told you , " Are you going to hu@@ g a tree ?
so this is where this little dear comes into play .
that machine is , today , about as fast as my iPhone .
this is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner .
but fully inter@@ actively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer , I can just put in a cli@@ p plane .
so this is from a virtual autop@@ sy .
without saying too much about this case , this is a traffic accident , a drunk driver hit a woman .
and this women also ended up under the car , so she 's quite badly beaten up by this injury .
it 's very easy to look at metal arti@@ facts that we can show inside of the body .
and what we 've done is that we 've turned the bullet into a light source , so that bullet is actually sh@@ ining , and it makes it really easy to find these fragments .
so it gained some traction , and we 're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes , but also , perhaps in the future , in a more clinical situation .
so this is really nice .
then he can examine how the heart is moving .
so Mo@@ t@@ ts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor cor@@ te@@ x .
now we 're also having a bit of fun at the center .
the only problem is to fit it into the machine .
some people in the last decade or two have started creating art@@ work with technology .
the bot , our rising celebr@@ ity , also has his own Twitter account : @ robo@@ tin@@ the@@ wild .
we 've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jo@@ kes .
if you don 't like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red .
ready for some jo@@ kes ?
first , let 's make sure he 's dead . "
and within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil -- all of them are multi@@ racial .
and the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embo@@ di@@ ment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization @@@ -@@ @ state .
so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
and therefore , they are , as a result , more cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan in many ways than the West .
I would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
and at last , I 'm afraid -- take Europe ; America is slightly different -- but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignor@@ ant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
or take this : now this is an idea , but it 's an idea to be tried out shortly in a subur@@ b of Beijing .
now behavior change is something that is a long @@@ -@@ @ standing problem in medicine .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non @@@ -@@ @ compliance .
so I 'm going to talk about one experiment that a few denti@@ sts in Connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago .
so this is an old experiment , but it 's a really good one , because it was very simple , so it 's an easy story to tell .
they showed p@@ uss o@@ o@@ zing out from between their teeth .
I mean , I showed my three @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old this slide last night , and he 's like , " Pap@@ a , why is an ambulance in these people 's homes ? "
so let me just spo@@ ol it out a little bit .
so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25 , and , of course , you 're going faster than that .
we always are . we 're always going above the speed limit .
your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
it 's very difficult to line things up so ne@@ at@@ ly .
this is the worst presented information .
what we did at W@@ ired was we went , and I got our graphic design department to re @@@ -@@ @ imagine these lab reports .
we tell you that you 're ok@@ ay , you 're normal .
now the CR@@ P test is often done following a ch@@ ole@@ ster@@ ol test , or in conjunction with a ch@@ ole@@ ster@@ ol test .
what you 're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language .
what does this mean ? help me understand what the data is .
what are my options ? what choices are now on the table ?
so I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information .
and engagement is essential here , because it 's not just giving them information ; it 's giving them an opportunity to act .
I was launched as a carto@@ on@@ ist .
it takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress , and it makes it unexpected , and that 's what el@@ icits a laugh .
and when I was five , my parents gave me an orange Sch@@ win@@ n S@@ ting @@@ -@@ @ R@@ ay bicycle .
that 's why they were called ap@@ e han@@ gers .
in fact , I made a living by walking .
get off the bus . seek out what 's different .
then he took my fi@@ bul@@ a from my cal@@ f , cut it out and then relocated it to my th@@ igh , where it now lives .
and what he actually did was he de @@@ -@@ @ vas@@ cul@@ arized it from my cal@@ f and re @@@ -@@ @ vas@@ cul@@ arized it in my th@@ igh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip .
and what was so striking -- and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today -- is the experience .
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people .
and on kind of the man@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ male front , he answers the phone -- I can say this I guess because you 've done it here -- he answers the phone , " Y@@ o , mo@@ ther@@ f@@ uc@@ ker . "
I was at a wall . "
I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great Central Valley of California to the bedro@@ ck of Manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character .
and it 's really a confl@@ ux of urban population rising , biodiversity plum@@ me@@ ting and also , of course , sea levels rising and climate changing .
so we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
here 's a map of my city , New York City , showing in@@ und@@ ation in red .
so we really had a lot to deal with .
when we started this project , one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .
and one oy@@ ster can filter up to 50 gall@@ ons of water a day .
( la@@ ughter ) Fin@@ ally , oy@@ sters can atten@@ u@@ ate and ag@@ gl@@ om@@ erate onto each other and form these amazing natural ree@@ f structures .
and with a $ 20 billion price tag , we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what 's in front of us .
it 's just that ; it 's this very inexpensive thing , available practically at your hardware store , and it 's very cheap .
( la@@ ughter ) So in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to kn@@ it .
and this glorious , readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oy@@ ster nursery below .
so rather than having 10 oy@@ sters , you have 10,000 oy@@ sters .
and then those sp@@ at are then see@@ ded .
and finally , how much fun it would be to watch the fl@@ up@@ sy parade and che@@ er on the oy@@ ster sp@@ ats as they go down to the ree@@ f .
we create things .
and this is a particularly small sco@@ oter for a gent@@ l@@ eman of this size .
but he 's trying to power it , or motor@@ ize it , with a drill .
but we hold them in San Francisco -- ( Appl@@ ause ) -- and in New York .
D@@ ale D@@ ough@@ er@@ ty : these are electric mu@@ ff@@ ins .
guy : where did you guys get those ?
and you can barely see it , but it 's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc .
so imagine a k@@ id : " am I going to get wet ? am I going to get wet ?
no , I did@@ n 't get wet . am I going to get wet ? am I going to get wet ? "
that 's the experience of a cle@@ ver ride .
I don 't know if this is called a basket @@@ -@@ @ bra , but it ought to be something like that .
they did that in the summer , and it was very warm .
you know what those are , right ?
Bil@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ Bob , or Bil@@ ly B@@ ass , or something like that .
now the background is -- the guy who did this is a phy@@ sic@@ ist .
they 're a bit subver@@ sive in what they do .
and I 'll tell you more about it , but just ...
( music ) ( Video ) narr@@ ator : of all things Americans are , we are makers .
but it was a sense of pride that we made things , that the world around us was made by us .
he 's just a k@@ id that grew up playing with tools instead of toys .
he liked to take things apart .
and there 's about three h@@ ack@@ er@@ spaces or more in De@@ tro@@ it .
if you don 't know what those are , they 're just the " bra@@ ins . "
and when someone opens your mailbox , you get a notification , an alert message goes to your iPhone .
these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars , and that means that hob@@ by@@ ists and ordinary fol@@ ks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers .
and we 've got to get this into schools , or into communities in many , many ways -- the ability to tin@@ ker , to shape and resha@@ pe the world around us .
there 's a great opportunity today -- and that 's what I really care about the most .
it 's old @@@ -@@ @ school demo@@ graphics .
they come up with these very restrictive labels to define us .
when they 're monitoring your cl@@ ick@@ stream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time fig@@ uring out your age , your gender and your income .
but they get a lot more information about what you do online , what you like , what interests you .
it had been presumed before .
if you look at the statistics -- these are worldwide statistics -- in every single age category , women actually out@@ number men in their use of social networking technologies .
more than a racial conversation , we need a racial literacy to dec@@ ode the politics of racial threat in America .
imagine if we could reduce the intensity of threat within those 60 seconds and keep our bra@@ ins from going on lock@@ down .
now , we can teach parents and children how to read , rec@@ ast and resolve using a mind@@ fulness strategy we call : " calculate , locate , communicate , breathe and ex@@ h@@ ale . "
stay with me .
the cool part is the bar@@ bers use their cultural style to deliver this health education to 18@@ - to 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old men while they 're cutting their hair .
and I know some of you are saying , " Practice ?
practice ?
I have two sons .
and we do not have time to talk about how that happened .
in August of 2013 , Jul@@ ian , who was eight at the time , and I were folding laundry , which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence , I should have known something strange was going to happen .
on the TV were Tra@@ y@@ von Martin 's parents , and they were c@@ rying because of the acquit@@ tal of George Zim@@ mer@@ man .
HS : yes .
HS : so he interrup@@ ts me to tell me a story about when he was racially threatened at a swimming pool with a friend by two grown white men , which his mother confirmed .
JS : what will happen ?
HS : well , they better run .
JS : because what ? HS : I 'm g@@ onn@@ a get ' em .
JS : see ? ( laugh@@ s ) HS : I 'm g@@ onn@@ a get ' em . JS : really ?
I don 't like that .
and you deserve to be on this planet , just as happy and beautiful and smart as you want to be .
you can do anything you want , baby .
can they make a healthy and just decision in 60 seconds ?
yes , we can .
thank you very much .
running : it 's basically just right , left , right , left , ye@@ ah ?
but the cool thing about running , as I 've discovered , is that something b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re happens in this activity all the time .
case in point : a couple months ago , if you saw the New York City Mar@@ athon , I guarantee you , you saw something that no one has ever seen before .
she 's 37 years old .
Pa@@ ula Rad@@ cli@@ ff@@ e , the one person who is sure to s@@ nat@@ ch the big pay@@ check from Der@@ ar@@ tu Tul@@ u 's under @@@ -@@ @ under@@ dog hands , suddenly gra@@ bs her leg and starts to fall back .
she cat@@ ches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line .
and Pa@@ ula Rad@@ cli@@ ff@@ e , at that point , says , " I 'm done . go . "
you show me a creature with web@@ bed feet and g@@ ills ; somehow water 's involved .
so what 's the connection ?
if you know it , you 're s@@ mar@@ ter than anybody on planet Earth .
now , we 're not using our strength , because we are the biggest sis@@ sies in the j@@ ung@@ le .
U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t can get his ass kicked by a squ@@ ir@@ rel .
the uter@@ us would literally fall out of the body .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , I 've been to a lot of mar@@ ath@@ ons , and I 've yet to see any ...
in that very short learning curve , you 've gone from broken organs up to the fact that you 're only 10 minutes off the male world record .
better than any other mam@@ mal on Earth , we can swe@@ at really well .
the pack has got to be able to sw@@ allow its ego , be cooperative , and pull together .
we try to cash in on it . right ?
thanks very much .
it is lif@@ eless .
I will craft my own drum .
this heart@@ beat is lou@@ der than death .
I live cycles of light and darkness .
we mour@@ n each one or we mean nothing at all .
resolutions , smoke .
if you must , fear the unexploded .
T@@ KM : and we 're going to tell you how to have a great sex life , right ?
we refuse to engage with sex properly .
T@@ KM : came through .
T@@ KM : also known as the African ero@@ tic .
now let 's take a bow to the " K@@ ama Su@@ tra , " the world 's first book on the plea@@ sures of sen@@ sual living .
what is the potential for doing great@@ ness on the kitchen counter , a sec@@ l@@ uded beach , the back@@ seat of a car or even simply in between the sheets ?
I 'd like all of you to pause for a moment , you w@@ ret@@ ched weak@@ lings , and take stock of your mis@@ erable existence .
so I went back to work , and I 've spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work @@@ -@@ @ life balance .
and I have four observations I 'd like to share with you today .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) It 's my contention that going to work on Friday in je@@ ans and [ a ] T @@@ -@@ @ shirt is@@ n 't really getting to the nu@@ b of the issue .
play a sport with a friend at lun@@ ch@@ time .
meet some mates in the pu@@ b for an early evening drink .
walk the dog . have sex again .
a fourth observation : we need to approach balance in a balanced way .
I then put him to bed , tuc@@ ked him in , gave him a k@@ iss on his fore@@ head and said , " Good@@ night , mate , " and walked out of his bedroom .
as I was walking out of his bedroom , he said , " D@@ ad ? " I went , " Yes , mate ? "
he went , " D@@ ad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . "
being more balanced do@@ es@@ n 't mean dramatic upheav@@ al in your life .
ever since I was a little girl seeing " Star Wars " for the first time , I 've been fasc@@ inated by this idea of personal robots .
this little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that , the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots .
we developed Leon@@ ardo in collaboration with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on Studio .
this is Mat@@ t Berlin inter@@ acting with Le@@ o , introducing Le@@ o to a new object .
and with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine new questions , new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .
people use these cu@@ es to determine things like how persu@@ asive someone is , how lik@@ able , how engaging , how trust@@ worthy .
and so in this video here -- this is a video taken from David De@@ St@@ en@@ o 's lab at Nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern University .
the next was to add mobility -- so , have the screen on a mobile base .
it turns out , when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost .
now let 's try to put this into a little bit of context .
so I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance @@@ -@@ @ play technology .
( la@@ ughter ) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study , they would come out to the car and say good @@@ -@@ @ b@@ ye to the robots .
they did@@ n 't do this with a computer .
I like to think of this as the A@@ tar@@ i P@@ ong of this bl@@ ended @@@ -@@ @ reality play .
and when it 's in their world , they can relate to it and play with it in a way that 's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
I actually want them to create those experiences .
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own .
so we 've been exploring a lot of ideas in tele@@ presence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them .
that 's the camp that we have in now 9@@ 0,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
would you explain the rules for admission ?
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society .
because the last 20 years , the Somali woman has stood up .
DM : for me , my mother was preparing [ me ] when I was a child to become a doctor , but I really did@@ n 't want to .
my sister was different .
you see 300 patients , 20 surg@@ eries and 9@@ 0,000 people to manage .
studying pol@@ len grains and radi@@ ol@@ aria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hex@@ agons and pent@@ agons .
it 's a challenge to our ing@@ en@@ uity .
far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language .
every single one of its plans fell through .
" I give up , " it cried , " I quit . "
J@@ M : everyone always wants to know how we became sisters .
using science and my in@@ tuition .
everything I know about detec@@ tive work , I learned on TV .
J@@ M : episode two .
( la@@ ughter ) F@@ B : after the piz@@ zer@@ ia reading , we have a sl@@ ice .
J@@ M : when a sister loves a sister .
when she says , " It 's time for bi@@ b@@ im@@ ba@@ p , " she means , " I need to talk , I 'm having a mel@@ t@@ down . "
you find it difficult to say good@@ b@@ ye .
J@@ M : you are so@@ b@@ bing , saying your boy@@ friend , the co@@ p , got shot and straight away , her voice contains the depth and calm of a wind@@ less lake .
F@@ B : what is wrong with you ? J@@ M : what 's wrong with you ?
( whi@@ st@@ ling ) ( W@@ hi@@ st@@ ling ends ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you very much .
my d@@ ad was always whi@@ st@@ ling around the house , and I just thought that 's part of communication in my family .
I whi@@ st@@ led alone , I whi@@ st@@ led in the classroom , I whi@@ st@@ led on bike , I whi@@ st@@ led everywhere .
( la@@ ughter ) So , OK , I 'm going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
and in 2008 , I entered again in Japan , Tokyo , and I won again .
( Ge@@ ert Ch@@ atro@@ u and audience whi@@ st@@ ling ) ( W@@ hi@@ st@@ ling ends ) This is very promising .
compassion is also curious .
and I don 't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him , but he 's para@@ ple@@ gic .
he 's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan .
and Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I 'm just going to offer you and let it sit .
this is Jean Van@@ ier .
but again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of ten@@ derness .
he 's says that what they do with L '@@ Arch@@ e is not a solution , but a sign .
and that the highest human calling is to look for this light , to point at it when we see it , to gather it up , and in so doing , to repair the world .
he liked to talk about the spiritual gen@@ i@@ uses of the ages .
we put these two photographs side @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ side on our website , and someone said , " When I look at the first photo , I ask myself , what was he thinking ?
so are we all .
and Karen Arm@@ strong , I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that , with a z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag , have led to the Charter for Comp@@ assion .
compassion can 't be reduced to sa@@ in@@ thood any more than it can be reduced to pity .
well , it 's got to do with your brain .
and the answer : before their first birth@@ days .
so the question is : what 's happening during this critical two @@@ -@@ @ month period ?
and those distributions grow .
English has a lot of Rs and Ls .
so babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their bra@@ ins ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture @@@ -@@ @ bound listen@@ ers that we are .
but we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .
it 's raising lots of questions about bilingual people .
two months later , something incredible happens .
but the Tai@@ wan@@ ese babies are getting better , not the American babies .
what did we do to their bra@@ ins ?
we 're the first in the world to record babies in an ME@@ G machine while they are learning .
we are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child 's brain development .
I 'd never been one of the boys my age ; terrible at sports , possibly the un@@ man@@ li@@ est little boy ever .
( la@@ ughter ) Well , almost .
that day , I discovered the power of fashion , and I 've been in love with it ever since .
and then they created a business plan competition .
and I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link .
for two years , he hardly made any money , a tiny sti@@ pen@@ d , but he apprentic@@ ed with this incredible housing developer named Tas@@ ne@@ em S@@ addi@@ qu@@ i .
we need leaders .
Robert Kennedy once said that " few of us have the great@@ ness to bend history itself , but each of us can work to change a small portion of events . "
so may each of you live lives of immer@@ sion .
it 's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff , with the things in our lives .
climate change : we 're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet .
it was a very nice experience , and the cars were clean and reliable , and it all worked .
what percentage of the time ?
people are making anywhere between 200 and 700 dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they 're not using it .
and so there 's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.
and this is a very m@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ y thing .
from my perspective , one of the things pop @@@ -@@ @ up stores do is create per@@ is@@ ha@@ bility and urgency .
but it 's very much at the beginning .
P@@ at M@@ itch@@ ell : what is the story of this pin ?
Ma : most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen .
and then I thought , well this is fun .
for instance , when I started , there were wars in the Balkans .
if you think that , you 've forgotten high school .
and so I think the capability of women to put themselves -- I think we 're better about putting ourselves into the other guy 's shoes and having more em@@ pa@@ thy .
because one of the things I think you 'll understand .
we talk things over with our friends , we sc@@ our the Internet , we search through books .
and they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice , however right or wrong .
first , we 've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispen@@ se with this notion of them as modern @@@ -@@ @ day apostles .
what has your investigation focused on ?
I 'll get some as@@ sh@@ ole at a water@@ ing hole asking what brand the ice is .
you might w@@ anna avert your gaz@@ e , because that is a new@@ t about to regener@@ ate its lim@@ b , and sha@@ king hands spreads more ger@@ ms than kis@@ sing .
wait for the man with the mo@@ ck@@ ing@@ bird . "
our face is h@@ ug@@ ely important because it 's the external , visual part that everybody else sees .
but also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight , we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be able to hold it erec@@ t , we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be able to look at the world around us .
it 's the face where we 're attracted to with that .
I 'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower ja@@ w forward .
that 's exactly what people used to say to S@@ ue .
after the facial surgery , she said , " My face now reflects my personality .
and what we found was -- we jum@@ bled up the photographs so they cou@@ ld@@ n 't recognize the before and after -- what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery .
well that 's not surprising , but we also asked them to judge them on honesty , intelligence , friend@@ liness , violence .
when people get older , they don 't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery .
he looks pretty good at this stage .
I don 't say he over@@ came this ; he did@@ n 't overcome it .
this was something more than that . he ignored it .
it was my longest operation .
when they have facial surgery , they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people .
sue was@@ n 't trying to achieve difference in her life .
she was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality .
but then we have other people who don 't choose to have facial surgery .
I 'll move it off , and we 'll have a blank slide for those who are squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish amongst you .
we think we can judge people on their expressions .
we 'd be pretty uncomfortable .
but are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement ?
this is an image of An@@ n who 's had her right ja@@ w removed and the base of her sk@@ ull removed .
" I want to look like this . this is how I looked before . "
just imagine , I can make a bi@@ ologically @@@ -@@ @ degra@@ dable template .
this is a bit like a Jul@@ ia Child recipe .
we 're still not re@@ constructing them well enough .
it was during the 2003 Nas@@ hi@@ k K@@ umb@@ h M@@ ela , one of the world 's largest religious gatherings .
the possible errors , like over@@ counting or double @@@ -@@ @ stepping , were overcome using design interventions .
when the sensors were colored , people would get sca@@ red and would ask us questions like , " Will I get electro@@ cu@@ ted if I step on this ? "
now , another added benefit of using black rubber was that dust naturally accum@@ ulates over the surface , eventually cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aging it with the ground .
" Ch@@ uck , no one wants to hear your stupid , ill @@@ -@@ @ informed political views !
( la@@ ughter ) The result ?
( la@@ ughter ) " Oh my god , I just love the way you just destroyed the planet .
I 'm talking about the robot gir@@ l@@ friend , the dream of one lon@@ ely ge@@ ek in a w@@ indow@@ less basement who v@@ owed one day : " I am going to marry my creation . "
impressive , very impressive . "
technology is@@ n 't sc@@ ary .
or will we allow it to reveal our deepest , dar@@ k@@ est dem@@ ons ?
the true question is not whether or not technology is sc@@ ary .
cy@@ stic fi@@ bro@@ sis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease , and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease .
it 's the one theory that the bi@@ ologists ever really got right .
and it matters how much of the protein it is .
I kept getting this call from this onc@@ ologist named David A@@ gu@@ s .
we 're treating cancer almost like it 's an infectious disease .
we 're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill .
I think this is the big mistake .
and it sounds sil@@ ly , but that 's basically what we do .
and I 'm not saying you shou@@ ld@@ n 't mo@@ p up your water if you have cancer , but I 'm saying that 's not really the problem ; that 's the symp@@ tom of the problem .
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it 's fixing them . it 's dra@@ ining them out and so on .
but I think eventually , we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer .
this was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , was@@ n 't the most popular thing in the classical music world .
sorry , it is impossible . "
until that , I thought I had a difficult life .
but here , I saw what women in other parts of Pakistan were experiencing .
these regimes created something within us during this period .
now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dre@@ aming for has eventually arrived .
people who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices , they tried to kill .
and they said , " These kids are mis@@ led . "
" bring these kids home because they are mis@@ led . "
but most of our camera people and our journalists , they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily -- to report what happened in Tah@@ ri@@ r Square .
let us not repeat the mistake of Iran , of [ the ] Mos@@ ad@@ de@@ q revolution .
thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
these were criminals , thu@@ gs , dangerous , destroying their own environment .
that 's where I realized the power of paper and glue .
a year later , I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict .
are they so different ?
we said , " Ok@@ ay , let 's try and push as far as we can . "
" Oh , we 're actually doing an art project and we are p@@ asting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job .
and I would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , " So can you tell me who is who ? "
I heard it was one of the most violent fa@@ vel@@ as , because the largest drug car@@ tel controls it .
so I decided to go there .
and she said , " You know what ?
there was the mother , the grand@@ mother , the best friend -- they all wanted to sh@@ out the story .
I took more photos , and we started the project .
so that 's a really symbolic p@@ asting , because that 's the first one we did that you cou@@ ld@@ n 't see from the city .
some people question , " Why is it in black and white ?
" Oh , that guy just moved . "
so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves .
and the photos kept traveling even without us .
because that 's a big part of it . there 's layers behind each photo .
I think , today , as important as the result is the way you do things .
but yesterday the city called them and said , " Lo@@ ok , you 're going to have to tear it down .
the people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .
so for example , I pa@@ sted the photo of the min@@ aret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law for@@ bidding min@@ are@@ ts in the country .
art is not supposed to change the world , to change practical things , but to change perceptions .
art can change the way we see the world .
I pre@@ sume that you belong to the second category , and that 's good , because for that project , I 'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them .
so a subject you 're passionate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .
take the photos , the portra@@ its , upload it -- I 'll give you all the details -- and I 'll send you back your poster . join by groups and reveal things to the world .
so I hope that , together , we 'll create something that the world will remember .
it was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing .
we only ranked high when it comes to poverty , corruption , lack of freedom of speech , lack of political activis@@ m .
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years , and here comes the Internet , technology , Black@@ Ber@@ ry , SMS .
there are a lot of people who are frustrated . "
there are lots of people who are frustrated .
they probably have the best life in the world .
they are living in happiness . they are living in their villas .
they are happy . they don 't have problems .
Khal@@ ed Sae@@ ed was killed in June 2010 .
but then what was the answer of the regime ?
his photo was remembered by all of us .
people were making fun of the idea .
and they were doing this thing .
but did the regime learn anything ? not really .
in fact , the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas , help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing .
and I did not really hear anything . I did not know anything .
I was not allowed to speak with anyone .
and I went out .
it 's actually strength -- it 's power .
we 're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts .
and some of that , in fact , is due to the fact that we 've had an economic recession .
the paper said , " It 's not really balanced .
or even if you 're flat , you might shift money into it .
but with the type of cuts we 're talking about , it will be far , far harder to get these incentives for excellence , or to move over to use technology in the new way .
so what 's going on ?
and the numbers are used to make decisions .
so what do we need to do ?
we can get some things out on the Internet .
I 'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture .
it should be more like private accounting .
in fact , there are some like these : Er@@ sk@@ ine B@@ ow@@ les , Al@@ an S@@ imp@@ son and others , who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health @@@ -@@ @ spending state @@@ -@@ @ level problem .
but in fact , their work was sort of pushed off .
but if I were to point to three challenges , the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time .
so we can actually use biom@@ ater@@ ials now .
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
we then grow the cells outside the body , take the sca@@ ff@@ old , coat the sca@@ ff@@ old with the cells -- the patient 's own cells , two different cell types .
a few weeks later , you have your engineered organ that we 're able to impl@@ ant back into the patient .
this particular printer we 're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient .
and Dr. K@@ ang 's going to walk on@@ stage right now , and we 're actually going to show you one of these kid@@ neys that we printed a little bit earlier today .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) J@@ E : and tell us a little bit about what you 're doing .
so my femin@@ ism is very indebted to my mom 's , but it looks very different .
femin@@ ist blog@@ ging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising .
F@@ emin@@ isting has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Wal@@ mart .
I realized femin@@ ism was@@ n 't about man @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ating and Bir@@ ken@@ stocks . "
we don 't want one icon .
these are three words many of us were raised with .
the mainstream media often paints my generation as ap@@ a@@ thetic , and I think it 's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhel@@ med .
it 's enough to make you feel very overwhel@@ med .
which brings me to my third parad@@ ox .
you may have gu@@ essed by now , I did not light myself on fire .
and it 's about loving people really well .
they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cous@@ in to their cous@@ in .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) But I was excited , so I kept going .
then you build on that in the next concept .
stay on that bicycle . fall off that bicycle .
but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map .
and Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg said , " A squ@@ ir@@ rel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa . "
so when I was growing up in a really rural area in Main@@ e , the Internet meant something very different to me .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
and here 's my friend Daniel 's screen shot .
Scot@@ t 's results were full of them .
that 's how different these results are becoming .
so it 's not just Google and Facebook either .
and what 's in your filter bubble depends on who you are , and it depends on what you do .
but that 's not actually what 's happening right now .
and we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system .
so we 're looking here at one of the first things we started to do .
and with that , let me take you now for a first tour into the data .
so you 've all , I 'm sure , seen time @@@ -@@ @ lap@@ se videos where a flower will bl@@ os@@ som as you accelerate time .
my son , soon after his first birthday , would say " g@@ aga " to mean water .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
the way to interpret this apparently simple graph is , on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregi@@ ver ut@@ ter@@ ances are based on the length of ut@@ ter@@ ances .

so we 're using these structures to start predic@@ ting the order of language acquisition , and that 's ongoing work now .
and we 're now , with satellite dishes , pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States .
and of course , through all of these lines are flowing un@@ structured language .
and I really want you to focus on something as I take you through .
and so you hear me encouraging him , realizing what 's happening , and then the magic happens .
the problem is that all over the West now it looks like this .
they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand .
well , it 's a national problem , but I 'm going to tell you another story from Mon@@ tana ...
it 's a broken system .
the bre@@ w@@ ers pay to restore water to the stream .
but the parad@@ ox is , when a lot of these people slip into the policy @@@ -@@ @ making mode , that social awareness van@@ ishes and they start talking like accountants .
we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't do anything stupid .
and the fact is , people learn from people they love .
and I came to the conclusion , this is a symp@@ tom of a larger problem .
and this leads to od@@ di@@ ties .
one of my favorite brain stories described these middle @@@ -@@ @ aged guys .
and the third insight is that we 're not primarily self @@@ -@@ @ contained individuals .
we are now children of the French En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
and so this is one skill of how to ho@@ over up knowledge , one from another .
it seems so elementary .
and he took Sch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child 's idea to the Pr@@ us@@ sian Academy of Sciences the next week .
it CA@@ N@@ NOT hide behind the black hole .
and then they 're going to merge .
it 's a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it 's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up .
in this Hu@@ b@@ ble image , we see two gal@@ ax@@ ies .
we don 't ever want to do that actually . we want to be inside the universe because there 's no such thing as standing outside the universe .
and if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observ@@ able universe .
I need you to go up@@ stairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . "
sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in un@@ conventional thinking that can move the needle , but you need to be bold enough to try .
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you .
in today 's modern medicine , there is a real understanding of light in an almost bio@@ chemical way .
what will be happening in the next five minutes ?
we 've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by W@@ ade Dav@@ is about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings ; there are also other animal beings .
she does very complex tasks , and I haven 't got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she do@@ es@@ n 't like making mistakes .
the importance of learning in that time , when behavior is flexible -- and there 's an aw@@ ful lot to learn in ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee society .
they have very sophisticated cooperation .
we find that they show emotions , similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sad@@ ness , fear , despair .
and people will pay more for bush @@@ -@@ @ meat , as it 's called , than for domestic meat -- it 's culturally preferred .
their culture is being destroyed , along with the animals upon whom they depend .
and Ro@@ ots and Sho@@ ots is a program for hope .
see the brick walls as all the problems that we 've inflicted on this planet .
we 're in every state now , and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York .
we want to go and work in a dog shelter .
the tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding .
and we 've talked a lot about that .
she said , " If you 're talking about hope and peace , ring this .
thank you very much .
there is hurt , here , that CA@@ N@@ NOT be fixed by B@@ and @@@ -@@ @ A@@ ids or poetry .
and no matter how many land mines erup@@ t in a minute , be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life .
your voice is small , but don 't ever stop singing .
ok@@ ay .
but there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding .
I love spoken word . I will keep coming back week after week . "
I use poetry to help me work through what I don 't understand , but I show up to each new po@@ em with a back@@ pack full of everywhere else that I 've been .
and actually , P@@ hi@@ l Kay@@ e and I co@@ incidentally also share the same last name .
at a certain point , you would realize that someone has the exact same thing , or one thing very similar , to something on your list .
I asked her what that meant , and she said , " M@@ iss , it 's kind of a long story . "
I 'm so lucky that there 's this archive of performances that I can share with my students .
I think that we all did .
my self @@@ -@@ @ confidence can be measured out in te@@ as@@ po@@ ons mixed into my poetry , and it still always tastes funny in my mouth .
but in Hiroshima , some people were wi@@ ped clean away , leaving only a wri@@ st@@ watch or a diary page .
my parents named me Sarah , which is a bi@@ blical name .
after the A @@@ -@@ @ bomb , specialists said it would take 75 years for the radiation @@@ -@@ @ damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again .
so if you tell me I can do the impossible -- I 'll probably laugh at you .
how do we find fulfillment in a world that 's literally changing as fast as we can think , or maybe even faster ?
it taught me that instead of acting like I know what I 'm doing or I have all the answers , it 's perfectly OK to say , " I don 't know .
I want to learn more , and I need your help . "
let me ! let me push the button ! "
and yet , in the world , there are so many people who still heat the water on fire , and they cook their food on fire .
and they want the washing machine .
and then I ask my students -- over the last two years , I 've asked -- " How many of you don 't use a car ? "
because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
they must change their behavior in some way .
we know them as the " make love , not war " ap@@ es since they have frequent , promis@@ cu@@ ous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
play is the glue that bin@@ ds us together .
have a look what she 's doing .
and I want you to see , this is Fu@@ ku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fellowship and wonder .
and if you think of dogs for example , dogs are now intentionally @@@ -@@ @ designed creatures .
this is a Be@@ ef@@ alo .
and they are now making them , and some@@ day , perhaps pretty soon , you will have Be@@ ef@@ alo pat@@ ties in your local supermarket .
the gu@@ ar is an endangered Southeast Asian ung@@ ulate .
and what they 've done here is they 've put electro@@ des in its gang@@ lia and its brain and then a transmit@@ ter on top , and it 's on a big computer tracking ball .
it gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
they have it running through ma@@ zes , controlling where it 's going .
we 've taken away the autonomy of this animal . "
I 'll get back to that in a minute .
and it 's not just technology that we 're putting into animals .
and then the final step of this , once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings , what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then ?
( appl@@ ause ) E@@ B : as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
( singing ) Sum@@ mer@@ time and the li@@ vin ' is easy .
there 's a piece by a composer , an American composer called John C@@ age .

ok@@ ay .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real @@@ -@@ @ time control systems .
so they know everything .
and if you manipulate the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to crack the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the centrifu@@ ge explo@@ de .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
the small war@@ head is taking one casc@@ ade , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and slowing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six casc@@ ades and manip@@ ulating valves .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the centrifu@@ ges .
that 's cool , hu@@ h ?
and this is very important , what I 'm going to say .
you could also use conventional wor@@ m technology for spreading .
R@@ al@@ ph , it 's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mos@@ sad is the main entity behind this .
Ba@@ si@@ l Jones : but actually we 're going to start this evolution with a hy@@ ena .
ok@@ ay , we 'll do something with it .
AK : well actually I prefer to say that it 's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life .
B@@ J : and it has these bulk@@ heads made out of pl@@ y@@ wood , covered with fabric -- curi@@ ously similar , in fact , to the pl@@ y@@ wood can@@ oes that Adri@@ an 's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop .
the bulk@@ heads have now turned into ho@@ ops of can@@ e , but it 's ultimately the same structure .
and just around that time , his mother had said , " Have you seen this book by Michael Mor@@ pur@@ go called ' War Hor@@ se ' ? "
AK : it 's about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
B@@ J : about 40 people .
Jo@@ ey .
B@@ J : Jo@@ ey .
he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
horses ' hearing is very important .
you see the string tend@@ on from the hy@@ ena , the hy@@ ena 's front leg , automatically pul@@ ls the ho@@ op up .
( la@@ ughter ) Hor@@ ses are so unpredictable .
and together , there 's quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
AK : you want to say something about the breathing ?
but now we would like you to put Jo@@ ey through some pac@@ es .
and on my way back to town , I began to cry .
my dream of completing the Iron@@ man World Championship was crushed .
I felt like I 'd mess@@ ed up .
among my generation , I am one of the very few individuals in the US who are living with paralysis by polio today .
many people who contract polio in developing countries do not have access to the same medical care , education , or opportunities like I have had in America .
and when I rolled into town , I heard on the lou@@ d@@ speaker , " Min@@ da D@@ ent@@ ler is one of the last competitors to make the bike cu@@ to@@ ff . "
for the first time in the 35 @@@ -@@ @ year history , a female wheelchair athlete completed the Iron@@ man World Championship .
in each image , I married dispar@@ ate costum@@ es from widely diverse traditions , countries and time frames .
in their varied movies -- from romantic movies , horror films , gang@@ ster movies to action movies -- one sees Nig@@ er@@ ians portra@@ yed with many layers of complexities .
N@@ ol@@ lywood is Africa 's mirror par excellence .
every aspect of her being commands attention .
quite an accomplishment .
it is modern , post @@@ -@@ @ modern , meta @@@ -@@ @ modern , bold sex@@ y , sh@@ re@@ w@@ d and with a contag@@ ious attitude worth catching .
( appl@@ ause ) Part of my job is to keep beauti@@ fying Africa for the world , one portrait at a time .
so we decided at Stan@@ ford to build a different self @@@ -@@ @ driving car .
it 's the perfect driving mechanism .
what ?
and I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nev@@ ada .
and the cho@@ ir conductor there knew that I san@@ g and invited me to come and join the cho@@ ir .
the most transformative experience I 've ever had -- in that single moment , hearing dis@@ son@@ ance and harmony and people singing , people together , the shared vision .
and I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself .
well a couple of years ago , a friend of mine em@@ ail@@ ed me a link , a YouTube link , and said , " You have got to see this . "
and I even loved seeing behind her ; I could see the little te@@ d@@ dy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room .
such an intimate video .
so I wrote on my blog , " O@@ MG O@@ MG . "
now I should say , before that , what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting .
afterwards , I played a piano track under@@ ne@@ ath so that the sing@@ ers would have something to listen to .
( singing ) This is Cher@@ yl An@@ g from Singapore .
( singing ) This is Jam@@ al Wal@@ ker from D@@ all@@ as , Texas .
( singing ) There was even a little s@@ op@@ ran@@ o solo in the piece , and so I had audi@@ tions .
here 's our winner of the s@@ op@@ ran@@ o solo .
and Scot@@ t aggregated all of the videos .
he made sure that everything lined up .
and then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago .
( video ) S@@ op@@ ran@@ o : ♫ Upon my pil@@ low ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ E@@ W : that 's Georgi@@ e from England . she 's only nine .
and my personal favorite , " When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this , he told me that I did not have the voice for it . "
what I 'd like to close with then today is the first look at " Sle@@ ep " by Virtual Cho@@ ir 2.0 .
it turns out that regular Play @@@ -@@ @ Do@@ h that you buy at the store conducts electricity , and high school physics teachers have used that for years .
well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative , tiny , little hands can build on their own .
if I want a sp@@ inning tail , let 's grab a motor , put some play @@@ -@@ @ d@@ ough on it , stick it on and we have sp@@ inning .
( appl@@ ause ) And once you have the basics , we can make a slightly more complicated circuit .
you could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this .
so this is all in your home kitchen .
have fun . thank you .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early .
they give 20 minutes -- that 's a time warning .
you go through some additional checks , and then they open the door .
so nice air comes flowing in .
you fall outside the door , you 're caught in the slip@@ stream .
I have no idea whether it makes any difference , but he seemed to make sense , and I was@@ n 't going to test the hypothesis that he 'd be wrong .
and then you wait for the opening shock for your par@@ ach@@ ute to open .
you are going to hit the ground .
you can 't delay that much .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'd look around , and then I 'd see another parat@@ ro@@ op@@ er , a young guy or girl , and they 'd have pulled out their M@@ 4 car@@ b@@ ine and they 'd be picking up their equipment .
but things had changed ; I was a 46 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old brig@@ ad@@ ier general .
this was my father in Vietnam .
and I 'm not sure that was real interaction .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
and that 's a new kind of leadership for me .
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
and one young R@@ anger in the back -- his hair 's t@@ ous@@ led and his face is red and wind@@ blown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind -- he said , " Sir , I was in the sixth grade . "
and I said , " John , where 's your son ? and how is he ? "
( la@@ ughter ) And it is@@ n 't always fair .
compassion is something that creates happiness .
compassion is fun .
I know there are other comp@@ assi@@ onate companies in the world , but Google is the place I 'm familiar with because I 've been there for 10 years , so I 'll use Google as the case study .
they just go ahead and start a fun@@ dra@@ iser .
so what are they ?
the first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders .
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?
these are leaders who , in addition to being highly capable , possess two important qualities , and they are hum@@ ility and ambition .
and he considers himself one of the inmates .
I want you to be happy . "
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in rob@@ es , not the other guy -- the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama , who said , " If you want others to be happy , practice compassion .
it 's a lot .
that 's just a working title , by the way .
so the movie will be called " The Great@@ est Mo@@ vie E@@ ver S@@ old . "
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
while anytime I do an interview with someone , I can say , " Are you fresh enough for this interview ?
whether it 's a " Flor@@ al Fu@@ sion " or a " Paradise Win@@ ds , " they 'll have their chance .
we will have them geared for both male or female -- solid , roll @@@ -@@ @ on or stick , whatever it may be .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we 're very much a challeng@@ er brand .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
( video ) Ab@@ ig@@ ail : you brought your pictures , right ?
MS : these are the people who shape the way I look at the world .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
are you established , traditional , nurturing , protective , em@@ pa@@ thetic like the Op@@ rah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sacred , contempl@@ ative or wise like the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama or Y@@ oda ?
I 'm going to deal directly with the artist .
well , since the film pre@@ m@@ ie@@ red at the S@@ und@@ ance Film Festival , let 's take a look .
today , more than ever , a little honesty is going to go a long way .
these devices are@@ n 't accessible to people . "
has everyone seen the movie " The Di@@ ving Bell and the Bu@@ tter@@ fly ? "
so they go around and do art installations like this .
( appl@@ ause ) Which was awesome .
because they were all about being free , the wind in your hair -- just to be free .
but more importantly , let me tell you -- I 'm going to come up really close here . Don 't f@@ rea@@ k out , P@@ at .
my ability and my potential .
and I went on a run that I know so well .
and really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
and I never needed eyes to see -- never .
yes , it is a sc@@ ram@@ bled egg .
recent studies by satellites such as the W@@ MAP satellite have shown that , in fact , there are just tiny differences in that background .
and in a chem@@ ically more complex universe , it 's possible to make more things .
so , it copies itself and scat@@ ters the templates through the ocean .
and what that means is that DNA is , in effect , learning .
DNA accum@@ ulates information through random errors , some of which just happen to work .
I call this ability collective learning .
a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go .
this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders -- because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .
but most importantly , it 's voluntary .
why do some large @@@ -@@ @ scale crises j@@ ol@@ t us awa@@ ke and inspire us to change and evolve while others might j@@ ol@@ t us a bit , but then it 's back to sleep ?
whether we grow up fast and find those strengths or whether we get knoc@@ ked back .
and within each compartment , there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs , each competing with one another for credit , name recognition and of course , resources .
so for instance , the people fighting poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change .
there were indigenous elders with hi@@ p@@ sters working on transit .
we wrote a manif@@ es@@ to , and we called it " The Le@@ ap . "
the slaughter of millions in the tren@@ ches and in the death camps have caused people to ask , " Where is God in all this ?
the loving soul of the universe .
in change and development and growth .
is God just another name for the universe , with no independent existence at all ?
in music and poetry , in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life , there is a deep , ind@@ welling presence that makes them extraordinary .
later , while checking my school bag , my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged .
these are real !
it was very James B@@ ond .
I managed to convince him that it was important for us , but possibly also for other people that he shared his story .
so , his story . my father was born in Argentina .
his parents were of Russian descent .
all the movements stopped at falsi@@ fying .
if he had accepted payment , he w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be able to say " yes " or " no " depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause .
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
after the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to im@@ migrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel .
and then , as he was a sta@@ un@@ ch anti @@@ -@@ @ colon@@ i@@ alist , he made false papers for Alg@@ er@@ ians during the Algerian war .
I used to be able to talk like that .
this was faster , and nobody had to try to read my hand@@ writing .
( la@@ ughter ) Rog@@ er E@@ bert : as you can hear , it sounds like me , but the words jump up and down .
I was in line at Radio Sh@@ ack to buy one of the first Model 100 's .
now we live in the age of the Internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
that 's why writing on the Internet has become a lifes@@ a@@ ver for me .
a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer .
if a computer voice can successfully tell a jo@@ ke and do the timing and delivery as well as H@@ enn@@ y Youn@@ g@@ man , then that 's the voice I want .
I was born in Poland , now in the U.S.
so I finished my 20@@ s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy , and I discovered I was useless .
I had no practical skills .
then contributors from all over the world began showing up , proto@@ typing new machines during dedicated project visits .
we know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity .
I 've pressed 5,000 bric@@ ks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days .
and this is even more challenging in that we need these observations at a gig@@ antic scale in both space and time .
( la@@ ughter ) This is a rad@@ ar@@ gram , which is a vertical profile through the ice sheet , kind of like a sl@@ ice of cake .
this is the result of heroic efforts over decades by teams from a variety of countries and international collabor@@ ations .
so that produced two million high @@@ -@@ @ resolution images that my group is now working on analyzing and processing for comparing with contemporary conditions in the ice sheet .
there 's some progress here , too .
the trans@@ plant community has actively campaig@@ ned in organ donation .

and pretty soon , they began shipping that coal , ton by ton , rail@@ car by rail@@ car , boat@@ load by boat@@ load , back to China and elsewhere around the world .
and they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
and lots of people are dying .
and it 's a very , very difficult situation .
and you 've got to feel that .
people back in the United States know it 's about oil .
and they have big cities , and the cities are all dependent on oil .
so these guys , you see them .
what are you feeling and thinking about this photo , about this woman ?
you see , that 's em@@ pa@@ thy .
step inside of the tiny , little world of somebody else .
and suddenly , without realizing it , you 're seeing the world differently .
I 'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq .
and the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
we go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .

that 's my brother Mal@@ col@@ m there on the right .
and the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Mad@@ eline .
and so I 'm here standing on the shoulders of many people .
I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
and in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
it 's a sincere ap@@ ology , and they take it very seriously .
and she was next door to a very wealthy , oil @@@ -@@ @ rich neighbor .
( la@@ ughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , " I know what I 'm doing . "

if you 're a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them , I put in a letter .

an extraordinary set of teles@@ cop@@ es .

I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument .

in professional circles everywhere , it 's of course universally accepted .
( la@@ ughter ) Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of cre@@ ation@@ ism , called " Intell@@ igent Design , " or ID .

what would you get done that you 're waiting to get done because you think you 'll be here forever ?
how would you like to be better than you are ?

which one would you like the most ?
how about fitness ?
Ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
the human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .

( la@@ ughter ) Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest @@@ -@@ @ lived .
and by the way , we im@@ migrate and circulate and inter@@ mix so much that you can 't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
it won 't be very long before the reality will be the 1,000 @@@ -@@ @ dollar human gen@@ ome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .

these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it .
and it 'll depend on where we live , whether we live alone or have a family , how much cool stuff we have , how much we 're willing to accept the risk of theft .
this is for children .
so you can imagine how that works .
you don 't hear about lion attacks , there are@@ n 't a lot of lions around .
so one half , one quarter , one fifth -- we 're good at that .
and what these cognitive bi@@ ases do is they act as filters between us and reality .
one , you can make people actually secure and hope they notice .
I have feeling and reality .
you don 't need a model .
it 's , of course , limited by science , by technology .
models can come from industry .
so an example might be , if you go back 100 years ago , when electricity was first becoming common , there were a lot of fears about it .
we change light bul@@ bs without even thinking about it .
I 'm going to give one more compl@@ ication .
and definitely this was not impossible , at least for New@@ ton .
but still , experiencing the new means exploring a very peculiar space , the space of what could be , the space of the possible , the space of possibilities .
so in this case , for instance , novel@@ ty could be climbing Mach@@ u Pic@@ ch@@ u for the first time , as I did in 2016 .
we are very , very bad at gra@@ sp@@ ing this space .
so it 's not so easy to con@@ ceive this space because we are trying to con@@ ceive the occurrence of something brand new , so something that never occurred before , so we don 't have clu@@ es .
so now we know that predictions had to be based on modeling , which means creating a synthetic model of the system , simul@@ ating this model and then projec@@ ting the system into the future through this model .
that winter was special also for me and my colleagues , because we had an insight about the possible mathematical scheme -- again , possible , possible mathematical scheme , to con@@ ceive the occurrence of the new .
and what happens ?
it 's not something we can pre@@ define .
and somehow , we predict that the rate of innovation should decrease steadily over time .
so somehow for some reason , the very notion of adjacent possible is already en@@ coding the common belief that one thing leads to another in many different systems .
but the reason why we were thr@@ illed is because actually we could give , for the first time , a scientific substance to this in@@ tuition and start making predictions about the way in which we experience the new .
( la@@ ughter ) So we could see very clearly all of these patterns in the huge amounts of data we collected and analyzed .
so as you can imagine , I was really fasc@@ inated by all this .
every time the di@@ at@@ oms replicate , they give the genetic information that says , " Here 's how to build glass in the ocean that 's perfectly nano@@ structured . "
I brought an example of that with me today .
and if you haven 't experienced this , then I 'm going to ask you to try and imagine your way into it right now .
Mike Mat@@ as : and so throughout the whole book , Al G@@ ore will walk you through and explain the photos .
what is the business here ?
the early ' 7@@ 0s , I was in college .
America was j@@ ol@@ ted by the anti @@@ -@@ @ Vietnam movement , the Civil Rights movement .
but you know , when there is a political ch@@ ur@@ ning of society , it unle@@ ashes a lot of energy .
the National Movement of India was testimony to that .
lots of people resigned from well @@@ -@@ @ paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement .
so he designed and went and started a village science program .
this was kind of the defining slogan .
well I took one year .
so I took one year off , and I went to this village science program .
and it was a turning point .
so I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the road@@ side .
with four , you make a square , you make a pent@@ agon , you make a hex@@ agon , you make all these kind of poly@@ g@@ ons .
if you look at the hex@@ agon , for instance , it 's like an am@@ o@@ e@@ ba , which is constantly changing its own profile .
but this is very sha@@ ky .
push it and it becomes house shaped .
and if I were to po@@ ke all the three legs of this in the three ver@@ tices of this triangle , I would make a te@@ tra@@ he@@ dr@@ on .
and once you make these , you make a little house .
( appl@@ ause ) If you , as a matter of fact , put four mar@@ bles inside , you simulate the molecular structure of methane , CH4 .
this is one @@@ -@@ @ way traffic .
right .
but this is great fun for children .
and this is a hundred @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old to@@ y .
there 's some gro@@ o@@ ves over here , you can see .
this is a straw .
there 's a hole here , and I shut this .
when teachers make it , children make it .
over 100,000 children learn science this way .
there are six layers -- three layers of plastic , aluminum -- which are are sealed together .
( Hon@@ k ) It 's children 's delight , a teacher 's en@@ vy , as they say .
you 're not able to see how the sound is produced , because the thing which is vibr@@ ating goes inside my mouth .
the other is that you keep blowing at it , keep making the sound , and you keep cutting it .
and this is wool over here .
well in the end , what we can also do : we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps .
it goes very slowly .
at the time , we knew that it was political .
I knew I would find her some@@ day , or we would find each other .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
so , A@@ ic@@ ha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?
( la@@ ughter ) ( Transl@@ ator ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other .
and I responded to them with my fear .
I gra@@ bbed up five people who I trusted , and the six of us became the organizing squad .
it 's going to stay safe around here . " and they kept their promise .
( appl@@ ause ) Right ? and we expect the same thing .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
and I 'll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
you see the timeline on the top .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track tra@@ sh as it moves through the system .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tra@@ sh and then started following it .
if those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
he liked it very much .
and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
the whole building is made of water .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution .
imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pix@@ el .
this has been digi@@ tizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the Internet .
you can enter inside it .
so as a fashion designer , I 've always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
we sti@@ r this in until it 's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .
after about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
so this is telling us that the fer@@ mentation is in full swing .
and this is a static culture .
at this point , it 's really heavy .
again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
using fruit and vegetable sta@@ ining , create organic patter@@ ning .
what I can 't yet do is make it water @@@ -@@ @ resistant .
finally , at the end of use , we could bio@@ de@@ grade it naturally along with your vegetable pe@@ el@@ ings .
you might say , " Well , maybe things just smooth@@ ed themselves out . "
the reason why ent@@ ro@@ py increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high ent@@ ro@@ py than to be low ent@@ ro@@ py .
in every little cubic centi@@ meter of space , whether or not there 's stuff , whether or not there 's particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there 's still energy , even in the space itself .
but that 's a prob@@ abil@@ istic statement .
so Bol@@ tz@@ mann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium .
images of lim@@ b regeneration and faces filled with small@@ po@@ x : 21 percent of the conference .
( la@@ ughter ) So you 're going to be able to go like this .
( la@@ ughter ) But Dar@@ win 's dangerous idea is coming back . it 's coming back .
now let 's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .
has to be visible in bright daylight . will work anywhere .
so we 're trying to check and trying to dou@@ se here , and see who uses m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana .
are we going to be able to find any m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana , J@@ im Young ?
now the wonderful thing is , Lar@@ ry Br@@ illi@@ ant was just appointed the head of the Google Foundation , and so he decided that he would support -- he would support Cam@@ eron 's work .
and the really wonderful thing about this is , when you 're done , well -- you can eat it .
and we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ .
no , I said what 's your favorite song ?
Tom Re@@ il@@ ly : exactly .
so I 've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace " global warming . "
so , I talked to Jos@@ h Prince @@@ -@@ @ Ram@@ us about the convention center and the conferences . it 's getting aw@@ fully big .
and I want you to get out a pen , and I want you to write a terrorist note .
( la@@ ughter ) Luc@@ k@@ ily , I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year .
OK .
( appl@@ ause ) Can we cue the music please ?
the water level of the lake has started drying up .
( la@@ ughter ) Mr. Vice President , I wish I knew how to quit you .
when I heard about the van@@ ishing be@@ es , Colon@@ y Col@@ lap@@ se Dis@@ order , it motivated me to take action .
because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward , as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life .
rarely seen by the naked eye , this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment .
I hope you 'll drink , t@@ we@@ et and plant some seeds to pol@@ lin@@ ate a friendly garden .
and always take time to smell the flowers , and let it fill you with beauty , and re@@ discover that sense of wonder .
here are some images from the film .
and in this community , we did@@ n 't have a television ; we did@@ n 't have computers , obviously , radio .
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
so I 'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross @@@ -@@ @ section of my work that I 've done on the polar regions .
now they 're saying the sea ice in the Arctic , the sum@@ mer@@ time extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years .
we 're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic .
losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
al@@ right , my favorite part .
it do@@ es@@ n 't work that way .
they are 12 f@@ t. long , a thousand pounds .
I 'm with my Swedish assistant and guide .
( la@@ ughter ) And I looked at Gor@@ an , and I said to him , " For@@ get that . "
he said , " If you get sca@@ red , you close your eyes , ya , and she 'll go away . "
( la@@ ughter ) So that 's all I had to work with at that point .
and so that did@@ n 't work .
this just did@@ n 't happen a couple of times .
and then so she realized I cou@@ ld@@ n 't catch live ones , so she brought me dead pen@@ gu@@ ins .
because she can 't believe I can 't eat this pen@@ gu@@ in .
and I thought , she 's about to b@@ ite .
she ch@@ ased that big seal away , went and got its pen@@ gu@@ in and brought it to me .
and so this starting material is back to the basic building block .
and if the angle is right , you can actually see a hol@@ o@@ gram appear in this film of sil@@ k .
but sil@@ k is versatile and it goes beyond op@@ tics .
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate .
a lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
you 've got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you 've got the Mo@@ MA , the Her@@ mitage , the R@@ ij@@ ks , the Van Go@@ gh .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you 're in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
I see this plus sign .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call G@@ ig@@ a@@ Pi@@ x@@ el technology .
and so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
I 'm sure there are people here who could tell you about the Richard Fe@@ yn@@ man they knew , and it would probably be a different Richard Fe@@ yn@@ man .
he was a man of many , many parts .
he was full of mach@@ o , a kind of mach@@ o one @@@ -@@ @ up@@ manship .
he loved to win , win these little mach@@ o games we would sometimes play .
and what did we talk about ?
but the amazing thing was -- Fe@@ yn@@ man had to leave a little early ; he was@@ n 't feeling too well , so he left a little bit early .
and D@@ ick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of simil@@ arity of personality .
he would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of at@@ oms looked like .
he would try to visu@@ alize it , guided by a small number of simple principles .
in 1968 , in my own university -- I was@@ n 't there at the time -- they were exploring the structure of the pro@@ ton .
and that 's the story I 'm going to tell you about today .
so how do we do this ?
the ne@@ ur@@ on uses its natural protein @@@ -@@ @ making machinery to fab@@ ric@@ ate these little light @@@ -@@ @ sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell , like putting solar panels on a roof .
and you can do that ; you can t@@ weak the viruses so they hit some cells and not others .
I want to tell you some short stories about how we 're using this both at the scientific clinical and pre@@ clinical levels .
and that 's what happens .
the animal goes to the right @@@ -@@ @ hand side and po@@ kes his nose there and gets a flash of blue light every time he does it .
these are the d@@ op@@ am@@ ine ne@@ ur@@ ons , in some of the pleasure centers in the brain .
the animal hears a tone . a flash of light occurs .
there 's no audio , but you see that the animal free@@ zes -- the tone used to mean bad news .
and the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
consider , for example , a condition like ep@@ il@@ ep@@ sy , where the brain is over@@ active .
another thing -- you 've got to get these genes into cells .
I wanted to close with one story , which we think could potentially be a clinical application .
let 's zoom in on it so we can see it in more detail .
in many forms of blind@@ ness , like re@@ tin@@ itis pig@@ ment@@ osa or mac@@ ular de@@ generation , the photo@@ recep@@ tor cells have atro@@ p@@ hi@@ ed or been destroyed .
on the other hand , light can still get into the eye .
he 's not using vision to do it .
ed Bo@@ y@@ den : that 's right .
J@@ e : well , that might change a couple things . thank you .
E@@ B : thank you .
the first building I built was 20 years ago .
sorry , this was my mother , by the way , in her be@@ ad shop in London .
this is a shop for a bag company .
and this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist mon@@ k .
and so you 're stuck on a bus .
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
so it 's got hybrid drive .
and this is a project for a bridge .
and then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just cou@@ ld@@ n 't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken .
and it 's a very b@@ oring bridge , as you can see .
so that 's it spe@@ eded up .
it has a child running through a field , or something like that .
it has a symbolic importance .
there 's 250 pavil@@ ions .
so we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
I 've never met anyone who says , " I don 't like flowers . "
and the film " Ju@@ ras@@ sic Park " actually really helped us .
so that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch .
( video ) Voice Over : the new Play @@@ -@@ @ Do@@ h M@@ op Top H@@ air Shop .
and inside , the daylight -- each one is an optic and it brings light into the center .
and so the rest of the site was a public space .
and then , you know when a pet has an operation and they s@@ have a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur -- in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral , in effect , we 've sha@@ ved it .
and if a cloud goes past , you can see a cloud on the tips where it 's letting the light through .
( la@@ ughter ) A key thing was how people would interact .
the British government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
this is the head of U.@@ K. Trade and Investment , who was our client , with the Chinese children , using the landscape .
and the mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that , if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city , they would give them more gross floor area , buil@@ dable .
there was one person in the contractors who was the right size -- and it was@@ n 't a child -- who could fit between them for the final water@@ proofing of the building .
I 'm a pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian and an an@@ esthe@@ si@@ ologist , so I put children to sleep for a living .
imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this fe@@ ather , but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain .
in fact , imagine something even worse .
that was the experience of my patient , Ch@@ and@@ ler , whom you see in the photograph .
and during the course of one of her dance re@@ hear@@ s@@ als , she fell on her out@@ stretched arm and spra@@ ined her wr@@ ist .
this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sp@@ rain .
it changes , and it mor@@ phs in response to stimul@@ i .
well , what do we do about that ?
we take ner@@ ves that are nois@@ y and active that should be quiet , and we put them to sleep with local an@@ esthe@@ tics .
I don 't design detention centers , and I don 't even design cour@@ thous@@ es .
it happened a lot , though , because my family had des@@ eg@@ reg@@ ated a white community in rural Virginia .
and so I would run into the forest , and I would build these little hu@@ ts .
what do we build instead of this ?
and then I heard about restorative justice .
early data shows that restorative justice builds em@@ pa@@ thy ; that it reduces violent re@@ off@@ ending by up to 75 percent ; that it eases PT@@ SD in survivors of the most severe violence .
I 'm going to build the world 's first restorative justice center all by myself .
thousands of people will come here instead of going to court .
they were bringing Native American peacemaking practices into a non @@@ -@@ @ Native community for the very first time in the United States .
it 's hom@@ ey . "
but then a new idea emerged .
next summer , the village will launch , and it pop@@ s up every single week , expanding to more and more communities as it goes .
so look out for it .
and it 's not a trip that requires light @@@ -@@ @ years of travel , but it 's to a place where it 's defined by light .
I needed some way to share the experience directly .
the other reason is this amazing bush g@@ lows .
this looks like a plant , but it 's actually an animal .
so what do you think happens if you squee@@ ze it in the middle ?
and I think this is actually a shri@@ mp that 's releasing its bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ es@@ cent chemicals into the water .
more than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean .
and I think that 's true .
( appl@@ ause ) Start as usual -- ( Appl@@ ause ) go the other way around the loop .
now , in keeping with today 's theme , I 'd like to point out -- something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage some@@ place in life can yield tremendous results some@@ place else .
this is another project I worked on with Sen@@ sible Cities La@@ b and Curren@@ t@@ C@@ ity@@ .org.
and it 's visu@@ alizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam .
there were 6@@ 62 rejected sheep that did@@ n 't meet " sheep @@@ -@@ @ like " criteria and were thrown out of the flock .
obviously , we think of sheep as followers .
the narr@@ ator 's only appe@@ ased when he draws a box .
and I like that .
and other people would draw stick figures or smil@@ ey faces .
that 's all I 'm getting paid for this ?
a whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content .
and I met a music video director named Chris Mil@@ k .
and you can sort the video a number of different ways .
but it was@@ n 't always that way .
finally , a vaccine that could stop this aw@@ ful disease , and here in the United States it had an incredible impact .
as you can see , the virus stopped , and it stopped very , very fast .
and it happened so fast in the United States , however , that even just last month J@@ on Ste@@ wart said this : ( video ) J@@ on Ste@@ wart : where is polio still active ?
Bru@@ ce A@@ yl@@ ward : o@@ ops . J@@ on , polio 's almost been eradicated .
we 're not trying to control polio .
so what we 're looking for is a permanent solution .
they 're right at the center of the whole thing .
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years , much longer than it should have -- but once it was built , the results were striking .
we should abandon this idea of eradication .
his right leg was paraly@@ zed in 2004 .
we 're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child .
now remember , northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio .
over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h and Bi@@ har -- 500,000 children every single month .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , with a combination of smart people , smart technology and smart investments , polio can now be eradicated anywhere .
we have the chance to write an entirely new polio @@@ -@@ @ free chapter in human history .
we are there to take pride and insist on respect .
while I was absent from Iran , the Islamic Revolution had des@@ cended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture .
and yet , I had an unusual position toward this .
and most of all , in the way that we fought for democracy .
and I did that ; I put on my rit@@ u@@ alistic dress , I went to the holy mosque , I did my prayers , I observed all the rit@@ uals .
but apparently , that was not an issue at the time .
first of all , Muslims -- p@@ ious , conservative , believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion -- should not cl@@ ing onto everything in their culture , thinking that that 's di@@ vin@@ ely mandated .
and , quite tell@@ ingly , some Muslims do practice it -- the Muslims in North Africa , not in other places .
and we see , truly , in some Muslim communities , that tradition .
for example , in Saudi Arabia , there is a phenomenon called the religious police .
now that is pretty authoritarian , and that 's something I 'm very much critical of .
in other words , they would force students to un@@ cover their heads .
but when I saw that , I said , " May@@ be the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region , and some Muslims have been influenced by that .
the name of the book is " Islam Without Ex@@ tre@@ mes : a Muslim Case for Liberty . "
now we 're living in a different world , with different values and political systems . "
similarly , in the Arab world , there was what the great Arab histor@@ ian Albert H@@ our@@ ani defines as the Liberal Age .
but there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century , because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modern@@ ist line .
just look at the political history of the 20th century , and you see things have changed a lot .
but the fact that those dict@@ ators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islam@@ ists much more stri@@ dent .
and this has been an inspiring example right now for some of the Islamic movements or some of the countries in the Arab world .
we are Muslim believers , but we want to be living as free people in free societies . "
they just should be allowed to work for that .
many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see .
what N@@ F@@ B wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
so starting from a three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional ping sound system , a vibr@@ ating vest , a click wheel with voice commands , a leg strip , even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
he 's coming up to the grand@@ stand , fellow Feder@@ ation@@ ists .
he 's closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : " now I understand why there is Bra@@ ille on a drive @@@ -@@ @ up ATM machine . "
you can see , there still is a little bit of a legi@@ bility problem there .
so this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the S@@ ayan Valley in Indonesia .
this is just completely ridic@@ ulous . "
and I 've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intri@@ gu@@ ing way .
be@@ a@@ ver dams , yes . Ho@@ over D@@ am , no .
well , does anything like that happen with human beings ?
the secret of happiness is : find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .
it is , on the one hand , a biological effect , and a very large one .
the idea of repl@@ icating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
they 're made of information , and can be carried in any physical medium .
I 've not time to go into more of it .
and for example , this would be somebody who 's completely logical .
and so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
this did@@ n 't really sit well with my in@@ tuition , and maybe it 's just because I don 't play with particles very often .
so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
so let 's think about the at@@ oms .
I think this is really cool .
I 'm J@@ ess@@ i , and this is my suit@@ case .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week .
just be who you are .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
Wednesday : embrace your inner child .
we 're the new techn@@ ologists .
what can we do with just one person 's data ?
how should we figure it out ?
in other words , it 's kind of random , kind of ad hoc , how we figure out what we should do .
we 're numbers people , living by numbers .
how can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework ?
he was worried about right and wrong .
I 'm just going back and forth ; I 'm not getting anywhere .
in math , we know the objective facts .
favorite number . I love that number .
then you would know what was really just and what was@@ n 't .
that 's as ambitious as we are .
it 's not like its relation to some abstract form .
I thought , that guy looks suspicious .
if you feel that way , that 's a util@@ itarian choice .
it 's wrong to take his phone because he 's a person and he has rights and he has dignity , and we can 't just interfere with that .
is it Pla@@ to , is it Ari@@ sto@@ tle , is it K@@ ant , is it M@@ ill ?
what should we be doing ? what 's the answer ?
you 're thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater -- how does that bear upon venture capital ?
we have so much power today , it is up to us to figure out what to do , and that 's the good news .
and so , at that time , I was able to make some interesting hypo@@ theses along with my colleagues .
the theme of this story is building a din@@ os@@ au@@ r , and so we come to that part of " Ju@@ ras@@ sic Park . "
and the H@@ ell C@@ ree@@ k Project was this massive undertaking to get as many din@@ osa@@ urs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some din@@ osa@@ urs that had more material in them .
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast .
and we know selection works .
now that 's a good characteristic .
and quite frankly , I think if Colonel San@@ ders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece .
this story is about taking imagination seriously .
promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Ma@@ hab@@ ali@@ pu@@ ram .
we had to engineer it to move gr@@ ac@@ efully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
I found a brilliant aer@@ on@@ autical engineer who designs sa@@ ils for America 's Cup racing yachts named Peter H@@ ep@@ pel .
I 'm going to share two directions that are new in my work .
historic Philadelphia City Hall : its pl@@ az@@ a , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than net@@ ting .
now I combine them with hi @@@ -@@ @ tech materials and engineering to create v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lowing forms the scale of buildings .
now we 're a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don 't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
so we could easily supply the world with dozens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from Guatemala sent Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the TE@@ D@@ Talk .
they called me .
this is a picture of Den@@ ver , and the outline is the new airport that was built in Den@@ ver .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
that 's more than 250 hundred @@@ -@@ @ thousand acres .
everybody applauded pol@@ itely .
so I sat down , and they played the TE@@ D@@ Talk .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there .
they even can bring with them some financing .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
so two couples each concei@@ ving one baby .
so some of what I 've worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ joined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
and we 're not exactly sure why that happens .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only , really , by a few nucle@@ oti@@ des ?
one of the places we 're seeing it , for example , in our culture , in the United States today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life .
now you might think that all this breaking @@@ -@@ @ down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
it 's because of what happened in 17@@ 76 with the F@@ ounding Fa@@ thers .
the F@@ ounding Fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activists , and this is why .
so what happened years afterwards ?
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain .
Henry can marry , in every state , a woman , but Mary can only marry today in a few states , a woman .
but this is also very b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , because of the story I told you at the beginning about and@@ rogen in@@ sensitivity syndrome .
we don 't have a situation that Iran has , for example , where a man who 's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered , unless he 's willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he 's allowed to live .
so I think we have to be in the lead .
and what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life , because of our tabo@@ os around suicide , we 're not sure what to say , and so quite often we say nothing .
and that fur@@ thers the isolation that people like John found themselves in .
and I would argue , in the future , we 'll have we@@ arable devices in our clothes , monitoring us 24 / 7 .
we 're now in the era of super @@@ -@@ @ enabling the surgeon , who can now go into the body and do robo@@ tic surgery , which is here today , at a level that was not really possible even five years ago .
and now this is being augmented with further layers of technology , like augmented reality .
this can be integrated with decision support .
and by leveraging these sorts of technologies , we 're going to change the definition of disability to , in some cases , be super@@ ability , or super @@@ -@@ @ enabling .
how about other expon@@ entials ?
a few examples : we 're now in the era of " F@@ ant@@ astic Vo@@ y@@ age , " the iP@@ ill .
this one is in proto@@ typing by Med@@ tr@@ onic ; it 's smaller than a pen@@ ny .
these are going to be game @@@ -@@ @ changing .
how about enabling the path@@ ologist to use their cell phone to see at a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic level and to l@@ umber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics ?
in fact , the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing .
many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches .
we 'll be predic@@ tive and know what you 're likely to have .
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized .
today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills .
we 're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long @@@ -@@ @ term cure .
because I know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with stage I disease , I 'm thr@@ illed ; we can often cure them .
which is kind of ir@@ onic , if you ask me .
you know , they are big , but they are a single cell .
with our friends in the Center for C@@ ell@@ ular Construction and the help of the National Science Foundation , we are using St@@ ent@@ or to sense the presence of contamination in food and water , which I think is really cool .
Oh , yes , I know it 's sad , yes .
the first surgeon in my country came from that rural village .
the vocabulary of measuring impact , return on investment ...
I however think that we could do a better job , and we could do a better job by embracing isi@@ ri@@ ka .
( appl@@ ause ) And we don 't have a planet B to go to .
we could use that wisdom today , I think , in every culture , in every place , passing to the next generation what we could do together .
and I tell you , long after the lights have gone off Mexico , Sem@@ illas will be there with the communities , with the women , for a very long time .
thirty years ago , there was very little funding that went directly to women 's hands in their communities .
and the second reason that I 'm asking you to invest in women and girls is because this is the s@@ mar@@ test thing you could ever do at this particular time .
for instance , me and my sister , when we were little , we would compete to see who could eat the most squ@@ ir@@ rel bra@@ ins .
( la@@ ughter ) Or we 'll be here all day with my childhood stories .
and great art would have " head " : it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts .
I 'm under the river with those fish .
and in her most recent project , it 's called " Weather I Made . "
( la@@ ughter ) And so what they 're doing -- each of these artists on a nine @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ seven @@@ -@@ @ inch card , which they sell for 10 buc@@ ks , they drew original works of art .
and in this one it 's called " Dra@@ wing the Short S@@ tick . "
( L@@ augh@@ ted ) Next is Syl@@ via S@@ later .
and you would carry this around with you , and if everything went to hell , you could make payments and buy your life .
I talked my family into doing this , and they did@@ n 't know what I was doing .
and I was like , " Get dressed for a funeral . we 're going to go do some work . "
and that 's my cous@@ in and my sister 's dog , Gab@@ by .
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
so if our engine 's broken , guess what ?
but then what happens in step three ?
I 'm going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
she passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time -- as the red@@ wood trees -- for that serious mem@@ e to get out of our operating system .
so they 're restrictive -- don 't use your mobile phone , don 't use your laptop , don 't search the Internet , don 't be on I.@@ M.
evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
but when they 're playing , they 're learning the social order and dynamics of things .
rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger bra@@ ins and they learn tasks better , skills .
it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better .
it 's the ones that play more .
it 's a universal thing -- we play .
we develop better decision @@@ -@@ @ making ability if we play more .
these guys are facts .
imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without la@@ ughter .
it 's pretty bl@@ ea@@ k .
is it fun ? is it play@@ ful ?
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
quick example from the corporate world .
what happens ? they give better service -- not worse , but better .
and you 're going to say , " Ge@@ e , that can work for Fed@@ Ex out there in the United States , but it can 't work in Bulgaria .
through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self @@@ -@@ @ direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not auto@@ c@@ racy , the things like having a results @@@ -@@ @ focus .
you 're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
you guys have to , and if you 're not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , are@@ n 't going to feel it .
I 'm going to let you make decisions . I 'm going to empower you , and I 'm going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
we 're not always right as leaders .
let them be on the Internet .
let them take long lun@@ ches .
let them do it . give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . let them have fun at the workplace .
we spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it 's supposed to be , what , a mis@@ erable gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , " Is this it ?
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
that 's about a 15 @@@ -@@ @ foot boat .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
and this video is real time .
and " Be@@ at@@ J@@ az@@ zers " become as common as D.@@ J. ' s .
the two places where I feel most free are@@ n 't actually places .
they 're moments .
I imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water and em@@ pa@@ thy .
the project is called " Mo@@ ving and Pass@@ ing . "
you love the game .
you 've just been practicing dri@@ b@@ bling through con@@ es for , like , 15 minutes , and then , all of a sudden , a mar@@ ching band comes down the field .
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my d@@ ad would bring home the latest Ford or Lin@@ col@@ n and leave it in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
so my parents would go to dinner .
and that 's a belief that I share .
today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide .
so parking gar@@ ages , buses , trains , they all operate within the same system .
every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in An@@ n Ar@@ b@@ or to my office in De@@ ar@@ born , Michigan .
this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system .
and we need people from all walks of life ; not just inven@@ tors , we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge .
you know , we 've come a long way .
one is a flash of white light .
the sket@@ ches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
four is blue .
it 's an infinite number -- literally goes on forever .
let 's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago .
64 becomes 6,@@ 400 .
four across , four up and down -- it 's 16 .
so what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16 , 16 , 16 .
I 'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic .
most people , a majority of people , say sad .
in my theory , language evol@@ ves in such a way that sounds match , correspond with , the subjective , with the personal , intuitive experience of the listen@@ er .
it stands to reason that we , existing in this world , should in the course of our lives absorb intu@@ i@@ tively those relationships .
in the case of h@@ are , it 's an ambiguous sound in English .
so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
I hope that I 've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes .
thank you .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
and indeed , most people associate space with silence .
and just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth , we can convert these trans@@ missions into sound using simple analog techniques .
so today , I 'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening .
but like any long length of charged wire , it also inadver@@ tently became an antenna .
some of the crac@@ k@@ les and pop@@ s were lightning , but the e@@ er@@ ie whi@@ stles and curi@@ ously mel@@ odi@@ ous ch@@ ir@@ ps had a rather more exotic origin .
they turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .
I re@@ frame that as a positive because the cra@@ z@@ ier I get on@@ stage , the more enter@@ taining I become .
( la@@ ughter ) I was sent to a place , a psy@@ ch ward , and in the psy@@ ch ward , everyone is doing their own one @@@ -@@ @ man show .
the second half was just one big na@@ p , pretty much , in class .
some of them committed suicide .
and there was an article written in the New York Times , September 2010 , that stated : " just Man@@ ic En@@ ough . "
everyone is just a little bit mad .
we spoke to you last several years ago .
audience : it 's people logging on to Google around the world .
now you can also see , if I turn this around here -- hopefully I won 't shake the world too much .
and if we can switch to slides -- all right , here we go .
so this is slowed down .
I mean , it could be somebody 's health , it could be somebody 's career , something important to them .
and so I guess the U.S. finally , finally started to like it , too .
audience : Or@@ k@@ ut .
this is Or@@ k@@ ut . is anybody here on Or@@ k@@ ut ?
ok@@ ay , not very many people know about it .
we just released it in a test phase last month , and it 's been taking off .
this is our V@@ P of Engineering .
and -- well , I 'll leave you in suspen@@ se .
so it 'd be like three people , or something like that , and they would try to make a product .
and we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't really be sure if it 's going to work or not .
and now it 's a real , full @@@ -@@ @ blown project with more people on it .
and as we become more of a global company , we find these things really affect us -- you know , can we work effectively with people who are@@ n 't in the room ?
we also have a lot of engineers in those meetings , and they don 't always do their laundry as much as they should .
so we decided -- actually , the highlight 's right there . Oh , thank you .
we accept payment for advertising , and we mark it as such .
maybe some cylin@@ dr@@ ical containers with some symbols on them .
but the Indu@@ s people also left behind arti@@ facts with writing on them .
in fact , we don 't even know what any of these objects say , and that 's because the Indu@@ s script is un@@ deci@@ phe@@ red .
it 's the square object with the un@@ ic@@ or@@ n @@@ -@@ @ like animal on it .
well let me show you .
so what were these used for ?
these were used to make those kinds of packing sli@@ ps .
in fact , the script has become a batt@@ leg@@ round of sorts between three different groups of people .
first , there 's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indu@@ s script does not represent a language at all .
there 's a last group of people who believe that the Indu@@ s people were the ancestors of people living in South India today .
which of these hypo@@ theses can be true ?
that 's when I was in India , and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script .
and I 'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .
are you ready ?
Oh , it 's almost 50 / 50 . ok@@ ay .
and so they had to cra@@ m the sign .
most of you said U , which is right .
now if I asked you to predict one more letter , what do you think that would be ?
and this is very similar to a Q and U example .
there 's a lot of these texts that are damaged .
this is a physics and information theory term .
so , as the old saying goes , if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script , then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .
what I haven 't told you is that the Indu@@ s people were very , very enter@@ prising .
got it ?
totally by coincidence , there 's that thing in my lung .
just incredible .
and the radi@@ ologist 's report said , " No cancer found . "
and the Wh@@ it@@ ney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line .
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30 @@@ -@@ @ day challenges , my self @@@ -@@ @ confidence grew .
it 's aw@@ ful .
no , no , if I want to , I can say , " I 'm a novel@@ ist . "
so I 'm going to tell you a little bit about re@@ imag@@ ining food .
I 've been interested in food for a long time .
and it 's largely what you would find in these books .
and it 's a wonderful thing .
in fact , understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking -- some of the chemistry , some of the physics and so forth .
but that 's not in any of those books .
the idea here is to explain what happens when you steam bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half .
but he@@ y , they grow back .
now it may also be the last cook@@ book that ever does it .
if you really want great ham@@ bur@@ ger , it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain .
here it is .
now the way that plants transmit that information is through pol@@ len .
so all the gra@@ s@@ ses , which means all of the ce@@ real crops , and most of the trees have wind @@@ -@@ @ borne pol@@ len .
and this one is evolved to m@@ im@@ ic a gl@@ os@@ sy metallic surface you see on some be@@ et@@ les .
they fly into this thing , and they fly all the way down it .
for anyone here from Brazil , you 'll know about this plant .
that sort of ph@@ all@@ ic bit there is about a foot long .
but if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
these are little yellow flowers like we all see , little yellow flowers all over the place .
but the contrast will look something like that , so standing out a lot from the background .
finally , there 's one of evening pri@@ m@@ rose that B@@ j@@ or@@ n R@@ or@@ s@@ let@@ t from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern .
we all began in the A@@ wash Valley in Ethiopia .
and then the next thing we do is we put a do@@ t in the center of the circle .
because it 's the first thing we draw ; we sur@@ round ourselves with images of it ; it 's probably the most common image on the planet .
until it was stripped from me , I never thought about it .
and what I 've learned since that event and during my recovery is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it 's never been under threat before .
our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate .
I discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide .
we 're talking about a society that is ret@@ re@@ ating into depression and dis@@ association when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift .
this is a dense array EE@@ G M@@ RI tracking 156 channels of information .
it 's the what our minds do every night to dig@@ est the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we 're asleep to the actual mind when we awak@@ en the following morning .
I did@@ n 't feel empty ; I felt everything simultaneously .
but let 's take a look behind my eyes .
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke .
here 's what my neuro@@ psych@@ ologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it .
what does average I.@@ Q. really mean ?
this is a very , very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system .
now the Journal of the National Medical Association gave my mem@@ o@@ ir a full clinical review , which is very unusual .
I 'm not a doctor . I have no medical background whatsoever .
here 's somebody , what they did as they went through cognitive training at ages seven and 11 .
but that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
so my teeth actually hold my ja@@ w in the correct position .
this affected my entire body .
using this technology , this is mapping in three dimensions .
using this technology , the specialists at U@@ C@@ LA Medical Center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring .
a v@@ ascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body .
and in the following months and years , I felt the neuro@@ logical flow of life itself returning .
all consciousness is about communication .
and I 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paraly@@ zed .
and when I came out of my com@@ a , I recognized my family , but I did@@ n 't remember my own past .
and I whis@@ pered the good news through my broken ja@@ w , which was wired shut , to my night nurse .
thank you very much .
I don 't know what I had in my mind .
and then we met and we talked , and I 'm like , he do@@ es@@ n 't look like somebody who was built out of nothing .
and if I do this , probably the mic won 't hear it .
and what I would love to add because I did@@ n 't have time ...
and this , this is the im@@ plan@@ table generation .
I should clarify that .
thank you . thank you .
this usually consisted of weekend reading lessons at our kitchen table while my friends played outside .
( la@@ ughter ) My high school was over 70 percent black and L@@ atin@@ o , but this advanced English class had white students everywhere .
reading ?
according to the US Department of Education , more than 85 percent of black male fourth gra@@ ders are not profici@@ ent in reading .
it 's a literacy non@@ profit that creates child @@@ -@@ @ friendly reading spaces in bar@@ ber shops .
and we feed them -- steril@@ ely of course -- with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food -- and we grow them in incub@@ ators .
but what we 're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them .
but that brings me to lesson number two : cells do all the work .
" we are what we eat , " could easily be described as , " We are what our cells eat . "
when she saw her reflection in the mirror , she started to cry .

it 's a 24 / 7 confidential helpl@@ ine in the UK for anyone who might be feeling desperate or su@@ ic@@ idal .
it felt my self @@@ -@@ @ harm was probably the only area where I felt I had any control .
so I caught up with my education , found someone I could persuade to give me a job , and I enjoyed my volunteering at Samar@@ it@@ ans .
( la@@ ughter ) Which I did .
recent systematic review of research actually said that it increased the mortality rates , or premature death rates , by up to 30 percent .
and it happens when there 's a mis@@ match between the quality and the quantity of relationships that we have and those that we want .
and in my experience , people who have been helped in a transforming way always want to pay something back .
I guess it 's a really simple idea , setting up a helpl@@ ine .
my favorite group is the music group , where people , every week , play musical instruments down the phone to each other .
because at the Silver Line , we do want to cher@@ ish the wonderful lives of older people and all the experiences that they bring .
( audio ) Good morning , you 're through to the Silver Line .
( cou@@ gh@@ s ) Exc@@ use me about that .
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government .
or " How could we have better prepared for that ? "
I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim @@@ -@@ @ majority societies .
but having been born in Es@@ sex , at the age of 16 , I joined an organization .
it 's comprised of ideas and narr@@ atives and symbols and leaders .
so the ideas and the narr@@ atives of Al @@@ -@@ @ Qaeda come to your mind immediately .
if I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders , they come to your mind immediately .
there is no equivalent of the Al @@@ -@@ @ Qaeda , without the terrorism , for democracy across Muslim @@@ -@@ @ majority societies .
there are no ideas and narr@@ atives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground .
let 's bring the military back again . "
and what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activis@@ m on the ground , in addition to international aid , in addition to education , in addition to health .
and it 's with that thought that I 'll end .
and my time is up , and thank you for your time .
has anyone ever been to As@@ pen , Col@@ or@@ ado ?
they 've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun .
but Arch@@ ie Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e was a resour@@ ce@@ ful person .
so Arch@@ ie spl@@ its the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups .
and then he goes back to his quarters , breaks down and we@@ eps because he 's convinced that the situation is hop@@ eless .
now I 'm not telling you this story because I think Arch@@ ie Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e is a du@@ de , although Arch@@ ie Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e is a du@@ de .
and he had a name for it .
now I 'm an economist , I 'm not a doctor , but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists .
so three pieces of data for each country -- three pieces of data .
imagine you had one second per product category .
you could count them in five minutes .
I realize that 's an ambiguous statement .
maybe I should clarify it .
what is evolution ?
well you have this great big tank full of liquid deter@@ gent .
now Un@@ il@@ ever did this and it did@@ n 't work -- too complicated .
and eventually , they 'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) if , of course , they haven 't already done so .
it did@@ n 't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
it 's about proving who you are and what you can do .
and it 's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say , " I am as much contributing to this family , or more , than you are . "
I 'm just not in touch .
so you just can 't shut these guys down .
well the yellow part of the code is now dec@@ ry@@ pted .
this is what runs everything around us .
the self changed , got affected , broken , destroyed , but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger , sometimes hat@@ eful , sometimes not wanting to be there at all .
and how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place ?
my d@@ ad is white from Corn@@ wall , and my mom is black from Zimbabwe .
but nature had its wicked way , and brown babies were born .
without it , we literally can 't interface with others .
that n@@ ag@@ ging dre@@ ad of self @@@ -@@ @ hood did@@ n 't exist when I was dancing .
my dys@@ functional self could actually plug in to another self , not my own , and it felt so good .
on the other hand , my definition of self just lost a huge ch@@ un@@ k of its credibility .
I still valued self @@@ -@@ @ worth above all other worth , and what was there to suggest otherwise ?
I 'm earth@@ ed in my essence , and my self is suspended .
I take it to therapy .
that its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it -- the world around us and the world inside us .
and it 's specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
what do you do when you grow up ? "
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that be handy ?
all it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says , " Stop . "
birds are very ag@@ ile .
we have to turn it , go up and go down .
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five @@@ -@@ @ act tragedy .
from the Taliban 's point of view , that was their number one mistake last time .
a girl , if you 're lucky , in the corner of a dark room -- lucky to be able to look at the Kor@@ an .
now is this a new idea ?
Paul Fish@@ stein who began working there in 1978 -- worked for Save the Children , ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit .
and yet , nobody listened to them .
you exagg@@ erate your fears , and you 're terri@@ fied about the humiliation of defeat .
what is the solution to this ?
we need to begin from the position that our knowledge , our power , our legitimacy is limited .
this do@@ es@@ n 't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster .
we criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees .
we 're not matching our resources to our priorities .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you very much .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
thank you .
we imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation .
so the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life , is that it is scal@@ able , it works over an extraordinary range .
and it is our interactions and the clu@@ stering of those interactions .
if it 's social networks with super @@@ -@@ @ linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life .
and we were trying to figure out how we were going to fix this whole thing of this money situation , and she said , " He@@ y , ba@@ be , I 've got a great idea . "
child 1 : no , you did it ! child 2 : no , you did it !
or as a parent in general , you get no sleep .

but when you 're with your kids all day , you become emo@@ tionally tired .
you had no time for anything .
and some people are done with their spouse as a stay @@@ -@@ @ at @@@ -@@ @ home parent .

no one can deny that family is one of the biggest foundations in anyone 's life .
and let your presence be a gift .
he went through Europe , through World War II , ste@@ aling , extor@@ ting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .
now nobody believed him .
why does this matter ?
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
I don 't doubt that that plays some role , but what I want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on .
would you eat this ?
that 's not so surprising .
how do you make children not just be more likely to eat car@@ ro@@ ts and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating car@@ ro@@ ts and drinking milk -- to think they taste better ?
it 's simple , you tell them they 're from Mc@@ Donald 's .
this was recently done with a neuro@@ scientific tw@@ ist .
in front of them on a screen is information about the wine .
or take sex .
these are stimul@@ i I 've used in some of my studies .
but how attractive you find them , how sexually or roman@@ tically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you 're looking at .
but that was before she got Cap@@ gr@@ as syndrome .
the golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy and sold for three @@@ -@@ @ quarters of a million dollars at auction .
according to an un@@ confirmed report , a Saudi mil@@ lion@@ aire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes .
in the case of art@@ work , the history is special indeed .
the original is typically the product of a creative act , the forgery is@@ n 't .
and they then reported that her father was coaching her .
and people have different views on this .
( la@@ ughter ) For a dollar 99 , you can listen to that silence , which is different than other forms of silence .
the third drops , the fourth , the fifth .
in the other condition , they 're told that the person in the next room is shoc@@ king them on purpose -- knows they 're shoc@@ king them .
as G@@ and@@ hi said , " To a hungry man , a piece of bread is the face of God . "
others worry about peace and security , stability in the world .
others think about Mal@@ thu@@ sian night@@ ma@@ res .
we know how to fix hunger .
and I was just struck that this is out of place .
yet again , the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people won@@ dering if they can make it to the next day .
their bra@@ ins and bodies will be stun@@ ted .
and here you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition , another , neglected and who was deeply mal@@ nourished .
this message , this word , can come out that this is not an old @@@ -@@ @ fashi@@ oned way of doing business ; it 's a brilliant way of saving your child 's life .
but what is most amazing is the effect on girls .
for the past two years , 500 of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid -- they 're self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient .
we 're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year .
and what I 've found is , rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things , they invested in a school feeding program .
when a leader says , " Not under my watch , " everything begins to change .
because food is one issue that CA@@ N@@ NOT be solved person by person , nation by nation .
it makes for a better meal .
thank you .
and my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called " The Hot Zone . " it was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus .
but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ing@@ en@@ ious response , but can 't quite control it .
meaning that you have muscle cells , but they 're not dividing , so it do@@ es@@ n 't seem like a good target for cancer to hij@@ ack .
and I guess I 'll keep investigating until I get the answers .
is it possible that muscle somehow intu@@ i@@ tively knows that it needs this blood supply ? it needs to be constantly contracting , so therefore it 's almost sel@@ fish . it 's gra@@ b@@ bing its blood vessels for itself .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the sk@@ ele@@ tal muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the sk@@ ele@@ tal muscle tissue , My@@ o@@ D acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become sk@@ ele@@ tal muscle cells ?
it 's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that 's a foreign object -- we want that out .
these cells are so versatile , these cancer cells are so versatile -- we just have to manipulate them in the right way .
when I married my wife , I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time .
( la@@ ughter ) But it 's a great intention to have in a relationship .
so I 'd like to share with you five simple exercises , tools you can take away with you , to improve your own conscious listening .
( noise ) So even if you 're in a nois@@ y environment like this -- and we all spend a lot of time in places like this -- listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear ?
how many birds am I hearing ?
if you 're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody who 's listening to this talk -- the acrony@@ m is RA@@ SA , which is the S@@ ans@@ k@@ rit word for " juice " or " essence . "
now sound is my passion , it 's my life .
so I invite you to connect with me , connect with each other , take this mission out .
by the end of this year , there 'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CN@@ N be@@ amed a live hol@@ o@@ gram of hip hop artist will@@ .@@ i.@@ am into their studio for an interview with An@@ derson Co@@ op@@ er .
these are cellular mobile phones .
and we even have to be asked sometimes , very kindly , to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons .
then there 's ultra@@ violet light .
and guess what ?
look at the ceiling , you see all these light bul@@ bs .
and what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp .
in the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones .
you don 't notice with your human eye .
so I 've mentioned to you the four challenges .
you would agree with me , hopefully , there 's no issue of capacity anymore .
you would agree with me that light do@@ es@@ n 't penetrate through walls .
and there 's only data where there is light .
so if I don 't want that receiver to receive the data , then what I could do , turn it away .
we have had a century of very nice , smart application developers .
and they use light to illumin@@ ate space down there .
intrin@@ sically safe environments like this petrochemical plant -- you can 't use RF , it may generate antenna spar@@ ks , but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there .
it 's just that , whereas that device relies on pul@@ ses of infrared light , your language relies on pul@@ ses , discrete pul@@ ses , of sound .
in fact , the Tower of Ba@@ bel story in the Bible is a f@@ able and warning about the power of language .
and this leads to the wonderful ir@@ ony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating .
now all this f@@ uss about a single one of our traits tells us there 's something worth explaining .
how do we know this ?
but in fact , it turns out that some time around 200,000 years ago , when our species first arose and acquired social learning , that this was really the beginning of our story , not the end of our story .
because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it 's fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
and the reason that dilemma arose is , it turns out , that social learning is visual theft .
one of those options was that we could have ret@@ re@@ ated into small family groups .
and this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas , there are fewer innovations .
well , we chose the second option , and language is the result .
just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit , language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit .
the other one says , " Fine . looks good to me .
and they even slow the flow of genes .
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay , this tendency we have , this seemingly natural tendency we have , towards isolation , towards keeping to ourselves , crashes head first into our modern world .
and we see this in the in@@ ex@@ orable march towards standardization .
there are lots and lots of ways of measuring things -- weighing them and measuring their length -- but the metric system is winning .
S@@ van@@ te found that the FO@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gene , which seems to be associated with language , was also shared in the same form in Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als as us .
so many of you will be familiar with the idea that there 's this gene called FO@@ X@@ P@@ 2 that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that 's associated with language .
what we know about this FO@@ X@@ P@@ 2 and Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als is that they may have had fine motor control of their mou@@ ths -- who knows .
and today , architects and bi@@ ologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us .
given the amount of time that we spend indo@@ ors , it 's important to understand how this affects our health .
and we looked at three different types of rooms .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
me was always trying to become something , somebody .
me only existed in the trying .
it was a way of locating myself .
all the stories began to ble@@ ed together .
and I said , " But what 's the water part ? "
it was the Congolese women who are now rising up .
it was advocating friends and a do@@ ting sister .
the problem is they now prefer [ the ] as@@ yn@@ chron@@ istic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships .
it really opened my eyes .
EA : I met Kor@@ t@@ ney Williams when I went to her college classroom to talk about " Un@@ prison@@ ed . "
she ended up inter@@ viewing her a@@ unt , Tro@@ y@@ ly@@ n@@ n Rob@@ er@@ t@@ son , for an episode .
EA : because of the way our criminal legal system disproportionately targets people of color , it 's not un@@ common for young people like Kor@@ t@@ ney to know about it .
girl : my d@@ ad works as a guard .
I really miss you .
( voice breaking up ) I have some good news .
we 're going to region@@ als , can 't you believe it ?
An@@ iss@@ a wrote these letters to her brother when she was a s@@ op@@ hom@@ ore in high school .
d@@ w : the group . we all agreed on it .
we elect the district attorneys , the judges and the legislators who operate these systems for we the people .
these public defenders receive around 30 percent less funding than district attorneys do , and they often have caselo@@ ads far out@@ numbering what the American Bar Association recommends .
and to di@@ g in on this big question , I wanted to know three things .
a very po@@ ignant example of how our attention ends up getting utilized .
this is the story of a marine captain , Cap@@ tain J@@ ef@@ f Dav@@ is .
he was actually on a bridge , in Florida .
and while his body was on that bridge , his mind , his attention , was thousands of miles away .
he was gri@@ pped with suffering .
and in the year 2008 , he part@@ nered with me in the first @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ its @@@ -@@ @ kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer something called mind@@ fulness training to active @@@ -@@ @ duty military personnel .
and doing this , we can very precisely plot the timing of the brain 's activity .
we call it the N@@ 170 component .
and we use this component in many of our studies .
and what we do is we ask our participants as they 're viewing a series of these types of over@@ laid images , to do something with their attention .
and what I mean by this is that when we direct attention to the face , it becomes clearer and more salient , it 's easier to see .
we found that when they paid attention to the face , the N@@ 170 was larger .
and when they paid attention to the scene , as you can see in red , it was smaller .
what it tells us is that attention , which is really the only thing that changed , since the images they viewed were identical in both cases -- attention changes perception .
when we bore people , people happ@@ ily generate all kinds of internal content to occupy themselves .
that was pretty much it .
so we wanted to know what happens when people have mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .
so what do all of these studies tell us ?
what about in the real world ?
what about in our actual day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day life ?
to kind of bring it back , I 'd like to make a prediction about your attention for the remainder of my talk .
I 'm surely going to assume that you 're going to remain seated and , you know , gr@@ aci@@ ously keep your eyes on me as I speak .
so we might ask why do we do this ?
why do we mind @@@ -@@ @ w@@ ander so much ?
we don 't just reflect on the past when we re@@ wind , we end up being in the past r@@ umin@@ ating , re@@ living or regret@@ ting events that have already happened .
is there anything we can possibly do about this ?
it 's more like practice , you have to embody this mindful mode of being to have any benefits .
and for many of the groups that we work with , high @@@ -@@ @ stress groups , like I said -- soldiers , medical professionals -- for them , as we know , mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering can be really dire .
or we want to give the training to accountants during tax season .
because those are the moments in which their attention is most likely to be vulnerable , because of stress and mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .
but if you do engage in mind@@ fulness practice , the more you do , the more you benefit .
and he said , " I want to tell you something .
pay attention to your attention .
by mid @@@ -@@ @ century , we 're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people living in cities or within a day 's travel of one .
basically , we substitute , in our lives , access to the things we want .
urban retro@@ fitting : creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there .
people are saying that it 's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood .
do they allow for pol@@ l@@ ination , pol@@ lin@@ ator pathways that be@@ es and bu@@ tter@@ flies and such can come back into our cities ?
now when the Trea@@ sure s@@ ank in 2000 , it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African pen@@ gu@@ in , which at the time , was listed as a threatened species .
so two days later , I was on a plane headed for Cape Town with a team of pen@@ gu@@ in specialists .
and this is what happened .
Pen@@ gu@@ ins are very vocal birds and really , really nois@@ y , so I expected to walk into this building and be met with this c@@ ac@@ op@@ hon@@ y of hon@@ king and bra@@ ying and squ@@ aw@@ king .
but instead , when we stepped through those doors and into the building , it was e@@ er@@ ily silent .
yet they were .
we just did not know .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
could I go and speak to older and wis@@ er people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
there was no day of intercultural cooperation .
you very quickly work out what is it that you 've got to do to fa@@ th@@ om that out .
and we started to build this case .
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually .
the OAU at the time , led by Sali@@ m Ahmed Sali@@ m , said , " I must get the African countries involved . "
and I 'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about .
and I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .
and actually I could never raise awareness by myself , no matter what I 'd achieved .
there was an interest in what was going on .
and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say , " Lo@@ ok , you guys made this possible . and thank you very much . "
and I remember being stuck in New York , this time because of the volcan@@ o , which was obviously much less harmful .
and I was there thinking about what was going on .
that 's exactly what we must do .
and obviously the life @@@ -@@ @ saving is increased , the concepts help .
he said , " It 's absolutely possible . "
nobody 's having a better day down here because of that .
the public realm in America has two roles : it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life , and it is the physical manifestation of the common good .
and that 's how we do it .
they 're not the same thing .
so you have this one last facade of the house , the front , which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house .
you know , but there 's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out , that they would s@@ nat@@ ch a motor@@ ist off the street and eat his liver .
we 're going to have to live closer to each other .
the age of the 3,000 mile Ca@@ es@@ ar sal@@ ad is coming to an end .
well , in point of fact , most of them are not going to make it .
we 're not going to be rescu@@ ed by the hy@@ per @@@ -@@ @ car ; we 're not going to be rescu@@ ed by alternative fuels .
no amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we 're running , the way we 're running it .
consumers are different than citizens .
in this image of the Tokyo sky@@ line , I 've hidden data from the newest planet @@@ -@@ @ hunting space teles@@ cope on the block , the Ke@@ pl@@ er Mission .
you 'll notice that it looks pretty much like the ic@@ onic yellow ball -- that Sun that we all draw when we 're children .
Ke@@ pl@@ er won 't find a planet around every single star it looks at .
it synchron@@ izes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices .
let 's play a game .
sometimes it 's hard to tell the two apart .
compul@@ sive gam@@ bl@@ ers are experts at self @@@ -@@ @ dec@@ eption .
so , I was in the hospital for a long time .
and a few years after I left , I went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me -- said , " Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you . "
but you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we 've done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreg@@ round for me .
I mean , this is all very de@@ pressing , right -- people have conflicts of interest , we don 't see it , and so on .
this is surprising , of course , because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in Africa than outside Africa .
so this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA , how you convert it to a form you can sequence .
and you can begin to compare it to the gen@@ om@@ es of people who live today .
and one question that you may then want to ask is , what happened when we met ?
statistically speaking , there is no difference in how often the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ thal matches one African or the other .
and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als around 64@@ 0,000 years ago .
but we do find it in Papua New Guinea and in other islands in Mel@@ an@@ esia and the Pacific .
so this presumably means that these Den@@ is@@ ov@@ ans had been more widespread in the past , since we don 't think that the ancestors of Mel@@ ane@@ sians were ever in Siberia .
why are@@ n 't Palestinians using non@@ violent resistance ?
man : today you 're invited to a peaceful march .
Hamas Party Member : we were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine .
the residents , after 10 months of peaceful resistance , convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line , which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories .
but that 's true for adults too .
in fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .
but I have seen first hand that if we do , they will multiply .
let 's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere .
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self @@@ -@@ @ assembling , repl@@ icating and repairing themselves .
we need some energy that 's going to allow that to activate , allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program .
so these are the brilliant scientists , engineers , designers that worked on this project .
the next one questions that and looks at passive nature , or passi@@ vely trying to have reconfiguration program@@ ma@@ bility .
but it goes a step further , and it tries to have actual computation .
it compu@@ tes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do .
each element is completely identical , and they 're biased .
I think that it 's telling us that there 's new possibilities for self @@@ -@@ @ assembly , replication , repair in our physical structures , our buildings , machines .
some of them are fierce ; some of them are w@@ ra@@ thful ; some of them are tender ; some of them are wise .
they are not lux@@ u@@ ries .
without them , humanity CA@@ N@@ NOT survive . "
the ra@@ gs were un@@ wrapped from a little girl whose body was m@@ assi@@ vely burned .
they touched me at that time .
and it was really her strength , I believe , that became the kind of m@@ ud@@ ra and im@@ pri@@ mat@@ ur that has been a guiding light in my life .
another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called ne@@ ural integration .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ defended heart .
may we actu@@ alize that capacity for women everywhere .
what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment ?
and I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity , at least in the next few hundred years .
historically , for example , ch@@ op@@ sticks -- according to one Japanese anthro@@ polog@@ ist who wrote a dis@@ ser@@ tation about it at the University of Michigan -- resulted in long @@@ -@@ @ term changes in the denti@@ tion , in the teeth , of the Japanese public .
and the translations of the surviving texts say , " This I will not treat . this I CA@@ N@@ NOT treat . "
it means , I think , that we 're living in a time of unexpected possibilities .
if we think , for example , of Louis Pa@@ ste@@ ur , who in the 18@@ 6@@ 0s was asked to study the diseases of sil@@ k wor@@ ms for the sil@@ k industry , and his discoveries were really the beginning of the ger@@ m theory of disease .
and we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge , to share their knowledge , in the face of an emergency , which they had@@ n 't really been for years and years .
now this may seem a bit ambitious , but when you look at yourself , you look at your hands , you realize that you 're alive .
this is an in@@ organic tube .
let 's say that if the physics of fusion is en@@ coded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
in fact , we have such amazing life@@ forms that we can manipulate .
if we can make matter alive , would we have a mat@@ ter@@ hazard ?
and we also have to be aware of the issues .
and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing .
so before we can really start to make life , we have to really think about where it came from .
but there 's a road@@ block that you can 't get past .
this seems most likely .
there 's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present .
and this movie here shows this competition between molecules .
if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete , they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete .
you believe you 're going to be successful in this project ?
Lee C@@ ron@@ in : so many people think that life took millions of years to kick in .
so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon , maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for .
it 's a children 's book for the iPad .
but you know , I have a problem with children 's books : I think they 're full of propaganda .
you know , my work is inspired by events such as this .
and conversely , only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them .
you pick them up , and once you see something that you 're interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
anyway , it 's based on the London subway system .
in contrast to if you went inside the d@@ ome , where it 's kind of wild and crazy and everybody 's learning all kinds of things , or fo@@ oling around , or whatever they 're doing .
you watch the video with super@@ imposed graphics that indicate your depth and comp@@ ass heading .
he 's made 30,000 new jobs .
look at the sky@@ line of Shanghai .
the implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth , rather than a facilitator of economic growth .
if you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe , then you will put less emphasis on strong government .
if you believe in the infrastructure view , then you will say , " Country 1 must be China .
I know that in 1989 he no longer ruled the Soviet Union , but that 's the best picture that I can find .
( la@@ ughter ) Tele@@ phones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
both countries are in Asia .
in East Asia , we have had successful economic growth stories such as Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore .
the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lo@@ tter@@ ies , " Have you won the lottery ? "
and then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are 100 percent .
China was during the Cultural Revolution .
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country , whereas in India , it 's all men .
India still has a long way to go to catch up with China .
st@@ atically , China is a one @@@ -@@ @ party system , authoritarian -- there 's no question about it .
and they have increased the security with long @@@ -@@ @ term land leases .
but nevertheless , the system has moved in a more liberal direction , moved in a more democratic direction .
you can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India .
if you are a N@@ BA player and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan , you 're going to look not so impressive .
in some communities , you might not find a public health center , a post office or even a school , but you 'll find a church or mosque .
many of these spaces could be utilized for social change .
the 2016 " why give " survey conducted in Kenya reveals that close to 60 percent of adults give to faith @@@ -@@ @ based organizations -- even more than they give their extended families .
meanwhile , faith @@@ -@@ @ based organizations draw thousands and millions every Sunday or Friday ...
there are over 2,000 African n@@ un@@ s and priests in leadership positions in Europe , with more influence than some of our diplomatic envoys , operating at a fraction of the cost .
similarly , some African churches have a presence in countries across the globe , and the Re@@ deemed Christian Church of God has a presence in 196 countries , serving as a bridge to the diaspora and providing support .
first , I should have commended him for asking tough questions .
an Africa that demonstrates that God loves Africans and that we are just as capable as any other world region in solving our problems in peace ...
we are everyone . we are no one .
you never know when they 're going to attack next , who or what the consequences will be .
but there is also a very serious aspect to An@@ onymous -- they are ide@@ ologically driven .
there 's a strong wh@@ iff of half @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ ked an@@ arch@@ ism about them .
these were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it .
instead , we prefer these really d@@ azz@@ ling technological solutions , which cost a huge amount of money .
and so nothing is going into the h@@ ackers .
but I think they 're doing very important work .
of course , the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals .
the purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars dig@@ it@@ ally , and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details .
he knew no other way of making a living and making money .
and then finally , C@@ ag@@ at@@ ay EV@@ Y@@ A@@ PA@@ N , aka Cha@@ 0 -- one of the most remarkable h@@ ackers ever , from Ankara in Turkey .
now I think we 're missing a trick here , because I don 't think people like Max Vision should be in jail .
and if we rely , as we do at the moment , solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences , we will be nurturing a mon@@ ster we CA@@ N@@ NOT t@@ ame .
thank you very much for listening .
mg : I think to an extent , you have to understand that it 's ax@@ i@@ om@@ atic among h@@ ackers that they do that .
they 're just relent@@ less and ob@@ ses@@ sive about what they do .
I teach courses in physical computing and we@@ arable electronics .
and so when working as an interaction designer , or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on , in or around the human form -- it 's really a powerful space to work within .
and so I went home , and I made a prototype of this hat .
this one is called the Talk to Y@@ our@@ self H@@ at .
so what happens when a person puts this thing on ?
( la@@ ughter ) And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences .
( la@@ ughter ) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .
so the E@@ ar Ben@@ der literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say .
and so when I was first living in New York City a few years back , I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them .
and so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or criti@@ que the spaces that surrounded me .
so when a plant is thirsty , it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter .
and so gl@@ aci@@ ers are these magnificent beings , and there 's lots of reasons to be obs@@ essed with them , but what I 'm particularly interested in is in human @@@ -@@ @ gl@@ ac@@ ier relations .
the gl@@ aci@@ ers are actually leaving us .
and so I actually live in Canada now , so I 've been visiting one of my local gl@@ aci@@ ers .
and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter .
or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool , like an ic@@ y meg@@ aph@@ one that I can use to ampl@@ ify my voice when I direct it at the ice .
but really the most satisfying experience I 've had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship .
and I was really struck by how much it affected me .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , I actually made a device called the Gl@@ ac@@ ier Em@@ brac@@ ing Su@@ it .
and once again , it 's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the gl@@ ac@@ ier and give it a hu@@ g .
these are initial mus@@ ings for this project .
women have two copies of that big X chro@@ mos@@ ome ; men have the X and , of course , that small copy of the Y.
is that a big number ?
and perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es -- decided they would want to sequence it .
in 2003 , the final version was published , and they keep working on it .
then we bring that into software and reas@@ sem@@ ble it , and tell you what the story is .
this is expected to double , triple or maybe quad@@ ru@@ ple year over year for the foreseeable future .
their mom is a very brave woman who did@@ n 't believe it ; the symptoms we@@ ren 't matching up .
( la@@ ughter ) The prospect of using the gen@@ ome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today .
do you want to see if you 're genetically compatible with your gir@@ l@@ friend ?
imagine one more thing , that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent : " would you be willing to meet your third cous@@ in ? "
now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that 's a good thing .
but a lot of people don 't love it so much .
they call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
but my idea today is not to debate whether there 's such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
the other thing about human beings is that we love to be enter@@ tained .
so to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
we went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
how did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
the Cuban Missile Crisis , J@@ F@@ K is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , ML@@ K is shot , Bob@@ by Kennedy is shot , Water@@ gate .
the 9@@ 0s -- the big bubbles of hum@@ or -- we 're watching " Friends , " " Fra@@ si@@ er , " " Che@@ ers " and " Se@@ inf@@ eld . "
three , property rights .
five , the consumer society .
you can play a game and try and think of one I 've missed at , or try and bo@@ il it down to just four , but you 'll lose .
competition means , not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500 , but within each of these units , there was competition between corporations as well as sove@@ reig@@ ns .
the ance@@ stor of the modern corporation , the City of London Corporation , existed in the 12th century .
the Ottoman Empire 's not that far from Europe , but there 's no scientific revolution there .
most people in rural North America owned some land by 1900 .
and this was another kill@@ er app -- the very opposite of a kill@@ er , because it doubled , and then more than doubled , human life expectancy .
it even did that in the European emp@@ ires .
this is the Great Recon@@ ver@@ gence , and it 's the biggest story of your lifetime .
one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it 's quite hard to transition to democracy before you 've established secure private property rights .
and third , can China do without kill@@ er app number three ?
that 's the basis for the Western model of representative government .
and I think these words really nail it : " it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
that 's not the way history works .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , a picture is not worth a thousand words .
in fact , we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
Jean @@@ -@@ @ Bap@@ ti@@ ste Michel : so how did we get to this conclusion ?
we have information about things like where was it published , who was the author , when was it published .
now Google , and J@@ on Or@@ want in particular , told us a little equation that we should learn .
( la@@ ughter ) Now again , we kind of ca@@ ved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
let me give you an example .
so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide .
EL@@ A : if you were not yet convinced , sea levels are rising , so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature .
but if you want to reach the very top , you should delay grati@@ fication and , of course , become a politician .
everyone can do it because three guys , J@@ on Or@@ want , Mat@@ t G@@ ray and Will B@@ roc@@ k@@ man over at Google , saw the prototype of the N@@ gram Vie@@ wer , and they said , " This is so fun .
this person studies all the " ar@@ gh@@ s , " from one through eight A 's .
and so while I was in the DRC , I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including Dam@@ i@@ en .
and as a marke@@ ter , I found that curious .
that 's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat .
it evol@@ ves .
an amazing fact is that , given the right environment and the right nutrients , a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever .
so cancer could be thought of as a strange , short @@@ -@@ @ lived , self @@@ -@@ @ destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end .
and when I looked at the sequence of the DNA , and compared the sequence of Jon@@ as ' tumor to that of the rest of his body , I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile .
the aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
in the 18th century , it became a ver@@ b , and it meant to sw@@ in@@ dle or ridic@@ ule or to make fun of someone .
we are called upon to serve hundreds of thousands of people .
but this was just the beginning .
but when it finally happened , I stayed on and decided to help .
she closed all the schools and universities and shut down many public events .
people were dying in the streets .
I sho@@ wered with chlorinated water , more concentrated than actually recommended .
I chlorinated my phones , my p@@ ants , my hands , my car .
those days you were alone , people were so afraid of touching anybody .
our president declared a state of emergency in August and suspended certain rights .
and the national police even supported our work during the Ebola response .
over the course of the outbreak , West Africa had almost 29@@ ,000 cases .
and that included 12 of my fine colleagues at John F. Kennedy hospital in Monrovia .
today , there are more than 17,000 survivors in West Africa .
and Philip said , " Then I saw something else .
some survivors are blind , others have neuro@@ logical disabilities .
many survivors have waited many months to undergo surgery to heal their bl@@ inding cat@@ ar@@ acts .
in 2014 , the baby of a dear friend of mine was only two months old , when both parents and child were admitted in an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia .
the only way we can defeat this pandemic is when we ensure that we win this final battle .
simply the ID that denies you health care .
of course I was .
as these conversations established common ground , especially across generations , I realized I was opening a space for people to talk about things that really mat@@ tered to them .
people are living far longer now , and for the first time in human history , it 's common for four generations to be living side by side .
and the real tragedy was , if you look through her records , she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years .
I am not a Lud@@ dite .
you might not know that Con@@ an Do@@ y@@ le went to medical school here in Edinburgh , and his character , Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes , was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell .
and Con@@ an Do@@ y@@ le , writing about Bell , described the following exchange between Bell and his students .
she says , " It was good . "
and Bell then goes on to explain to the students .
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh , except in the bo@@ tanical gardens .
and as a teacher of medicine , as a student myself , I was so inspired by that story .
the picture I 'm showing you is of Le@@ op@@ old Au@@ en@@ bru@@ gg@@ er who , in the late 17@@ 00@@ s , discovered per@@ cus@@ sion .
and La@@ en@@ ne@@ c thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abd@@ omen using what he called " the cylinder . "
but the arrival of aus@@ cul@@ tation and per@@ cus@@ sion represented a sea change , a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body .
the focus was around the patient .
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lum@@ pec@@ tomy in the town in which I lived .
and she was reluctant to tell me .
she said , " The cancer center was wonderful .
I say that because these are difficult patients .
and so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and I tried not to interrupt them .
I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence , and when the patient came for the physical , I was able to do a thorough physical , because I had nothing else to do .
now if that were true , it 's a true condemnation of our health care system , because they had been seen in other places .
the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this , but here 's what you should do , here 's what we should do . "
I took this to my colleagues at Stan@@ ford in anthro@@ pology and told them the same story .
we marry , for example , with great p@@ om@@ p and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of sol@@ itude and misery and lon@@ eliness to one of eternal bl@@ iss .
I 'm not sure why you 're laugh@@ ing .
they 're all about transformation .
I would feel the abd@@ omen .
I remember so many patients , their names still vivid on my tongue , their faces still so clear .
I remember so many huge , hol@@ low@@ ed out , ha@@ un@@ ted eyes st@@ aring up at me as I performed this ritual .
and then the next day , I would come , and I would do it again .
" I recall one patient who was at that point no more than a sk@@ elet@@ on enc@@ ased in shrinking skin , unable to speak , his mouth cru@@ sted with candi@@ da that was resistant to the usual medications .
what I want to talk about today is one idea .
you work by learning , and you learn by working .
the minister of education down south in London described himself as a " big fan . "
we think we 're onto something .
I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana , West Africa .
it was a di@@ mly lit sh@@ ack .
the firing squad aimed , fired -- the general was dead .
and I was thinking , was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity ?
and he said , " I 'm sorry , I can 't tell you . "
and nobody really knows what epidem@@ i@@ ology is .
epidem@@ i@@ ology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you .
that 's what happens in academic journals , it 's what happens at academic conferences -- the Q & amp ; A session after a post@@ doc presents data is often a blood@@ bath .
it 's a description of the changes in the behavior of one enzy@@ me when you dri@@ p a chemical extracted from some red gra@@ pe skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere .
the claim : fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children .
and so it 's no surprise that overall , industry @@@ -@@ @ funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials .
if there is publication bias , if small negative trials have gone missing in action , you can see it on one of these graphs .
in fact , 76 percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients .
this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
and he had a key insight , and that was that people riding underground in trains don 't really care what 's happening above@@ ground .
they all are part of a universal language , seemingly .
there was no easy way to make them , and it was the Americans who really mechan@@ ized the craft .
it 's an icon , it 's what people think of when they think of a pen@@ cil and what they think of when they think of school .
and the pen@@ cil 's really a thing that , I think , the average user has never thought twice about , how it 's made or why it 's made the way it is , because it 's just always been that way .
it 's perfect .
I mean , this goes back to pre @@@ -@@ @ computer versions of this on led@@ gers , where people would fill in a horizontal bar from left to right to show how much of a task they had completed at a factory .
that took five minutes .
well , now you can start trying to enhance it and make it appear to move more quickly than it really is , make it move faster at the beginning , like a burst of speed .
so the progress bar at least gives you the vision of a beginning and an end , and you 're working towards a goal .
it 's not clear what the origin of the jump rope is .
it 's their space , it 's a girl @@@ -@@ @ power space .
in some ways , the rope is the thing that helps carry it .
so , a jump rope , you can use it for all different kinds of things .
it crosses cultures .
it 's one of the most enduring designs in history .
and the way you figure that out is : the diameter of the button plus the width of the button , plus a little bit of ease .
but then fashion moved closer to the body as we discovered uses for the button .
z@@ ip@@ pers break ; Vel@@ c@@ ro makes a lot of noise , and it we@@ ars out after a while .
I did@@ n 't like it .
ris@@ er , which is the vertical element that separ@@ ates the two t@@ reads .
stairs can be made from all kinds of material .
stairs can be indo@@ ors , they can be out@@ doors .
as we move across a stair@@ way , the form dict@@ ates our pac@@ ing , our feeling , our safety and our relationship and engagement with the space around us .
the sto@@ op is a place that invites neighbors to gather , blast music , and watch the city in motion .
it 's actually remarkably easy to learn how to do .
and it 's kind of crazy to think about that now , because , like all great innovations , it 's not long after we get access to something that we start to take it for granted .
to me , it 's one of the most democratic designs ever created .
it 's like my " thing , " it 's what I 'm known for .
honestly , I did@@ n 't think about it much myself .
when I was 10 years old , there was a girl in my class at school named V@@ ick@@ y .
it do@@ es@@ n 't make it any better , does it ?
and as classes let out , I ran down the hall shou@@ ting at all the other kids , " S@@ tic@@ ky V@@ ick@@ y uses White R@@ ain sha@@ m@@ po@@ o .
I for@@ got about this memory for a long time .
( si@@ gh ) But what I quickly realized was I was@@ n 't just trying to figure out what happened to V@@ ick@@ y .
like I was better than her , and she was garbage .
what kind of a nice person does that ?
for better or for worse , we are all a product of the culture around us .
and V@@ ick@@ y 's right .
why can 't they have their own ideas and their own voice ? "
( appl@@ ause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
I was in Beijing 's bidding for the Olympic Games .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
all those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boy@@ friend , who used to be a board member in a sub@@ division of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blog .
that could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we 're in a globalized world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries .
and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they 're sick .
in urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
that ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it 's 30 to 40 years with the sky@@ roc@@ keting real estate price .
among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside , but they don 't have the sense of belonging .
and also , the bit@@ ter@@ ness and even resent@@ ment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
we heard about polluted air , polluted water , pois@@ oned food .
they have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
while young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy @@@ -@@ @ making , but sometimes they 're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
and this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a B@@ MW than smile on a bicycle .
people were don@@ ating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
and after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescu@@ ed .
and here also people are helping to find missing children .
a father posted his son 's picture onto the Internet .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
so , I have a strange career .
I know it because people come up to me , like colleagues , and say , " Chris , you have a strange career . "
later , I would work on evolutionary gene@@ tics , and I would work on systems biology .
one day , a NASA manager comes into my office , sits down and says , " Can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside Earth ? "
and I said , " What is that ? "
who on Earth would write something as con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted and complex and in@@ ane ?
and this was Ste@@ en Ras@@ mus@@ sen .
and he wrote the Ti@@ erra system , and , in my book , is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems -- except for the fact that these programs did@@ n 't really grow in complexity .
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types .
and this type of activity goes on for quite a while , until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs .
and obviously , each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
and so that 's really the only take @@@ -@@ @ home message that I have for you .
my mother dropped out of school quite early , because her mother , my grand@@ mother , could not afford her education .
and succeed where people have tried but failed .
but the fact that these problems persist and that solutions sometimes create their own problems is not a reason for us to give up or to resign .
in fact , there is fulfillment in striving , and trying to provide answers and solutions to the problem humanity faces even when the likely outcome is failure .
so why despair when the unexpected knoc@@ ks on the horizon ?
we have let this continent fl@@ oun@@ der .
and if other parts of the world have moved on , why can 't we , now ?
let 's open our hearts and minds .
did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
well I 'm here to suggest there 's a better way , that less might actually equal more .
maybe a little more time ? "
we saw all the sights , like the ge@@ y@@ sers , we stopped at the Bad@@ lands , but more than any of the places , I remember this as an adventure .
but it was@@ n 't until I got older and I learned more about the National Park System that I realized just how lucky I was .
( la@@ ughter ) No t@@ wee@@ ting .
the Department of the Interior wrote him back .
and Dr. Syl@@ via Ear@@ l has been influential , like John Mu@@ ir , with administrations -- George W. Bush and Obama were both fantastic ocean presidents , creating marine protected areas all around the country .
this is not a conservative idea or a liberal idea , it 's not even an American idea , it 's just a good idea .
there are stories of fishermen in Mexico , who used the robot to create marine protected areas where Nas@@ sau grou@@ per were spa@@ w@@ ning , to protect the future of this species .
but we need to take it a step further .
my parents are visiting here from Minnesota , and they don 't really even care about this talk , all they 're talking about is going to Mu@@ ir Woods .
perhaps it was like these to@@ dd@@ ler rules : it 's my stuff if I saw it first .
the entire pile is my stuff if I 'm building something .
and there 's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .
so it 's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials .
because after all , we 're doing above @@@ -@@ @ ground mining .
this is the last frontier of recycling .
it 's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth .
we push that material to extr@@ ud@@ ers where we mel@@ t it , push it through small die holes , make sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti @@@ -@@ @ like plastic str@@ ands .
my job depends upon it .
I spent a lot of time in those early years we@@ eping sil@@ ently in dressing rooms .
so we got some shows off the ground . we started tour@@ ing them internationally .
( music ) Ly@@ n : when I 'm making music , I feel like a pilot in the cock@@ pit flying an air@@ plane .
( music ) ( Appl@@ ause ) CH : I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today , so you could see at fir@@ s@@ th@@ and how utterly extraordinary they are .
now one day in 17@@ 72 , the prince decre@@ ed that the musicians ' families , the orchestr@@ al musicians ' families , were no longer welcome in the castle .
and they did for a total of two and a half hours a week .
and then , after 21 , they went to something called shel@@ tered workshops with men@@ ial work and earning either nothing or below minimum wage .
and so they realized that they could not be silent as things were going wrong for me in my life .
not me personally , but what was going on around me .
so my parents ban@@ ded together with other parents .
my medical exam was something completely different .
if it is , I can do that .
he did@@ n 't know that .
so -- ( Appl@@ ause ) That 's a whole other TED Talk .
we were learning from them about their activis@@ m and their ability to come together , not only to discuss problems but to discuss solutions .
so I 'd like to tell you a couple of rid@@ dles .
that was an amazing day , and the House and Senate passed the AD@@ A .
it is the first international human rights treaty fully focused on disabled people .
so what is it that we can be doing together ?
in the last 20 years , developmental science has completely over@@ turned that picture .
so half the time , she acted as if she liked the crac@@ kers and did@@ n 't like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i -- just like a baby and any other san@@ e person .
and then she would take a little bit of the crac@@ kers , and she 'd go , " e@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck , crac@@ kers .
and chick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ keys are basically as dum@@ b as dum@@ ps .
there 's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
this is Re@@ ve@@ ren@@ d Bay@@ es 's note@@ book .
so I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional prob@@ abilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works .
this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
when children do experiments we call it " getting into everything " or else " playing . "
AG : ok@@ ay , there 's his fifth hypothesis .
I don 't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
we were able to tell an alternative truth utilizing new technology , utilizing social media , particularly Twitter .
now , he had been -- he was@@ n 't a prote@@ ster , he 'd been trying to find his way home from work through the demonstrations .
but it was a social arena in which other people were gathering with a common motive .
so they were concerned that the stories we@@ ren 't quite as accurate as police were claiming them to be .
the result was putting out stories ourselves .
there was no official investigation into his death .
on the day of I@@ an Tom@@ lin@@ son 's death , he 'd been in London on business , and he 'd taken out his digital camera , and he 'd recorded this .
( people y@@ elling ) We 've slowed down the foot@@ age to show how it poses serious questions about police conduct .
I@@ an Tom@@ lin@@ son had his back to riot officers and dog hand@@ lers and was walking away from them .
here the riot officer appears to strike Tom@@ lin@@ son 's leg area with a bat@@ on .
that video was@@ n 't playing too well , but I remember when I first watched the video for myself , I 'd been in touch with this investment fund manager in New York , and I had become obs@@ essed with this story .
it was two o 'clock in the morning , I was there with an IT guy -- the video was@@ n 't coming .
we wrote , as I said before , stories -- they 're online magne@@ ts .
he realized we had an intention to tell a different version of events ; we were skep@@ tical .
could I have done something ?
they were houses being moved along , as if in the sea .
again , always very difficult to verify , but potentially , a huge layer of accountability .
that 's new for journalists .
that process of witnessing , recording and sharing is journalism .
and the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or I found something , that really fasc@@ inated me , and maybe you can remember it .
so I started to ask myself questions about it .
and the first was , I 'd ask other people : " do you like it ? " " yes . "
" why ? " and they 'd say , " Oh , it feels so natural , " or , " It 's nice . "
and so I did some experiments .
for the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ?
I don 't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it .
it 's actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
they arrive first .
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
the lady over there is actually c@@ rying , by the way .
that 's not the expression of joy .
so I 'm going to sha@@ mel@@ essly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
I mean , if I just go through some of them now -- I know about lam@@ in@@ ar flow when it comes to air @@@ -@@ @ pi@@ er@@ cing objects , and that does it consum@@ mately well , you can see it can .
the bit that you can 't see is the gen@@ ius that created this .
we have to deal with it .
so all hail to that .
you all , I guess , like me , enjoy watching a ballet dan@@ cer dance .
so is that wrong ?
but you 're a slave of that first flash .
but just go to the Web , YouTube , pull it down , " folding T @@@ -@@ @ shirt . "
only sometimes . only sometimes .
what I try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things .
they 're the things that you 'd s@@ nat@@ ch if the house was on fire .
well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
and you can see , he 's working between documents and graphics and so forth .
and he said , " I need to talk to you . "
and the 12 publishers who turned down J.@@ K. R@@ ow@@ ling 's Harry Pot@@ ter , I guess .
it occurred in 2005 , or started in 2005 .
we 're talking about changing not just what scientists do but what grant agencies do , what universities do and what governments do .
our society faces a fundamental question : what kinds of knowledge are we going to expect and incenti@@ vi@@ ze our scientists to share ?
now not all lies are harmful .
or in the case of double agents and tra@@ itors , like Robert H@@ ans@@ sen or Al@@ dr@@ ich A@@ mes , lies can betra@@ y our country , they can compromise our security , they can undermine democracy , they can cause the deaths of those that defend us .
( la@@ ughter ) L@@ ying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
now you might remember Kok@@ o .
I 'm going to show you Dom@@ ini@@ que Stra@@ uss @@@ -@@ @ Ka@@ hn with Obama who 's chat@@ tering with his fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps .
Don 't over@@ do the Bo@@ to@@ x ; nobody will think you 're honest .
so I know it 's not possible .
but I 'm happy to participate in one .
they will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is inter@@ viewing them .
they 're not proof of dec@@ eption .
and as I promised , we 're now going to look at what the truth looks like .
I 'm an artist , so I 'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art , science and culture .
the d@@ end@@ ri@@ tic pattern you see m@@ im@@ ics the growth of mush@@ room my@@ cel@@ ia , which are the equivalent of plant roots .
and I 'd like to share a 45 year @@@ -@@ @ old love story with the poor , living on less than one dollar a day .
and I wanted to give something back in my own way . "
a traditional bone set@@ ter is a professional .
you come for the money , you don 't come to B@@ are@@ foot College .

because it 's for the convenience of the child ; it 's not for the convenience of the teacher .
every five years we have an election .
( la@@ ughter ) W@@ ent to Afghanistan .
so we came up with a great solution : train grand@@ mothers .
tell a woman .
you don 't choose the written word .
those three women have trained 27 more women and solar @@@ -@@ @ electri@@ fied 100 villages in Afghanistan .
they 're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
I went to Sierra Leone , and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night -- comes across this village .
she went like a grand@@ mother and came back like a ti@@ ger .
she handled the national press , and she was a star .
they have all the solutions in the world .
something always seems to stop us .
it was taken by K@@ ev@@ in Car@@ ter who went to the Sudan to document their famine there .
it 's just wrong .
that 's what I say in my mind . and I just say " thank you , " and I go on to the next one .
but other times it gets tri@@ pped up and has you thinking it do@@ es@@ n 't understand you at all .
this way , when you have an interaction with a chat@@ bot on your phone or a voice @@@ -@@ @ based system in the car , it sounds a little more human and less cold and dis@@ join@@ ted .
and despite checking all the boxes , the dialogue lacks soul and those one @@@ -@@ @ off qu@@ ir@@ ks that make each of us who we are .
and I don 't remember exactly how it happened , but I have one rec@@ ol@@ lec@@ tion , which was pretty strong in my mind .
I thought the word " framework " was great .
he says we don 't even know how to begin to think about it .
if you ask neuro@@ scientists why is this the state of affairs , first , they 'll admit it .
another one is sometimes people say , " Bra@@ ins are so complex , it 'll take another 50 years . "
and although the brain looks very complicated , things look complicated until you understand them .
so what is the intuitive , but incorrect assumption , that 's kept us from understanding bra@@ ins ?
we experience the world through a sequence of patterns , and we store them , and we recall them .
it can attack . it can do all kinds of stuff .
first thing that happened in evolution with mammals is we started to develop a thing called the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x .
you still have that all@@ ig@@ ator brain . you do . it 's your emotional brain .
I already said the word " sentence . "
we test it by prediction : what is the next word in this ... ?
you have to make these theories very realistic in an@@ atom@@ ical terms .
it 's a memory of very high @@@ -@@ @ dimensional patterns , like the things that come from your eyes .
( la@@ ughter ) We can also do intelligent security systems .
but ultimately , the world 's the limit .
I don 't know how this will turn out .
regarding cyber@@ attacks against the American company Google .
I 'll quote General James Car@@ tw@@ right , Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who says in a report to Congress that cyber@@ attacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .
it gets even more complicated when the doctrines of use become ambiguous .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the att@@ acker , because the defender do@@ es@@ n 't know who to fight back against .
in May 2007 , Estonia was the victim of cyber@@ attacks , that damaged its communication and banking systems .
on the other hand , we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking .
this is the environment that 's being created by cyber weapons today , and historically it was the environment in Europe at the onset of World War I.
today we 're moving to a multi@@ polar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at Copenhagen .
and this coordination may become even tr@@ ick@@ ier with the introduction of cyber weapons .
recently , we 've seen the effects of cyber attacks on the business world .
and the public sector has not been immune , either .
as computer technology is becoming more powerful , the systems we use to protect our data are becoming more vulnerable .
should we start packing our digital survival gear and prepare for an upcoming data ap@@ oc@@ aly@@ pse ?
the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to make encryption stronger really intri@@ gu@@ ed me .
there 's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger .
currently , we construct encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software , so @@@ -@@ @ called pseud@@ o @@@ -@@ @ random numbers .
at my company , our quantum random number generator started life on a two meter by one meter optic table .
we assume that Dr. No is trying to h@@ ack the exchange .
luc@@ k@@ ily , Dr. No 's attempt to inter@@ cept the quantum keys while in transit will leave finger@@ prints that James and you can detect .
the internet of things is her@@ al@@ ding a hyper@@ connected era with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020 .
and specifically , I 'd like to talk with you about how Bi@@ onics is evolving for people with arm ampu@@ tations .
arm ampu@@ tation is usually caused by trauma , with things like industrial accidents , motor vehicle colli@@ sions or , very po@@ ign@@ antly , war .
here you see a patent for an arm in 1912 .
every time you contract a muscle , it em@@ its a little electricity that you can record with anten@@ na@@ e or electro@@ des and use that to operate the motorized pros@@ thesis .
you open it , these muscles contract .
so it 's intuitive , and it works pretty well .
we built our own arm at the Re@@ hab Institute of Chicago where we 've added some wr@@ ist flexi@@ on and shoulder joints to get up to six motors , or six degrees of freedom .
you touch yourself , there 's a stimulus that comes up those very same ner@@ ves back up to your brain .
and if I tap the nerve ending on a World War II vet , he 'll still feel his missing hand .
so our approach is something we call targeted rein@@ ner@@ vation .
J@@ esse came to us at the R@@ IC to be fit with these state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art devices , and here you see them .
he has not learned how to do this with the chest .
then we had one of those little surprises in science .
and after a few months , you touch J@@ esse on his chest , and he felt his missing hand .
and we 're fortunate today to have A@@ man@@ da Kitts come and join us .
( appl@@ ause ) So A@@ man@@ da , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
so for the simple little things like picking something up , I would have to bend my el@@ bow , and then I would have to co@@ contract to get it to change modes .
AK : a little slow , and it was just hard to work .
( la@@ ughter ) And here you can see , on J@@ esse 's chest , when he just tried to do three different things , you can see three different patterns .
AK : so I have the el@@ bow that goes up and down .
and in fact , it feels even heavier , because it 's not glu@@ ed on the same .
I had the key grip , I had a ch@@ uck grip , I had a power grasp and I had a fine p@@ inch .
T@@ K : that 's Cla@@ u@@ dia , and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her pros@@ thetic .
she said that when she just ran it across the table , it felt like her finger was roc@@ king .
so we 're really challenged on what we 're doing there .
so it 'll be the smallest and ligh@@ test and the s@@ mar@@ test arm ever made .
there was a computer spo@@ ok , a broken wire , a converter that spar@@ ked .
so thank you very much .
every single be@@ ad , every single colored band , represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note .
I find weather extremely fascinating .
weather is an am@@ alg@@ am of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us .
and then I compile all of these numbers on these clip@@ boards that you see here .
these clip@@ boards are filled with numbers .
I use natural re@@ ed , because natural re@@ ed has a lot of tension in it that I CA@@ N@@ NOT fully control .
what I come up with are forms like these .
so all the way around , you have a 24 @@@ -@@ @ hour timeline .
on that grid , I can then we@@ ave the high tide readings , water temperature , air temperature and Moon phases .
and musical no@@ tation allows me a more nu@@ an@@ ced way of translating information without compromising it .
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians .
you place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musical score .
you all know the truth of what I 'm going to say .
but first , see what a mis@@ erable lot we are .
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .
but if we look within our societies , there are extraordinary social gradi@@ ents in health running right across society .
this , again , is life expectancy .
a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
now I 'm going to show you what that does to our societies .
they 're all weighted equally .
it 's an extra@@ ordinarily close correlation .
it comes from the World Val@@ ues Survey .
this is mental illness .
who put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society .
it 's actually a measure of mobility based on income .
there 's more social mobility .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I 've shown you just a few things in ital@@ ics here .
I could have shown a number of other problems .
but even at the top , there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society .
we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally .
this is@@ n 't confined to these countries here , hiding a very simple demonstration .
well we 've shown you that GNP per capita do@@ es@@ n 't make any difference .
we 've got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top .
it 's a real pleasure to be here .
I last did a TED Talk I think about seven years ago or so .
and as Nor@@ den fam@@ ously says , " Before that bomb@@ sight came along , bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more . "
and the U.S. military spends 1.5 billion dollars -- billion dollars in 1940 dollars -- developing the Nor@@ den bomb@@ sight .
it 's never allowed to be photograph@@ ed .
and the Nor@@ den bomb@@ sight do@@ es@@ n 't work as well under those conditions .
it needs clou@@ dless sky to be really accurate .
it 's the dr@@ one . what is the dr@@ one ?
meanwhile , back in New York , no one told Car@@ l Nor@@ den that his bomb@@ sight was used over Hiroshima .
hor@@ sem@@ en of the A@@ poc@@ aly@@ pse that is cancer .
we have this molec@@ ule , but it 's not a pill yet .
and so I want to thank you for your participation , your collaboration and most of all , for your confidence in our ideas .
but I was also a rebel .
( la@@ ughter ) So I made series of images , cut@@ tings , and I assembled them in portfolios .
and I have a passion for images and for words .
I love od@@ di@@ ties of languages .
and everywhere I lived , I learned the languages , but never ma@@ stered them .
and my daily language is English .
( la@@ ughter ) But it 's much more connected to the Web .
here it 's " C@@ and@@ y@@ City . "
other times , it 's not even my stories .
" Re@@ ef@@ City . "
" a Web of Time . "
then I went to run 50@@ K , then 60@@ K .
and in paper@@ cutting , you have the drawing as the structure itself .
so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
it was for a merger station for emergency workers and fire@@ men .
and B@@ ron@@ x literature , it 's all about B@@ ron@@ x writers and their stories .
so I made a vegetable point of view of the growth of San Jose .
and then the fruit of the world for Sil@@ icon Valley today .
and it 's called " Se@@ eds of the Future are Plan@@ ted Today . "
it 's a story about transformation and connections .
and for other projects , like in Paris , it 's about the name of the street .
so that was a very cap@@ tive audience .
and I wanted to give them an escape .
it is a paper@@ cutting , and then after , I added color on the computer .
this , of course , is the De@@ tro@@ it that your hear about .
another De@@ tro@@ it that 's more hopeful , more innovative , and may just provide some of the answers to cities struggling to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves everywhere .
and I was@@ n 't able to see it myself until I lived there .
a city built for almost two million was down to less than 800,000 .
I grew up in a small town in Michigan , the son of a relatively blue @@@ -@@ @ coll@@ ar family .
just a 15 @@@ -@@ @ minute bike ride from the bas@@ eball stadium downtown , the neighborhood was positively rural .
what houses were left looked like card@@ board boxes left in the rain ; two @@@ -@@ @ story mon@@ stro@@ si@@ ties with wide @@@ -@@ @ open shells and mel@@ ted por@@ ches .
one of the most striking things I remember were the ro@@ se@@ bus@@ hes , forgotten and running wild over tum@@ bled @@@ -@@ @ down f@@ ences , no longer cared for by anyone .
I 'd assumed the neighborhood was dead .
it had just transformed in a way that was difficult to see if you did@@ n 't live there .
while building my house , I found something I did@@ n 't know I was looking for -- what a lot of mill@@ enn@@ ials and people who are moving back to cities are looking for .
and since 2005 , one in three houses -- think about this , please -- one in every three houses has been fore@@ closed in the city , representing a population about the size of Bu@@ ff@@ alo , New York .
we 're creating two De@@ tro@@ its , two classes of citizens , cracking the community apart .
it 's ch@@ ip@@ ping in when a small group of neighbors decides to buy back a fore@@ closed home and return the deeds to the occupants .
I live it right now in a neighborhood called Pol@@ e@@ town in one of the most mal@@ igned cities in the world .
and usually when I tell people I 'm an artist , they just look at me and say , " Do you paint ? "
so let me show you a little of that .
I 'm going to pass this onto the T@@ amp@@ a office . they 're the ones who initiated this .
by the way , you fol@@ ks know that in the United States , you can 't take photographs of federal buildings , but Google can do it for you .
and you also have to consider the state of mind you 're in when you 're doing this .
but they said , " Ok@@ ay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ? "
and there was a sincere concern there .
northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th " or whatever .
( la@@ ughter ) " I don 't want you guys to think that I 'm about to flee .
you don 't have to waste your energy or your resources .
and I 'll help you out .
well they probably have all my flight records , so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online .
and then you see , these are some of the meals that I 've been fed on the planes .
but if you can cross @@@ -@@ @ reference this with the other data , then you 're basically re@@ playing the roll of the F@@ BI agent and putting it all together .
sometimes there 's a lot of information .
so there 's multiple databases .
so there 's different categor@@ izations of meals eaten outside empty train stations , empty gas stations .
and I understand that , on an individual level , it 's purely symbolic .
so we 're creating our own archives and so on .
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now .
I think they kind of like to look at art .
and I 'm glad that we have pat@@ r@@ ons of the arts in these fields .
you said , " Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone , " but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .
it 's no different than sending a text .
I want to know if there 's a chemistry of morality .
I want to know if there was a moral molec@@ ule .
so oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in is a simple and ancient molec@@ ule found only in mammals .
so what we do in my lab is we temp@@ t people with virtue and vice by using money .
and now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?
we showed that oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in in@@ fusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent .
yes , my mom was happy about that last one .
I just found the molec@@ ule behind it .
they have many of the attributes of psych@@ opa@@ ths .
so we 've studied sexually abused women , and about half those don 't release oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in on stimulus .
so we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
( la@@ ughter ) Now think about this . it means , within our own biology , we have the y@@ in and yang of morality .
and I took blood from the bride and the gro@@ om and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the v@@ ows .
and they 're hap@@ pier because they have better relationships of all types .
Dr. Love says eight hu@@ gs a day .
it 's as if , as they were growing , they just for@@ got the tail part .
of course evolution is somewhat random , and you know , about 55 million years ago there was this rebel@@ li@@ ous little pu@@ ffer fish faction that said , oh , the hec@@ k with the coral reefs -- we 're going to head to the high seas .
and lots of generations , lots of t@@ we@@ aking and tor@@ qu@@ ing , and we turn our pu@@ ffer into the Mol@@ a .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) So being a l@@ oner is a great thing , especially in today 's seas , because schooling used to be salvation for f@@ ishes , but it 's suicide for f@@ ishes now .
and I 'm not exagg@@ erating , it is just -- and sometimes they don 't eat them , it 's just sp@@ it@@ eful .
we were served a nine @@@ -@@ @ course meal of Mol@@ a after we tag@@ ged .
as the sun comes up , you see in the blue , they start their di@@ ve .
and to me that -- I don 't think I could say it any better than the im@@ mortal B@@ ard himself : " one touch of nature makes the whole world kin . "
and sure , it may be just one big old sil@@ ly fish , but it 's helping .
within the light sport aircraft category .
so we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
now since we started Ter@@ ra@@ fu@@ g@@ ia about 6 years ago , we 've had a lot of those baby steps .
there are thousands of local air@@ strips that don 't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could .
not all species on our planet have bra@@ ins , so if we want to know what the brain is for , let 's think about why we evolved one .
we have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that 's to produce adap@@ table and complex movements .
how well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that 's what we 'd like to know .
and it sounds like an easy problem .
and I 've put the formula up there .
I 'm not going to explain what that formula is , but it 's very beautiful .
now both these sources of information carry important information .
so it 's the optimal way of combining information .
now I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't tell you all this if it was@@ n 't that a few years ago , we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills .
as we go around , we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down , but we also learn about how nois@@ y our own sen@@ sory apparatus is , and then combine those in a real Ba@@ ye@@ sian way .
I get you tapping on it , and I get me sha@@ king it , but from my senses ' point of view , that is combined together into one source of information .
because external events are actually much more behavi@@ orally relevant than feeling everything that 's going on inside my body .
and then we 're going to ask them to rate a bun@@ ch of things including tic@@ kl@@ ish@@ ness .
all we 're playing with is a temp@@ o caus@@ ality .
and based on this illustration , we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain 's making precise predictions and sub@@ tracting them off from the sens@@ ations .
and in the intervening years I had two daughters .
and so they take it in turns to apply the force they 've just experienced back and forward .
so they don 't know the rules the other person 's playing by .
so think about just a point to point movement .
now my own speci@@ ality is combining digital technology and magic .
( music ) Please .
( music ) Come on .
( music ) You heard her , go ahead .
and one day , I found myself entering through my b@@ oss ' office and qu@@ itting my job to dedicate myself to this .
I found out that it was a much more severe problem than I thought .
they are persons who are able to join letters , but they can 't , actually , understand .
50 % of the Portuguese . then we have 30 % more , those yellow ones , over there , people who get by on the daily basis .
I realized we live in an apartheid of information .
these are the renting contracts , the package leaflet of the medicines .
it 's all this . the electricity bills .
so , the first think that comes to mind is , " If literacy is down here , let 's make it rise " -- is@@ n 't it ?
so , how is this achieved ? how can you make the State and companies communicate with citizens in a language they can understand at first glance ?
for example , Sweden and the United States introduced , last year , a legislation that forces the State to communicate with people in a language they can understand .
" it would be nice if in our country there was also legislation towards that , w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't it be ? "
but the thing is : it is not applied . so , the question , the path of going through legislation , enforcing through legislation , works in those countries where laws are made to be applied .
first of all : we have to become demanding consumers and citizens .
al@@ right ? it 's easy !
and write in order to be understood . write to your grand@@ ma .
over the last hundred and fifty years or so , science has kind of blur@@ red this distinction between non @@@ -@@ @ living and living systems , and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two .
it do@@ es@@ n 't really satisfy all the requirements , it do@@ es@@ n 't have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a paras@@ ite on other living systems in order to , say , reproduce and evolve .
really what I 'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life .
and so what we do is , we start simple and we work our way up to living systems .
what that means is , I can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab , and these chemicals will start to self @@@ -@@ @ associate to form larger and larger structures .
likewise , we can work with oil and water systems .
watch when these two large proto@@ cells , the hybrid ones , f@@ use together .
so the challenge then is , throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab , and try to make some proto@@ cells with lif@@ eli@@ ke properties from this kind of pri@@ mor@@ dial o@@ o@@ ze .
I 'm going to add some resource from the left , here , that def@@ uses into the system , and you can see , they really like that .
without the Sun , there 's likely to be no life on this planet .
and so I made him a golden ty@@ pe@@ writer through which he could dispen@@ se his commands to ne@@ phe@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an email .
this is a video prototype .
and it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
and there 's no wires .
so I 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it 's much faster .
all of this happens in seconds .
the results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conserv@@ ators and researchers .
humans have long held a fasc@@ ination for the human brain .
they 're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with .
( la@@ ughter ) So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what 's called an M@@ R.
so the techn@@ ician takes the instructions .
we 've put all of that together into one thing , and I 'll show you what that synthesis looks like .
we 're just starting to look at this data ourselves .
two great examples are drugs , Pro@@ z@@ ac and Well@@ bu@@ tr@@ in .
we also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before , and we see these genes turned on there .
they look at their entire gen@@ om@@ es , and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked caus@@ ally to genes .
and so it 's very important for those researchers that we 've created this resource .
we 're similar at the genetic level .
I think these resources are incredibly valuable .
but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .
and I believe the end product of it will be entirely about engagement .
in fact , I think it is possibly a transform@@ ational change in the way we 're going to think about engagement .
it may even be subject to elimination .
so I 'm going to share them with you today , because I think collectively , we have a chance of fig@@ uring this out .
another one is Google .
now , you may not have focused on this , but index search accounted for 90 % of all search volume about 4 years ago .
( la@@ ughter ) If you look hard enough , you can find really compelling things there .
so the thing has really changed .
and you see this in mobile in particular .
if the left @@@ -@@ @ hand side of this equation is the open @@@ -@@ @ source World Wide Web , with its belief in the long tail , its belief in an absence of regulation , of an absence of security and control , it 's really a frontier .
and people have overwhel@@ mingly chosen that over Google 's vision .
over the last three years , Apple 's gone from being an also @@@ -@@ @ ran in computers to this year they will ship approximately 100 million internet @@@ -@@ @ enabled devices .
one hundred million .
it is a programming language .
and keep in mind , it was our investment that built Palm 's web@@ OS that HP 's shipping soon , eventually , some@@ day .
to borrow a phrase from Star Wars : this is not the man@@ ia you are looking for .
and then recently , we bought a satellite network .
the second signal was for everybody to do jumping j@@ acks together .
you 'll see that start right here .
a lot of them made jo@@ kes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
( appl@@ ause ) So we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
Africans , after -- they 're tired , we 're tired of being the subject of everybody 's charity and care .
( la@@ ughter ) What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
and with the support of a leader who was willing , at the time , to do the reforms , we put forward a comprehensive reform program , which we developed ourselves .
( la@@ ughter ) The s@@ mar@@ test one , first to come in , was the MT@@ N company of South Africa .
agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
there was nothing in a country of 140 million people -- no shopping m@@ alls as you know them here .
and now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this m@@ all are doing four times the turnover that they had projected .
standard Char@@ tered has brought in 140 million .
and this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year .
and the women are dil@@ igent . they are focused ; they work hard .
I remember one of the first times we were looking at coll@@ agen .
here 's a human heart at 25 days .
comment@@ ator Two : it looks like he 's stabilized .
he 's out over the channel .
and that 's the nearest thing to the dream .
B@@ G : what kind of training do you do , you personally , for that ?
B@@ G : we saw the 2009 crossing of the Gibraltar Strait where you lost control and then you di@@ ved down into the clouds and in the ocean .
it was the sea .
and you can adapt really precisely .
what 's next for you ? what 's next for J@@ et@@ man ?
I could say , " Im@@ ag@@ ine a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish wal@@ t@@ zing in a library while thinking about quantum mechanics . "
( la@@ ughter ) But now I 've just made you think it , through language .
and all the languages differ from one another in all kinds of ways .
now , this is an ancient question .
people have been spec@@ ulating about this question forever .
well , that suggests that maybe language do@@ es@@ n 't craft reality .
so let me tell you about some of my favorite examples .
these are the Ku@@ uk Tha@@ ay@@ or@@ re people .
they stay oriented better than we used to think humans could .
OK , so you can open your eyes .
when we sat people facing south , they organized time from left to right .
so , for example , if I ask you to match this number of pen@@ gu@@ ins to the same number of duc@@ ks , you would be able to do that by counting .
this is one of my favor@@ ites .
in English , quite we@@ ir@@ dly , we can even say things like , " I broke my arm . "
if it was an accident , you would use a different construction .
so , people who speak different languages will pay attention to different things , depending on what their language usually requires them to do .
so , two people watch the same event , witness the same crime , but end up rememb@@ ering different things about that event .
that means language can shape how you 're thinking about anything that can be named by a n@@ oun .
these are important things in our daily lives .
instead , we studied a little , tiny , round wor@@ m called C. eleg@@ ans , which is just about the size of a comm@@ a in a sentence .
and we were very lucky to find that mu@@ tations that damage one single gene called da@@ f @@@ -@@ @ 2 doubled the lifes@@ pan of the little wor@@ m .
but at that time , most of the mu@@ tant wor@@ ms are still alive .
and next you 're going to see the long @@@ -@@ @ lived mu@@ tant when it 's young .
now get out your hand@@ ker@@ chiefs here .
you 're going to see , in just two weeks , the normal wor@@ ms are old .
you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there .
but it 's really more like this : let 's say you 're a 30 year @@@ -@@ @ old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you 're a b@@ achelor and you 're dating people .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
part of it 's on the outside , and it 's catching the hormone as it comes by in green .
and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell .
I just told you that , if you make a mu@@ tation in the da@@ f @@@ -@@ @ 2 gene cell , that you get a recep@@ tor that do@@ es@@ n 't work as well ; the animal lives longer .
so it 's like the animal has the gri@@ m re@@ aper inside of itself , speeding up aging .
and that is the case in flies .
if you change this hormone path@@ way in flies , they live longer .
so in a da@@ f @@@ -@@ @ 2 mu@@ tant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the recep@@ tor .
and they all come and they forti@@ fy the house .
so we 've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FO@@ X@@ O cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age @@@ -@@ @ related diseases .
and I 'm really optimistic that this is going to work .
that is gone .
this is a wonderful thing .
even on my journey up here -- the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time .
if you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful .
is probably the most important video game ever made , principally because it was the first and the last time that parents , teachers and kids all agreed that a video game was awesome .
( la@@ ughter ) So , between 1987 and now , I played a lot of this game called " Civil@@ ization , " which was designed by a guy named S@@ id Me@@ ier .
and the way that Generation G is different from X , Y , and all the different generations that we may belong to , is that video games are the primary form of entertainment that Generation G is consuming .
part of the reason gam@@ ification has become such an emer@@ gent topic right now is because of Generation G 's effect on culture and society already .
most of the game mechanics are very simple : a plant grows as you drive more ecologically and with@@ ers if you don 't , like those virtual pets Tam@@ ag@@ ot@@ chi .
it turns out that we are already out of touch .
they 're the ones who had to deal with the summer of love and sex and drugs and all that kind of stuff .
we still make phone calls .
of course , it 's also true , and I 'm here to tell you : the kids are al@@ right .
two things that I did struggle with a lot growing up was one -- that my d@@ ad has been sick my whole life .
something started kind of stir@@ ring inside of me , and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't identify what it was .
but for us , it would have been in@@ san@@ e not to go .
the girl on the right , her name 's Beth@@ any B@@ yl@@ sm@@ a .
it was@@ n 't about us getting on Op@@ rah , because when I got down from their shoulders , the war had@@ n 't ended .
everybody knows it 's cool@@ er under a cloud .
these are contra@@ ils , which are artificial water clouds that are made by the passing of a jet engine .
so we already are doing solar engineering .
and that turns out to be very easy to calculate .
but it 's so little , it would be like putting a handful of chal@@ k into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain .
why is@@ n 't it taken more seriously ?
and I do worry about that .
this is certainly not a silver bullet .
and so , my partners and I , we set off on this mission to learn more , to try to do much more . so , we mobilized . we got on air@@ planes .
I mean , why would you try to refriger@@ ate a whole store ?
why does W@@ al @@@ -@@ @ M@@ art matter ? well , it 's massive .
consumers don 't really like these light bul@@ bs .
the light 's kind of funny , they won 't di@@ m , takes a while for them to start up .
at the end of our first meeting , we got together to talk about what the action items would be , how we 'd follow up .
and the result of that is , we 're going to generate 8@@ 3,000 new jobs , four billion dollars a year in annual income , and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons a year .
well , I 'll tell you -- a lot .
but I 'm really afraid we need much , much more .
it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country .
to size the problem , China 's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gig@@ at@@ ons ; the U.S. is 5.8 . business as usual means we 'll have 23 gig@@ at@@ ons from China by 2050 .
sixty @@@ -@@ @ five million years ago -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) the din@@ osa@@ urs had a bad day .
we all live here in B@@ oul@@ der .
this was 50,000 years ago , so it may have wi@@ ped out a few bu@@ ff@@ alo or ant@@ el@@ ope , or something like that out in the desert , but it probably would not have caused global devastation .
the heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it , and then the shock wave came down and knoc@@ ked down trees for hundreds of square miles .
they don 't have to do global devastation .
this is a potential threat .
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the din@@ os@@ au@@ r kill@@ er for 65 million years .
the smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years .
this is an image of an aster@@ oid that passed us in 2009 .
this is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that ble@@ w up over T@@ ung@@ us@@ ka and hit Ari@@ z@@ ona 50,000 years ago .

but if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane , I think you need to learn to live , not without regret , but with it .
so let 's start off by defining some terms .
why ?
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
we wish we 'd chosen to study a different topic .
it feels terrible . regret feels aw@@ ful .
but it turns out that regret feels aw@@ ful in four very specific and consistent ways .
when I went home that night after getting my tat@@ too , I basically stayed up all night .
and for the first several hours , there was exactly one thought in my head .
this is an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably primitive emotional response .
we just want it to van@@ ish .
make it go away . make it go away . "
so if you look at the psychological literature , these are the four consistent defining components of regret .
but I want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one .
we 're incredibly used to not having to face life 's hard realities , in a certain sense .
( la@@ ughter ) Text : Rel@@ py to all .
and this do@@ es@@ n 't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life .
I mean , even the stupid " reply all " regrets can leave us in a fit of ex@@ cruci@@ ating ag@@ ony for days .
and do you guys just want to see it ?
and as I said earlier , I 'm a perfec@@ tionist .
and I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent m@@ n@@ em@@ onic device .
he was not a political prisoner .
she said , " I have defended more than a hundred people , and I 've never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . "
she was pregnant at the time . she had cigarette burns on her . she 'd mis@@ carried .
and he said , " Ok@@ ay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . what can we do ? "
but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
and then he said , " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . "
it had everything in it . lawyers can come at the police station . it was perfect .
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
we have a program called J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ Mak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
so it 's an online contest where it 's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
but I 'm one . I can do something .
but that may not be all that 's going on .
the real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narr@@ ators , when fet@@ uses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty .
this is what happened to the children of the Dutch " Hung@@ er Winter . "
the notion that the prenatal transmission of PT@@ SD risk is adaptive is still speculative , but I find it rather po@@ ignant .
this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory , visually , of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's like the six degrees of separation , but with research .
then they submit that paper to relevant academic journals .
I don 't en@@ vision this translation to look like the six degrees of separation that I illustrated earlier .
can you imagine what that might look like ?
J@@ n : I see . and who is that ?
and without the ability to perceive pitch well , music and mel@@ ody is a very difficult thing to do -- forget about a harmony and things like that .
this impl@@ ant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth .
so for whatever reason , this impl@@ ant is not successfully stimulating aud@@ itory cor@@ tices during mel@@ ody perception .
go ahead and play that .

and at about four months old , I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss .

but although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time , they we@@ ren 't very helpful .
so as a result , I had to rely on lip reading a lot , and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't really hear what people were saying .
since then , I 've never looked back .
CL : Joseph is phenomen@@ al . he 's brilliant .
truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a co@@ ch@@ lear impl@@ ant , because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time .
you don 't actually have to hear it .
( la@@ ughter ) And it 's one of the most aw@@ ful things -- hear@@ tw@@ arming , but aw@@ ful .
you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
I believe that journalism is a public good .
so we 're going to NGOs and asking them if we can emb@@ ed in their projects .
NGOs understand the benefits of having reporters tag along on their team .
so they 're collaborating with reporters , because for many researchers , it 's difficult for them to write a simple story or a clear story .
and the benefit for reporters is that covering field research is some of the best work out there .
you not only get to cover science , but you get to meet interesting scientists , like my PhD advisor Rev@@ i S@@ ter@@ ling , she , of the magic research high tops there .
and it was a discussion with Rev@@ i that brought us to the edge of the researcher and repor@@ ter , that fu@@ zz@@ y boundary .
here 's a very classic example . this is Somalia , 1992 .
it 's a ter@@ rific story .
this also is not a research picture .
but social scientists understand that people 's time is valuable so they pay them for that time .
so while journalists are well @@@ -@@ @ placed to convey the beauty of the scientific process -- and I would add , the NGO process -- what about the war@@ ts ?
research environments and reporting trips and NGO projects are very intimate environments ; you make good friends while you 're doing good work .
the point is that you 'll want to negotiate in advance what is on the record and off the record .
that 's part of S@@ ally Str@@ u@@ thers 's famine campaign .
another set of questions is : what are the rights of these children ?
should they get paid ?
this is a for @@@ -@@ @ profit game .

it 's only 200 of us in this room .
this project started from the following realization : it turns out that approximately 200 million cap@@ t@@ ch@@ as are typed everyday by people around the world .
( la@@ ughter ) And then I started thinking , of course , we can 't just get rid of cap@@ t@@ ch@@ as , because the security of the web depends on them .
Google has one . the Internet Archive has one .
so the next time you type a CA@@ PT@@ CHA , these words that you 're typing are actually words from books that are being digi@@ tized that the computer could not recognize .
imagine you 're using the Internet and you see a CA@@ PT@@ CHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CA@@ PT@@ CHA .
so this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
so based on this question , we 've had a lot of different projects that we 've been working on .
it started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Sever@@ in H@@ acker .
( la@@ ughter ) So I posed this question to him : how can we get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free ?
first of all , translating the web .
so I would like to translate all of the web , or at least most of it , into every major language .
it was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
so what we want to do is , we want to get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free .
the first one is a lack of bil@@ ingu@@ als .
to kill two birds with one stone .
so what we 've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website -- it 's called Du@@ ol@@ ingo -- where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the web .
so people really do learn a language .
if you can see , it 's pretty much perfect .
we combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
since people are creating value while they 're learning , they don 't have to pay with their money , they pay with their time .
here 's one of our field sites , and just to give you a sense of perspective , this little blue sm@@ udge here , that 's one of my collaborators .
to put that into perspective , this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es , a mere seven million years ago .
even fossil sp@@ id@@ ers can make sil@@ k , as we can see from this impression of a spin@@ ne@@ ret on this fossil spi@@ der .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
there are several features that all these sil@@ ks have in common . they all have a common design , such as they 're all very long -- they 're sort of out@@ lan@@ dish@@ ly long compared to other proteins .
to give you an idea of what a spi@@ der sil@@ k protein looks like , this is a dra@@ g@@ line sil@@ k protein , it 's just a portion of it , from the black widow spi@@ der .
what sil@@ k bi@@ ologists do is we try to relate these sequences , these am@@ ino acid sequences , to the mechanical properties of the sil@@ k fi@@ bers .
so sil@@ k fi@@ bers vary in their strength and also their exten@@ sibility .
there 's quite a bit of variation within the fi@@ bers that an individual spi@@ der can make .
you 'll be seeing one of the most high @@@ -@@ @ performance materials known to man .
it is made out of silic@@ on .
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay , so let 's talk a little bit about ultrasound , the force of ultrasound .
but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between , because it 's a mechanical force .
and I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing .
so this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat le@@ sions in the brain is not new at all .
he failed , so he then invented the gam@@ ma@@ knife .
and I will give you several examples .
and the objective of that ?
the only hand@@ work the physician does here is moving a mouse .
there 's water in between the sk@@ ull and the trans@@ duc@@ er .
but here we can get both the an@@ atom@@ ical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .
if you do it for more than a second , it 's enough to basically destroy the proteins of the cells .
and you wonder why .
he was treated with radiation therapy , state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art radiation therapy , but it did@@ n 't help .
they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
and this is , in 2004 , the FDA has approved M@@ R @@@ -@@ @ guided focused ultra@@ sounds for the treatment of symp@@ tom@@ atic uter@@ ine fi@@ bro@@ ids .
all those tum@@ ors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent ur@@ ination .
this is a big fi@@ bro@@ id .
and in 2010 , she became a first @@@ -@@ @ time mother to a healthy baby .
in all our treatments , the patient holds a stop son@@ ication button .
there are so many decisions being made when you walk on the band@@ stand .
so for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a pal@@ ette , that s@@ ounded like this ...
( music ) So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
and at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
so it 's unpredictable . we 'll paint this pal@@ ette again .
so jazz , this band@@ stand is absolutely amazing .
( music ) It 's kind of cha@@ otic because I 'm bullying my ideas .
it 's much more organic . it 's much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
so , my normal working field is called two @@@ -@@ @ pho@@ ton poly@@ mer@@ ization .
you can do things that you CA@@ N@@ NOT see with your eyes .
what we 're trying to do , or what the next step would be , is to make bio@@ compatible poly@@ mers and maybe to write some things inside your body or inside the body of a wor@@ m , or to attach cells to our structures , and so on .
and it just depends on how big your model is .
the wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion .
a lot of us work for people ; we 're in the hands of other people .
and when I started out , I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff .
and like the play@@ w@@ right said the other day -- I could relate to him : you 're not sure .
they we@@ ren 't mistakes ; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embar@@ ras@@ sed by it .
when I came out of college , I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California , and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roof@@ s and things like that .
by saying all that , it means your work is good somehow .
if you don 't meet the budgets , you 're not going to get much work .
( la@@ ughter ) R@@ S@@ W : frank had a sort of ...
R@@ W : ... sort of had a f@@ ame . his f@@ ame was built on that in L.@@ A. for a while .
F@@ G : no . not now either .
F@@ G : I did a te@@ ap@@ ot and nobody bought it .
I asked them what kind of building it was .
and we get a lot of that .
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't have my own plane yet .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) R@@ S@@ W : once a sh@@ it , always a sh@@ it !
F@@ G : because I want to get a standing o@@ vation like everybody , so ...
all the young people , actually , from the city .
what 's he doing over there at Am@@ rap@@ ali 's house with all his 500 monks , " and so on . they were all gr@@ um@@ bling , and so they boy@@ co@@ tted him .
and we 're all still trying to , I guess we 're all trying to become TE@@ D@@ sters , if that 's a modern form of enligh@@ tenment .
because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do , a little bit tired , we do suffer .
and it 's inside and outside , self and other , and other is all very different .
and so you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it 's you versus the universe -- that 's all Buddha discovered .
too bad nobody ever wo@@ ke up to it , and they 've been trying to suppress it since then .
it should be done by fun . generosity is more fun . that 's the key .
the human being is almost out of time .
now , J@@ im 's brain is memor@@ izing the al@@ man@@ ac .
and he would have tremendous fun doing that .
they understand the value of the second life of products .
now , a landfill is basically something which is not going to go away , and it 's increasing .
it 's the idea of completely changing the way we think about waste , so waste is no longer a dirty word -- we almost remove the word " waste " completely .
all we 're looking to is resources .
even as we move towards battery @@@ -@@ @ powered cars , there are companies that claim they can recycl@@ e up to 90 percent of the 11 million tons of batteries that are going to be with us in 2020 .
these are actually bric@@ ks that are made from old demolition waste , which includes the glass , the rub@@ ble , the concrete .
if there 's a building down the block which is being demolished , are there materials there that the new building being built here can use ?
most metal smel@@ ters give off an aw@@ ful lot of carbon dioxide .
so what you can do is instead take the DNA from the spi@@ der , and put it into various different things .
what do we do with them ?
the advantage with that , of course , is that you have potentially zero loss of material resources .
again , the perfect idea of thri@@ ft .
I heard their prayer and ate their bread .
these are opium @@@ -@@ @ addic@@ ted people on the roof@@ s of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
I saw one day , the largest school in Afghanistan , a girls ' school .
but art can change the way we see the world .
the easy way is just -- I 'm pap@@ ering black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white images on walls .
and I started thinking : why I don 't take myself out of the equation and let them do it ?
Lu@@ ana : we 're just a tool for people that want to send a positive message .
once the truck is ready and running , anyone can come .
woman : Oh ye@@ ah , there 's my funny face for you .
it can be political , to bring attention to issues .
( music ) J@@ R : you do think that just p@@ asting an image up there might have no impact , but it does have an impact .
even if it 's a very small change in one person , that 's a positive change .
it 's about everyone who believes that art can change the world .
( voices overlapping ) So , my wish ... My wish ... I wish ...
they 're not reaching these remote communities .
in a country like Liberia , it could mean helping a mother get treatment for her child suffering from malaria .
so the only time you 're going to give it is in the evening time .
their ability to do that is strengthened when they 're enabled with modern technology .
woman : now , she 's saying that the child has improved and went to school today .
it 's time for technology to help re@@ inv@@ ent health care on a game @@@ -@@ @ changing scale .
but equipping 50,000 community health workers with smartphones is an extra@@ ordinarily ambitious effort , larger than what our organization alone could take on .
so that 's all very exciting , because many , many more millions of children and families are now going to have a chance of getting it , and they 're going to get it from their own neighbors .
and now , here 's my wish ...
you of course want to record maybe how thick something is , which you can 't measure from space , whether that 's soil or snow .
the reality is , there are@@ n 't enough of us scientists , we 've got to give more people opportunities to become explo@@ rers .
and I play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong with friends on Friday .
but it has a number of what look more like trails and roads .
SP : all you have to do is look at an image and look carefully , and you see that there could potentially be a new site there .
she 's able to give back and really contribute in a meaningful way .
SP : I just had to see your face and say , " Than@@ k you . "
he said , " This is a fossil . "
and we took out to the cre@@ ek and started looking for f@@ ossi@@ ls .
SP : that 's wonderful .
so Glob@@ al@@ X@@ plo@@ rer was kind of my rain@@ bow .
they 're beginning to confirm the things the crowd has found .
so , in other words , the platform works .
and the greatest story ever told is the story of our shared human journey .
in fact , medicine today is a team sport .
so let me back up a little bit .
so if you 're driving on the free@@ way and you want to know where 's the next gas station , you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .
so in surgery , it 's important to know what to cut out .
that 's a lot of people to have a lot of problems -- and this is even in so @@@ -@@ @ called nerve @@@ -@@ @ spar@@ ing surgery , which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem , and they are trying to avoid the ner@@ ves .
but I went ahead anyway .
however , we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molec@@ ule for one @@@ -@@ @ time use .
five years later , I started my organization , Ch@@ op@@ Art , which is a multidisciplinary arts organization for homeless minors .
they come to the Ch@@ op@@ Art classes every Wednesday evening .
and we continue to build .
and so to the youth out there experiencing homelessness , let me tell you , you have the power to build within you .
you have a voice through the arts that do@@ es@@ n 't judge what you 've been through .
so never stop fighting to stand in your light because even in your dar@@ k@@ est times , we see you .
I don 't know if you knew this , but you are sitting within 15 minutes of one of the largest rivers in the world : the Mississippi river .
old Man River , Big M@@ ud@@ dy .
the nitrogen and the phosph@@ orus stimulate the growth of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic plants called phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton .
as a scientist , I have access to high @@@ -@@ @ tech equipment that we can put over the side of the research vessel , and it measures oxygen and many more things .
I don 't know if you could tell that .
at the same time , Senator Olymp@@ ia S@@ no@@ we from Main@@ e was having trouble with harmful al@@ gal blo@@ oms in the Gulf of Main@@ e .
we can do better than this .
but we can do it .
I strongly believe we can translate the science , bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment .
we all want a clean environment .
and amongst our compiled results was the star@@ t@@ ling revelation that , in fact , we were losing natural capital -- the benefits that flow from nature to us .
so rainfall cycle and water regulation by rain@@ forests at an ecosystem level .
something like a billion people depend on fish , the quantity of fish in the oceans .
that 's the difference .
but that do@@ es@@ n 't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place .
but of course , if you look at exactly what those profits are , almost 8,000 of those dollars are , in fact , subsidies .
that 's not that hard .
in other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ?
can we stop this , and how ?
well I think we kind of did it at the same time , but he 's done it .
what we 're also missing is blue carbon , which , by the way , is the largest store of carbon -- more than 55 percent .
thank@@ fully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
well , aside from Mac@@ ron 's . he 's just wrong .
how widely could we spread prosperity ?
now taking the leap forward is@@ n 't that far @@@ -@@ @ fet@@ ched .
there are tons of examples that demonstrate the potential for change in Africa .
imagine your internet access went off for a day , and when it came back , it only stayed on for three hours at a time , with random 15 @@@ -@@ @ hour out@@ ages ?
films can serve as a convey@@ or belt for hope .
and film can change perspectives faster than we can build roads .
so the chips are candi@@ ed , the ground beef is made from chocolate , and the cheese is made from a sh@@ red@@ ded man@@ go sor@@ bet that gets sh@@ red@@ ded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese .
so we put this in the basement , and we got really serious about food , like serious experi@@ mentation .
as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment , it do@@ es@@ n 't matter .
HC : so this is where we step into the future and we le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g ahead .
BR : thanks , guys .
so bear with me as I take you through this journey .
I was running across the street , and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .
your a@@ or@@ ta comes up behind your heart , it 's your major ar@@ tery -- and it was se@@ vered , so my blood was g@@ ur@@ gling out of my mouth .
I had no idea what was going on , but str@@ angers intervened , kept my heart moving , beating .
and my lung collapsed , so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well , to stop that catastrophic event from happening .
but who 's counting ?
so they basically put a map up on the wall , threw a d@@ art , and it landed at a senior home , here in Col@@ or@@ ado .
and then they had to figure out : " well , she needs furniture .
my parents definitely were not fans , and I was certain that my teachers w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be either .
first , unlike their math textbooks , these com@@ ics lectures taught visually .
in a com@@ ic , past , present and future all sit side by side on the same page .
it was like I was giving them a remote control over the information .
in 1944 , the " Journal of Educational Soci@@ ology " even devoted an entire issue to this topic .
this is child psych@@ ologist Dr. Fre@@ dri@@ c W@@ er@@ th@@ am , and in 1954 , he wrote a book called " S@@ educ@@ tion of the Inno@@ cent , " where he argues that com@@ ic books cause juvenile delinquency .
( la@@ ughter ) He was wrong .
they teach visually , they give our students that remote control .
the educational potential is there just waiting to be tapped by creative people like you .
but trust me -- we have very , very little in common .
his plots are all about destruction and secrecy , whereas my plots are about creation and openness .
now , I would like to suggest to you all that g@@ ard@@ ening is a subver@@ sive activity .
( " also spr@@ ach Zar@@ a@@ thu@@ str@@ a " plays ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) So , here we are .
there 's a fundamental shift taking place .
now , you might not think in terms of oil and food as being linked , but there 's a very strong link , in fact .
it takes 10 cal@@ ories of fossil fuel energy in our highly industrialized food system in order to produce one cal@@ ori@@ e of food energy .
that 's the average amount of time the American family spends preparing , eating and cleaning up after meals per day .
and where do we go where the going gets tough ?
and we 've seen this time and time again .
that 's , in fact , my yard , and that 's how I look at it .
I mean food that is safe , food that is healthy , food that is absolutely gor@@ geous and delicious .
why not green food ?
( la@@ ughter ) So I 'm going to take you to task , guys .
so here 's the new history of ga@@ str@@ onomy .
fun@@ gi are the most destructive path@@ ogens of plants , including crops of major economic importance .
I think we would think of three main principles .
secondly , we want innovative activities , the research and development that pharmaceutical companies do , to track the diseases that are the most important , the most damaging .
a lot of money goes for lobbying politicians in order to extend patent periods -- to " ever@@ green , " as it 's called .
and finally , remember -- the entire industry is dependent for its income on one thing and one thing only : mark@@ ups .
and it 's also due , sometimes , to the fact that doctors and patients are fal@@ sely influenced by advertising campaigns of pharmaceutical companies .
so what can we do ? how can we change the system ?
I want to show you a way in which we can better incenti@@ vi@@ ze pharmaceutical innovation and the provision [ of ] medicines to poor people and rich alike .
remember that the total money that the world spends on pharmaceuticals is a trillion .
what does that mean ?
in other cases , the new product is better than the old products , and so a person gets switched over to a better product , and we pay for the impact , for the difference the new product makes .
and , of course , you look very carefully at the actual world -- this is in contrast to how medicines are today rewarded .
here , we need funding for the rewards , funding for the assessment , and in particular , we need political support to get politicians to support a pilot of that sort .
we would have no pa@@ ins , but also no jo@@ ys .
so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it .
so throughout vertebr@@ ates , the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours , which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious minds like we do .
except that they 're not as rich as ours , because they don 't have a cere@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x like we do .
and out of that came the instruments of culture -- religions , justice , trade , the arts , science , technology .
so let me start in on that problem .
what 's the potential impact on a patient 's ability to see ?
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our en@@ co@@ der and trans@@ duc@@ er .
I just wanted to say something about the standard method .
so one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is cre@@ ase them and fold them , just like paper . remember , you know , something for later .
and he 's standing on the deck of his ship , he 's talking to his first mate , and he 's saying , " Tom@@ orrow , we will sa@@ il past those rocks , and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Si@@ ren@@ s .
he thro@@ ws the first mate to the ground .
he just thinks about the here and now and the immediate grati@@ fication .
I mean , you can 't burn it ; that 's illegal .
whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one .
other conditions show people the future self .
the older face is mis@@ erable .
I was also working in the orth@@ op@@ edic center , we call it .
I felt not quite ready for that job .
it was a strange sensation .
I was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squ@@ at@@ ting in terrible conditions .
you know , when you want to forget , you don 't want to see things , so you just want to go to your room , to lock yourself inside and say , " That 's enough . "
a bomb fell not far from my car -- well , far enough , but big noise .
the cars disappeared as well .
the man was without legs and only with one arm .
behind him there was a child , his son , red in the face in an effort to push the father .
and so the following day , I went to the orth@@ op@@ edic center .
I can run , and now you can go to school .
I feel ashamed .
and then he said , " No , we can modify the work@@ bench maybe to put a special sto@@ ol , a special an@@ vil , special vice , and maybe an electric scre@@ w@@ driver . "
that 's a production line and a very fast one .
I can 't believe it . "
sometimes you see them , they look , " Oh . "
sc@@ ra@@ ps of men do not exist .
people like Mahmoud are agents of change .
so employing people , yes , but also we started programming projects of microfinance , education .
I have learned a lot from people like Na@@ j@@ m@@ ud@@ din , Mahmoud , Raf@@ i .
I have a wish , a big wish , that this way of working , this way of thinking , is going to be implemented in other countries .
I said , " No , no , no , no , we can 't . "
and then I asked the usual question : " is it a priority ?
well now you should see me .
the night before a match I 'm very nervous .
that was my story . thank you very much .
and I just finished a couple of months ago .
age not at all as path@@ ology .
I thought , " Oh my g@@ os@@ h . I 'm going to become a Cro@@ t@@ ch@@ ety old lady . "
as I slowly lost my speech , I gained my voice .
as I lost so much , I finally started to find myself . "
for me , it began as I was approaching my third act , my 60th birthday .
and you 're able to go back and forgive them .
you can work to change your relationship to your past .
but let 's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world .
what 's happening today is that the power that was enc@@ ased , held to accountability , held to the rule of law , within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage .
these live in a global space which is largely unregulated , not subject to the rule of law , and in which people may act free of constraint .
you see , our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel , the Internet , satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their po@@ ison , which is about destroying our systems and our ways .
I 'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gent@@ lemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spa@@ w@@ ning more U.@@ N. institutions .
in fact , what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
and you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China , of course , though my own guess is that China 's as@@ cent to great@@ ness is not smooth .
you know , up until now , if the West got its act together , it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world .
but that 's no longer true .
now we have to create the G20 .
let me make a prediction for you , which is probably even more star@@ t@@ ling .
of course they are , they are a mer@@ can@@ til@@ ist nation .
today in our modern world , because of the Internet , because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here , everything is connected to everything .
it 's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense .
and this tells you something very important .
you in business know that the paradigm structure of our time , ladies and gent@@ lemen , is the network .
by the way , don 't ask me about Ash@@ down 's first law and second law because I haven 't invented those yet ; it always sounds better if there 's a third law , do@@ es@@ n 't it ?
it is no longer the case .
I started with a po@@ em , I 'll end with one .
so having seen this danger to the economy , I thought , we need to find a solution to this problem .
so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole mem@@ o@@ ir can be put into six words , you don 't need more than six words for a TED Talk .
so I had to find a different method , preferably involving total str@@ angers .
I would cut my costs by 90 percent .
but it 's actually not , because there 's an example by statistics professor Hans Ros@@ ling .
and when I asked them to summarize the 10 TED Tal@@ ks at the same time , some took the easy route out .
now I had my nine groups , but , I mean , it 's already quite a reduction .
and unfortunately , when I first received the answers -- and here , you 'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed .
" m@@ ess " can be liber@@ ating , " m@@ ess " can be empowering , " m@@ ess " can be a way of drawing upon multiple strengths .
but what people wanted to say was , " My life is a journey . "
51 % wanted to turn his or her life into a story .
11 % said , " My life is a battle . " again , that is a kind of story .
8 % said , " My life is a novel . " 5 % said , " My life is a play . "
the story of Paul Re@@ ver@@ e , it 's not obvious that that is exactly the way it happened .
they connect us to other people .
so they are like a can@@ dy that we 're fed when we consume political information , when we read no@@ vels .
non @@@ -@@ @ fiction is , in a sense , the new fiction .
so what are the problems of relying too heavily on stories ?
you don 't have to read any books .
so your stories are serving too many purposes .
stories in order to work have to be simple , easily gra@@ sp@@ ed , easily told to others , easily remembered .
so stories will serve dual and conflicting purposes , and very often they will lead us a@@ stra@@ y .
why don 't these books tell us that ?
it 's because the books themselves are all about stories .
you 're like , " He@@ y , a free story ! "
story A is : " buy this car , and you will have beautiful , romantic partners and a fascinating life . "
but , say , the alternative story is : " you don 't actually need a car as nice as your income would indicate .
you can never get out of the pattern of thinking in terms of stories , but you can improve the extent to which you think in stories , and make some better decisions .
one story you might be like the story of the quest .
I 'm really not sure , and I 'm not here to tell you to burn your DVD player and throw out your Tol@@ sto@@ y .
do I really have to follow some kind of narrative ?
it 's a kind of portfolio move you make to be more do@@ g@@ matic elsewhere , right ?
( la@@ ughter ) Som@@ e@@ times , the most intellec@@ tually trust@@ worthy people are the ones who pick one area , and they are totally do@@ g@@ matic in that , so pig @@@ -@@ @ he@@ ade@@ dly unreasonable , that you think , " How can they possibly believe that ? "
this is an equipment gra@@ ve@@ yard .
now , this approach has been around for more than a century .
well , we focus on needs and people and context .
I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor 's office -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) which was between the Phy@@ si@@ cian 's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants .
well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I did@@ n 't have the equipment in my school .
but that was me years ago .
and this can be used by anyone .
and the doctor has her sit down , and he takes her peak expir@@ atory flow rate -- which is essentially her ex@@ hal@@ ation rate , or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath .
so what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right @@@ -@@ @ hand corner -- it shows Jul@@ ie 's actual peak expir@@ atory flow rate in the yellow bar .
but I want everyone here to re@@ imagine a world where instead of prescri@@ bing ster@@ oids , inhal@@ ers and medication , the doctor turns to Jul@@ ie and says , " Why don 't you go home and clean out your air filters .
clean out the air duc@@ ts in your home , in your workplace , in your school .
and if you 're remo@@ del@@ ing your house , take out all the car@@ pe@@ ting and put in hard@@ wood flo@@ oring . "
and air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asth@@ matic patients , anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general .
and I can tell you , our agenda is full .
the rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them .
they may have to be dealt with with military means , but they CA@@ N@@ NOT be solved by military means .
and we , therefore , have a problem , because they escape traditional diplomacy .
right now , the discussion goes , " Should we talk to the Muslim Bro@@ therhood ?
how will we ever be interlocutors ?
so if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be domin@@ ating the news in years to come , we will further radic@@ alization , I believe .
and I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances .
sometimes you have to .
it 's crucial to understand , I believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom @@@ -@@ @ up .
but still not wanting to believe it , I said , " Now , mal@@ ignant carcin@@ oma , you 're sure that means cancer ? "
and I was fig@@ uring out how I was going to tell my mother , who had herself had breast cancer when she was pregnant with me .
medical appointments would be scheduled during business hours , and I knew that I would need time off to recover from surgical procedures .
and while I appreciated the sentiment , I actually needed the deadlines .
and he transformed our understanding of the Moon .
in the top left @@@ -@@ @ hand corner , you 've got this yellow @@@ -@@ @ green area .
but in each one of your cells , each str@@ and of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nan@@ ometers long .
the nuclear envelope breaks down .
one set of DNA goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of DNA -- identical copies of DNA .
and then the cell spl@@ its down the middle .
it 's involved with the growing of the micro@@ tu@@ b@@ ules , and it 's able to transi@@ ently couple onto them .
and a supply of energy is the basis for all of these activities .
in the beginning of my time there in 2000 , I was very interested in communities .
but this is the kind of community I was thinking of -- a lun@@ ar community It had all of the same needs as a community on Earth would have , but it had some very unique constraints .
there 's no petroleum .
there 's no atmosphere .
for two weeks , the sun goes down , and your solar panels don 't make any energy .
at normal pressures , water will bo@@ il at 100 degrees Cel@@ sius .
so water @@@ -@@ @ cooled reactors have to run at much higher pressures than atmospheric pressure .
water @@@ -@@ @ cooled reactors have another additional challenge : they need to be near large bodies of water , where the steam they generate can be cooled and conden@@ sed .
one day , I was at a friend 's office at work , and I noticed this book on the shelf , " Flu@@ id Fuel Re@@ actors . "
I was interested and asked him if I could borrow it .
now , this was s@@ ounding pretty good to me , and I was excited about the potential of using a liquid fluoride reactor to power a lun@@ ar community .
right now , we 're burning fossil fuels because they 're easy to find and because we can .
and thor@@ ium is not a rare substance , either .
there are many sites like this one in I@@ da@@ ho , where an area the size of a football field would produce enough thor@@ ium each year to power the entire world .
using liquid fluoride thor@@ ium technology , we could move away from expensive and difficult aspects of current water @@@ -@@ @ cooled , solid @@@ -@@ @ fu@@ eled uranium nuclear power .
in response to the desperate state of affairs , the drug use , the poverty , the violence , the so@@ aring rates of HIV , Vancouver declared a public health emergency in 1997 .
after every criminal and societal sanction that we can come up with , people still use drugs , and far too many die .
the last time I looked , these drug users are our children .
no judgment , no h@@ ass@@ les , no fear , lots of profound conversation .
after eight years , the battle to close In@@ Site went all the way up to Canada 's Supreme Court .
if you live in a community with Su@@ box@@ one or meth@@ ad@@ one , you may get on a substitution program .
many people who were reliant on a steady supply of prescription drugs turned to heroin .
the results are in .
over@@ doses are un@@ common .
this year even more people will get caught up in the illegal drug trade .
at TE@@ D@@ x@@ Brussels today , we 've been looking forward to the future -- 50 years from now .
why is this ?
where is the infrastructure that creates a space for them so that they can collaborate with other great musicians ?
so , ladies and gent@@ lemen , where the hell is music in all this ?
it 's like we need some mel@@ odic Vi@@ ag@@ ra in our culture , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak did@@ n 't come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
it do@@ es@@ n 't require any special training .
we 've seen how distributed networks , big data and information can transform society .
these people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued -- they 've argued that believing in God is ak@@ in to believing in fai@@ ries and essentially that the whole thing is a chil@@ dish game .
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament . "
education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it 's also going to make us better people .
in there , we 'll find a lot of the tru@@ ths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
I 'm an independent , individual person . "
well a ser@@ mon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
and I think we need to get back to that ser@@ mon tradition .
" give us the new , " we 're always saying .
we 're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they 're so true .
we 're going to watch Elizabeth Gil@@ bert five times because what she says is so cle@@ ver , " you 'd feel che@@ ated .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
what is a calendar ?
and the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
the other thing that religions are really aware of is : speak well -- I 'm not doing a very good job of this here -- but or@@ atory , or@@ atory is absolutely key to religions .
in the secular world , you can come through the university system and be a l@@ ous@@ y speaker and still have a great career .
so if you go to an African @@@ -@@ @ American Pent@@ eco@@ st@@ alist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
all right , all right . we 're getting there . we 're getting there .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
R@@ emb@@ ran@@ dt is a propag@@ an@@ dis@@ t in the Christian view .
my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
they 're selling us shoes and cars .
and if you 're an educ@@ ator in any way , again , look at how religions are spreading ideas .
you can get shot by the hard @@@ -@@ @ headed a@@ the@@ ists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
is there an equivalent process by which there 's a sort of bridge between what you 're talking about and what you would say to them ?
AB : I would say that there are many , many gaps in secular life and these can be plug@@ ged .
one wants to say , " Non@@ sense . why not ? "
they will tap your Internet connection .
why should I worry ? because I have nothing to hide . "
now the domain name system is the thing that turns human @@@ -@@ @ readable names , like Go@@ og@@ le@@ .com , into the kinds of addresses machines expect -- 7@@ 4.@@ 12@@ 5.@@ 22@@ 6.@@ 212 .
plan B appeared in its first full @@@ -@@ @ blown form in 1998 -- something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
so this is the Internet they have in mind .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub @@@ -@@ @ choices of course .
think about your own choices .
so when I was a graduate student at Stan@@ ford University , I used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cery store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
they had 348 different kinds of j@@ am .
people are always upset when I say , " Cu@@ t . "
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice over@@ load problem , which is concre@@ tization .
I 'm going to show you one example of what I 'm talking about .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they 're hitting that default button over and over and over again .
if I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choos@@ y about choosing .
is it possible to write a piece of music that has no repetition whatsoever ?
the sound goes down , it echo@@ es back , it goes down , echo@@ es back .
the relationship between the first two notes is the same as the second two , and so forth .
if you look very carefully , you may notice that , in fact , the relationship between each pair of do@@ ts is distinct .
there was no reference .
and he relied on the mathematics of this gent@@ l@@ eman here , É@@ vari@@ ste G@@ alo@@ is .
the point when you hear this music is not that it 's supposed to be beautiful .
we had this huge client that was killing us .
we 're a software consulting firm , and we cou@@ ld@@ n 't find a very specific programming skill to help this client deploy a cutting @@@ -@@ @ edge cloud system .
we have a bun@@ ch of engineers , but none of them could please this client .
and finally , he dead@@ p@@ ans us and says , " Why don 't you send me in there ?
meanwhile , the push for S@@ TEM @@@ -@@ @ based education in this country -- science , technology , engineering , mathematics -- is fierce .
yes , our workforce needs specialized skill , but that skill requires a far less rigorous and formalized education than it did in the past .
when I hear people treat the human@@ ities as a lesser path , as the easier path .
and that next bridge I drive over or that next elevator we all jump into -- let 's make sure there 's an engineer behind it .
( appl@@ ause ) The jobs will be there .
but before I do that , we have to go over the definition of what green is , ' cause a lot of us have a different definition of it .
what does it actually mean ?
the first metric is : is it sustainable ?
ninety @@@ -@@ @ seven percent of the world 's water is sal@@ tw@@ ater .
if 9@@ 7.5 percent of the world 's water is sal@@ tw@@ ater , 2.5 percent is fresh water . less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use .
we actually have a solution for that .
and the answer is : yes .
we have a natural solution : fish .
fish waste is what we use . as a matter of fact we use freshwater Mol@@ lies , that we 've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way to sea@@ water .
and the more they go to the bathroom , the more fertilizer we get , the better off we are , believe it or not .
here 's the plant species . Sal@@ ic@@ or@@ nia vir@@ g@@ in@@ ica .
it is the highest lip@@ id content that we have , but it has a short@@ coming : it 's short .
so we are pic@@ kling pic@@ kle weed in the middle .
and last , gar@@ lic with Sal@@ ic@@ or@@ nia , which is what I like .
so , water , fuel and food .
none of this is possible without the Green@@ La@@ b team .
I say , " I 'm ok@@ ay with that , ' cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thin@@ kers , which is significant . "
so , in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food , fuel and water .
so , we have two wind turbines connected to the Green@@ La@@ b , we have four or five more hopefully coming soon .
and the reason why you see red , red and yellow , is a lot of people think NASA employees don 't work on Saturday - This is a picture taken on Saturday .
so I get a lot of questions about , " What are you doing in that lab ? "
there are also more scientific versions of this , all sorts of ways of profiling personality type , such as the M@@ yers @@@ -@@ @ Brig@@ gs tests , for example .
doing the test to find what is your learning style , what is your loving style , or what is your working style ?
either way , they have beliefs about m@@ essi@@ ah@@ s .
and I can show you what 's wrong with one click .
but what happens is these things exist , and they 're kind of all integrated , they 're over@@ lap@@ ped , they 're connected in various different ways .
we do things because of other things .
and so really , there are all these things , like beliefs , desires , sens@@ ations , experiences , they 're all related to each other , and that just is you .
in some ways , it 's a small difference from the common @@@ -@@ @ sense understanding .
now this idea , that what we are , the way to understand ourselves , is as not of some permanent being , which has experiences , but is kind of a collection of experiences , might strike you as kind of we@@ ir@@ d .
let 's take something like water .
we understand , very easily , very straight@@ for@@ war@@ dly , that water is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged .
there is no kind of center where everything happens .
there are lots of different processes in the brain , all of which operate , in a way , quite independently .
you might think that if it 's true , that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self , no permanent essence , does that mean that really , the self is an illusion ?
does it mean that we really don 't exist ?
these are the I@@ gu@@ az@@ u F@@ alls , in Argentina .
for one thing , it 's always changing .
of course the water that flows through the water@@ fall is different every single instance .
but it do@@ es@@ n 't mean that the I@@ gu@@ az@@ u F@@ alls are an illusion .
because unlike the the water@@ falls , we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree .
I 've heard some fantastic musicians this morning , and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them .
and they say they are ard@@ ent apostles of Adam Smith : competition is great , we 're all in it individually , government do@@ es@@ n 't help us .
so taking this thought experiment , I wanted to go a little bit further and suggest that these things are managed commun@@ ally , and they are taking care of scarce capital , scarce cash and scarce resources .
because typically they 've been too inefficient , inaccessible , they 've not been fast enough , they 've been quite expensive .
so all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way .
and very hard to even create this by hand .
and it 's used by aerospace and automotive .
it 's a lighter part and it uses less material waste .
they 're also now small enough to sit on a desktop .
and to get the government permissions , you read in the paper , you think it 's easy to get into Cuba everyday ?
and there are shar@@ ks .
and I gathered together , honestly , the world 's leading experts in every possible way .
( la@@ ughter ) And it 's odd , is@@ n 't it ?
you 'd think you 'd be singing Leon@@ ard Co@@ hen 's " H@@ all@@ elu@@ jah " out in the maje@@ sty of the ocean , not songs about heroin addiction in New York City .
is this an envelope we 're living inside of , or no , does it go onto in@@ fin@@ ity in both time and space ?
and when I jumped into that water , I y@@ elled in my mother 's French , " C@@ oura@@ ge ! "
and I was thinking of the hypo@@ therm@@ ia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things -- the vom@@ iting that comes from being in the sal@@ tw@@ ater .
I don 't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
evidently , a piece this big of ten@@ tac@@ le has a hundred @@@ -@@ @ thousand little bar@@ bs on it and each bar@@ b is not just stin@@ ging your skin , it 's sending a ven@@ om .
so first I feel like boiling hot oil , I 've been dipped in .
and the next thing is paralysis .
a young man on our boat is an EM@@ T . he dives in to try to help me .
he 's 29 years old , very well @@@ -@@ @ built , lean , he 's six @@@ -@@ @ foot , five , weigh@@ s 265 l@@ bs . , and he is down .
my breath is down to three brea@@ ths a minute .
and at 41 hours , this body cou@@ ld@@ n 't make it .
I 'll just swim right through them .
we 've got Ben@@ ad@@ ry@@ l on board . if I get st@@ ung , I 'll just gr@@ in and bear it .
as a matter of fact , the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in the Caribbean .
no , that 's the last swim .
but I 'm ready .
but I carried on with my work .
they put her on a ventil@@ ator .
and I was shocked and sha@@ ken to the core .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- Mrs. Dr@@ uc@@ ker , a wife , a mother and a grand@@ mother .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered , maybe I could feel better again .
he kept pointing here .
he had a potentially life @@@ -@@ @ threatening condition called ep@@ ig@@ lot@@ ti@@ tis .
I ordered a kidney X @@@ -@@ @ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a re@@ assessment of the patient noticed some ten@@ derness in the right lower quad@@ rant and called the surge@@ ons .
it 's a complete denial of mistakes .
but there are two problems with that .
they want to be able to say , " Lo@@ ok , don 't make the same mistake I did . "
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
I am a re@@ defined physician .
" know thy@@ self . "
" know thy@@ self . "
I take it from this little dic@@ tum , " K@@ now thy@@ self . "
I mean , it 's self @@@ -@@ @ awareness that separ@@ ates Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens from earlier instances of our mankind .
much of the time we 're trans@@ fixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world .
is this how we feel about the pressures of our world , that in order to get inside ourselves , you have to run for the hills ?
so my question to you is , can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape ?
can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions , " K@@ now thy@@ self ? "
this is actually a bra@@ in@@ wave sensor that 's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk .
that blue line there is my bra@@ in@@ wave .
in the first phase of development , we were really en@@ th@@ used by all the things we could control with our mind .
but we 're always interested in multi@@ ti@@ ered levels of human interaction .
we realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you .
so as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day , on the cou@@ ch in our office , the music would mel@@ low with you .
so you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their AD@@ D symptoms as they do it .
it would be like plug@@ ging into your own personal Google .
or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention , just like this .
would you make more time for those people ? would you prioritize ?
would you get a divorce ?
as I sat e@@ as@@ el @@@ -@@ @ side , watching her transform canvas after canvas , I learned that you could create your own world .
but this is the face of resilience .
six years ago , I started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict .
I set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that I thought mat@@ tered .
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from " The App@@ ren@@ tice . "
so maybe you could interview her . "
by the time we met , she had 20 employees , most of them women , who were sending their boys and their girls to school .
because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth , and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets .
now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
the women in my family are not exceptions .
together we can make certain that the so @@@ -@@ @ called exceptions begin to rule .
so at this point you 've assembled your order .
not only is this an un@@ productive way to fill orders , it also turns out to be an un@@ fulfilling way to fill orders .
well , actually it came from a bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming exercise , probably a technique that many of you use , It 's this notion of testing your ideas .
and say , labor is cheap , land is cheap .
if I need it , I 'll call you , otherwise just stand there .
that 's a very interesting , very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse .
( la@@ ughter ) So we said mobile shel@@ ving - We 'll put them on mobile shel@@ ving .
and so we got underway on that and then I 'm sitting on my cou@@ ch in 2008 .
so of course , now what became the practical reality of this idea ?
this pick worker 's life is completely different .
and we 're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse .
and all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes .
we think it 's a more fulfilling way to fill orders .
( la@@ ughter ) So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own , interesting processes and produc@@ ti@@ vities can emerge .
some chose the micro@@ scope as their instrument .
others work through the instrument of money .
I chose this instrument .
it means the Netherlands is a peaceful country .
they are oppressed .
why did I choose the gun as my instrument ?
no German soldier fell to the ground .
my father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite ri@@ ver@@ bank .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons .
the murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle A@@ ges .
or is there something else ?
it removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies .
war is simply no longer the best option , and that is why violence has decreased .
we do this in a legitim@@ ized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so .
and I hope that one day armies can be disban@@ ded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .
until that day comes , I stand for my father who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun .
I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg , when she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan .
it takes good equipment and well @@@ -@@ @ trained , dedicated soldiers .
because she makes an active contribution to a better world , just like all of us here today .
to understand how T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Fi@@ elds work , we first need to understand what are electric fields .
first of all , electric fields are not an electric current that is cour@@ sing through the tissue .
the best way to visu@@ alize an electric field is to think of gravity .
we can all picture astr@@ onau@@ ts in space .
and out in the cy@@ to@@ plas@@ mic sou@@ p we have special proteins that are required for cell division that float freely in this sou@@ p in three dimensions .
and it prevents them from forming those chains , those mit@@ otic sp@@ ind@@ les , that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells .
and we 've stained these cultures with a green flo@@ rescent dy@@ e so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains .
the one up there can 't divide at all .
we 've applied T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Fi@@ elds to over 20 different can@@ cers in the lab , and we see this effect in all of them .
now importantly , these T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Fi@@ elds have no effect on normal un@@ dividing cells .
10 years ago , Dr. Pal@@ ti founded a company called Nov@@ oc@@ ure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
and then the second group received only T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Field therapy .
what we saw in that trial is that that the life expec@@ tan@@ cies of both groups -- so the chem@@ otherapy treated group and the T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Field group -- was the same .
they had no pain , suffered none of the infections .
importantly , it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an onc@@ ology treatment a quality of life claim .
so I 'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial .
and five years ago , Robert was diagnosed with GB@@ M .
he received surgery .
a year after this treatment -- in fact , this is his baseline M@@ RI .
it do@@ es@@ n 't interfere with computers or electrical equipment .
it 's still there .
she underwent four different regimes of chem@@ otherapy over two years , none of which had an effect .
you can see the T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Field field generator , but importantly you can also see that she is living her life .
thank you .
so we were up on top of our bun@@ k beds .
and if you have children , you 've seen this hundreds of times .
and the latter won .
we had stum@@ bled across something called positive psychology , which is the reason I 'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning .
the first thing I want to do is start with a graph .
and this graph do@@ es@@ n 't even mean anything ; it 's fake data .
which is fantastic if I 'm trying to find out how many Ad@@ vil the average person should be taking -- two .
( la@@ ughter ) Which , even at Y@@ ale , is extra@@ ordinarily rare .
I applied to Harvard on a dare .
I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well , that they 'd be excited to be there .
when they 'd visit , they 'd look around , and say , " This dining hall looks like something out of H@@ og@@ wart 's . "
embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness .
and if we change it , if we change our formula for happiness and success , we can change the way that we can then affect reality .
Tuesday night it 's school violence and bullying .
and into the silence , I said , " I 'd be happy to speak at your school , but that 's not a wellness week , that 's a sickness week .
the absence of disease is not health .
and I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success , which is this : if I work harder , I 'll be more successful .
and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and back@@ wards for two reasons .
which means we can reverse the formula .
this is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi .
and what he came up with : was this guy .
when you have electricity , everything in this machine begins in the base .
essentially , to deliver an@@ esthe@@ sia , you want as pure oxygen as possible , because eventually you 're going to dil@@ ute it , essentially , with the gas .
I sh@@ ud@@ der to say simple ; it 's straightforward .
and it 's by design .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
they have a really cool an@@ esthe@@ sia simulation lab out in Balti@@ more .
so I 've talked a lot about an@@ esthe@@ sia , and I tend to do that .
who gets safe surgery and who do@@ es@@ n 't ?
thank you very much .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that 's on .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of R@@ ISC micro@@ processors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we 're used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi @@@ -@@ @ log curve .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi @@@ -@@ @ log curves .
and that 's basically what I 'm going to be talking about .
now the question that I 'd like to ask is , if you look at these expon@@ ential curves , they don 't go on forever .
if so , that means that what we 're in the middle of right now is a transition .
now in order to do that I 'm going to have to talk about a bun@@ ch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ dless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that I did just for am@@ us@@ ement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , I have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it 's right here .
( la@@ ughter ) If I had really been a eg@@ oti@@ st , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
( la@@ ughter ) So what was the next step ?
and at that stage , we have multi @@@ -@@ @ cellular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and in fact , we 're such a multi @@@ -@@ @ cellular community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
so ne@@ ur@@ ons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremend@@ ously sp@@ ed up the whole process of evolution .
it could happen in learning time scales .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
and so , in fact , what we 've done is we , humanity , have started abstr@@ acting out .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
and I say , " Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
and now let 's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
so I 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
introduce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
so I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
but they do the job .
( la@@ ughter ) I was riding in a 7@@ 47 with Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , " Oh look . look at this .
and yet , we don 't quite understand the options of it .
so it 's feeding back on itself .
and in 2017 , home ownership amongst young Austr@@ alians has fallen to the lowest level in recorded history .
so , fool@@ ish@@ ly or otherwise , I decided to build my own home .
but the pro@@ g@@ nosis was@@ n 't good there , either .
what 's more , I was dou@@ bly surprised at how vulnerable this made me feel .
and I realized what I wanted was democrati@@ zed design and construction .
and that led to me asking one very simple question : what is building a house ?
so why should your house ?
eighty @@@ -@@ @ three percent of home builders said that next to cost , environmentally friendly features were the most important things to them .
between now and 2050 , when the global population is set to move from today 's 7.6 billion to tomorrow 's 9.8 billion people , hundreds of millions of people will experience security , health and safety issues .
it 's the 21st century .
what if -- what if -- we could restore control and dignity to those individuals by giving them a home , but not just any home : their home , and a home of their design .
so for every 10 homes we build , we can build a home for someone in need .
the power in modular construction is that you can build year @@@ -@@ @ round with confidence in your costs , in your quality , and in your delivery date , in your build date .
so the other morning I went to the gro@@ cery store and an employee greeted me with a " Good morning , si@@ r , can I help you with anything ? "
I gra@@ bbed cheer@@ ios and I left the gro@@ cery store .
trust me , the discomfort can range from minor anno@@ y@@ ance to feeling physically unsafe .
and I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called " m@@ ama " or something like it did@@ n 't feel like me at all .
and I knew the idea of being a female @@@ -@@ @ born person being called " d@@ add@@ y " was going to be a harder road with a lot more uncomfortable moments .
but , before I knew it , the time had come and El@@ li@@ ot came scre@@ aming into the world , like most babies do , and my new identity as a parent began .
now one of the most common things that happens when people meet us is for people to " mom " me .
well , option one is of@@ ten@@ times the easier route .
but the discomfort is still there .
there 's no way to be sure of anyone 's reaction , and I want to be sure that fol@@ ks have good intentions , that people are good .
but despite this risk , I know as El@@ li@@ ot gets older and grows into her consciousness and language skills , if I don 't correct people , she will .
but there 's also been , in just two short years , val@@ idating and at times transformative moments on my journey as a d@@ ad and my path towards authenticity .
yes , I want a diversity of colors and toys for my child to experience .
we value femin@@ inity and mas@@ cul@@ inity while also being highly critical of it .
I had to engage with some of my most uncomfortable parts to move towards my most authentic self .
I 've always struggled with the parts of my body that can be defined as more femin@@ ine -- my chest , my hips , my voice .
if I hate or am uncomfortable with my body , how can I expect my k@@ id to love h@@ ers ?
so I talk about it more , I explore the depths of this discomfort and find language that I feel comfortable with .
I want her to see my journey towards authenticity even when it means showing her the m@@ essi@@ er parts .
Sarah was one of those fol@@ ks that took it in stri@@ de , and our subsequent visits went pretty smoothly .
but an idea is power@@ less if it stays inside of you .
you need to really ampl@@ ify that gap .
so the middle goes back and forth , it tra@@ verses between what is and what could be , what is and what could be .
so he 's definitely changed the world .
so the top right he ends with the new bl@@ iss .
and this is the shape of the " I Have a Dre@@ am " speech .
so he used the met@@ aph@@ or people were very familiar with .
this is not a sustainable model .
we need to use it as a means , not as an end .
so ep@@ il@@ ep@@ sy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
another kind of cell , head direction cells , which I did@@ n 't mention yet , they fire like a comp@@ ass according to which way you 're facing .
the one on the top right here is actually a d@@ azz@@ ling laser , intended to just blind the person moment@@ arily and dis@@ orient them .
anybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat , and just wants to get out of the way .
I was very surprised when I started to do this to see that , in fact , even the people who advocated the use of non@@ lethal weapons by the military had@@ n 't actually done that .
it was used in@@ discrimin@@ ately .
( la@@ ughter ) Or Florida : " police T@@ aser 6 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Bo@@ y at Ele@@ mentary School . "
but I 'd remind you -- I 'm talking about military uses of non@@ lethal weapons , so why is this relevant ?
we don 't want to be all the same , but we want to respect each other and understand each other .
we 're trying to be part of this global village , but at the same time we 're revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development .
and I 'm sure , although we can 't see the people in Washington , they are in the same position .
how does that impact our desert culture ?
I 'm not sure of how many of you in Washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and , the more recent , Museum of Islamic Art opened in Qatar in 2008 .
and guess what ?
no , I don 't think so .
I think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally .
art becomes a very important part of our national identity .
ask the chairpersons and CE@@ Os of So@@ the@@ by 's and Christi@@ e 's .
and why is there an upro@@ ar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum ?
she lives in New York City , but she do@@ es@@ n 't try to be a Western artist .
this institution is government @@@ -@@ @ backed and it has been the case for the past three decades .
we will open the museum in a few days , and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Air@@ ways and come and join us .
some of you might have heard of the Algerian artist B@@ aya Ma@@ hi@@ ed@@ d@@ ine , but I doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in Pic@@ as@@ so 's studio in Paris in the 19@@ 30s .
now the Doha Film Institute is an organization to teach people about film and fil@@ m@@ making .
last year we did@@ n 't have one Qatari woman fil@@ m@@ maker .
( appl@@ ause ) Now if you 'll allow me , I would love to share a one @@@ -@@ @ minute film that has proven to show that a 60 @@@ -@@ @ sec film can be as powerful as a ha@@ ik@@ u in telling a big picture .
it 's important for two things .
first , it allows us to showcase our Arab fil@@ m@@ makers and voices to one of the most cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan cities in the world , New York City .
now over and over again , people have said , " Let 's build bridges , " and frankly , I want to do more than that .
I would like break the walls of ignorance between East and West -- no , not the soft option that we have discussed before , but rather the soft power that Joseph N@@ ye has spoken about before .
they will find their way to a small refuge designed for this purpose , where they will find intense heat , fil@@ th and about enough food for two men for 10 days .
no drilling technology in the industry is capable of getting through rock that hard and that deep fast enough to save their lives .
te@@ aming is team@@ work on the fly .
sports teams work together : that magic , those game @@@ -@@ @ saving plays .
so it turns out hospitals have to be open 24 / 7 .
the average hospit@@ alized patient is seen by 60 or so different caregivers throughout his stay .
of course , in te@@ aming , the stakes are@@ n 't always life and death .
consider what it takes to create an animated film , an award @@@ -@@ @ winning animated film .
now , taking care of patients in the emergency room and designing an animated film are obviously very different work .
issues like food or water scarcity CA@@ N@@ NOT be done by individuals , even by single companies , even by single sectors .
their goal was to build a demo smart city from scratch .
OK . five years into the project , not a whole lot had happened .
and with just a very small inci@@ sion , they were able to find it through a bun@@ ch of experimental techniques .
you need psychological safety to do that .
and unfortunately , we 're hard@@ wired to think we know .
and to explain it , I 'm going to quote from the movie " The Paper Ch@@ ase . "
the professor in this famous scene , he 's welcoming the new 1@@ L class , and he says , " Lo@@ ok to your left . look to your right .
it 's me or you .
Pakistan is the sixth most popul@@ ous country in the world , with 140 million people having access to mobile technologies , and 15 percent internet penetration .
and this number do@@ es@@ n 't seem to go down with the rise of new technologies .
Pakistan is also the birth@@ place of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner , Mal@@ ala You@@ saf@@ zai .
but that 's just one aspect of Pakistan .
to get my law degree , of course , it was really difficult , and [ there were ] fro@@ w@@ ns of dis@@ approval .
( la@@ ughter ) All right .
so I 'll just give you my message up front : try not to go extin@@ c@@ t .
well that 's not true , but we 'll get to the go@@ ose in a minute .
( la@@ ughter ) And so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
and what happened , of course , is we ended up with a whole bun@@ ch of different din@@ osa@@ urs .
and in fact , he used the cas@@ so@@ w@@ ary as an example .
and it 's kind of cool -- if you look at the cas@@ so@@ w@@ ary , or any of the birds that have cre@@ sts on their heads , they grow to about 80 percent adult size before the c@@ rest starts to grow .
so it 's real easy to tell them apart .
so my students , my staff , we 've been cutting them open .
and we want to look at these three first .
but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related .
and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you 're related to your brother or your sister , you can 't do it by looking at differences .
nobody noticed the gn@@ arly stuff sort of looked alike .
but if you line them up , if you just take those three sk@@ ul@@ ls and just line them up , they line up like this .
the d@@ ome , that little d@@ ome , is growing really fast .
the sp@@ ik@@ es on the back of the Sty@@ g@@ im@@ olo@@ ch are actually resor@@ bing , which means they 're getting smaller as that d@@ ome is getting bigger .
which of course means that Sty@@ g@@ im@@ olo@@ ch and D@@ rac@@ ore@@ x are extin@@ c@@ t .
( la@@ ughter ) OK .
there 's a T@@ ric@@ er@@ at@@ ops in every museum in the world , but no one had ever collected a juvenile .
I mean , here 's Ed@@ mon@@ t@@ osa@@ ur@@ us and An@@ ato@@ tit@@ an .
so we cut into them .
it looks like it could still get bigger .
that 's a good number to go extin@@ c@@ t , I think .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you very much .
so how do you know when to switch from looking to being ready to make an offer ?
we know this because trying to find a place to live is an example of an optimal stopping problem .
( la@@ ughter ) She pointed out that I was taking the wrong approach to solving this problem -- and she later became my wife .
but thinking about the computer science of human decisions reveals that in fact , we 've got this back@@ wards .
take the example of trying to decide what restaurant to go to .
this is a problem that has a particular compu@@ tational structure .
when you 're trying to decide what restaurant to go to , the first question you should ask yourself is how much longer you 're going to be in town .
if you 're just going to be there for a short time , then you should exploit .
is it a duplicate of something that I already own ?
and there 's a certain kind of logic to this .
if it 's been a long time since you last accessed that piece of information , it 's probably going to be a long time before you 're going to need to access it again .
your wardrobe is just like the computer 's memory .
each time he 'd add a document , he 'd move what was in there along and he 'd add that document to the left @@@ -@@ @ hand side of the box .
as a result , the documents would be ordered from left to right by how recently they had been used .
before you d@@ ash home and implement this filing system -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) it 's worth recognizing that you probably already have .
you could take the 37 percent rule for finding a home as an example .
ultimately , computer science can help to make us more for@@ giving of our own limitations .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
when I say realism , I mean photo @@@ -@@ @ realism .
because , of course , it 's not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
so it 's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
and I see the same process with combining photographs .
as you can see , these images are@@ n 't really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
thank you .
growing up , I 'd always wanted to join the military .
why ? simply because I 'm deaf .
for example , after I graduated from high school , three months before 9 / 11 occurred , I went to a naval recruiting center with high hopes of joining the n@@ avy .
I 'd lec@@ tured on the Mexican @@@ -@@ @ American War .
the bell had run@@ g , and I was seated at my desk , when one of my students , who is deaf , approached me and said that he 'd like to join the military .
now , the second thing that happened , my friend had just moved to Israel .
thirdly , CS@@ UN here , my al@@ ma mat@@ er , had recently started up an Army RO@@ TC program .
RO@@ TC , which stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps , allows students working on their college maj@@ ors to concurrently participate in the RO@@ TC program .
so if one joined the army , one could commission as a second li@@ eu@@ tenant .
altogether , that 's how it trans@@ pi@@ red .
I fig@@ ured I better stand in the second line , so I could watch what the cade@@ ts were doing in the row ahead of me .
but they filled two du@@ ff@@ el bags ch@@ ock @@@ -@@ @ full of gear : hel@@ met , amm@@ o vest , sho@@ vel , sleeping bag -- the whole nine yards .
so I had to stand aside , while the others were filing toward the helicopter .
this is where my passion lies .
he teaches me all the fin@@ er points and how to execute them ideally .
he gave a talk at U@@ C@@ LA to a full house .
afterwards , I lined up to shake his hand .
he seemed a little confused and just quickly moved on to shake hands with the rest of the soldiers .
obviously , I 'm deaf , so I 'd fail a hearing test .
I could take the classes , audit them , and that 's all .
we 've taken this title of " leader " and treat it as something that one day we 're going to deserve .
inte@@ res@@ tingly , one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.
it 's the number one contamin@@ ant of groundwater , drinking water , rain water .
P@@ JC : so speaking of e@@ stro@@ gen , one of the other compounds that Ty@@ r@@ one talks about in the film is something called bis@@ phen@@ ol A , B@@ PA , which has been in the news recently .
however , if we parents are unaware , we are leaving our children to f@@ end for themselves .
for those of you who don 't know , we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
we are losing species from the Earth faster than the din@@ osa@@ urs disappeared , and leading that loss are amp@@ hibi@@ ans .
and I believe , many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline .
the evidence of that is that studies in rats , again with at@@ raz@@ ine , show that the hormone imbalance at@@ raz@@ ine generates causes abortion .
of those rats that don 't abor@@ t , at@@ raz@@ ine causes prostate disease in the pu@@ ps so the sons are born with an old man 's disease .
so the pu@@ p you see on the bottom is affected by at@@ raz@@ ine that its grand@@ mother was exposed to .
and it 's interesting when you make a film like this , because you 're stuck trying to visu@@ alize science that there 's no visu@@ alization for .
and I have to take a little bit of artistic license .
we are in effect polluting our children .
this is my toxic baby .
and perhaps it 's the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it 's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area .
and the men who actually apply at@@ raz@@ ine have even more at@@ raz@@ ine in their urine , up to levels that are 24@@ ,000 times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men .
and it 's not just at@@ raz@@ ine they 're exposed to .
and my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it 's not just about melting gl@@ aci@@ ers and ice caps , but it 's also about our children as well .
the features of an in@@ sect 's mou@@ th@@ parts can help identify which order it belongs to , while also providing clu@@ es about how it evolved and what it feeds on .
on this type of mou@@ th@@ part , the man@@ di@@ bles themselves are not actually used for eating .
( la@@ ughter ) You know , because they can 't hear the sn@@ oring anymore .
so , what 's going on when it do@@ es@@ n 't ?
they stal@@ k bl@@ iss@@ ful couples and study their every move and man@@ ner@@ ism .
and they try to pin@@ point what it is that sets them apart from their mis@@ erable neighbors and friends .
in other words , men , you might want to pick it up a not@@ ch in the domestic department .
so , what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
they actually call it the O@@ scar curse .
we produce hap@@ pier , more stable and more successful kids .
we have more sex than our supposedly sw@@ inging single friends , believe it or not .
and like I said , we have those divorced friends who may secret@@ ly or sub@@ consciously be trying to break us up .
how this happened was actually somewhat random .
as I go along my life , I look up not long later , and I see everyone I know is ho@@ oked on this thing .
and from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity , some perspective on it , I realized this seems a little bit dangerous .
I think I 'm hap@@ pier , I think I find more sustainability in my life , and I think I 've been more successful professionally because I don 't use social media .
let 's see if I could actually convince more of you that you too would be better off if you quit social media .
that 's the can@@ ary in the coal mine .
that can actually be a little bit sc@@ ary to think about .
some of you might disagree , some of you might have sca@@ thing but accurate criti@@ ques of me and my points , and of course , I welcome all negative feedback .
now people sometimes ask me questions like , " is@@ n 't it hard living with Pro@@ g@@ eria ? " or " What daily challenges of Pro@@ g@@ eria do you face ? "
so here 's a cli@@ p with me playing Spi@@ der @@@ -@@ @ Man with the Fo@@ x@@ bor@@ o High School M@@ arching B@@ and at half@@ time a couple of years ago .
so I don 't have to worry about that when I 'm feeling so good about making music .
and like anyone , my views on many things have changed , and hopefully mat@@ ured , like my potential career choice .
sometimes I fal@@ tered , I had bad days , but I realized that being brave is@@ n 't supposed to be easy .
I sur@@ round myself with people that I want to be with , and I keep moving forward .
and thick th@@ igh@@ s , you are just so sex@@ y , you can 't stop rub@@ bing each other .
I 'm going to choose to love you even though you want to take over my whole bottom half , but you 're a part of me .
I felt free once I realized I was never going to fit the narrow m@@ old that society wanted me to fit in .
because I , like you , possess a wonder@@ fully unique and diverse physi@@ que .
I really feel like we need to start looking beyond the plus size model paradig@@ ms to what it actually means to be a model in 2015 .
I was 12 years old and sc@@ ou@@ ted in a m@@ all .
I began to face my in@@ securities head on .
and instead , I was filling my life with temporary fixes .
in reality , the woman I looked up to the most was my mother .
so why would I ?
and in re@@ claiming my body as my own , I understood as a woman that I had a greater purpose .
five covers in a little over a year .
upl@@ ift the important women in your lives .
and remember this is the generation of body diversity .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , " What 's up ?
it 's a very simple thing . it 's got one kno@@ b , on / off .
but there 's another thing .
( music ) ( Heart @@@ -@@ @ beat ) We 've all got navigation controls in our car .
nobody knew where the nearest lifes@@ aving A@@ ED was to be obtained right now .
we made an application for Lay@@ ar : augmented Re@@ ality , to find these AE@@ Ds .
( la@@ ughter ) Women had been bra@@ in@@ washed and led on for so long until we had fallen victim and actually started believing in this ourselves .
I have repeatedly been questioned why I would choose to play drums instead of practicing journalism , which I studied for my under@@ graduate , which has been termed " more decent . "
inspired by the need to preserve this culture , I am teaching the significance and the importance of the drum to young boys , women and girls .
Oh yes , it 's not that easy .
they might weigh up to two tons .
they 're also harm@@ less plan@@ k@@ ton @@@ -@@ @ feeding animals .
and then they 'd to@@ w the shar@@ ks back to Pur@@ teen Harb@@ our , bo@@ il them up , use the oil .
we kill about 100 million shar@@ ks a year .
as you can see here , it pe@@ aked in the ' 50s , where they were killing 1,500 shar@@ ks a year .
there 's great concern that bas@@ king shar@@ ks are depleted all throughout the world .
so we concentrated mainly in North Don@@ eg@@ al and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active .
on Christmas , it was out on the shelf edge .
nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened .
so it does seem to be that bas@@ king shar@@ ks , for some reason , have incredibly low diversity .
and R@@ us Ho@@ el@@ z@@ el came up with an effective population size : 8,@@ 200 animals .
so Les did a fin@@ er study , and he found out it came out about 9,000 .
all it was doing was breaking my arrows , because the shar@@ k 's skin is just so strong .
he thought he 'd better do it because I never met him before ; he might lose face if he had@@ n 't done the thing I sent him .
and I thought , " He@@ y , you know , I can build on this . "
look at that lovely black shar@@ k s@@ lim@@ e .
five individual shar@@ ks were sampled using Simon 's Shar@@ k S@@ lim@@ e Sam@@ pling System .
we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples .
grab them while you can .
I remember standing on the roof of the Ministry of Justice in downtown Port @@@ -@@ @ au @@@ -@@ @ Prince .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster @@@ -@@ @ hard@@ ened veterans that Haiti was something different .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender @@@ -@@ @ based violence .
we have just published an evaluation of this program , and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable .
and 73 percent of them shared it .
right across the developing world , citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change , positive change , in their own communities .
people like Jos@@ h and Ste@@ ve are continuing to layer information upon information , real @@@ -@@ @ time information , T@@ we@@ et it and text it onto these maps for all to use .
you can find out about places of worship .
they 're showing us what can be done with mobile , digital technologies .
they 're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible .
they are telling their own story , by@@ passing the official narrative .
in Mongolia for instance , where 30 percent of the people are nomadic , SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns .
and not only is it empowering to the communities , but really importantly , this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long @@@ -@@ @ term health polic@@ es .
by 2015 , there will be three billion smartphones in the world .
they 're normally back@@ room or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strateg@@ ists .
we need people in our organizations who know what it 's like to work with big data .
we need technology as a core organizational principle .
there are no more reasons not to do it .
unfortunately , when I was there , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't find one of them , but you have the ant@@ lers as proof .
again , imagine those all back and forth there .
how large is that one portion of a mine ?
this is one of the reasons why it 's called the world 's dir@@ ti@@ est oil .
and the Ath@@ ab@@ as@@ ca River dra@@ ins downstream to a range of aboriginal communities .
and we 're replacing that with the largest industrial project in the history of the world , which is producing the most high @@@ -@@ @ carbon greenhouse @@@ -@@ @ gas emitting oil in the world .
the world does not need any more tar mines .
and the world certainly does not need the largest toxic imp@@ ound@@ ments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities .
it compromises the life and the health of some of our most under@@ privileged and vulnerable people , the aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us .
the sky is inherently democratic .
so what do we look at instead ?
and you know , that 's just simply not true .
of course , the answer is obvious if you think about it or if you look at the picture on the left , where you 're seeing the same neighborhood taken during a black@@ out versus on an ordinary night .
take a look at our planet .
or would we ?
but really what that picture shows you is that it 's not just these extreme examples , it 's anywhere that uses outdoor lighting .
when you 're out@@ doors , mostly what you care about is lighting the ground beneath you and your immediate surroundings .
one such example of this is what I 'm showing here , called " Galaxy Zo@@ o . "
we have an associated citizen science project called " Planet Hun@@ ters . "
however , it 's missing something .
so the hyper@@ b@@ ole is not actually surprising .
and the Book of Chron@@ ic@@ les , the Book of E@@ z@@ ra in the Hebrew scrip@@ tures reported in ringing terms .
and by the time of his son D@@ ari@@ us , the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control .
Je@@ ff@@ er@@ son was a great admi@@ rer -- the ideals of Cy@@ rus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state .
and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Mar@@ du@@ k .
40 years on and we 're in 1917 , and the cylinder enters a different world .
and the obvious emblem is Cy@@ rus .
to see this object in Tehran , thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it .
it was a narrative presented by the president himself .
it will appear , certainly , in many more Middle Eastern stories .
so when I heard that the translator , Greg@@ ory Rab@@ ass@@ a , had written his own book on the subject , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't wait to read it .
and also because that 's where , in terms of our own self @@@ -@@ @ interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
( la@@ ughter ) You have given birth to an ab@@ om@@ ination .
( la@@ ughter ) Not to mention what it reveals about the adult who 's speaking them .
this is a map that grows and g@@ lows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
so I 'm just going to enter in .
a child in India says , " I saw a mon@@ key today . "
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
we 're harnessing energy from the sun .
and then they fore@@ close .
I would bet many more of you in@@ sure your iPhone -- you 're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty .
no one .
so where does it take us ?
so let me divert for a second as we 're going to identify the problems , the challenges , the behavi@@ oral challenges , that prevent people from saving .
or as some economists call it , present bias .
so this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving , but end up spending .
it takes effort . you need to think .
Austria , a neighboring country , slightly similar , slightly different .
what 's the difference ?
what is the default setting if people do nothing , if they keep proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ating , if they don 't check the boxes ?
this is the notion of loss a@@ version .
you would hate to go to the ATM , take out 100 dollars and notice that you lost one of those $ 20 bills .
if you think about the problem of ban@@ anas versus choc@@ ol@@ ates , we think we 're going to eat ban@@ anas next week .
save More Tom@@ orrow makes it easy .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
saving more today is not an option .
and here are the results .
by now , about 60 percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place .
let me wrap with two key messages .
if you 're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
we 've got a lot to do , a lot to solve , also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement .
there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
he died broken by history .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grand@@ mother never let me forget his life .
for her , life had dis@@ til@@ led itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
we settled in Foot@@ sc@@ ray , a working @@@ -@@ @ class subur@@ b whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
the sm@@ ells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
grants and sponsors were sought .
in one , I was the classic Asian student , relent@@ less in the demands that I made on myself .
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the presum@@ ptions of your province .
I made the decision to move to the US after only one trip .
life had@@ n 't changed for centuries .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
so , when you leave here today , I 'm going to ask you to engage or re @@@ -@@ @ engage with some of the most important people in your lives : your brothers and sisters .
it can be a profoundly life @@@ -@@ @ affirming thing to do , even if it is@@ n 't always easy .
Bob@@ by 's own death , so similar to John 's , seems somehow fitting .
after we are born , we do whatever we can to attract the attention of our parents , determining what our strongest selling points are and marketing them fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ously .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's not parents ' fault that they harb@@ or feelings of fav@@ ori@@ tism .
and there can be self @@@ -@@ @ esteem issues associated with that , notwithstanding the fact that I 've been asked to do TED , so I feel much better about these things right now .
now , they have two areas they can attack .
the other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular , or something like that , never having actually gotten physical access to your car .
well , what if you make the car always say it 's going 20 miles an hour slower than it 's actually going ?
well , you compromise the car by a buffer over@@ flow of vulnerability in the software , something like that .
these are ones where I went to a conference , and my mind was just blown , and I said , " I have to share this with other people . "
they vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ ed people on a bus , and then they post @@@ -@@ @ processed the video .
this is what the phone looks like . it 's not really a phone .
it 's more of a two @@@ -@@ @ way radio .
the acceler@@ ometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone .
and then there 's the attack phase , where you get somebody to type something in , you don 't know what it was , but you use your model that you created in the training phase to figure out what they were typing .
it 's the Supreme Court , right ?
so they ran the Pa@@ c @@@ -@@ @ Man game .
well , I think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly . I love the next cool@@ est gad@@ get .
so we 're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bow .
and similar to " Double Rain@@ bow , " it seems to have just s@@ pro@@ u@@ ted up out of nowhere .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of " Friday " on YouTube .
there were re@@ mi@@ xes .
( la@@ ughter ) An entire re@@ mix community s@@ pro@@ u@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
thank you .
the oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet .
it involved 17 different projects around the world .
so fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day .
so it 's not all hop@@ eless .
there 's a lot of exciting things , and I 'm going to tell you a little bit about them .
so these are te@@ thered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they 're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom .
and to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool , because knowing how many fish are there is really critical .
and so from that we can produce these tracks .
and so from this we 're able to identify these blue highways , these hot spots in the ocean , that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation .
now one of the nic@@ est examples I like to cite on this is the story of two young women , high school students in New York City , who worked with the census .
the Ocean Bio@@ geographic Information System is the database for all the census data .
what I 've plo@@ tted up here is the data that we have on hand .
now what you can see is we 've sampled the area in the North Atlantic , in the North Sea in particular , and also the east coast of North America fairly well .
the cold colors , the blue and the black , show areas where we have almost no data .
so one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity ?
but there 's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things .
we 've got about 75 percent of the fish , maybe as much as 90 percent .
and so this particular bacter@@ ium is actually visible to the naked eye .
we actually don 't know .
and that 's the deep sea , that 's the environment that we consider to be among the most pris@@ tine left on Earth .
and as the oceans go so shall we .
what are the health impacts of mountain@@ top @@@ -@@ @ removal mining ?
we all know that correlation does not prove caus@@ ation .
we used the dust in laboratory experiments and found that it induced cardiovascular dysfunction in rats .
maybe so .
I 've published over 30 papers on this topic so far .
I think that is true , not only for M@@ TR but for other situations where evidence is strong and concerning but im@@ perfect .
how many lives will be lost while we wait ?
this was the sail@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
but they don 't perceive what happened before as a loss .
at the end you want to sustain mis@@ erable lef@@ to@@ vers .
they become ra@@ rer because we fish them .
we recre@@ ate the past that people CA@@ N@@ NOT con@@ ceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low .
how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Mid@@ west for example ?
( la@@ ughter ) And if you think about " Av@@ atar , " if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the P@@ oca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so touched by the imagery ?
yes , we are a brilliant and creative species , but we 've created a little too much stuff -- so much that our economy is now bigger than its host , our planet .
there are many science @@@ -@@ @ based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we 're living beyond our means .
but of course , you can 't borrow natural resources , so we 're burning through our capital , or ste@@ aling from the future .
in other words , thanks to those pes@@ ky laws of physics , when things are@@ n 't sustainable , they stop .
that the crazy idea is just that , it is crazy , and with the Earth full , it 's game over .
many of you will be thinking , but surely we can still stop this .
we tend to look at the world , not as the integrated system that it is , but as a series of individual issues .
but we see , mistakenly , each of these issues as individual problems to be solved .
I want to talk to you about fear .
but this time it 's not a ti@@ ger at the cave mouth .
yes , things will get ug@@ ly , and it will happen soon -- certainly in our lifetime -- but we are more than capable of getting through everything that 's coming .
think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done .
there 's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way .
we developed a plan called " The One Degree War Plan " -- so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required .
the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel .
we need to accept the fear and then we need to act .
I know the free market fundament@@ alists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
we can be more , we can be much more .
we can do what we need to do , but it will take every entrepreneur , every artist , every scientist , every communic@@ ator , every mother , every father , every child , every one of us .
thank you .
so let 's look at what this last century has been to see where we 're going .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,000 @@@ -@@ @ fold .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , expon@@ entially growing technologies .
now look at this curve .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
it do@@ es@@ n 't slow for any of our grand challenges .
and imagine if you would A.@@ I. ' s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
four years ago here at TED , R@@ ay Kur@@ z@@ we@@ il and I started a new university called Sing@@ ul@@ arity University .
you see , scarcity is contex@@ tual , and technology is a resource @@@ -@@ @ liber@@ ating force .
he 's the du@@ de on the left .
he invited over to dinner the king of Si@@ am .
but the King of Si@@ am , he was fed with aluminum u@@ tensi@@ ls .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and pl@@ atinum .
it 's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
do you remember when Car@@ l Sag@@ an turned the Vo@@ y@@ ager spacecraft back towards the Earth , in 1990 after it just passed Satur@@ n ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
and if that p@@ ans out , which I have every confidence it will , C@@ oca @@@ -@@ @ Col@@ a will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
and so we retrofit these with sensors and processors , and these robots can fly indo@@ ors .
I 'll tell you a little bit more about this .
so let me show you some examples of what these minimum @@@ -@@ @ sna@@ p trajec@@ tories look like .
here you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is 100 times a second .
and I told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size .
plus , the robots have to base their actions only on local information -- what they sense from their neighbors .
they 're maintaining formation .
and to fly through obstacles , they can adapt the formations on the fly .
( appl@@ ause ) So before I play this video , I want to tell you that they created it in the last three days , after getting a call from Chris .
he said that such a man would be in a lun@@ atic asylum , if he existed at all .
and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too intro@@ ver@@ ted to leave the house when he was growing up .
now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always fav@@ ored the man of action over the " man " of contempl@@ ation .
( la@@ ughter ) And that actually helped a lot .
number three : take a good look at what 's inside your own suit@@ case and why you put it there .
all right , let 's get ready for the worst TED Talk ever .
( la@@ ughter ) I mean it . we prepared 30 minutes ago .
we began feeding the people of Puerto Rico , on a Monday .
and we began making food that people could recognize , not things that come from a far@@ away place in plastic bags that you open and you CA@@ N@@ NOT even smell .
( la@@ ughter ) We began making the foods that people feel home .
people in these moments , they had this urgency of feeling they are alive , that somebody ca@@ res .
I went to FE@@ MA . they kicked me out with eight ar@@ mo@@ red guards and AK @@@ -@@ @ 47@@ s .
the entire island of Puerto Rico was the perfect delivery system .
anybody with a truck wanted to help .
we brought the first water purification system to the island of Vi@@ equ@@ es , where we could be filtering one gall@@ on per minute .
( la@@ ughter ) And then we found creative ways .
Volunteers will go to the edges of the island .
they happened in the hotel room , in the middle of the street , in the middle of the mountains .
( la@@ ughter ) Al@@ most 28 days later , more than 10 food trucks , more than 7,000 volunteers , 18 kitchens ...
( appl@@ ause ) N@@ ate Mo@@ ok : a couple of quick questions , because I think some fol@@ ks would be interested to hear .
José Andr@@ és : this is great . this is how good my talk was .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's the first talk with a follow @@@ -@@ @ up in the history of TED .
( la@@ ughter ) N@@ M : so tell us why , what were some of the challenges , and then when you noticed , they started coming to you to ask you .
J@@ a : we CA@@ N@@ NOT be asking everything from Red Cross or Sal@@ vation Army .
so yes , FE@@ MA , to a degree , was thinking about how to feed the people .
Red Cross did@@ n 't have the right answers , because Southern Baptist Church , the biggest food organization in America , my heroes , they were never called to Puerto Rico .
salvation Army came and asked me for 420 meals on a Wednesday rainy night for a local elderly shop .
so we went to a town called Mor@@ ov@@ is .
San Lo@@ ren@@ zo was critical , because the bridge was broken , and so it was an island inside the island , a little community surrounded by water .
so I picked up the phone and I called a company called B@@ on app@@ é@@ ti@@ t , Fe@@ del@@ e .
they do food for Google and for aren@@ as .
what we need to start is bringing the right expertise where the expertise is needed .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
I spend most of my time in very low @@@ -@@ @ income communities in the projects and places where there 's a great deal of hop@@ elessness .
and sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it do@@ es@@ n 't have when it do@@ es@@ n 't .
if you 're a doctor you can do some good things , but if you 're a caring doctor you can do some other things .
when I would see her as a little boy , she 'd come up to me and she 'd give me these hu@@ gs .
and an hour or two later , if I saw her , she 'd come over to me and she 'd say , " Br@@ yan , do you still feel me h@@ ug@@ ging you ? "
and if I said , " No , " she 'd assault me again , and if I said , " Yes , " she 'd leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
and my grand@@ mother was sitting across the room st@@ aring at me .
I never will forget it .
she said , " Now you make sure you don 't do that . " I said , " S@@ ure . "
and she said , " I think you 're special . "
and then she said , " I just need you to promise me three things , Br@@ yan . "
she said , " The first thing I want you to promise me is that you 'll always love your mom . "
then she said , " The second thing I want you to promise me is that you 'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . "
I had some , your sister had some . have some beer . "
I said , " No , I don 't feel right about that . y '@@ all go ahead . y '@@ all go ahead . "
( la@@ ughter ) I was devastated .
my grand@@ father was in prison during prohibition .
our system is@@ n 't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race , they 're also distorted by poverty .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
we 're looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
in many ways , we 've been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they 've committed ?
for every nine people who have been executed , we 've actually identified one innocent person who 's been ex@@ on@@ erated and released from death row .
a kind of aston@@ ishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
it 's not our struggle .
we don 't like to talk about our history .
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty .
he said , " We don 't have the death penalty in Germany .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellec@@ t as we are .
and one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Par@@ ks turned to me and she said , " Now Br@@ yan , tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is .
we 're trying to reduce the prison population .
she said , " That 's going to make you tired , tired , tired . "
it 's just taught me very simple things .
I sometimes push too hard .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
ye@@ ah , Br@@ yan , the judge has some magic power .
there was a crazy line in there about how there 's no conduct in this county , it 's all misconduct .
and the next morning , I wo@@ ke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?
and to my horror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to court .
( appl@@ ause ) A couple months went by , and I had just forgotten all about it .
I 've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
56 percent of all rape cases don 't result .
it was this mis@@ guided war on drugs .
that 's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and he orders a p@@ int , and they sit in silence for a while .
but do they call me Mac@@ Greg@@ or the pier buil@@ der ? no .
but you f@@ uck one go@@ at ... " ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Stor@@ yt@@ elling -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) is jo@@ ke telling .
we all want affir@@ mations that our lives have meaning .
we all know what it 's like to not care .
and to make it more interesting , we 'll start from the ending and we 'll go to the beginning .
and the most current story lesson that I 've had was completing the film I 've just done this year in 2012 .
it 's the pu@@ rest form of cin@@ ematic stor@@ yt@@ elling .
we 're compelled to de@@ duce and to deduc@@ t , because that 's what we do in real life .
and we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two .
I don 't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science , it 's not .
and the idea is that the character has an inner motor , a dominant , un@@ conscious goal that they 're striving for , an itch that they can 't scratch .
she gave a wonderful example of Michael Cor@@ le@@ one , Al Pac@@ ino 's character in " The God@@ father , " and that probably his spine was to please his father .
and it 's something that always drove all his choices .
so we 're all learning all the time .
and they were : no songs , no " I want " moment , no happy village , no love story .
as : so how do you make a sel@@ fish character lik@@ able ?
after that , all bets are off .
and that was the year that they restored and re @@@ -@@ @ released " Law@@ rence of Arabia . "
yet , on the surface it just seemed to be depic@@ ting his historical line@@ age of what went on .
yet , there was something more being said . what exactly was it ?
cycl@@ ist : who are you ?
everything Law@@ rence did in that movie was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world .
when I was five , I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient that I feel a story should have , but is rarely invoked .
come on . get up .
and when the doctor took a look at this yellow k@@ id with black teeth , he looked straight at my mom and said , " He 's not going to live . "
and many blood trans@@ fu@@ sions later , I lived , and that made me special .
use what you know . draw from it .
it do@@ es@@ n 't always mean plot or fact .
and what would you do if you knew what I know ?
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Ven@@ us .
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president 's climate task force .
over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies , while still research@@ ing the physics of climate change .
it will occur without adding any more greenhouse g@@ asses .
the deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate , and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet .
this imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
but that lag is exactly what is expected .
small changes in Earth 's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth .
shrinking ice sheets make the planet dar@@ ker , so it absor@@ bs more sunlight and becomes war@@ mer .
a war@@ mer ocean releases CO2 , just as a warm C@@ oca @@@ -@@ @ Col@@ a does .
and more CO2 causes more warming .
what sea level rise can we look forward to ?
the last time CO2 was 390 ppm , today 's value , sea level was higher by at least 15 meters , 50 feet .
hundreds of New Orleans @@@ -@@ @ like deva@@ stations around the world .
this path , if continued , guarantees that we will pass ti@@ pping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations .
if we had started in 2005 , it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
and that 's important .
so Scot@@ t gets this call .
turned tra@@ sh@@ can on its side . walked home .
good@@ night sweet op@@ os@@ sum . "
and I don 't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
so that 's Occup@@ y@@ the@@ SEC movement has done .
and we 're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
it might take a moment to load .
( la@@ ughter ) Solar technology is ...
Oh , that 's all my time ?
ok@@ ay . thank you very much .
it won 't just come to you .
WG : first , the heart gap .
and H@@ arri@@ et Tu@@ b@@ man and Rosa Par@@ ks .
we can 't ignore the stat@@ s , either .
WG : to be racially literate -- P@@ V : to understand who we are so that we can heal together -- WG : we CA@@ N@@ NOT neglect the heart -- P@@ V : or the mind .
and that is who you are . "
WG : these are just parts of a few stories .
WG : so we have a lot to listen to .
P@@ V : and a lot to learn .
P@@ V : a new shared culture of mutual suffering and celebration .
( both ) Let 's all get to work .
the small things we make can work to reinforce our assumptions about the world .
or small things can come out of left field and draw us into re@@ assessing our complac@@ ent expectations about reality .
because then , these small things act as sort of a humble back door into understanding a reality that 's in@@ finitely surprising .
this is a dum@@ b game , but it underscores a belief I have , that the world is full of order that do@@ es@@ n 't necessarily deserve our respect .
I think that the moment we realize this is the moment we become creative people , because it promp@@ ts us to m@@ ess things up and do something better with the basic pieces of experience .
this first project is a holiday card I made for my friends .
and I did that through a holiday card , of course .
so when you first pick it up , while fl@@ op@@ py , it 's clear it wants to bend in all of these certain ways .
and as you can see , it 's a story about itself .
and it begins life as a humble piece of paper that came out of my ink@@ jet printer .
in a sense , that project was all about ritual becoming empty gesture .
and it speaks to the fact that the more an experience repe@@ ats itself , the less it means -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) because we begin to take it for granted .
so while paper does have all of these aston@@ ishing , overlooked capabilities , it takes a hell of a lot of intervention into getting us to see it as new again .
so it was a really good excuse to push the boundaries of this format .
and as far as how to push it , the facts of our shared history made it clear that this card should be about music .
and I remembered this episode that demonstrated sound is physical , with this simple experiment .
meanwhile , Mike and Karen were recording a song , which they had ma@@ stered to a clear fl@@ ex@@ i disc .
( la@@ ughter ) And I was excited that we uncovered this hidden talent of paper in the process .
we have assumptions about material experience , like that paper should be silent or that websites should be flat .
but we also have these assumptions -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) that should be a lot sc@@ ari@@ er in a democracy , because they 're like these little thought loop@@ holes .
and this next project demonstrates just that .
( la@@ ughter ) Spec@@ ific@@ ally : what if some crazy person had me@@ ticul@@ ously recre@@ ated a typical paper depic@@ ting an alternate reality ?
we did@@ n 't ask anyone for permission , we just did it .
years before Occup@@ y Wall Street , we put in a maximum wage law -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) to end the g@@ in@@ or@@ mous wage inequities between the lowest and highest income ear@@ ners .
so then students would know how their government works again .
there 's a very important difference between these two papers .
and Daniel Dun@@ nam , my other half , and I formed the beli@@ ev@@ ability team .
( la@@ ughter ) And we do this through the vocabulary of their own advertising .
that would be awesome , right ?
more nef@@ arious are companies like De Be@@ ers , who are making amen@@ ds for their sale of blood diamonds by don@@ ating pros@@ the@@ tics to war @@@ -@@ @ torn African countries .
and this is our take on a used car deal@@ ership ad .
( la@@ ughter ) And here 's my favorite , Dr. Z@@ iz@@ m@@ or , who is giving you a beautiful , clear conscience .
they can heal and they can kill ...
they don 't belong .
but where are the words to stop this ?
but I believe , truly , we have to keep trying .
we san@@ g songs , we played everywhere and ate lunch .
one night , my mom and d@@ ad came .
they had this strange look when they wo@@ ke us .
I had no idea which direction was home .
and a master at getting things done .
in 2006 , after 12 years being separated away from my family , and then seven years knowing that they were dead and them thinking that we were dead , we re@@ united ...
who are we in our breath ?
who are we in our heart@@ beat ?
I want to discuss with you this afternoon why you 're going to fail to have a great career .
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career .
you 're going to fail , too .
and then , of course , another excuse : " well , I would do this , I would do this , but , but -- well , after all , I 'm not we@@ ir@@ d .
I 'm not prepared to pursue my passion , so I know what I 'm going to do , because I have a solution .
it 's the one Mom@@ my and D@@ add@@ y told me about .
you know what ? here 's a little secret : you want to work ? you want to work really , really , really hard ?
the world will give you the opportunity to work really , really , really , really hard .
I love you more than Mary , J@@ ane , Su@@ si@@ e , Pen@@ el@@ ope , In@@ grid , Ger@@ tr@@ ude , Gre@@ tel -- I was on a German exchange program then .

although , he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed , it was perhaps not necessary to enum@@ erate all of the women he had audi@@ tioned for the part .
( la@@ ughter ) Vel@@ c@@ ro , indeed !
I want to be a great friend .
do you really think it 's appropriate that you should actually take children and use them as a shield ?
but then , you were born . "
so what if we do an experiment ?
( la@@ ughter ) So you see what 's moving . it 's moving on the bass .
will robots become conscious one day ?
I mean , first of all , the 100 billion gal@@ ax@@ ies within range of our teles@@ cop@@ es are probably a min@@ us@@ cul@@ e fraction of the total .
but why don 't we see any evidence of it ?
and it 's the crazy possibilities , the unanswered questions , that pull us forward .
every time we go to the bottom of the sea , we explore with our sub@@ mar@@ ines , with our robots , we see something that 's usually surprising , sometimes it 's star@@ t@@ ling and sometimes revolutionary .
they 're being wheeled out onto deck .
they 're absolutely some of the cool@@ est creatures on Earth .
look at that thing , just fla@@ iling his arms around .
that 's like a little lob@@ ster .

this ship , " The Ship of Dre@@ ams " -- a hundred years ago this coming April , this ship was supposed to show up in New York .
so if we think a male contraceptive would be useful , the next question is : how do we go about developing one ?
the vitamin A that we ing@@ est is converted by a family of enzy@@ mes to something called re@@ tin@@ o@@ ic acid .
in the last several years , two groups have introduced home sperm @@@ -@@ @ testing devices that are iPhone @@@ -@@ @ based and that are easy to use .
things stick around for years sometimes before you understand why you 're interested in them , before you understand their import to you .
I should tell you -- the idea that Christop@@ her Colum@@ bus discovered that the world is s@@ pher@@ ical is total bull .
so he understood that the sun was directly above the city of Sw@@ en@@ et , because looking down a well , it was a straight line all the way down the well , right past the guy 's head up to the sun .
( la@@ ughter ) The road between Sw@@ en@@ et and Alexand@@ ria was a road of commerce , and commerce needed to know how long it took to get there .
and he was familiar with Galileo 's experiments in trying to determine whether or not light had a speed .
Galileo had worked out this really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp , each one of them was holding a lamp .
Galileo would open his lamp , and his assistant would open his .
they just knew their timing .
but light was too fast for Galileo .
why is that ?
it 's actually hitting a tooth .
what happens when you look at what the disco@@ ve@@ rers were thinking about when they made their discoveries , is you understand that they are not so different from us .
please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person .
let 's see , I 'd say about three or four percent .
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference .
ok@@ ay , that 's the majority .
my Talk today is about self @@@ -@@ @ trans@@ cend@@ ence .
now it 's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete met@@ aph@@ or .
in 19@@ 02 , the great American psych@@ ologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience .
he quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences .
and here 's what Bra@@ d@@ ley said about it .
the world 's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the stair@@ case .
others overcome their self at ra@@ ves .
but really the way to think about this is as multi@@ level selection .
it 's not that hard a problem .
and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new super@@ organisms .
in fact , often , as we 've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revol@@ ts , often those divisions are along religious lines .
nonetheless , when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement , they can move mountains .
one of the most common is climbing the secret stair@@ case and losing ourselves .
this is why politics is so tribal .
because human beings are , to some extent , hi@@ vis@@ h creatures like be@@ es .
nowadays we fly around like individual be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our freedom .
but sometimes we wonder : is this all there is ?
what should I do with my life ?
come , have a seat in my home entertainment center .
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia .
they 're all searching for their stair@@ case .
every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . "
when you think about it , we 're so constrained by browsing the Web , rememb@@ ering UR@@ Ls , saving favor@@ ites .
the poor PC guy . they 're duc@@ t tap@@ ing his head . they 're just wrap@@ ping it on him .
well , a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team .
( la@@ ughter ) . so they 've got a little bit of a si@@ bling rival@@ ry thing going on here .
we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities , and that 's how we 're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream .
we think about the user interface .
what we 're doing is -- people like this a lot , this bird 's eye imagery we work with . it 's this high resolution data .
but what we 've found is they like the flu@@ idity of the 3 @@@ -@@ @ D model .
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles .
and I think some dis@@ passionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
but it 's also a morally important one .
because this is@@ n 't just the hypo@@ the@@ tical retail value of some pir@@ ated movies that we 're talking about , but this is actual economic losses .
this is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops , as well as wheat , tobacco , rice , sor@@ gh@@ um -- whatever sor@@ gh@@ um is -- losing sor@@ gh@@ um .
now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since N@@ ap@@ ster first came on the scene .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's true .
now when this law first passed , the world 's ho@@ tt@@ est MP3 player could hold just 10 songs .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs , which is to say eight billion dollars @@@ -@@ @ worth of stolen media .
( appl@@ ause ) Or about 7@@ 5,000 jobs .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Now you might find copyright math strange , but that 's because it 's a field that 's best left to experts .
but it was great . "
and I said , " Let me ask you something . "
" if 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . "
( la@@ ughter ) I had no contingency plan for four million .
( la@@ ughter ) And my life did end when that happened .
there 's two things that I 've learned in the last year .
one of the we@@ ir@@ d things that 's happened is , after the TED explosion , I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to For@@ tune 500 companies .
and so many of the calls went like this , " Dr. Brown , we loved your TED talk .
this is mostly , to be honest with you , from the business sector : innovation , creativity and change .
( la@@ ughter ) So let me go on the record and say , vulnerability is the birth@@ place of innovation , creativity and change .
there 's nothing more vulnerable than that .
and I 'm going to be really honest with you .
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
I turn around , I go , " H@@ i . "
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And she looks back and does this , " I know . "
and we 're going to walk in .
we heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country , and I think globally , around race , right ?
and he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for an@@ emia , because people were dying unnecessarily .
I know those things that happened to you growing up .
us .
how many of you , if you did something that was hur@@ tful to me , would be willing to say , " I 'm sorry . I made a mistake ? "
guilt , in@@ vers@@ ely correlated with those things .
which means , yes , I have a little shame ; no , I 'm a soci@@ op@@ ath .
and don 't tell me it 's from the guys and the coaches and the d@@ ads .
( la@@ ughter ) But he really list@@ ens -- because that 's all we need -- I 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work .
he asked , what do women need to do to conform to female norms ?
if we 're going to find our way back to each other , we have to understand and know em@@ pa@@ thy , because em@@ pa@@ thy 's the anti@@ do@@ te to shame .
if you put the same amount in a Pe@@ tr@@ i dish and dou@@ se it with em@@ pa@@ thy , it can 't survive .
it 's not a profound philosophy , but it works for us .
so we sc@@ rap@@ ped that in the new design process , and we start with the person .
the resulting parts recre@@ ated his shape and deliberately had an aesthetic that look like sporting gear .
De@@ bor@@ ah wanted her curves back , but she also just wanted what came out of it to be really sex@@ y , which is great for us to hear .
we switched things over .
we try to capture as much of somebody 's personality as we can .
he 's kind of a classic , tim@@ eless @@@ -@@ @ type personality , so we did H@@ err@@ ing@@ bone t@@ weed , but in pol@@ ished nickel .
people don 't think about that all the time , but yes , throw it in the dishwasher , it works just great .
or , we up@@ ped the quality of the materials and created this for John .
he 's never heard that in his life .
you look up , half @@@ -@@ @ er@@ ased chal@@ k@@ board , you can see that perfectly written cur@@ sive alphabet , the pull @@@ -@@ @ down maps , you can hear , tick , tick , tick , tic@@ king on the wall , that industrial clock .
Oh , you can feel the wind on your face , then the sun on your skin and most importantly , the big blue sky .
that is a revelation of space .
congratulations . ( la@@ ughter ) But seriously , Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are said it : " all the world 's a stage . "
OK . step one : therapy . right ?
in@@ ky @@@ -@@ @ black darkness gives way at the right moment , we fly away that wall and reveal a beautiful blue sky .
toilet bow@@ ls are always -- thank God -- at the same height , because no one ever mis@@ ses the toilet bow@@ l .
if you 're anything like me , the tra@@ sh can is just too small for the amount of take@@ out that you buy every night , right ?
he was literally standing on a floating pl@@ exig@@ l@@ ass deck over his ad@@ oring fans , who had no choice but to praise to Ye@@ e@@ z@@ us up above .
our construction of the built environment -- that 's what I mean by architecture .
this is an image of Freder@@ ick Street in the early part of the last century .
and I think it 's a good image in lots of ways .
it seems like that little tri@@ ang@@ ulation of the environment , the economy and society seems to be in a kind of balance .
he said architecture is the making of the city over time .
we can 't really control this anymore .
they 're undermining the integrity of the city , they 're undermining the capacity of the city to accommodate social interaction , to accommodate everybody , because the other thing is they 're also exclusive .
and ne@@ arer to home , in Bogo@@ t@@ á , En@@ rique Pe@@ ñ@@ al@@ osa , the mayor of Bogo@@ t@@ á , when he took office , he decided , " I 'm not going to spend billions of dollars on creating more highways .
it could become a really very important civic space .
and the cost annually is three trillion dollars .
but it 's the greatest transfer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of mankind .
does that continue ?
but if you 're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil , you have to address transportation .
so here we are using 20 million barrels a day -- producing eight , importing 12 , and from the 12 , five comes from OPEC .
we 're headed to natural gas .
how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent ?
I 'm back to the@@ or@@ ist again .
the first one was Bar@@ net@@ t Sh@@ ale in Texas and then the Mar@@ cell@@ us up in the Nor@@ theast across New York , Pennsylvania , West Virginia ; and Hay@@ nes@@ ville in Louisiana .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : no , no . the argument that it 's a bridge fuel makes sense , because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal , correct ?
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
frac@@ king came out in ' 47 , and don 't believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the Department of Energy 30 years ago developed frac@@ king .
I 've frac@@ ked over 3,000 wells in my life .
I don 't understand why the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania .
ca : all right , so you don 't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon .
your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we 'll some@@ day make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?
T@@ BP : solar and wind , J@@ im and I agreed on that in 13 seconds .
ye@@ ah , sure , I 'm game for it .
ca : Bo@@ one , I really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation .
and that was a real gift you gave this audience .
and as we have watched women conqu@@ er breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign , this is what we need to do now with heart .
now sometimes when people see this , I hear this gas@@ p .
and that is the 40 years that women have advocated .
and then physicians have gone to bat .
women are living longer than ever .
it was a study to specifically ask , what 's going on with women ?
E@@ K@@ G goes p@@ b@@ br@@ rh@@ h , so the doctors can see this h@@ ug@@ ely abnormal E@@ K@@ G .
and because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat .
where do women get fat ?
he 's got a beer bel@@ ly in his cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ teries .
now what are the implications of that ?
the syndrome , the female @@@ -@@ @ pattern now is called micro@@ v@@ ascular cor@@ on@@ ary dysfunction , or obstruction .
the second reason we really liked M@@ RI is that there 's no radiation .
so those are the consequences .
that 's all stem cells .
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
we are bending the curve .
and it 's political .
so we have these feast and famine cycles .
so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge , we have a lot of lives to save .
I started building this project when I was about 12 or 13 years old .
now most of you are probably saying , well there 's no such thing as nuclear fusion .
well it do@@ es@@ n 't break even .
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Hom@@ eland Security has .
this is me at CER@@ N in Geneva , Switzerland , which is the pre@@ eminent particle physics laboratory in the world .
so thank you very much .
because the mixing of those two media is a sort of un@@ natural or unnecessary act .
when I was him back then , I was approached by J. Walter Thom@@ pson , the ad company , and they were hired sort of by the S@@ und@@ ance Channel .
and the idea was to have me record some of my po@@ ems and then they would find anim@@ ators to anim@@ ate them .
bugs Bun@@ ny is my m@@ use .
my pen moves along the page like the sn@@ out of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sle@@ eve of a loose green swe@@ ater .
I watch it sni@@ ffing the paper ce@@ as@@ el@@ essly , intent as any for@@ ager that has nothing on its mind but the g@@ ru@@ bs and insects that will allow it to live another day .
he says that , " If at first you don 't succeed , hide all evidence you ever tried . "

but other days I am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a doll@@ house to sit with the others at the long table .
the next po@@ em is called for@@ get@@ fulness , and it 's really just a kind of poe@@ tic ess@@ ay on the subject of mental slip@@ page .
who could sleep that night ?
so the little po@@ em is called " The De@@ ad . "
while we are putting on our shoes or making a sand@@ wich , they are looking down through the glass @@@ -@@ @ bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity .
this is John Hun@@ ter Hospital .
and I thought , surely , we do better than that .
and we did@@ n 't find a single record of any preference about goals , treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient .
the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest : sudden death .
sudden death has become very rare .
we were able to make that happen for them .
so that was really kind of heart@@ breaking for us , because we thought this was going to really take off .
there are a couple of things you can do .
now , I 'm an aging hi@@ p@@ pi@@ e .
and she said , " You matter because you are , and you matter to the last moment of your life . "
thank you .
and let me repeat what you saw last year .
there now , social benefits , social progress , are going ahead of economical progress .
Chile 's catching up !
and they are taking over Sweden , and they are now healthier than Sweden .
it by@@ passed Sweden about two to three years ago , with better child survival .
we can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am I choosing here ?
and we don 't have all the updated data any longer , because this is really hot data today .
" but we forgive you , because you did@@ n 't know it .
the world is quite a mess@@ y place .
this we can call Dol@@ lar Street .
everyone lives on this street here .
if we look at the bed here , we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor .
I lec@@ tured on this for I@@ ke@@ a , and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here .
and the interesting thing , when you go around here in the photo panor@@ ama , you see the family still sitting on the floor there .
although there is a sofa , if you watch in the kitchen , you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars .
it comes beyond here , when you really can get good working conditions in the family .
this is one of the best agr@@ onom@@ ists in Malawi , Jun@@ at@@ am@@ be Kum@@ bir@@ a , and he 's discussing what sort of c@@ assa@@ va they will plant -- the best converter of sun@@ shine to food that man has found .
and they are very , very eag@@ erly interested to get advice , and that 's to survive in poverty .
it 's also good with credit .
micro @@@ -@@ @ credits gave her the bicycle , you know .
I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible .
I only know two types of wine -- red and white .
I 'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
let me first grade what are the most important means .
but where are the important goals ?
it 's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .
so , when we 're making history , or when we 're creating historical documents , we 're taking things that have happened in the past , and we 're sti@@ t@@ ching them together into a story .
but I want to talk about one program that Bill At@@ kin@@ son wrote , called Hy@@ per@@ Card .
these were small things , people making applications to keep track of their local basketball team scores or to organize their research or to teach people about classical music or to calculate we@@ ir@@ d astronomical dates .
I 'm starting my career as an artist , and I 'm building things with my computer , small @@@ -@@ @ scale things , investigating things like the growth systems of plants .
so I 'm building graphics like this , which compare " communism " -- the frequency of usage of the word " communism " in the New York Times -- to " terrorism , " at the top .
you see " terrorism " kind of appears as " communism " is going away .
" I 'm not showing off . really . but I did just land in Hawa@@ ii . "
here 's a more useful -- maybe -- project , where I took all the information from the Ke@@ pl@@ er Project and tried to put it into some visual form that made sense to me .
and these casc@@ ades actually happen over time .
at the bottom left , the very first event .
and then as people are sharing the content from one person to another , we go up in the Y axis , degrees of separation , and over on the X axis , for time .
now , the Times publishes about 7,000 pieces of content every month .
so , in this casc@@ ade , there 's a group of rab@@ bis having a conversation about a New York Times story .
( la@@ ughter ) But we would have never found this if it we@@ ren 't for this exploratory tool .
how does this affect our lives ?
how many of you have i@@ Ph@@ ones ?
so in this room , we have this tremendous database of location data that researchers would really , really like .
so we built this system called Open Pa@@ ths , which lets people upload their iPhone data and broker relationships with researchers to share that data , to don@@ ate that data to people that can actually put it to use .
open Pa@@ ths was a great success as a prototype .
but if we can do this with other data , if we can put data into a human context , I think we can change a lot of things , because it builds , automatically , em@@ pa@@ thy for the people involved in these systems .
the only party that never gets access to this information is the first party !
and I think that 's because we think about these pieces of data in this str@@ an@@ ded , abstract way .
because I believe that this world of data is going to be transformative for us .
the battery was invented about 200 years ago by a professor , Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro Vol@@ ta , at the University of Pad@@ ua in Italy .
today , we can produce vir@@ gin metal from ore at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound .
it is this that caught and held my attention to the point that I became obs@@ essed with inven@@ ting a battery that could capture this gig@@ antic economy of scale .
it 's pretty cool , at least in theory .
that 's 200 wat@@ t @@@ -@@ @ hours .
and then we 've got a four kil@@ ow@@ att @@@ -@@ @ hour cell on the horizon .
so here you have it , grid @@@ -@@ @ level storage : silent , emissions @@@ -@@ @ free , no moving parts , remotely controlled , designed to the market price point without subsidy .
our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current sur@@ ges .
now the Min@@ o@@ ta@@ ur IV has too much impulse , so we have to ble@@ ed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory .
I saw J@@ ason nearly every day , sometimes twice a day .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : Reg@@ ina , thank you .
I think you cou@@ ld@@ n 't be human if you did@@ n 't ask those questions .
I work with some of the most amazing people .
and with that ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ation , comes a really deep sense of responsibility .
and all day she walked around only in her under@@ wear .
fast @@@ -@@ @ forward , 2004 : in the peak of our activis@@ m , the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said , " Le@@ y@@ mah , I have a nine @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old for you .
I wish to go to school . "
one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship .
the director of sports who 's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class .
great people have made commitments -- we will protect our children from want and from fear .
we created a space called the Young Girls Trans@@ form@@ ative Project .
one young woman I met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college .
she sells water , sells soft drinks and sells re@@ charge cards for cell@@ phones .
and you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education .
I failed to do this .
we set up a foundation .
he 's out of office today .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , LE@@ GO came up with this .
like the concrete block , the transi@@ stor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
I personally don 't accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so I decided to change that .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
and it 's been an incredible experience .
the nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don 't learn at schools .
augmented reality is the mel@@ ding of the real world with computer @@@ -@@ @ generated imagery .
to enjoy being decei@@ ved , an audience must first suspend its dis@@ belief .
without it , a script is just words .
we do it every day , while reading no@@ vels , watching television or going to the movies .
without this ability there is no magic .
Jean Robert @@@ -@@ @ Hou@@ din : a con@@ ju@@ rer is not a ju@@ ggl@@ er .

the fin@@ ale def@@ ies logic , gives new insight into the problem , and audiences express their amaz@@ ement with la@@ ughter .
we feel compelled to tell them .
the damage was so severe because the primary energy fuel in Haiti is charcoal , which is made from trees , and has left the country almost completely de@@ fore@@ sted .
the only way they 're going to lift themselves out of energy poverty is by adapting fuels that are more efficient , that are less expensive , that are better for human health , better for the environment and that are more productive .
what we need for ending energy poverty are last @@@ -@@ @ mile retailers that bring these clean energy products to the people .
we all know that clean energy products , technologies , tend to be characterized by higher up@@ front costs , but very low operating costs .
what does that mean ?
I love seeing my name on Twitter .
hi ! I 'm R@@ ick .
this is actually the first time ever that does not match .
and I 'm g@@ onn@@ a share the secret recipe of how we did that .
and they can be applied to any business or social cause .
and you don 't let them .
a s@@ warm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen of their own will to conver@@ ge on a common goal .
( la@@ ughter ) This kind of idi@@ ot , apparently .
that was all the advertising I ever did .
let 's take a look at them : it needs to be tangible .
it needs to be credible .
if you know how high the mountain is , you know exactly what it takes to scale it .
everybody had the key to the treasure chest .
if you 're pioneering something , that means you must , by definition , venture into the unknown .
this is not just a silver bullet .
you can do this using these methods .
and then one last thing : there 's one component more that 's required to work s@@ warm@@ wise that I haven 't mentioned yet .
for the reason that you need to attract volunteers .
and people , in this aspect , are rather predictable .
and that will reward you with two orders of magnitude of cost @@@ -@@ @ efficiency advantage .
well , it 's a stranger story than you might think .
I shared my nursery with other embry@@ os and juveniles , from cl@@ ams and cra@@ bs to sea ur@@ ch@@ ins and an@@ em@@ ones .
( high pitch sound ) We dri@@ fting animals are called zo@@ o@@ plan@@ k@@ ton .
and com@@ b j@@ el@@ lies , that beat c@@ ilia like rain@@ bow@@ ed e@@ yel@@ ashes .
best of all , they make the perfect snack for a small fish like me .
I 'm a woman who loves getting texts who 's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem .
people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you 're tex@@ ting .
and he says he do@@ es@@ n 't want to interrupt his colleagues because , he says , " They 're too busy on their email . "
tex@@ ting , email , posting , all of these things let us present the self as we want to be .
and over time , we seem to forget this , or we seem to stop caring .
my answer was no , they don 't add up .
and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us .
have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other ?
and one day I came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal .
it seemed to be looking in her eyes .
but that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life .
but when I stepped back , I felt myself at the cold , hard center of a perfect storm .
and we are vulnerable .
we are not so much in control .
the problem with this new regime of " I share therefore I am " is that , if we don 't have connection , we don 't feel like ourselves .
when we don 't have the capacity for sol@@ itude , we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive .
first place I 'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world 's deepest natural aby@@ ss .
while our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA , it 's nonetheless thorough .
eventually , if you keep going down in these things , probability says that you 're going to run into a place like this .
this is the target site , the world 's deepest hydro@@ thermal spring at Cen@@ ote Z@@ ac@@ aton in northern Mexico .
how do you take a robot and turn it into a field micro@@ bi@@ ologist ?
it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago .
there are three underp@@ in@@ nings of working in space privately .
the next thing we need are places to stay on orbit .
it says you 're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
it 's risky and it 's going to be one hell of a ride -- better than Dis@@ ney .
this is not like that . I 'm much more like Scot@@ ty .
now I was stupid , but not so stupid that I turned it down .
and lo and behold , soon enough , I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Kn@@ op@@ f .
we all know it was an amazing movie , and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different per@@ mu@@ tations of it .
for me , it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the p@@ ants off of .
but when you do , you don 't get what you expect .
( la@@ ughter ) Au@@ gu@@ sten Bur@@ rough@@ s wrote a mem@@ o@@ ir called [ " Dry " ] , and it 's about his time in re@@ hab .
so with this An@@ atom@@ age Table , students can experience the dis@@ section without a human cad@@ a@@ ver .
so if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you , that means we did the right job .
let 's say I 'm going to cut the liver right here .
the second area , in brown , is the world 's pa@@ stures and ran@@ gel@@ ands , where our animals live .
but let 's bring it home .
I don 't know about you , but I 'm terri@@ fied that future archae@@ ologists will di@@ g this up and write stories about our time in history , and wonder , " What were you thinking ? "
and they 're both happening at the same time .
but we have to do it in a way that is sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future .
but how ?
most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation , methane from animals and rice fields , and nit@@ rous oxide from over @@@ -@@ @ fertil@@ izing .
as a body architect , I 've created this lim@@ it@@ less and bound@@ less platform for me to discover whatever I want .
just relax . just stay calm . everything will be nice and smooth if you just participate and just relax , ok@@ ay ?
ye@@ ah , suc@@ ka , put the scholarships in the bag , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah .
we have fought .
there is no other way .
people began to buy their own post@@ cards and make their own post@@ cards .
Post@@ Secret@@ .com is the most visited advertisement @@@ -@@ @ free blog in the world .
secrets can remind us of the countless human dra@@ mas , of fra@@ il@@ ty and hero@@ ism , playing out sil@@ ently in the lives of people all around us even now .
I love to speak on college cam@@ p@@ uses and share secrets and the stories with students .
right . you know what I 'm saying .
I feel like the hap@@ pi@@ est person on Earth ( now . ) " " One of these men is the father of my son .
and it had@@ n 't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant email from the guy who ma@@ iled me this post@@ card .
and he said , " Frank , I 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . "
he says , " It 's really brought us closer together through the years .
( la@@ ughter ) " I found your camera at L@@ ol@@ lap@@ alo@@ o@@ za this summer .
( appl@@ ause ) June Co@@ hen : frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
have you ever sent yourself a post@@ card ?
much later , as a student , I went to a very different garden , a zo@@ ological garden in Ar@@ n@@ hem where we keep ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es .
they ended up in a tree , and one of them holds out a hand to the other .
and about a second after I took the picture , they came together in the for@@ k of the tree and kis@@ sed and embraced each other .
but the principle is exactly the same .
so my whole picture of the animal kingdom , and including humans also , started to change at that time .
I think it 's a very unfair image for the wol@@ f .
so I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
one is reciprocity , and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness .
so this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation .
otherwise they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be pulling so hard .
another problem with ele@@ ph@@ ants is that you CA@@ N@@ NOT make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single ele@@ phant .
and so what we did in that case -- we do these studies in Thailand for Jos@@ h P@@ lot@@ nik -- is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope , a single rope .
otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope dis@@ appears .
so that 's how they bring it in .
but now we 're going to make it more difficult .
so it 's what we call fre@@ elo@@ ading .
and the emotional part .
it acti@@ vates the same areas in the brain .
also , we know that people who have a lot of ya@@ wn contag@@ ion are highly em@@ path@@ ic .
and we study that in our ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es by presenting them with an animated head .
and consol@@ ation behavior -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) it 's em@@ pa@@ thy driven .
and so it is related to em@@ pa@@ thy , and that 's the kind of expressions we look at .
one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
so the one who makes the choices -- that 's the interesting part here -- for the one who makes the choices , it do@@ es@@ n 't really matter .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts sp@@ itting water and intim@@ idating them -- then the choices go down .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's as if they 're saying , " If you 're not be@@ having , I 'm not going to be pro @@@ -@@ @ social today . "
again , these animals , live in a group , they know each other .
we take them out of the group , put them in a test chamber .
and there 's a very simple task that they need to do .
the one on the left is the mon@@ key who gets c@@ uc@@ umber .
the one on the right is the one who gets grapes .
and we give her a piece of c@@ uc@@ umber and she e@@ ats it .
and she gets a gra@@ pe ...
so many children today die of diar@@ rhe@@ a , as you heard earlier , and pneum@@ onia .
when I grew up , I grew up in a Catholic home .
in fact , she 's the one who taught me as a young girl how to read .
I was very close to her .
maybe some of you know that feeling .
and so we waited a little while before we had our second child .
I want them to feel the way I did -- like they can do anything they want to do in life .
last year , I was in Nairobi , in the slums , in one called Kor@@ o@@ go@@ cho -- which literally means when translated , " standing shoulder to shoulder . "
for 250 years , parents around the world have been deciding to have smaller families .
it took so long back then because the contraceptives we@@ ren 't that good .
they were carried out in places where parents already wanted to lower their family size .
given the option , they will have fewer children .
it 's what prop@@ els societies forward .
and when I talked with her , she had three children , and I asked her about her family .
and she explained the income that she was getting out of her business afforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children .
it 's where researchers have collected data on over 18@@ 0,000 inhabitants since 1963 .
they got education and access to contraception .
the families were also we@@ alth@@ ier .
we can do our part , in this room and globally , by talking about the hundreds of millions of families that don 't have access to contraception today and what it would do to change their lives if they did have access .
and we need to start now .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : thank you .
so , Mel@@ in@@ da , in the last few years I 've heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of , " We don 't need to worry about the population issue anymore .
family sizes are coming down naturally all over the world .
we 're going to peak at nine or 10 billion . and that 's it . "
Mel@@ in@@ da G@@ ates : if you look at the statistics across Africa , they are wrong .
I think that 's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble on this issue of contraception .
mg : I would say that sex is absolutely sacred .
and the fact that 98 percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced say they use birth control do@@ es@@ n 't make sex any less sacred .
we need a ground@@ s@@ well of people saying , " This makes sense .
I hope that they 'll be very proud of me for living out what they taught us about social justice and service .
ca : so , you and your team brought together today an amazing group of speakers to whom we 're all grateful .
sometimes it 's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer the next person that can help you answer it .
and I thought it was just an amazing day .
ca : Mel@@ in@@ da , thank you for inviting all of us on this journey with you .
the surgery on offer was pretty g@@ ru@@ es@@ ome .
so I set out to change the entire treatment for a@@ or@@ tic dil@@ ation .
we started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic reson@@ ance and CT imaging machines , from which to make a model of the patient 's a@@ or@@ ta .
it has a funny tr@@ i @@@ -@@ @ lobal shape at the bottom , which contains the a@@ or@@ tic valve .
John P@@ ep@@ per , bless his heart , professor of cardi@@ oth@@ or@@ ac@@ ic surgery .
he opens you up , he acc@@ esses the a@@ or@@ ta while your heart is beating , all at the right temperature .
j@@ ar@@ gon is a big one .
taking the j@@ ar@@ gon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used .
everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not .
I was working with the Imperial and the Bro@@ mp@@ ton , and this generated some serious problems for the project .
we did@@ n 't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that , we also had professional je@@ al@@ ou@@ sies .
and they made extra problems for us .
particularly when some jumped @@@ -@@ @ up engineer has come along with the answer .
I think it 's not good , but that 's my view .
eg@@ os , of course , again a huge problem .
Tom Trea@@ sure , professor of cardi@@ oth@@ or@@ ac@@ ic surgery .
him giving me respect ? slightly different .
diabetes , cancer , Par@@ kin@@ son 's , Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's , heart failure , lung failure -- things that we know are de@@ bil@@ itating diseases , for which there 's relatively little that can be done .
this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bi@@ onic human .
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
but perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnos@@ ing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symp@@ tom .
I 'll actually show you some more important features about lim@@ b regeneration in a moment .
there 's a lim@@ b pros@@ thetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that 's come back from Iraq .
the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .
a mam@@ mal@@ ian fe@@ tus , if it loses a lim@@ b during the first tri@@ me@@ ster of pregnancy , will re @@@ -@@ @ grow that lim@@ b .
so our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound @@@ -@@ @ healing mechanisms .
it 's a natural process , but it is lost as we age .
by the time they 're five , they won 't be able to do that anymore .
and that idea was that the small intestin@@ e of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain bi@@ ologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself .
and he asked a very important question .
( la@@ ughter ) What I 'm about to show you is a di@@ abe@@ tic ul@@ cer .
I think a lot of times we hear about di@@ abe@@ tics , di@@ abe@@ tic ul@@ cers , we just don 't connect the ul@@ cer with the eventual treatment , which is ampu@@ tation , if you can 't heal it .
that material contained only natural signals .
could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio @@@ -@@ @ degra@@ dable material on there ?
so you could go in , you could get your tum@@ my @@@ -@@ @ tu@@ ck .
many of those patients are very severely burned .
and it became a question of , how do we all get good at what we 're trying to do ?
and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good .
he did@@ n 't see it in his own patients .
we got the lead safety engineer for Bo@@ eing to help us .
and what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than I had understood .
this is not yet our norm in surgery -- let alone making check@@ lists to go onto childbirth and other areas .
there 's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we 're not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
and because these settlements are under a non @@@ -@@ @ disclosure agreement , no one knows what the terms were .
now Shi@@ v@@ du@@ t@@ t was visiting the local land registry office in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead .
according to the Y@@ ad@@ a@@ v family , the local court has been scheduling a case review since 2001 , but a judge has never appeared .
and then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel .
they chose a large family from Beijing for its size , and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice .
many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival , and high rates of suicide are recorded .
it 's hardly time to rest on our lau@@ rels .
aging brings some rather remarkable improvements -- increased knowledge , expertise -- and emotional aspects of life improve .
the C@@ DC recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week .
( la@@ ughter ) We 've said , could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions , and so you switch to the positive emotions ?
we might spend time with people we don 't even like because it 's somehow interesting .
people over 50 don 't go on blind dates .
culture will .
have you ever wondered what is inside your dental pl@@ a@@ que ?
m@@ um@@ mies are a great source of information , except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease , but they are very rare .
they 'd looked at dental calcul@@ us under a micro@@ scope , and what they had found was things like pol@@ len and plant star@@ ches , and they 'd found muscle cells from animal me@@ ats and bacteria .
now the idea of a multi@@ verse is a strange one .
ok@@ ay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronom@@ er Ed@@ win Hu@@ b@@ ble realized that the distant gal@@ ax@@ ies were all rush@@ ing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it 's expanding .
but in E@@ in@@ stein 's theory of gravity , his general theory of rel@@ ativity , gravity can also push things apart .
it says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more fin@@ ely , at first you 'll find molecules and then you 'll find at@@ oms and sub@@ atomic particles .
but over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes .
Ke@@ pl@@ er was asking the wrong question .
instead the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance , instead of any of the other possibilities ?
and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Ban@@ g theory .
the different shapes yield different physical features .
and so exotic as this picture is , it may one day be grounded in observations , establishing the existence of other univers@@ es .
I suspect the latter .
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
so I want to talk today about money and happiness , which are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about , either trying to earn them or trying to increase them .
and instead of talking about how it made them realize that money do@@ es@@ n 't lead to happiness , everyone started saying , " You know what I 'd do if I won the lottery ... ? "
anyone beg@@ ging for money or trying to extor@@ t from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else . "
people who spent money on others got hap@@ pier ; people who spent it on themselves , nothing happened .
the other thing we saw is the amount of money do@@ es@@ n 't matter much .
the teams we give the money to spend on each other become different teams ; they dominate the league by the time they 're done .
OK , that 's still kind of hard to figure .
how many cars ' nuc@@ lei would you have to put into the box to have your one @@@ -@@ @ foot @@@ -@@ @ box have the same density of the nucle@@ us ?
the answer is much bigger .
OK , let 's review .
now look inside the blue@@ berry , and blow it up to the size of a football stadium , and now the nucle@@ us is a marble in the middle .
think of putting all those cars in your one @@@ -@@ @ foot box .
it 's a great honor to be here talking about cities , talking about the future of cities .
and I really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio .
and really , this is the reason I came here tonight .
I want you all to imagine Rio .
the contractors , they don 't like that .
you don 't have to di@@ g deep down underground .
so spending much less money and doing it much faster , you can really change the way people move .
so remember what I said : you don 't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done .
but moving to our fourth commandment , I really w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be here tonight .
we , at this time of year , get lots of traffic j@@ ams .
we are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city .
let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks .
waste collection on time .
that is great , that means we 're going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion talents together .
so if you 're a software engineer and you 're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program , it 's important to think about how much it costs .
young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality .
but this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge .
so this is a problem for policy . it was a problem for my research .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to HIV .
but this also tells us that one of these facts that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right .
so obviously , as an economist , I 'm deeply familiar with the fact that development , that openness to trade , is really good for developing countries .
in Africa , epidem@@ i@@ ologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people .
but that actually do@@ es@@ n 't mean at all that if we gave people more exports , more trade , that that would increase prevalence .
and we can go and we can try to have pre @@@ -@@ @ emp@@ tive preventive measures there .
and then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade .
and what 's really , really great about being here is I 'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very , very different than the questions that I think up myself .
and I can 't wait to hear about what they are .
it 's fast , it 's pretty private .
because I 'm not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals .
what 's going on in your school ? "
there 's the one that cuts it , that you have to tear off .
shake -- one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 .
it 's way too big a to@@ wel .
if you 're really quick , if you 're really quick -- and I can prove this -- this is half a to@@ wel from the dispens@@ er in this building .
you 've been up too late playing a game .
it was practically a religious event .
but really , was this a game ?
and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself , and you can see here he 's got Zi@@ g 's Indian Reser@@ vation .
so you can look at this , and maybe you 've even seen things like this .
we can see that 's a traditional Native American .
pause for about 10 seconds .
and I said , " Hon@@ ey , no , they don 't want to go .
" but what if I saw them ? cou@@ ld@@ n 't we stay together ? "
" yes . "
he did@@ n 't expect to come home from work to the Middle Pass@@ age , but there it goes .
and so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics , and if you 're going to cover a difficult topic , this is one you need to cover , and I 'll let you figure out what that 's about on your own .
and I also made a game about the Tra@@ il of Te@@ ars .
I was crazy when I decided to start it , but I 'm in the middle of it now .
and so to me , this beautiful culture , this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games .
what translates generic public space into qualitative space ?
and we 're doing this through some case studies .
so we 've been eating , drinking , thinking , living public space for quite a long time .
and what 's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing , it 's not an image , it 's not an arti@@ fact , actually it 's a space , and it 's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side .
and that is that those museums are usually passive , they have passive relationships between the museum as the pres@@ enter and the audience , as the receiver of information .
there are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
it 's h@@ ul@@ king , it 's silent , it 's clo@@ i@@ stered , it 's arrog@@ ant , it 's a design challenge .
where would it go ?
but how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it in@@ vi@@ sibly ?
the sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary fe@@ eb@@ ates , that is reb@@ ates for efficient new auto@@ s paid for by fees on inefficient ones .
of course , computers and electronics are now America 's biggest industry , while ty@@ pe@@ writer makers have van@@ ished .
together , efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector .
in 1976 , for example , government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down .
but with today 's much better technologies , more mature delivery channels and integr@@ ative design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
efficiently used , it really can do our work without working our un@@ doing .
of all my sculp@@ tures , it 's the most tal@@ k@@ ative .
and here I 'm going to pull out the double wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths and increase the single .
and I waited , and the next day I liked it a bit better , the next day I liked it a bit better , and now I really love it .
now let me stop here .
we are not even two bit@@ es into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me .
this is a nine @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girl navi@@ gating to principally children 's sites .
I can tell you , there is@@ n 't a person in this room that would sit idly by .
we 'd take action . it may not be good action , but we would take action .
it 's now time for us to watch the wat@@ chers .
but pensioners are reportedly very , very happy , whereas the unemployed are extra@@ ordinarily un@@ happy and depressed .
I think that 's true , actually .
you know my example of the Euro@@ star : six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between Paris and London by about 40 minutes .
Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one .
they believed that there was a discipline called pra@@ x@@ e@@ ology , which is a prior discipline to the study of economics .
I think the danger we have in today 's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology .
but as Char@@ lie M@@ ung@@ er says , " If economics is@@ n 't behavi@@ oral , I don 't know what the hell is . "
try this quick thought experiment : imagine a restaurant that serves Michel@@ in @@@ -@@ @ star@@ red food , but where the restaurant sm@@ ells of sewage and there 's human fec@@ es on the floor .
now , if your perception is much worse than your reality , what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality ?
all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or val@@ eted .
you can 't be smart and pretty .
Ha ha . ( la@@ ughter ) If you use that , you can get away with anything .
we also have articles called " How to Lo@@ ok Li@@ ke You we@@ ren 't Just C@@ rying in L@@ ess than Five Min@@ utes . "
this certainly applies to those who are desperate enough to navigate ch@@ op@@ py and stor@@ my seas in boats .
migrants can share perspectives , if only politicians would be willing to listen .
as I carried his body in my hands to lay it in the ground in June of last year , I realized I had paid a profound price for ampl@@ ifying my voice .
before border controls can be tightened and new visa restrictions imposed , countries that have long received migrants should engage in a more open discussion .
instead , I 'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories , people all around the world .
you know , we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something , some smaller community .
( la@@ ughter ) This , also , is nothing new .
( la@@ ughter ) " I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do . "
we see , " I just feel like I 'm not going to have fun if it 's not the both of us . " that was from someone in Michigan .
the next movement is called mo@@ bs .
and we see that women are slightly more prolif@@ ic talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men .
the rainy ones fall down as if they 're in a ra@@ inst@@ or@@ m , and the snow@@ y ones kind of fl@@ utter to the ground .
metrics provides more numerical views on the data .
here are gender , age , weather , location .
you can see the little pink cursor moving along , representing our position .
for instance , you could find women who feel " addic@@ ted " in their 20@@ s when it was clou@@ dy in Bangladesh .
and this is a technique that I explored in a different project , the Ya@@ ho@@ o ! time Cap@@ su@@ le , which was designed to take a finger@@ print of the world in 2006 .
the ten themes radi@@ ate out and orbit the time cap@@ su@@ le .
and as an adult , I 've been more aware of the great Greek my@@ ths playing out in the sky overhead every night .
and those are the questions that inspired my new project , which is debu@@ ting here today at TED .
the data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world .
in Universe , there 's kind of no end . it just goes in@@ finitely , and you can just kind of click on stuff .
so we see again , climate change is large : Nairobi , global conference , environmental .
the super@@ stars of climate change in 2006 : United States , Britain , China . you know , these are the tow@@ ering countries that kind of define this concept .
and you 'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal my@@ th@@ ology might be .
so it 's been a pleasure . thank you very much .
and for him , it was@@ n 't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you .
one day in New York , I was on the street and I saw some kids playing bas@@ eball between sto@@ ops and cars and fire hyd@@ rants .
it 's a language that 's still evolving .
( music ) It 's so simple , so ev@@ oc@@ ative .
yet , of course , like all music , it 's essentially not about anything .
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pin@@ point the pitch 's location .
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big ' what ' was to praise God .
Ah , bal@@ eful stars !
the what now was not to mirror the mind of God , but to follow the emo@@ tion turbul@@ ence of man .
but what 's the actual difference between these two ch@@ ords ?
turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .
and the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the scores , the co@@ de@@ books of music , into the hands of performers everywhere .
( music ) And it turned out the sym@@ phony could be used for more complex issues , like gri@@ pping ones of culture , such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sen@@ su@@ ality .
now this moment so fascin@@ ates me .
what happens when the music stops ?
is it a mel@@ ody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude ?
to me this is the intimate , personal side of music .
people could now hear music all the time , even though it was@@ n 't necessary for them to play an instrument , read music or even go to concerts .
it spear@@ headed a cultural revolution in which artists like Car@@ us@@ o and B@@ essi@@ e Smith were on the same footing .
the question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
now that we have unlimited access to music , what does stick with us ?
well let me show you a story of what I mean by " really stic@@ king with us . "
he came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this .
( music ) And he said something like , " Me ... boy ... sym@@ phony ... Be@@ eth@@ oven . "
the sym@@ phony : Isaac S@@ tern , the concer@@ to , I heard it . "
I never know who might be there , who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life .
sure , the big events attract a lot of attention , but what really matters is what goes on every single day .
if you 're curious , if you have a capacity for wonder , if you 're alive , you know all that you need to know .
you can start anywhere . ram@@ ble a bit .
my children usually tell me that one of those pas@@ sions is a little more apparent than the other .
it was@@ n 't the only passion I had .
and two of the things about Beng@@ al : they like their sav@@ ory dishes and they like their swee@@ ts .
it 's the story of this experimental robot which got electro@@ cu@@ ted and found a life .
energy came to it in some form or shape , data came to it in some form or shape .
and as I went to research that even further , I got to a point where I discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis .
if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large , you had to live with a smaller gu@@ t .
that then set me off completely to say , Ok@@ ay , these two are connected .
when I moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
because what I began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this .
they 'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients .
do you go to a restaurant ?
I 've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it .
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
images of gri@@ zz@@ ly bears are pretty familiar .
and the only way to film that is a shoot from the air .
to find food , mothers must lead their cu@@ bs down to the coast , where the snow will already be melting .
( video ) narr@@ ator : the tube @@@ -@@ @ li@@ pped nec@@ tar bat .
a pool of delicious nec@@ tar lies at the bottom of each flower 's long fl@@ ute .
if human , he 'd have a nine @@@ -@@ @ foot tongue .
and the truth is I just don 't have one .
( la@@ ughter ) They are competing in a naked bicycle race , and they are headed straight for your front door .
it 's a talking horse .
and I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist , expecting , I guess , that this was going to be like the Super@@ bow@@ l of sav@@ ants .
and we were standing outside the competition hall , and E@@ d , who is a wonderful , brilliant , but somewhat ec@@ centric English guy , says to me , " Jos@@ h , you 're an American journalist .
( la@@ ughter ) I was like , " Well , I 'm not Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars , but maybe you could teach me .
this is Kim Pe@@ ek , he was the basis for D@@ ustin H@@ off@@ man 's character in the movie " R@@ ain Man . "
and I was fasc@@ inated , I wanted to know how do these guys do it .
and I come back to you at some point later on , and I say , " Do you remember that word that I told you a while back ?
the person who was told his name is Bak@@ er is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a ba@@ ker .
I know that there 's incredible stuff happening in these people 's minds , but I don 't have access to it .
I won the contest -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) which really was@@ n 't supposed to happen .
we now are in this period called " peak TV , " right ?
each one of them found this .
in fact , it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the ar@@ oma of L@@ imbur@@ ger cheese that we 're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosqu@@ it@@ oes than humans .
Lim@@ burg , be proud of your cheese , as it is now used in the fight against malaria .
now , on the video -- on the video here , I 'm going to show you exactly the same thing , except that what I 'm showing you on the video happened one hour after I took the tablet .
we get the piano , right ?
so you can now have an instrument that 's not too expensive , that everyone can have one , that you can have at home .
you did@@ n 't buy a CD of Moz@@ art , you did@@ n 't download Moz@@ art .
he writes software that runs on that piece of hardware over there .
you start playing that new Be@@ eth@@ oven piano son@@ ata , and what happens ?
you run out of room .
so what are the effects of these disruptions in music technology ?
but with Be@@ eth@@ oven , you can buy the sheet music , you can go home , you can close the door and play the piano .
there 's so much choice out there . how do you pick ?
so if you 're playing Ch@@ op@@ in , the additions from different countries are different on purpose , because he wanted to be able to track who was a pir@@ ate .
there 's still something of value here , as we 've demonstrated today , because we 're at this thing called TED , where we still want to get to know each other .
we overes@@ timate our longevity , our career prospects .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
we can 't all be better than everyone else .
and they found that when people with high expectations succeed , they attribute that success to their own traits .
well if you get the k@@ iss now , it 's over and done with .
but if you get the k@@ iss in three days , well that 's three days of j@@ it@@ tery anticipation , the thr@@ ill of the wait .
on Sunday , the only thing you can look forward to is the work week .
it acts as a self @@@ -@@ @ fulfilling proph@@ ec@@ y .
and indeed they did -- but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected .
the average likelihood is only 30 percent , " the next time around they would say , " Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent . "
the more optimistic you were , the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information .
and by doing that , he 's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour .
( la@@ ughter ) So let 's see what happens .
take for example this email I reci@@ eved from a fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter here in California .
the British government , for example , has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underes@@ timate the costs and d@@ urations of projects .
my friend who 's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget .
a concept so fundamental to the American psych@@ e that it is enshrined in our constitution .
he was taken to court , where a judge set 500 dollars bail .
you ple@@ ad guilty whether you did it or not .
what 's perhaps more conf@@ ounding is it do@@ es@@ n 't make us any safer .
freedom makes all the difference .
look , we did@@ n 't know what to expect .
there were plenty of people that told us we were crazy and we were going to lose all of the money .
turns out money is@@ n 't what makes people come back to court .
we simply need court reminders -- simple court reminders about when to come back to court .
next , we learned that if you 're held in jail on a mis@@ demean@@ or , 90 percent of people will ple@@ ad guilty .
it 's time to do something about that .
the repeated infection will scar your e@@ yel@@ ids so that they contract and they turn inside out .
but of course , that only gives them temporary res@@ p@@ ite , because they just grow back more vicious than before .
we train nurses to do it , and they use local an@@ esthe@@ tics .
then " A " stands for " antibiotics . "
these are donated by P@@ f@@ izer , who also pay for those drugs to be transported to the port in @@@ -@@ @ country .
and you can see it 's marked different colors , and you can tell how many pills you should give somebody , based on how tall they are .
in fact , President Car@@ ter , he talks about how tr@@ ach@@ oma was a real problem in Georgia when he was a little boy .
and finally , " E " stands for " environment , " where we help the communities build lat@@ r@@ ines , and we teach them to separate their animals from their living quarters in order to reduce the fly population .
yes , it does .
this map shows you the progress that we 've made to date .
and we can make significant progress in two countries which have the highest burden of the disease , which is Ethiopia and Nigeria .
and in doing all of that , we can leverage more than two billion dollars ' worth of donated drugs .
now , yes , there are some countries that are still red .
and we also have the relationships with the governments so that we can make sure that our program is coordinated with other disease @@@ -@@ @ control programs , so that we can be efficient .
we would be on the home straight to eliminate this disease from the whole world .
and he said , " People don 't go blind by the million .
it 's no exagg@@ eration to say that this had totally transformed her life .
she could work , she could soci@@ alize .
but there are so many T@@ wi@@ bas .
do you think we can ?
at 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface , sunlight is barely a g@@ lim@@ mer .
in fact , maybe more than all the rest of the ocean combined .
I think we can change that .
this amazing discovery happened because we used new technology to see life in the ocean in a new way .
I am convinced that the discoveries awaiting us in the tw@@ il@@ ight zone will be just as breath@@ taking .
it gets even more interesting , because small size does not stop them from being powerful through sheer number .
factory ships in the open ocean have been vacu@@ um@@ ing up hundreds of thousands of tons of small , shri@@ mp @@@ -@@ @ like animals called kr@@ ill .
the animals are ground into fish meal to support increasing demands for aquaculture and for nu@@ trac@@ eu@@ ticals such as kr@@ ill oil .
we used to think these animals found all of their food in surface waters .
we now believe they depend on the tw@@ il@@ ight zone .
to meet these challenges , we will need to push the limits of technology .
the excitement level about this could not be higher on our team of ocean scientists , engineers and communic@@ ators .
how amazing would it be to take a different path this time ?
this is the first time we 've shared this publicly .
because of the power of information , information from technology that is coming down in price and going up in precision .
one of the largest sources of methane pollution is the oil and gas industry .
how about now ?
so , as it 's produced and processed and transported to homes and businesses across America , it escap@@ es from wells and pipes and other equipment .
and finally , we learn that when you put information like that into people 's hands , they act .
we 're doing this because we can 't wait for Washington , especially not now .
then it 's all about turning data into action , just as we did in the United States .
and because all of our data will be free and public , there will be transparency -- we 'll all be able to see how much progress is being made and where .
and we talked about sn@@ akes -- I don 't know why -- we talked about sn@@ akes and fear of sn@@ akes as a pho@@ bia .
and it was really enjoyable , really interesting .
and that little girl was c@@ rying and was terri@@ fied .
I thought a lot about : what was I put on Earth to do ?
you may know her .
these were just three of her 10,000 students .
we walk in the foot@@ steps of SE@@ P@@ TI@@ MA Clar@@ k .
and to , lastly : never ask permission to save your own life .
and this shows a recently vir@@ gin que@@ en . here 's her wings .
and she 's in the process of m@@ ating with this male , and there 's another male on top waiting his turn .
she lays eggs , she feeds the lar@@ v@@ ae -- so an ant starts as an egg , then it 's a lar@@ va .
they make a M@@ idden , a pile of refuse -- mostly the hus@@ ks of the seeds that they eat .
that is , that there are chambers inside , they line the walls of the chambers with mo@@ ist soil and it dri@@ es to a kind of an ad@@ o@@ be @@@ -@@ @ like surface in it .
the que@@ en 's in there somewhere ; she just lays eggs .
and the nest maintenance workers just take all the to@@ oth@@ pic@@ ks to the outer edge of the nest m@@ ound and leave them there .
and this was true for all the pair @@@ -@@ @ wise combinations of tasks .
the nest maintenance workers become for@@ agers .
the pat@@ rol@@ lers become for@@ agers .
instead , something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .
and it would change as the colony gets larger .
they smell with their anten@@ na@@ e .
and what we 're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its An@@ ten@@ nal contacts , the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks , in deciding what to do .
two eyes at the bottom , optic nerve flowing out from the back .
Spanish neuro@@ an@@ atom@@ ist Santiago Ram@@ on y Ca@@ j@@ al , who 's widely considered the father of modern neuro@@ science , applied this Gol@@ gi sta@@ in , which yields data which looks like this , and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell , the ne@@ ur@@ on .
and anti@@ body stain@@ ings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question .
those are the kind of posters , let me show you .
he went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe and stood there with the photos to say , " We have rights . "
and he 's here also today .
so back to the question , " Can art change the world ? "
this actually became my creative ob@@ session .
sounds like a great idea , but how do you make it real ?
one of my favorite examples is that they provide half of the oxygen we breathe .
and admittedly , they may be more h@@ ug@@ g@@ able than the micro@@ bes .
your next two brea@@ ths -- tip your h@@ ats to the micro@@ bes .
as an extreme example : the disease cholera is caused by a bacter@@ ium that thri@@ ves in the ocean .
our relationship with the ocean , much like our gu@@ t , is dependent on the right balance of micro@@ bes .
so again , clean ree@@ f on your left , fish farm ree@@ f on your right .
we 're looking at a side view of the same coral as before , where the protective layer meets the sea@@ water ; so , sea@@ water on your right , coral on your left .
to what extent are these people right ?
will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century ?
otherwise it was only Christian countries .
now 1962 -- can you see they 're getting a little richer , but the number of babies per woman is falling ?
so what we can conclude is you don 't have to get rich to have few children .
but let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar .
for Christmas I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation .
two months later , six years old , I 'm able to do one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
and he was fro@@ w@@ ning .
and he finally asked , " Can I see those ? "
well within a few days I 'm able to do one crossing .
and a few days later , I was practicing on a single tigh@@ tro@@ pe .
so that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try -- this is how not to learn wire walking .
I was starting to inv@@ ent my own moves and bring them to perfection .
so I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission .
on the other , the universe of the clouds , so full of unknown we think it 's empty .
so after the walk people ask me , " How can you top that ? "
you know that , right ?
and I chose to put my wire between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem over the Ben H@@ inno@@ m Valley .
and in my hotel room , each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air , she would gra@@ ze the wall and end up on the bed .
I make the do@@ ve appear .
and then in the most magnificent gesture , I send the bird of peace into the az@@ ure .
somebody somewhere , a group of people , starts cl@@ apping in rhythm with my steps .
but not an appl@@ ause of delight like before , an appl@@ ause encouragement .
thank you .
but then something unexpected happened .
today we can prevent the transmission of HIV .
these laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance .
you are a very , very , very bad person .
that 's the day I found out .
I am sure now that is the reason they steril@@ ized me .
the nurse just came with it already marked where I had to sign .
let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference .
for many of us here HIV is not an abstract threat .
the law , on the other hand , can seem remote , ar@@ can@@ e , the stuff of specialists , but it is@@ n 't .
laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves : as equals .
four years ago I worked with a few people at the Bro@@ ok@@ ings Institute , and I arrived at a conclusion .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's something you live inside of every day .
so please , without further ado .
( appl@@ ause ) This is a fun one .
( be@@ at@@ box ) ( G@@ ib@@ ber@@ ish ) ( Music ends ) Ok@@ ay , for the last piece I 'd like to do , this one goes very similar to this .
( la@@ ughter ) See , he owned a chro@@ mium @@@ -@@ @ pl@@ ating company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals .
when I was at college , I decided to study engineering , like him .
and as a result , the need@@ les damage these organs , cause damage , which leads to trauma and side effects .
now , it 's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this .
first , we use a technique called dynamic time war@@ ping from speech recognition .
now we take those human demonstrations -- they 're all nois@@ y and im@@ perfect -- and we extract from them an inf@@ erred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot .
( la@@ ughter ) I wish she could meet my d@@ ad .
thank you .
and she would design these toys , where kids in playing with the toys would come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play .
and most games put the player in the role of Luke Sky@@ wal@@ ker , this pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist playing through this story .
now , over time , this is going to heat up the planet .
so basically , what we 're getting here is the sequ@@ el to " An In@@ convenient Truth , " in about two minutes , and that actually brings up an interesting point about games .
so I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them senti@@ ent .
so here 's a little black hole that we probably don 't want to get too close to .
but we also have stars and things as well .
you might be a ven@@ ge@@ ful god , con@@ ques@@ ting , because you actually can do that , you can attack other intelligent races .
you might be a networking god , building alliances , or just curious , going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can .
shou@@ ld@@ n 't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels ? "
so here 's a question : imagine if we said , " Oh yes , we can get off fossil fuels .
that 's true of European biofuels .
so let 's start in the United Kingdom , since that 's where we are today .
the energy consumption of the United Kingdom , the total energy consumption -- not just transport , but everything -- I like to quantify it in light@@ bul@@ bs .
it 's as if we 've all got 125 light@@ bul@@ bs on all the time , 125 kil@@ ow@@ att @@@ -@@ @ hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the UK .
I 'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures .
we 're at 125 light@@ bul@@ bs per person , and that little blue do@@ t there is showing you the land area of the United Kingdom .
let 's add European countries in blue , and you can see there 's quite a variety .
that 's 15 years of progress .
what does that mean ?
( la@@ ughter ) What can we do to it ?
but the sad truth is , it 'll only get about 25 percent of the leak@@ iness of your building if you do these things , which are good ideas .
here 's a graph I made .
I don 't remember everything , but I do remember I went into crisis mode , mother mode .
" I 'm OK . "
this was the most difficult question I 've been asked .
my students ask really though@@ tful questions all the time .
yes , voting is one of the best ways to take personal responsibility for gun violence .
then we have Cho@@ ice C : this will end when we do a better job of taking care of each other .
maybe that 's the answer here .
or maybe " all of the above " is too easy , and this is not an easy problem .
so instead , I 'm asking you to do your home@@ work , write your own Cho@@ ice D using supporting detail .
hum@@ bly share your knowledge with each other .
everything we know about Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es as a mathemati@@ cian we know about because of just three books , and they 're called A , B and C.
and he wanted to do this as a matter of principle .
because not many people are really going to read Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es in ancient Greek , but they should have the chance to do it .
the first problem was a conservation problem .
and that glue is hide glue .
and so before we could start imaging Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es , we had to take this book apart .
and here are two different images of the Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es manus@@ cript .
and this is terri@@ bly important , because the diagrams in the manus@@ cript are the unique source for the diagrams that Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es drew in the sand in the fourth century B.@@ C.
and what we wanted to get was the iron .
well one of the unique texts in Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es is called " The St@@ om@@ achi@@ on . "
so Athens and The@@ bes went out to fight Philip of Maced@@ on .
to find three is completely we@@ ir@@ d .
and that is the future of the Web .
and it 's an attractive and beautiful future , if only we can make it happen .
now the Wal@@ ters Art Museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts , but the data is fantastic .
there are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution .
they go to see the Mon@@ a Lis@@ a .
because they already know what she looks like .
and I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
yet , though I feared her rage on a daily basis , I also learned so much from her .
but life at home with my mom was not the only aspect of my journey that has been form@@ ative and uncomfortable .
as a black student attending predominantly white private schools , I 've encountered attitudes and behavi@@ ors that reflected racial stereotypes .
I was eager to engage in lively debate with peers and professors and with outside speakers ; to listen , to learn and gain a deeper understanding of myself and of others .
to prepare myself to engage with controversy in the real world , I joined a group that brought controversial speakers to campus .
the way in which he wanted to understand the issue , the way in which he wanted to approach the issue of inequality also differed from my own .
and the next thing you know , there were hands on her , and she was being moved out of the way .
she said that she was shocked at first -- ye@@ ah .
this fur@@ y is something that I have been ch@@ om@@ ping on since the last US presidential election .
f@@ ell@@ as , can you imagine you 're just on your phone , and someone walks up to you and just takes it out of your hand ?
men are so used to helping themselves , that it 's like ...
I 'm totally over@@ re@@ acting . "
no .
we try to make sense of non@@ sense , and we sw@@ allow the fu@@ rious feelings .
that fur@@ y that my friend felt holds centuries of never being able to directly address or express our indign@@ ation , our frustration and our rage .
time 's up on thinking that we 're over@@ re@@ acting or " This is just the way it is . "
time 's up on women being held responsible for men 's bad behavior .
your fur@@ y is not something to be afraid of .
thank you .
GS : so this was such an important moment for Sp@@ ace@@ X .
with the Fal@@ con 9 and now the Fal@@ con Heavy , we can launch into orbit any pay@@ load that has previously been conceived or is conceived right now .
GS : exactly . it was perfect .
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's what a 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girl connects with .
and I used to sh@@ y away from telling that story , but if that 's what caused me to be an engineer -- he@@ y , I think we should talk about that .
I think it was helpful to my role of running sales for El@@ on .
this is if there was an issue on the pad .
GS : ye@@ ah , so the launch escape system for Dragon is pretty unique .
how was that possible ?
the first is that we 're kind of standing on the shoulders of gi@@ ants . right ?
we got to look at the rocket industry and the developments to date , and we got to pick the best ideas , leverage them .
we also did@@ n 't have technology that we had to include in our vehicle systems .
it is done elsewhere , probably not to the degree that we do it , but it adds a lot of margin to the vehicle , which obviously adds reliability .
( la@@ ughter ) GS : you put me in a unique position , Chris .
ca : it feels like you play kind of a key intermediary role here .
ca : so if I estimated that the conversation ratio for El@@ on time to your time is about 2@@ x , am I a long way out there ?
GS : that 's not terrible , and you said it , I did@@ n 't .
people worry a lot about this .
ca : is that what you call this ? talk about what the hec@@ k this is .
GS : it 's exactly this residual capability .
what on earth is this ?
and yet , a long @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ ul aircraft can only make one of those flights a day .
ca : and this is G@@ w@@ yn@@ ne time or El@@ on time ?
it 's going to take off .
so it sounds incredible , but we 're working on the pieces , and you can see us achieve these pieces .
I think this first version , and we 'll continue to make even bigger B@@ F@@ Rs , I think it 's a three @@@ -@@ @ month trip .
it will be within a decade -- not this decade .
( appl@@ ause ) It 's the fundamental risk reduction for the human species .
and this does not sub@@ vert making our planet here better and doing a better job taking care of it , but I think you need multiple paths to survival , and this is one of them .
and let 's not talk about the dow@@ ner piece , like , you go to Mars to make sure all earth@@ lings don 't die .
ca : that is a big vision .
since 2001 , we 've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people -- young and old , men and women , educated and illiterate .
I 'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt .
but it 's the largest Arab country and it 's also one with a great deal of influence .
among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice .
so now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak 's 30 @@@ -@@ @ year rule , they potentially could be an example for the region .
evaluating Egypt on this basis alone , however , igno@@ res the real revolution .
( la@@ ughter ) " They 're really watching us , and we can 't help but worry that we 're not going to live up to their expectations . "
but people 's expectations for their future went up significantly .
where women agree , however , is on their own role , and that it must be central and active .
so the question becomes , What drives men 's support for women 's rights ?
my values can be radically different from your values , which means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral .
and I 'd like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people to do things .
well , there are some technologies which obviously combine both .
as you see in today 's modern liberal democracies , the society , the state , not only allows us to determine our self , to shape our self , it also demands it of us .
and we can question these values .
is it " still " ethical ?
our designs are not ethical or un@@ ethical in that they 're using ethical or un@@ ethical means of persu@@ ading us .
in other words , the rate of increase is expon@@ ential .
but in this sense , you actually can look into the future , haz@@ ily , but you can look into the future .
well , let me suggest to you that SE@@ TI obviously can 't solve the problem , but it can address the problem .
today , you 've got to spend years in grad school and post @@@ -@@ @ doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are .
and I bet the answer you 're going to get , is , " Well , I don 't know what the H@@ ig@@ gs bos@@ on is , and I don 't know if it 's important . "
it was like D@@ ustin H@@ off@@ man in " The Gradu@@ ate , " right , when he said " plastics , " whatever that means , plastics .
ok@@ ay ? that had a big effect on me .
it 's a sex@@ tra @@@ -@@ @ quad@@ ra @@@ -@@ @ hex@@ a @@@ -@@ @ something or other . " right ?
so to me , it is a privilege , and when I look in the mirror , the facts are that I really don 't see myself .
I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly .
that 's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subver@@ ts the security of a well @@@ -@@ @ constructed system .
that 's the big problem we 're trying to solve .
if only they were using the real names , Then you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be worried about them on the Internet .
and so you get this sort of log@@ j@@ am around identity where you want full disclosure from everybody else , but not from yourself .
so on my RSS feed , I saw this thing about - I just said something bad about my RSS feed , did@@ n 't I ?
so you 've got to give them your Facebook password .
identity is , especially when you 're a teen@@ ager , a fluid thing .
you have lots of identities .
and it just do@@ es@@ n 't work properly .
suppose I was sitting next to a ro@@ gue trader , and I want to report it to the b@@ oss of the bank .
that message will only happen if I 'm anonymous .
the goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don 't need identity , which is actually almost all transactions .
so my suggestion @@@ -@@ @ I , like James , think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R & amp ; D.
it 's something we can do about .
naturally , in these circumstances , I turn to Doctor Who .
come on , you guys must have seen Doctor Who 's psych@@ ic paper .
who 's seen Doctor Who 's psych@@ ic paper ?
is that what you 're going to tell us ?
that 's a Japanese ATM , the finger@@ print template is stored inside the mobile phone .
it has to be a utility that you can use everywhere .
it has to be absolutely convenient , that 's me going into the pu@@ b .
it do@@ es@@ n 't disclose any other information .
there are 6.6 billion mobile phone subscriptions .
we 're going to do it using phones , and we 're going to do it using mobile proximity .
digital signatures , the bl@@ inding of public key certificates , these technologies have been around for a while , we 've just had no way of packaging them up .
so the technology already exists .
and I want you to pay particular attention to the three little pr@@ ongs in the center of this picture .
second theory is : could we upgrade ?
so very small changes can have a big impact .
that got exported and was really mis@@ used .
if that is true , it leads to some very complicated questions for the London Olympics .
three options : do you want the Olympics to be a showcase for really hard@@ working mu@@ tants ?
you 've also got people with who are extra@@ ordinarily smart , people who can remember everything they 've seen in their lives , people who 've got syn@@ esthe@@ sia , people who 've got sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
I don 't have a good answer .
so this is the assor@@ tative m@@ ating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures .
other people get hy@@ per @@@ -@@ @ sensitive to the amount of information .
other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information .
and that 's because we tend to think of sk@@ elet@@ ons as sti@@ ff lever systems that produce speed or power .
a lot of it did@@ n 't pan out .
and moreover , it has to work .
without both elements you have no support .
but instead I saw this .
the arrow shows you the long axis of the sk@@ elet@@ on .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the v@@ ascular tissues .
if the wall around the erectile tissue was@@ n 't there , if it was@@ n 't reinforced in this way , the shape would change , but the infl@@ ated penis would not resist bending , and erection simply w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't work .
not just about its gene@@ tics and molecular biology , but up here in the meat end of the scale .
now I know we learned that in math class , but now it 's everywhere in the culture -- The X prize , the X @@@ -@@ @ Files , Project X , TE@@ D@@ x .
and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language .
one problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don 't make it through a European voice box without lots of practice .
( la@@ ughter ) And I thought that was worth sharing .
truth and beauty are things that are often opa@@ que to people who are not in the sciences .
and these micro @@@ -@@ @ machines power how a cell moves .
so what you 're seeing here is the bacteria metabol@@ izing , and as they do so they create an electrical charge .
and this attracts metals from their local environment .
and the des@@ al@@ ination process is one where we take out salts .
and this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it 's pum@@ ped back out into .
now , I 'm sure you recognize this object ; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private z@@ ep@@ pel@@ ins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days .
after all , the ancient astr@@ onau@@ ts who used it did not travel by jet very often , pref@@ erring instead to travel by fea@@ thered ser@@ p@@ ent powered by crystal sk@@ ul@@ ls .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Music ) Ah yes , a table .
and on top of it , the ju@@ ic@@ y Sal@@ if .
and yet I forget about it all the time .
so there you go . my name is John H@@ od@@ g@@ man .
you see , babies are born in a state of utter fragility .
and it 's out of this mutually reinforcing chore@@ ography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind -- the social mind , the social brain -- depends on .
we always think about au@@ tism as something that happens later on in life .
you would reco@@ il . you would call the police .
we do so , remember , intu@@ i@@ tively , effor@@ t@@ lessly .
and we 've known that for a long time .
now , she is obl@@ i@@ vious to me and I 'm so close to her , and you think , maybe she can see you , maybe she can hear you .
it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born .
there are millions of individuals with au@@ tism all around us .
most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled , individuals who need w@@ ra@@ par@@ ound services -- services that are very , very intensive .
and those services can cost in excess of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year .
so I feel that we have a bio@@ ethical imperative .
the science is there .
in fact , we believe there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with au@@ tism , and genetic anom@@ alies , much more than just genes .
well , it 's hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies .
so on that frame , the children who are typical are watching this , the emo@@ tion of expression of that little boy as he 's fighting a little bit with the little girl .
well , we took a construct from our pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian friends , the concept of growth charts -- you know , when you take a child to the pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian , and you have physical height and weight .
we sought children from the time they 're born .
this is the percent of their viewing time that they 're focusing on people 's eyes , and this is their growth chart .
they start over here -- they love people 's eyes -- and it remains quite stable .
it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months .
it 's something very different .
we did@@ n 't have to wait for the behavi@@ ors of au@@ tism to emerge in the second year of life .
we need to be able to work with the families , support the families , to manage those first years with them .
there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities , preventing , in fact , those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field .
we want that the next generations of individuals with au@@ tism will be able not only to express their strengths , but to fulfill their promise .
we make up half the population of the world , but we 're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories .
" drawn into this " -- like they were se@@ duc@@ ed into committing an act of violence .
and the first person he quotes says , " These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives . "
the Times was del@@ u@@ ged with criticism .
initially , it defended itself , and said , " These are@@ n 't our views .
but The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way .
what emerges is a truly sad , hor@@ rific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty .
what she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and de@@ value their lives .
Chris An@@ derson , the editor of W@@ ired , defended his choice and said there are@@ n 't enough women , prominent women in technology to sell a cover , to sell an issue .
this is its cover from November 15 , 2010 .
it 's important to keep talking about this , in light of L@@ ara Log@@ an .
I never heard anyone say this about An@@ derson Co@@ op@@ er and his crew , who were attacked covering the same story .
you all have a stake in a strong , vibrant media .
suggest female sources to reporters and editors .
it 's for The Guardi@@ an newspaper .
it 's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist , but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world .
but it 's only when you get the whole picture , you can fully understand what 's going on .
my d@@ ad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
I had to figure out what it is my d@@ ad did and why it was important .
that 's what he said .
he had a Di@@ x@@ i@@ eland jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover Louis Arm@@ strong tun@@ es .
all of us ? designers ?
I don 't like to talk about this very much , but I 'll tell you guys the story today .
and for decades , I 'm going , why does this happen ? what can I do about it ? how can I change this ? I mean there must be something .
or I 'd dress up really , really sharply or something .
intent changes the picture completely .
it conve@@ ys author@@ ship .
he 's the random state of nature we emerged from .
we 're supposed to act with intent .
I met the du@@ de . he 's a great guy .
he would say , " You 're right between horse and squ@@ ir@@ rel , John . "
" no need for birth control , Do@@ c , are you sure about that ? "
well !
he 's like our other children , but the experience is completely different .
but we all had to change , but not just react to the given ; we bend to this new experience with intent .
man , I love that thing .
other designs I really cou@@ ld@@ n 't afford , like the 1974 9@@ 11 Tar@@ ga .
as the human race emerged from a pre@@ historic chaos , a confrontation with random , brutal nature , they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about .
today we don 't confront the chaos of nature .
what shall we do ?
how shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create , on all the circumstances we create , on all the places we change ?
and we can 't just im@@ itate the past . no .
in the middle of this chaos , I 'm rolling around in a wheelchair , and I was completely invisible . completely .
I was in a wheelchair ; I did@@ n 't look like a loo@@ ter .
we sat there and compared wheels and tires and spo@@ kes and tubes .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
I said , " I know all that -- what day is it ? "
" nurse ! is this the 28th or the 29th ? "
far more effective , I have to say , than anything I later learned in law school .
and I heard the same story again and again , a story we 've heard hundreds of times since then .
but that do@@ es@@ n 't change my belief that all of us , deep inside , here in this room and across this country , share a similar set of desires .
it 's just a set of choices that people make .
so now at Har@@ le@@ m Hospital Center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index , the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for Health Le@@ ads .
so it 's a brutal winter in the Nor@@ theast , your k@@ id has asth@@ ma , your heat just got turned off , and of course you 're in the waiting room of the ER , because the cold air triggered your child 's asth@@ ma .
now we may think that 's good or bad , but in either case it 's real .
and people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it .
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father 's 50th birthday .
frank Cap@@ ra 's classic values independence and propri@@ ety .
as they watch more films their lives got pal@@ pa@@ bly richer .
and those without friends started making them .
he never mentioned that journey .

thank you .
it certainly puts finding seas@@ hel@@ ls by the se@@ ash@@ ore in perspective .
Oh ye@@ ah , great movie , right ? -- Well , I saw Matthew Bro@@ der@@ ick on the screen , and so I thought , " Swe@@ et ! Ferr@@ is Bu@@ eller . I 'll watch this ! "
the finding love and respect , the part about trying to find your place in the world .
I realized there were a lot of people who we@@ ren 't as gay as I was -- gay being happy , not gay being attracted to the same sex .
in fact , I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle .
and sometimes I just wear it just because .
( appl@@ ause ) You may want to tell your spouse . who , if they 're in love , might be gay as well .
it goes and goes and eng@@ ul@@ fs !
when you get in front of this crowd , you 're g@@ onn@@ a share the news .
( la@@ ughter ) Non@@ etheless , our fo@@ ref@@ a@@ thers , right ?
( appl@@ ause ) As a k@@ id , I grew up on a farm in Florida , and I did what most little kids do .
in fact , when someone tells you they 're a sk@@ ater today , they pretty much mean a street sk@@ ater , because freestyle , it took about five years for it to die , and at that stage , I 'd been a " champion " champion for 11 years , which -- phe@@ w !
I don 't know how many of you guys have had surgery , but -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) you are so helpl@@ ess , right ?
again , we 'll get back to that .
and another example of how the context changed , and the creative process for me and for most sk@@ aters , is , you go , you get out of the car , you check for security , you check for stuff .
you pun@@ ch it up , and then when I would do that , it was throwing my shoulder this way ...
( la@@ ughter ) Those are the community .
and sk@@ aters , I think they tend to be out@@ sid@@ ers who seek a sense of belonging , but belonging on their own terms .
there 's some sort of beautiful sym@@ metry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individu@@ ality , which we are expressing by what we do .

this is a recent com@@ ic strip from the Los Angeles Times .
" on the other hand , I don 't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Lab@@ rad@@ or . "
( la@@ ughter ) A time for even gri@@ m@@ mer stuff than that , like autop@@ sies and emb@@ al@@ min@@ gs in Isa@@ bel Al@@ len@@ de 's " The House of the Spir@@ its . "
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ?
no , feel free to follow along on your Black@@ berries or your i@@ Ph@@ ones if you 've got them .
no , not everything fits so ti@@ d@@ ily into the paradigm , but that does not mean there 's not something going on at the highest possible levels .

Mt : Nik@@ ola T@@ es@@ la died on the 7th of January , 1943 .
there 's nobody I 'll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years , so we thought that 's a perfect place where we should situ@@ ate our plan and let our imagination take flight .

I like to think -- Than@@ k you .
it 'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today .
in time , all of science will come to be a continuum of description , an explanation of networks , of principles and laws .
it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world , and it 's never going to be quen@@ ched .
many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathem@@ atically semi @@@ -@@ @ literate .
of foremost importance is a thorough , well @@@ -@@ @ organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter .
when something new is discovered , it 's logical then that one of the follow @@@ -@@ @ up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward .
and conversely , for every species or other entity or phenomenon , there exist important problems for the solution of which , those particular objects of research are ideally suited .
now , I 'll show you some of the forums , most of which were self @@@ -@@ @ organized by the students themselves .
we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .

the date here is November 11 , 1980 .
now , there 's a funny thing going on here .
it do@@ es@@ n 't look like anything 's going on .
it only looks like nothing 's moving because , well , Satur@@ n here is 700,000 miles away , and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
it actually has a very thick atmosphere .
and , in fact , I 'm going to go back to the solar system .
and for the last four years , my co@@ author P@@ han@@ ish P@@ uran@@ am and I spent investigating this topic .
so we started examining the R & amp ; amp ; D and innovation lab@@ s of Sil@@ icon Valley .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India .
but of course , as an end user , you don 't see that , because you only see the name of the company , not where it was developed .
so within the company , there 's no difference in the forward c@@ itation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries .
only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center .
what happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart , young , ambitious kids on a call center job ?
and the last kind of innovation , invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation .
you can 't be a professor without having been a student .

you just have to read the article until you find something you don 't know , and preferably something your d@@ ad do@@ es@@ n 't even know .

now , take the Arab Spring .
the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled .
up until two years ago , all revolutions in human history had a leadership , and when the old regime fell , the leadership and the organization would take power .

could we start to share our intelligence ?

when they s@@ warm and ch@@ ase you down the block to shoot you , a little bit less so .
every time a new technology is being introduced , criminals are there to exploit it .
we 've all seen 3D printers .
you need@@ n 't bring the gun into the UK anymore .
you just bring the 3D printer and print the gun while you 're here , and , of course , the magazines for your bullets .
the technologies are allowing bigger printers .
that 's troubling , since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology .
every year , thousands of co@@ ch@@ lear impl@@ ants , di@@ abe@@ tic pumps , pac@@ em@@ akers and defi@@ br@@ ill@@ ators are being im@@ planted in people .
the defi@@ br@@ ill@@ ators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it .
for example , I predict that we will move away from a plant @@@ -@@ @ based narcotics world to a synthetic one . why do you need the plants anymore ?
so how we use ye@@ ast in the future is going to be really interesting .
how will we protect them in the future ?
what to do ? what to do about all this ?
it 's nation @@@ -@@ @ based , while the threat is international .
the cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be tri@@ vial .
what can we do about this ? the government has proven ineffective .
the tools to change the world are in everybody 's hands .
this technology has become outdated in our current world .
it do@@ es@@ n 't scale , it do@@ es@@ n 't work globally , and it surely do@@ es@@ n 't work virtually .
my d@@ ad was my hero and my ment@@ or for most of my life , and I 've spent the last decade watching him disappear .
de@@ men@@ tia sca@@ res us . the confused faces and sha@@ ky hands of people who have de@@ men@@ tia , the big numbers of people who get it , they frigh@@ ten us .
but the research also shows that there 's nothing that will 100 percent protect you .
and reading is just about impossible .
if you 're multipl@@ ying the ri@@ g , so you multiply how many layers of absor@@ bent you 're using , you can collect a lot more .
essentially , open hardware is a license .
this is how most work today .
what 's next for us ?
this is what our team@@ mates , we dream of at night .
in other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
it said , " The pain will never end . "
things like c@@ ud@@ dling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
the game was helping us experience what scientists call post @@@ -@@ @ traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about .
" I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life . "
go !
so good job . quest number three .
we 're cl@@ apping for that ?
now I get to share one more little bit of science with you .
( la@@ ughter ) So , unfortunately or not surprisingly , most of the micro@@ bes they sell at the National Academy building are path@@ ogens .
people have used micro@@ sc@@ opes to look at the micro@@ bes that cover us , I know you 're not paying attention to me , but ...
pro@@ bio@@ tics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the micro@@ b@@ ial community that is in and on you .
premature infants have real problems with their micro@@ b@@ ial community .
now what these trans@@ plants , these fec@@ al trans@@ plants , or the po@@ o tea suggest to me , and many other people have come up with this same idea , is that the micro@@ b@@ ial community in and on us , it 's an organ .
we are them . they are us .
( appl@@ ause ) It 's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression , and I really like this image , but a lot of people think it 's fake .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
now , in those situations , w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't it be great if there was a button on your dash@@ board that you could push , and the car would get you home safely ?
it really makes you think , we 'd love to know what 's going on inside their brain .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
now watch , he has to down@@ shift .
he 's going to have to correct for that with steering .
so , as we move forward into this technological future , I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment .
the change was silent , imper@@ cep@@ tible , unless you knew exactly what to look for .
before this switch was thrown , we did@@ n 't have in @@@ -@@ @ car navigation systems giving turn @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ turn directions , because back then , GPS cou@@ ld@@ n 't tell you what block you were on , let alone what street .
with more base stations , more ground stations , better recei@@ vers and better algorithms , GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on , but what part of the street .
this level of accuracy has unle@@ ashed a fi@@ restor@@ m of innovation .
the GPS do@@ t will do the same for our pos@@ sessions .
I was in my office some months back and got a telephone call .
Car@@ ol is@@ n 't the first , and certainly won 't be the last , to find herself in this kind of fear@@ some environment , worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking .
well , because it 's not a bubble at all .
they -- in fact , they don 't update or up@@ keep ligh@@ thous@@ es anymore , and L@@ or@@ an , the only backup to GPS , was discontinued last year .
so , turning on a Wa@@ ve Bu@@ b@@ ble might not just cause in@@ convenience .
so let me show you how this works .
can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver just like that , with a spo@@ of@@ er ?
they 're wide open , vulnerable to a kind of spo@@ of@@ ing attack .
people fig@@ ured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some h@@ acker to build one .
we built it at my home , which means that I got a little extra help from my three @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old son Ram@@ on .
here 's Ram@@ on - ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) - looking for a little attention from D@@ ad that week .
so something felt very wrong about the world .
I saw the GPS @@@ -@@ @ derived timing of the New York Stock Exchange being manip@@ ulated by h@@ ackers .
you can scar@@ c@@ ely imagine the kind of ha@@ vo@@ c you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spo@@ of@@ er .
maybe you 'll have a whole bag full of them .
you may never experience the entire thing yourself .
so I decided to create a piece which is a self @@@ -@@ @ portrait piece .
from my current self , I 'm turned into a middle @@@ -@@ @ aged man , and then , from there , into an elderly man .
and it 's partly because I came to this field from a different background , chem@@ ist and a bacterial gene@@ tic@@ ist .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , did@@ n 't make sense .
so , to begin with , however , I have to give you a very , very quick lesson in developmental biology , with ap@@ ologies to those of you who know some biology .
why not ?
it was the first cancer virus discovered , and when I call it " on@@ co@@ gene , " meaning " cancer gene . "
so , he made a filtr@@ ate , he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter , and he injected it to another chicken , and he got another tumor .
now look at that . there is that beautiful fe@@ ather in the embry@@ o .
what does that mean ?
so , here is a lovely human breast .
it has a bottom , it has a top , it is sec@@ re@@ ting go@@ bs and go@@ bs of milk , because it just came from an early pregnant mouse .
they are completely different from each other .
in different contexts , cells do different things .
we in@@ ject them into the mouse , the ones on the right , and none of them would make tum@@ ors .
and I always say to the students and post @@@ -@@ @ doc@@ s I lecture to , don 't be arrog@@ ant , because arrog@@ ance kills curi@@ osity .
there are people who think that we should pour more money , more aid into this bow@@ l which leaks .
we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong .
( la@@ ughter ) I let that pass .
there is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said that " Here in Lesotho , we 've got two problems : rats and the government . "
by ra@@ king it off the backs of their suffering people .
an African economy can be broken up into three sectors .
in many African countries the modern sector is lost .
and even then , what kind of socialism did they practice ?
we also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora , not only to go into the traditional sectors , but to go into agriculture and also to insti@@ gate change from within .
I started in 2000 . let me finish in 2030 .
but I 'm confident , with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one , I think we can get this and other goals done .
medicine for our mad@@ ness , medicine for our rage .
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image .
so imagine a restaurant where we can have , like , Lady G@@ aga sal@@ ads as star@@ ters . ( la@@ ughter ) I mean , this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables , probably .
( musical ch@@ ords ) Y@@ ea@@ h , Nic@@ ole K@@ id@@ man sounds good . ( la@@ ughter ) Some people , I would never relate , but they sound similar .
( music ) It 's J@@ ustin B@@ ie@@ ber 's " Baby . " ( la@@ ughter ) ( Music ) It is very pink and very yellow .
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel .
we should all think that knowledge comes from our senses , so if we extend our senses , we will consequently extend our knowledge .
what 's wrong with this picture ?
we need to think about how to address it .
that 's just under the GDP of Great Britain .
the bad news is , this is a semi @@@ -@@ @ subm@@ er@@ sible run by drug cartels .
what should we do ?
this is a US Navy war@@ ship .
this is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people .
purple are t@@ wee@@ ts . green are ge@@ ol@@ ocation .
I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point . I said , as I say to all of you , I 'm on Facebook . friend me .
no one person , no one alliance , no one nation , no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together .
these are well @@@ -@@ @ meaning doctors , some of them have gone on to become very good friends .
which got me thinking .
or are there contexts where we 're far better off taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive ?
and since I study human decision making , I said , I 'm going to run some studies to find some answers .
if you 're won@@ dering why , I 'll tell you why in a few seconds from now .
now , why do you have to consume the tea ?
so this is an extreme @@@ -@@ @ case scenario .
we 'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects .
audience member : pul@@ pit ! B@@ aba Shi@@ v : W@@ ho@@ a ! OK .
well , we have two objective measures .
and that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that ; we could focus on her recovery .
unlike what you may have seen on " Law & amp ; Order : SV@@ U , " justice is rare for victims of gender violence .
again , the thing that 's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become .
all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself .
so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it 's printed .
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin .
mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an a@@ ura , and I 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
my American colleagues have told me I 've got to call it a rou@@ ter , so that everyone here understands - ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) - but nonetheless , here is the device .
Tam@@ ara , would you like to jump in ?
child : Oh , that is so cool .
second child : it 's magic .
mm on video : one , two , three . go !
where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a dig@@ it@@ ally inclusive society .
so , we kind of to@@ yed around with this idea , and we said , " What can we do with this ?
can we make a little product or a service out of it ? "
instead of being the sole guardian of information , be a facilitator to all this information .
how do you make this teacher into a digital gateway , and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally ? "
so we walked around .
we went and sca@@ ven@@ ged the nearby markets , and we tried to understand , " What can we pick up that will make this happen ? "
they are kids who scream at the top of their voices , and you really have to get above that .
it might take a few days to get there , but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality .
this kind of a technique or me@@ trology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas , and I 'm going to tell you one more little story .
it 's about this little device called a med@@ i @@@ -@@ @ meter .
so we said , " Come on , there 's got to be a better way of doing this for sure . "
so the real key question was , how do we empower this woman ?
completely mechanical . this whole machine is mechanical .
this is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum .
Bab@@ bage , of course , wanted to use proven technology , so steam and things .
now , he needed accessories .
I mean , if you 're going to do anything with graphics , so he said , " Well , I need a plo@@ tter . I 've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I 'll make it plot . "
he laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science , and said , " It do@@ es@@ n 't matter how you make a computer . "
there is in a sense a computing essence .
it used pun@@ ch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first Z@@ X@@ 81 .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
hold it up .
we want self @@@ -@@ @ determination in the digital age , and we don 't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us .
and here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said , " Freedom , not fear . "
and some even said , this would be St@@ asi 2.0 .
can they really store all this information about us ?
because in the mean time , the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.@@ U. directive into German law was unconstitutional .
and on the C.@@ D. , this was on .
and after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
but you have to fight for your self @@@ -@@ @ determination today .
we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
a simple volume , the cu@@ be .
so that means that surfaces can inter@@ sect themselves , they can become im@@ possibly small .
so now I 'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it , but instead I 'm establishing a rule , I 'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded .
these forms look elaborate , but the process is a very minimal one .
and unlike traditional architecture , it 's a single process that creates both the overall form and the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic surface detail .
what you 're looking at here is an X @@@ -@@ @ ray of the column that you just saw , viewed from the top .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
instead , we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't even have dre@@ am@@ t up .
that 's what I 'd like to try and do .
the picture I showed you before , and this picture , of drought , death and disease is what we usually see .
what we want to look at is " Africa : the Next Chapter , " and that 's this : a healthy , smil@@ ing , beautiful African .
now this is a huge achievement .
we 've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
what does this mean ?
you have to focus on how to create jobs , make sure they don 't fall into disease , and that they get an education .
and someone stood up to say that one of the frustr@@ ating things is that it 's been a simpl@@ istic debate .
( appl@@ ause ) It is all the resources that were taken from Africa , including human , that built these countries today !
how are we using it ?
my sister fell very ill with malaria .
I got there and I saw huge crow@@ ds .
have you been to southern Spain lately ? there are roads everywhere .
aid CA@@ N@@ NOT solve our problems , I 'm firmly convinced about that .
now I realize -- I 'm not saying -- health and education -- no , you can also provide that as well .
but there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
there are people creating jobs .
( la@@ ughter ) So how did my team at MI@@ T create this camera ?
some other heroes can become invisible .
the idea is that we could shine some light on the door , it 's going to b@@ ounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance .
can we see it in full 3D ?
so this is our reconstruction .
but we can also do a new form of compu@@ tational photography , with time @@@ -@@ @ lap@@ se and color coding .
( la@@ ughter ) The order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order .
( la@@ ughter ) The thing is , I think we should give ourselves a break .
no ! you select .
the first one needs little introduction -- " Girl with a Pe@@ arl Ear@@ ring " by Johan@@ nes Ver@@ me@@ er , 17th @@@ -@@ @ century Dutch pa@@ inter .
this is the most glorious painting .
I first saw it when I was 19 , and I immediately went out and got a poster of it , and in fact I still have that poster . 30 years later it 's hanging in my house .
the daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting .
we happen to know , there 's a list of Cath@@ ar@@ ina , the wife 's clothes .
I 'm thinking of an older version of himself .
they thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Over@@ bury , and then they discovered that it was@@ n 't him , and they have no idea who it is .
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune ?
( la@@ ughter ) So , my work became popular .
in fact , he 's right on both counts , so credit where credit is due .
but I did@@ n 't want to .
DM : Oh , ye@@ ah . you 're allowed to .
Jos@@ h : it was hell .
Matthew ( L@@ augh@@ ing ) : I honestly did@@ n 't think that you would .
and I just said , " No , I don 't care . "
notice that this man is not getting st@@ ung .
we think , oh , be@@ es , countryside , agriculture , but that 's not what the be@@ es are showing .
perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in [ rural ] areas .
and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es . hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es are dying , and it 's a huge , huge grand challenge of our time .
they don 't experience this .
I don 't research what 's killing the be@@ es , per se .
this hi@@ ve that you see here has been in F@@ en@@ way High School for many years now .
I would like to encourage you to open your mind .
a be@@ e is@@ n 't going to sting you if you see it .
you can 't just tell a one sided story .
he said the S@@ IC@@ K country means Syria , Iran , China and North Korea .
so basically , China is a S@@ IC@@ K BR@@ IC country .
but China also has a great firewall .
we all know Mubarak is technically dead .
that means keep the server in your hands .
so he can 't prevent it , his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption .
but those two very smart international censorship policies did@@ n 't prevent Chinese social media [ from ] becoming a really public sphere , a path@@ way of public opinion and the night@@ mare of Chinese officials .
but itself -- the Chin@@ an@@ et -- but itself can create very powerful energy , which has never happened in the Chinese history .
2011 , in July , two [ unclear ] trains crash@@ ed , in W@@ en@@ zhou , a southern city .
I live in Beijing . every day , I just watch the American Embassy 's data to decide whether I should open my window .
but in English it 's 20 words or a sentence with a short link .
so because of this , the Chinese really regard this micro@@ blog@@ ging as a media , not only a head@@ line to media .
" We@@ ib@@ o " is the Chinese translation for " micro@@ blog . "
it has its own innovation .
anything not mentioned in We@@ ib@@ o , it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public .
but also , Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mind@@ sets and Chinese life .
but now we have We@@ ib@@ o , so I call it the We@@ ib@@ o petition .
if you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her .
but also , it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China .
so the crac@@ k@@ down is very serious .
but I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ mouse .
( la@@ ughter ) You know , the server is in the [ central ] cats ' hands , so even that -- when the Ne@@ tiz@@ ens criticize the local government , the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing .
without bri@@ bing the central cats , he can do nothing , only apolog@@ ize .
and so it 's very simple , because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy , this independent kingdom .
not cen@@ s@@ oring in China has become a political tool .
social media changed Chinese mind@@ set .
so my conclusion is very simple .
Don 't let them ho@@ ok [ up ] with the Chinese cats .
it changes what we see . it changes what we remember .
so this is the foot@@ age that I was showing everybody .
( launch no@@ ises ) So literally what you 're seeing now is the confl@@ u@@ ence of a bun@@ ch of different people , a bun@@ ch of different memories , including my own , of taking a little bit of liberty with the subject matter .
( music ) Tom Han@@ ks : Hello , Houston , this is O@@ dys@@ sey .
it 's good to see you again . ( che@@ ers ) ( Music ) Ro@@ b leg@@ ato : I pre@@ tend they 're cl@@ apping for me .
and that 's simply what I did .
( la@@ ughter ) So what I got from him is , he turned to me and said , " You would never , ever design a rocket like that .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'm not going to argue with you . you 're an astr@@ on@@ aut , a hero , and I 'm from New Jersey , so -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I 'm just going to show you some foot@@ age .
so I showed him this , and this is actual foot@@ age that he was on . this is A@@ pol@@ lo 15 . this was his mission .
( explosion ) ( " S@@ ure " ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) R@@ L : I think he 's a great American .
( la@@ ughter ) So , " Tit@@ anic " was , if you don 't know the story , do@@ es@@ n 't end well .
so this is the foot@@ age he photograph@@ ed , and it was pretty moving and pretty a@@ we @@@ -@@ @ inspiring .
so I 'm going to just let it run , so you kind of absorb this sort of thing , and I 'll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time .
so here 's the behind the scenes , a couple of little shots here .
so , when you saw my foot@@ age , you were seeing this : basically , a bun@@ ch of guys f@@ li@@ pping a ship up@@ side down , and the little M@@ ir sub@@ s are actually about the size of small foot@@ balls , and shot in smoke .
so basically , if there 's two sub@@ s in the same shot , I shot it , because where 's the camera coming from ?
I 'll give it to J@@ im , because he could use the p@@ at on the back .
the moment my eye shifted , I immediately started to change them , so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped .
and so I 'll just show it one more time .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " And the thing without the wheels , that moves . "
so I was kind of proud of it , and I went to a friend of mine , and said , " You know , this is , you know , kind of the best @@@ -@@ @ reviewed shot I 've ever worked on .
( la@@ ughter ) So , all I can say is , thank you , and that 's my presentation for you . ( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause )
so here we have this piece of music by Be@@ eth@@ oven , and my problem with it is , it 's b@@ oring .
in fact , I think it 's not better than it . the thing is -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- it 's more interesting to me . it 's less b@@ oring for me .
the full score is 72 feet wide .
( music ) Ok@@ ay , I hear you were laugh@@ ing ner@@ v@@ ously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the int@@ on@@ ation was a little questionable . ( la@@ ughter ) Let 's watch just another cli@@ p .
( music ) So with all these the@@ atric elements , this push@@ es me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dra@@ mat@@ urge .
there was the fl@@ or@@ ist , and I can understand that , once again , we 're putting pressure on the ont@@ ology of music as we know it conven@@ tionally , but let 's look at one last piece today I 'm going to share with you .
is it music ? here 's how I want to conclude .
it 's something that I have to do with other people .
you know , it 's a distributed cognitive process in a way .
ye@@ ah , you all have a body , right ?
( appl@@ ause ) They have no idea what we 're going to do .
I 'm going to start really , really simply .
it has a kind of a grammar . I know what I 'm going to do with it , and I can start to describe it , so I can describe it very simply . I can describe it in my arms , right ?
so all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand .
going to watch it from the side , wh@@ oa .
strike moment .
they 're using the information that they receive to generate the begin@@ nings of a phrase .
some dancers , when they 're watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the k@@ ine@@ tic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
they have something and they 're going to hold on to it , ye@@ ah ? one way of making .
here we go , ready ? and ... ba@@ m , ba@@ ke ... ( clic@@ ks metr@@ on@@ ome ) Great . ok@@ ay , from there , you 're both getting up .
so , maybe too much . so , here we go , ready , and -- ( C@@ lic@@ ks metr@@ on@@ ome ) ( C@@ lic@@ ks metr@@ on@@ ome ) Nice , good job . ye@@ ah ? ok@@ ay . ( appl@@ ause ) Ok@@ ay , not bad . ( appl@@ ause ) A little bit more ?
avoid it . avoid it . W@@ ho@@ om . kick it out of the way .
throw it into the audience again .
they 're starting it already , and this is a task @@@ -@@ @ based method , where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves .
what I 'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it .
if you reach with your finger , where would it be ?
so , you 're going to do the first solo that we made , ye@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah , we go into the du@@ et , ye@@ ah , bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah . the next solo , bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah , ye@@ ah , and both at the same time , you do the last solutions .
until 2017 claimed that record -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) and left many people l@@ onging for earlier decades , when the world seemed safer , cleaner and more equal .
but 30 years ago , there were 23 wars , 85 auto@@ c@@ racies , 37 percent of the world population in extreme poverty and more than 60,000 nuclear weapons .
and what about the qu@@ int@@ essential act of God , the projec@@ tile hur@@ led by Ze@@ us himself ?
the answer is yes .
the other danger of though@@ tless pes@@ sim@@ ism is radic@@ alism .
but it 's not just climate change information that 's being sti@@ fled .
V@@ era was dead .
in science , attempts fail , results prove in@@ conclusive and theories don 't pan out .
but I quickly learned that scientists were nervous , even afraid to talk to me .
it quickly brought what was happening in Canada into sharp focus for me .
( appl@@ ause ) And I have worked hard to back up those words with actions .
but we want our government scientists to talk to the media , talk to the public .
I 'm sure today you 'll hear a lot of stories and , by listening to other people 's stories , I think we can learn about the world , about other people and get a better understanding .
I enjoyed it , I had a lot of fun , but always wanted to do something more with my work .
and it may seem very obvious , the link , now , but at the time , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't really work out how could I use my photography to do something useful .
as I said , N@@ ick would self @@@ -@@ @ harm .
he would pun@@ ch himself in the face .
the people there have been forgotten , so I thought it was important to go and document their stories .
and that 's exactly what their situation is -- helpl@@ ess .
I got in a bit of a panic , because these people were coming up to me , desperate , and I was trying to explain to the village elder that I was not a doctor , and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't help these people .
it was a realization that maybe it was worthwhile going off and doing these things .
many late nights of vod@@ ka @@@ -@@ @ fu@@ eled violence with me sitting in the corner with my bag , just going , " When was this a good idea ? "
now , I have to say , I had a " L@@ on@@ ely Planet " guide to Ukraine and in it , it gave some advice .
he had a real eye for things .
that 's him , there .
at first , I was devastated by what had happened , obviously .
I went to those places because I wanted to make some kind of change , and photography happened to be my tool .
I think that 's what 's really key .
it might be standing on a so@@ ap@@ box and talking .
it 's a sav@@ ory , fla@@ vor@@ ful dish that my mom thought would keep me warm on a cold day .
I 'm a first @@@ -@@ @ generation American .
in fact , my father , Gabriel , came to the US almost 50 years ago .
my mother , Georg@@ ina , joined him years later .
she had a love of fashion and worked in a sewing factory in lower Manhattan , until she saved up enough to open her own women 's clothing store .
he explained to me that , when he was in Ghana , everyone was black , so he never thought about it .
but in the US , it 's a thing .
remember that . "
and he would emphasize this , even though many Africans in the continent would only consider me to be just an American .
what 's the most educated immigrant demographic ?
even if we look at something like workplace diversity and inclusion , if I asked you what gender @@@ -@@ @ ethnicity combination is least likely to be promoted to senior managerial positions , who would you think it was ?
the answer is not Africans this time .
there are millions of E@@ nod@@ is who use hy@@ ph@@ ens to connect their countries of origin with their various homes in the US or Canada or Britain or Germany .
in fact , many people you might know are E@@ no@@ di .
this complicated navigation is not just the experience of first @@@ -@@ @ generation fol@@ ks .
we 're walking melting pots of culture , and if something in that pot sm@@ ells new or different to you -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) don 't turn up your nose .
I work at the Mc@@ Ph@@ er@@ son Square Library of the Free Library of Philadelphia .
we began to take notice of ID@@ s we were seeing : addresses from nearby and up@@ state counties and then slowly out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ state ones .
and as the weather war@@ med , we struggled to respond .
when we opened the door , we found a man on the floor , un@@ responsive .
someone on staff called 9@@ 11 , someone else escorted the kids and te@@ ens down@@ stairs , somebody went to flag down the ambulance in the park .
the highest ranking female is the alpha female .
the male is approaching , she gr@@ un@@ ts at him .
and what I really like about this particular picture is the two old guys to the side .
you also see the big can@@ ine teeth that they have .
the males on the right are walking together in synchron@@ y .
first of all , you need to be impressive and intim@@ idating and demonstrate your vig@@ or on occasion and show that you are very strong , and there 's all sorts of ways of doing that .
the costs , one cost is of course that you need to keep your partners happy .
the alpha male has two sorts of obligations .
and the second thing they do is they show em@@ pa@@ thy for others .
they all have to do this job , so providing consol@@ ation , and that 's a very important task .
but I do want to emphasize that the alpha in a group do@@ es@@ n 't need to be a male , and that actually in one of our close relatives , it is a female .
ca : so what did you do ? how did you realize that ?
ca : and you made it out of what ?
W@@ K : I made four blades , just because I want to increase power .
W@@ K : 12 wat@@ ts .
ca : so what did they make of -- that you were 14 , 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ? they were impressed ?
ca : and so what 's your -- what are you going to do with this ?
thank you so much for coming .
almost all of my kids live below poverty .
and what do you know ? we made 21st century money , and that was ground@@ breaking . w@@ ow !
that 's the beauty of this economy .
and when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South B@@ ron@@ x , so did the international community .
so thank you all and I love them .
they introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health , again , free resources , don 't waste them .
and we took the money that we made from our farmer 's market , and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world .
no Air Jord@@ ans were ever ru@@ ined on my farm .
and these were all grown from seeds . we 're learning everything .
now , you may ask about these kids .
it 's real easy . go see these two videos , please .
one got us invited to the White House , one 's a recent incar@@ nation .
and most importantly , get the biggest bul@@ ly out of schools .
I 'm a third @@@ -@@ @ generation PhD , a daughter of two academics .
in South Africa , the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority .
when the gates opened , there was a stam@@ pe@@ de , and 20 people were injured and one woman died .
this , of course , is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions , but for many others , they do not get the value for their time and their effort .
D@@ ap@@ hn@@ e Kol@@ ler : so this is which coin you pick , and this is the two tos@@ ses .
after all , online course content has been available for a while .
what made it different was that this was real course experience .
you can break up the material , for example , into these short , modular units of eight to 12 minutes , each of which represents a coherent concept .
so , for example , some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
now , how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs ?
and so , the student tries again , and now they got it right , and they 're told that , and they can move on to the next assignment .
this ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you 're right or wrong is really essential to student learning .
specifically , what 's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the human@@ ities , the social sciences , business and others .
it turns out that previous studies show , like this one by Sadd@@ ler and Good , that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing repro@@ duci@@ ble grades .
what 's even more surprising is that self @@@ -@@ @ grades , where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incenti@@ vi@@ ze them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades .
students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways .
educational researcher Benjamin Blo@@ om , in 1984 , posed what 's called the 2 si@@ g@@ ma problem , which he observed by studying three populations .
the first is the population that studied in a lecture @@@ -@@ @ based classroom .
imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average .
so the question is , how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph , from the blue curve , to the right side with the green curve ?
so , if this is so great , are universities now obsolete ?
he said that , " College is a place where a professor 's lecture notes go straight to the students ' lecture notes , without passing through the bra@@ ins of either . "
so how do we do that ?
second , it would enable lifelong learning .
and if we could offer that person an education , they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us .
we cleared tons and tons of stin@@ king , ro@@ tting fish carc@@ asses from the local fish processing plant .
we got dirty , and we loved it .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safe@@ keeping .
the k@@ imon@@ o in this shot pretty much had to be hand @@@ -@@ @ drawn , or piec@@ ed together , picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water had@@ n 't damaged .
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully restored and ret@@ ou@@ ched .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them , Cin@@ dy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
and she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidem@@ i@@ ology , the study of patterns in disease .
but like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
had the children eaten bo@@ iled swee@@ ts ?
did they eat fish and chips ?
conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
in fact , she need not have hur@@ ried .
so , how did she know that she was right ?
they saw it as thinking .
if we are@@ n 't going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
but when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
after all , maybe they knew something he did@@ n 't .
no one knows what the hell we do .
so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neuro@@ log@@ ist 's clinic to do it .
we see vocal trem@@ or , weakness and rig@@ idity .
so these voice @@@ -@@ @ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we 'll , they 're both non @@@ -@@ @ invasive .
we can do high @@@ -@@ @ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
it was made using these three techniques : copy , transform and combine .
I think everything is a re@@ mix , and I think this is a better way to con@@ ceive of creativity .
we 'll do some side @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ side comparisons here .
it 's been estimated that two thirds of the mel@@ o@@ dies D@@ yl@@ an used in his early songs were borrowed .
thank you so much . it was an honor to be here .
and the answer would appear to be yes , and the language would appear to be food .
and there 's some great ideas already in our patch .
and then they 've said to every single one of their workforce , if you can , help those communities grow , and help them to maintain their spaces .
my mother cooked with the colors and tex@@ tures of her garden .
it all began with a fantastic phone call .
and I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point .
so let 's start on that .
Egypt : from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent .
and this is what today is about -- it 's about discussing those very opportunities .
so let 's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data .
but what were they there for ? to acquire assets .
undoubtedly , Nigeria is clearly a hot spot .
but looking at Gold@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ' work -- we had the famous BR@@ IC Report .
if you haven 't , why not ?
it 's just a sign of things to come .
we have to move away from what 's called " the curse of the commodities . "
because it 's not about oil , it 's not about commodities .
so let 's un@@ pack those very quickly , and I 'm going to move through these very , very , very fast because I can see that clock counting down .
Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone -- 2.8 billion investment .
it 's being managed by a Sing@@ ap@@ ore@@ an @@@ -@@ @ based management company .
let 's look at agriculture . let 's look at forestry .
again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .
they 're going to be tapping into carbon credits .
there are only 700 ATMs in the country . opportunity .
this is an opportunity ! energy needs -- it 's an opportunity .
these are the trends that are taking place .
but in any investment decision , the key question is , " What is my alternative investment ? "
now , when looking at Africa vis @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ vis other things , and countries in Africa vis @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ vis other things , comparisons become important .
today , 16 African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings . what does this mean ?
in fact , one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa .
so that 's the change that 's coming down the pipeline .
so the next step , over the next four days , is us exploring more of these ideas .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't offer them any direct help .
each cu@@ bic@@ le is dark and d@@ ing@@ y , identified with a painted number on the wall , and parti@@ tioned by pl@@ y@@ wood and a cur@@ tain .
I visited villages in India where entire families were ensla@@ ved in the sil@@ k trade .
it 's estimated that more than 4,000 children are ensla@@ ved on Lake Vol@@ ta , the largest man @@@ -@@ @ made lake in the world .
this question : " how do I deal with a bul@@ ly without becoming a thu@@ g in return ? "
over time I 've collected about a half @@@ -@@ @ dozen methods that do work -- of course there are many more -- that do work and that are effective .
but we have to practice .
and if it grows very big it probably happens .
the only thing to do is to get up , make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you .
how can this be made better ?
in order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger .
they are human beings just like us .
and that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them .
it 's like mushrooms coming through concrete .
and these huge soldiers with their back@@ packs and their body arm@@ or , w@@ ob@@ bled to the ground .
because finally human beings are getting it .
and I see that we , ordinary people , can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and G@@ hand@@ i and Mandela did .
if there 's any place I don 't belong , it 's in a mind where the story of me starts with the branch of me being que@@ er and not with my rural roots .
indi@@ gen@@ izing my que@@ er@@ ness means understanding that the rural is a part of me , and I am an indelible part of it .
sure , the physics changes , but if you wanted to know about the path of the Earth around the Sun , E@@ in@@ stein could write you an equation telling you where both objects are at any point in time .
E@@ in@@ stein can 't even tell you whether the next iPhone is going to be a hit or a flo@@ p .
but instead of planets being attracted to one another , it 's people who are attracted to areas with better job opportunities , higher pay , better quality of life and lower unemployment .
so they learn the layout of the houses , the escape routes and the local security measures that are in place .
as it turns out , this is exactly the same process as how a le@@ op@@ ard gets its spots , except in the le@@ op@@ ard example , it 's not bur@@ gl@@ ars and security , it 's the chemical process that creates these patterns and something called " mor@@ pho@@ gene@@ sis . "
so I said to the psychi@@ atr@@ ist , ' I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls . ' " and I said , " What else ? "
can I come and interview you about your special brain anom@@ aly ? "
I was desperate to define him by his m@@ add@@ est edges .
there 's a woman there that I fancy .
nothing bad happened .
I just want to thank you for everything you 've done for me . "
... pulling trees from the ground , shat@@ tering windows , taking the roof@@ s off of homes ...
co : so , tor@@ n@@ ad@@ oes don 't happen in Massachusetts , and I was cle@@ ver@@ ly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill .
M@@ o : sure . and we need to tell people what not to bring .
we had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in a minute or less ; otherwise , something more urgent would come up , and it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't get done .
M@@ o : we did@@ n 't get our authority from the board of selec@@ t@@ men or the emergency management director or the United Way .
we just started answering questions and making decisions because someone -- anyone -- had to .
so they use Post @@@ -@@ @ its or Excel or Facebook .
in a disaster , however , you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity .
data is inherently un@@ sex@@ y , but it can jump @@@ -@@ @ start an area 's recovery .
and we 've been flying into disaster areas since this past January , setting up software , training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters .
hearing loss evaluation traditionally requires testing by an audi@@ ologist in a sound@@ proof room , with a lot of permanent equipment .
if I were screening An@@ uk at school , sound @@@ -@@ @ atten@@ u@@ ating head@@ phones and noise monitoring would take the place of a sound booth , and I would use a phone adapter instead of a micro@@ scope to examine his ears .
we then apply Alas@@ ka tel@@ eme@@ dic@@ ine technology to transmit the data to specialists , who connect An@@ uk to the treatment he needs .
now , this is@@ n 't just a contem@@ por@@ an@@ eous question .
the printing press was clearly the right medium for this , but the book was the wrong tool . it was too slow .
the scientific revolution was@@ n 't created by the printing press .
so I study social media , which means , to a first approxim@@ ation , I watch people argue .
and you don 't have to squ@@ int very hard to see the political ramifications of a system like this .
but this is also the thing that brings the chaos back , and this is G@@ it 's second big innovation .
this long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change , but without any central coordination .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they did@@ n 't know of each other 's existence beforehand .
no democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets , even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money .
part of the problem , of course , is just a lack of information .
or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large ?
I 'm afraid I 'm one of those speakers you hope you 're not going to meet at TED .
secondly , a political the@@ or@@ ist who 's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
and one of the things that I want to question is this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness can restore the trust in democratic institutions .
and according to the surveys , we are marked the most p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic people in the world .
and when the votes had been counted , three @@@ -@@ @ four@@ ths of the people have voted with a blank ballot .
because you know what to do about the protests .
I mean the unemployed , the under @@@ -@@ @ privileged .
and the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s , which put the individual at the center of politics .
basically this was also a major outbreak , a culture of dis@@ sent , a culture of basically non @@@ -@@ @ conform@@ ism , which was not known before .
so I do believe that even things like that are very much the children of ' 68 -- nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then .
and of course , you have 1989 -- the end of Commun@@ ism , the end of the Cold War .
it has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics .
the very idea of political community totally has changed .
the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality .
when the Soviet Union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them .
because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most .
thank you very much .
what if your employees experience a culture of bias , exclusion and worse ?
and most tra@@ g@@ ically , what if a technological fail leads to the loss of human life ?
( la@@ ughter ) It was 250 days of wearing an U@@ ber T @@@ -@@ @ shirt .
if you sense that I have real rig@@ or in my logic , you are far more likely to trust me .
now here 's what I 'd like to do .
so that 's what I would like to do together .
OK . so -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) it 's just super helpful feedback .
the most common w@@ ob@@ ble is that people just don 't believe that we 're mostly in it for them , and they believe that we 're too self @@@ -@@ @ distr@@ acted .
we are all so busy with so many demands on our time , it 's easy to crowd out the time and space that em@@ pa@@ thy requires .
now if the quality of your logic is at risk , I can 't really help you with that .
we as a human species can sn@@ iff out in a moment , literally in a moment , whether or not someone is being their authentic true self .
I 'm a woman of super strong opinions , with really deep convictions , direct speech .
I have a magnificent wife , and together , we have such crazy ambition .
( la@@ ughter ) I had never seen anything like it .
it gave people the rig@@ or of the quality of their logic , and it turned a whole lot of tri@@ angles , right @@@ -@@ @ side up , so people were able to communicate effectively with one another .
something to do with words , I assume .
and it did@@ n 't have much more gran@@ de@@ ur than the term " fore@@ man " or " over@@ se@@ er . "
there were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing title .
( la@@ ughter ) And after three weeks of debate , in the end , the Senate did not cave in .
and also , the Senate 's other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ul@@ arity -- well , it was a sing@@ ul@@ arity back then .
because nobody 's going to feel that humble when they 're told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
I 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world .
well , here 's an example .
it turns out he do@@ es@@ n 't buy any of his equipment .
our other partner is East Mee@@ ts West , an American foundation that distribu@@ tes that technology to poor hospitals around that region .
and they said , " Let 's work on newborn ja@@ un@@ dic@@ e . "
ja@@ un@@ dic@@ e affects two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of new@@ bor@@ ns around the world .
of those new@@ bor@@ ns , one in 10 roughly , if it 's not treated , the ja@@ un@@ dic@@ e gets so severe that it leads to either a life @@@ -@@ @ long disability , or the kids could even die .
she sees her baby naked , lying under some blue lights , looking kind of vulnerable .
how are people actually going to use this ?
so thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter .
and one day I looked in -- they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished .
I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution .
I have to think like an exi@@ st@@ enti@@ alist .
I just want to say good afternoon , good evening .
( la@@ ughter ) There 's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa .
and what 's become increasingly clear to me is that we 're talking about news stories about Africa ; we 're not really talking about African narr@@ atives .
it 's important because mis@@ reading is really the chance for compl@@ ication and opportunity .
and I 'm not going to give you the pat@@ ois translation ; I 'm going to make it standard English .
we 've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here .
the first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in 1922 , following the Ab@@ a women 's market riots .
in 1967 , in the middle of the Bi@@ af@@ ran @@@ -@@ @ Nigerian Civil War , Dr. N@@ jo@@ ku @@@ -@@ @ Ob@@ i invented the Ch@@ oler@@ a vaccine .
well , it 's just a jo@@ ke , anyway .
so what seems like an ec@@ centric if tragic jo@@ ke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred .
I mean , picture this -- really picture this .
I am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible .
as a young middle @@@ -@@ @ class Nigerian activist , I launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government .
there are no essential Africans , and most of us are as completely ignor@@ ant as everyone else about the continent we come from , and yet we want to make profound statements about it .
weeks ago , you broke me as a woman once shat@@ tered me into a song beneath her weight , before you sl@@ ou@@ ched into that grass@@ y hus@@ h .
brass nails t@@ acked into the e@@ bon@@ y wood , your face has been car@@ ved five times .
I have to drive trouble in the hills .
anyway , bear with me .
I picked up a hand @@@ -@@ @ sized stone , threw it as far as I was able , it was about 22 meters .
( la@@ ughter ) What 's all the f@@ uss about ?
the ele@@ mental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together , the darkness of the body .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon ?
and there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like on a typical afternoon .
so if I had way more eye@@ balls , then we 'd all be really comfortable , right ?
so , I promise -- I mean , it still has -- it do@@ es@@ n 't have any water in it , I 'm sorry .
( robot bu@@ zz@@ es ) ( S@@ inging ) Oh no , it got stuck .
to me that 's the true beauty of making useless things , because it 's this acknowled@@ gment that you don 't always know what the best answer is .
they can transform cities and communities .
civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit .
lift has always been a pioneer in the use of venues .
for " The Sul@@ tan 's Ele@@ phant , " Royal de Lux@@ e came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time @@@ -@@ @ traveling ele@@ phant .
" before I die , I want to be someone 's cav@@ al@@ ry . "
thinking about death clar@@ ifies your life .
but this is changing , and fast .
I 'm a scientist who thinks a lot about light and heat .
and then something amazing happened .
namely , the air that surro@@ unds it .
and it can escape to a place that is much , much col@@ der .
it was called night @@@ -@@ @ sky cooling for a reason .
the first time I tested this was on a roof@@ top in Stan@@ ford that I 'm showing you right here .
so I was really excited , because not only do we make something cool , but we might actually have the opportunity to do something real and make it useful .
one such process I 'd like to highlight are solar cells .
in 2015 , we showed that with deliberate kinds of micro@@ structures on top of a solar cell , we could take better advantage of this cooling effect to maintain a solar cell passi@@ vely at a lower temperature .
that difference , at least concep@@ tually , could be used to drive something called a heat engine to generate electricity .
hold up .
so I inter@@ faced it with a Bluetooth chip , which you can see here by the app screen@@ shots on the right .
cities like London , Glas@@ gow , Amsterdam are pioneering circular city design , finding ways to turn the waste from one urban process into food for the next .
but look at the data . this is a flight of fancy .
just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that , a piece of something .
in 1941 , the bur@@ n@@ ished p@@ atin@@ a of an all @@@ -@@ @ American bas@@ eball g@@ love inspired the founder of Co@@ ach to create a new collection of hand@@ bags from the same luxuri@@ ously soft glo@@ ved @@@ -@@ @ hand leather .
very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be .
ca : was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
this is Ol@@ us@@ o@@ sun dump , the largest garbage dump in Lag@@ os , and 2,000 people work here , and I found this out from this fellow , Andrew S@@ abor@@ u .
it 's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year , and that 's a vast amount of money , right ?
it 's that the G@@ ala sa@@ usage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called UA@@ C foods that 's active throughout Africa and the Middle East , but the G@@ ala sa@@ usage roll is not sold in stores .
thousands of people came together from across the world to achieve a global first : we built the first @@@ -@@ @ ever crow@@ d@@ funded hospital .
thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Oh , and the best thing of all -- I have a major accomplishment under my belt .
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's when I knew .
and , you know , A@@ unti@@ e M@@ ame said , " Life is a banquet " -- well , I 've eaten my fill .
you can see it .
we 've been paying a lot of attention to Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky 's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years .
we require high @@@ -@@ @ end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing .
and for this task , super@@ computer field bru@@ te force simply is@@ n 't enough .
Fol@@ dit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deci@@ ph@@ ering the structure of the Mas@@ on @@@ -@@ @ P@@ f@@ izer mon@@ key virus .
so the more you look around you , the more you see L@@ ick@@ li@@ der 's vision everywhere .
you can start by designing the human into the process .
the better the process , the less the friction .
the imperative is not to figure out how to compu@@ te , but what to compu@@ te . how do you impose human in@@ tuition on data at this scale ?
to some , this has terri@@ fying privacy and civil liberties implications . to others it fo@@ ret@@ ells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections , but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance .
in the developing countries of the world , this gap is even larger .
now when we do that , we discover some star@@ t@@ ling things about mental illness from a global perspective .
in India , I found the situation was not a lot better .
it seems to me that there are five key lessons that I 've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting .
well , in part , because health care in the developed world , the health care costs in the [ developed ] world , are rapidly spir@@ aling out of control , and a huge ch@@ un@@ k of those costs are human resource costs .
we did@@ n 't have a blog , let alone a dozen t@@ witter accounts like we have today .
turns out that had never been done before .
in fact , many people told us it was illegal .
we have a precedent for this . good old Henry II here , in the 12th century , invented the jury .
simply throwing data over the tran@@ som do@@ es@@ n 't change how government works .
the second phase is in getting decision @@@ -@@ @ making power out .
learning took place in schools .
and we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not .
cities will account for 90 percent of the population growth , 80 percent of the global CO2 , 75 percent of energy use , but at the same time it 's where people want to be , increasingly .
cities are places of celebration , personal expression .
and that 's a very important trend to think about .
the 20 ar@@ ron@@ dis@@ sements of Paris are these little neighbor@@ hoods .
this is even a more interesting solution in Seoul , Korea .
my PhD student R@@ yan Ch@@ in presented these early ideas two years ago at a TE@@ D@@ x conference .
housing is another area where we can really improve .
so we 're saying , let 's build a standardized chassis , much like our car .
you have a conventional one @@@ -@@ @ bedroom arrangement when you need it .
I think you have to build dum@@ b homes and put smart stuff in it .
we think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
another time , she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had .
the lawyers , the judges , the policemen , the doctors , the engineers , the civil servants -- those are the leaders .
the ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual .
I became a parent .
so now , when it 's important for us to be able to recall what it was that we experienced , we have an incomplete , we have a partial store , and what happens ?
it 's called reconstructed memories .
well , what 's that got to do with this ?
this is looking down to the east , where the shooting vehicle sp@@ ed off , and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers .
furthermore , the roof of the car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it dar@@ ker .
he is now a freed man . ( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ) This is him embracing his grand@@ mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
now really what we were doing , we were working in four areas .
I think we need to consider everything , everything from alpha to O@@ ME@@ GA .
you 're publishing it .
so , embry@@ onic stem cells are really incredible cells .
it 's a terrible business model .
it 's our health , our social behavior , and our productivity as well .
hospital sound is getting worse all the time .
that is not good for you .
to you and me , that 's a heart attack .
I think the economics are pretty clear on this .
I don 't know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
it 's time to start designing for the ears .
the fact is , we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger .
supermarkets are an easy place to start .
but this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain , in Europe , in North America .
this farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spin@@ ach , not one leaf of which he harvested , because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it .
I was sitting in a road@@ side cafe .
the one on the right I treated like cut flowers .
some food waste , as I said at the beginning , will inevitably arise , so the question is , what is the best thing to do with it ?
they don 't really go to the usual place that memories go .
but I want to tell you what the Congo has got to do with you .
it would be great if the story ended there .
we genetically engineer bacteria .
it actually is a Japanese be@@ et@@ le .
you can make a bi@@ oc@@ en@@ sor out of ye@@ ast to detect pollutants in water .
so it do@@ es@@ n 't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was in@@ competent , but do we like that person and how they inter@@ acted ?
they do this .
what do we do when we feel power@@ less ?
so I 'm watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
they raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
so what do the minds of the powerful versus the power@@ less look like ?
so powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more asser@@ tive and more confident , more optimistic .
they also tend to be able to think more abstr@@ ac@@ tly .
so there are a lot of differences . they take more risks .
so what does that mean ? when you think about power , people tended to think only about testosterone , because that was about dominance .
here are a couple more .
so you can be standing or you can be sitting .
so you 're folding up , you 're making yourself small .
risk tolerance , which is the gambling , we find that when you are in the high @@@ -@@ @ power pose condition , 86 percent of you will gam@@ ble .
and we 've all had the feeling , right ?
but the next question , of course , is , can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
this is in the lab , it 's this little task , it 's just a couple of minutes .
for some people it 's speaking at a school board meeting .
it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through , was the job interview .
so we bring people into a lab , and they do either high@@ - or low @@@ -@@ @ power poses again , they go through a very stres@@ s@@ ful job interview .
so this really sp@@ ik@@ es your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
I am an im@@ post@@ or .
one was that I realized , oh my g@@ os@@ h , I don 't feel like that anymore .
I don 't feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
and so I want to say to you , don 't fake it till you make it .
get your testosterone up . get your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
thank you .
they ner@@ v@@ ously agreed . I ner@@ v@@ ously started , and , of course , things are always harder than you think they 're going to be .
and they said , " Blue , blue , we love blue . let 's do it blue . "
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
I want to tell you two stories . both of them are in Africa .
and so as people get healthier , they also get we@@ alth@@ ier .
these are old @@@ -@@ @ hand farmers who 've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last 30 years .
so that 's about 50,000 people affected .
and we called all of the social investors we know .
this is Samuel . he 's a farmer .
it 's a 40 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old company , it understands manufacturing .
I look around at my si@@ bl@@ ings and my cou@@ sins -- and as I said , there are a lot of us -- and I see teachers and musicians , he@@ dge fund managers , designers .
it takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success .
instead , he went on to build a gl@@ it@@ tering empire of department stores .
his department stores confiscated , he spent the rest of his life in a relent@@ less pursuit of art and culture .
and this is the great team that helped us make it happen .
and in short order , thousands of people were building our machine .
the people who are attracted to these courses typically have a h@@ acker mentality .
and indeed , for quite a few people , taking this NA@@ ND@@ 2@@ Te@@ tr@@ is pilgri@@ mage , if you will , has turned into a life @@@ -@@ @ changing experience .
and with that in mind , I 'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
in each country , I 'm sure you have this thing called the parent @@@ -@@ @ teacher conference .
do you know about the parent @@@ -@@ @ teacher conference ?
and I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson .
by being President of R@@ ISD I 've gone deep into art , and art is a wonderful thing , fine art , pure art .
you know , when people say , " I don 't get art .
it 's about something in between .
you see it in all interesting art today , in all interesting businesses today . how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting .
but I found a sign for Russian @@@ -@@ @ speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
my favorite ones are " no plants . " why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? I 'm not sure .
it 's a hierarchy . we all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today , but as we know , it 's been disrupted .
and I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sand@@ box , and I said great .
but I would listen to people , hear their issues , draw in the sand , try to figure things out , and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing .
how often are you calling them , em@@ ailing them ?
if you don 't like the hotel , there 's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night .
and then he happened to stum@@ ble across a post about T@@ ask@@ Rab@@ bit .
yes , there 's actually a four @@@ -@@ @ stage , rigorous interview process that 's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the do@@ d@@ gy Rab@@ bits .
how to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities ? do we want them to be the same ?
now - ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- I love that word , Super@@ Rab@@ bit .
30 million ri@@ des have been shared on Car@@ pool@@ ing@@ .com.
you know , it 's very interesting .
I wanted to be a designer because I wanted to solve real problems .
( la@@ ughter ) And after a few months of this , I noticed that there were certain things that started to come up again and again and again .
( la@@ ughter ) The floors und@@ ulate , so you don 't end up walking around so much as kind of b@@ ouncing around the apartment , and there are bright colors in every direction .
for example , this hospital , designed by the Danish artist P@@ oul Ger@@ nes .
we evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous , and abundance meant survival .
the architect Em@@ manu@@ elle Mou@@ reaux uses this idea in her work a lot .
thank you .
in the 1990s , it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode , and in that mode , you could make micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic blood flow movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain .
we can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings , and we have a few bur@@ ge@@ oning biological measures .
well , you can 't compare oran@@ ges to wind@@ shi@@ elds .
and we steal their games . and we con@@ tri@@ ve them to our own purposes .
so a rational choice economist would say , well , you should take all non @@@ -@@ @ zero offers .
this is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world .
in doing this , what we 've discovered is that humans are liter@@ al can@@ aries in social exchanges .
it 's now in Virginia and London . and we built software that 'll link functional magnetic reson@@ ance imaging devices up over the Internet . I guess we 've done up to six machines at a time , but let 's just focus on two .
let me leave you with one thought in closing .
we just haven 't had the tools to look at inter@@ acting bra@@ ins simultaneously .
and as I look at the conversation , it strikes me that it 's focused on exactly the right topic , and at the same time , it 's missing the point entirely .
and business investment in gear -- in equipment and hardware and software -- is at an all @@@ -@@ @ time high .
so this red line is the employment @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ population ratio , in other words , the percentage of working @@@ -@@ @ age people in America who have work .
but the story is not just a recession story .
throughout all of history , if you wanted something written , a report or an article , you had to involve a person .
it was written by an algorithm .
it 's an endless debate and there 's no conclusive , single answer to it .
there has been one story , one development in human history that bent the curve , bent it just about 90 degrees , and it is a technology story .
so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when I look at what 's going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey .
and when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies , my single conclusion is that we ain 't seen nothing yet .
( la@@ ughter ) So here are the winners of a Top@@ Co@@ der programming challenge , and I assure you that nobody ca@@ res where these kids grew up , where they went to school , or what they look like .
all anyone ca@@ res about is the quality of the work , the quality of the ideas .
and I want to say to that very clearly : non@@ sense .
and when you write for the Quar@@ terly Journal of Economics , you have to use very dry and very circum@@ spec@@ t language .
I 'm with him ; I 'm going to echo his words : " I , for one , welcome our new computer over@@ lords . "
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ ks very much .
hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
his name is No@@ stra@@ dam@@ us , although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Se@@ an Con@@ ner@@ y . ( la@@ ughter ) And like most of you , I suspect , I don 't really believe that people can see into the future .
so they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published .
unfortunately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as in people who have had heart attacks .
now these are stories from basic science .
but when they went to look for these trials in the peer @@@ -@@ @ reviewed academic literature , what they found was a very different picture .
but that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't mean that I had a two @@@ -@@ @ headed coin .
and when they started obtaining the writ@@ e@@ ups of those trials through various different means , through Freedom of Information Act requests , through har@@ assing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent .
we won 't publish any journals , we won 't publish any trials , unless they 've been registered before they began .
and this is not a difficult problem to fix .
we 're always sort of small in the face of its exp@@ ans@@ e .
normally it lives on the top of Big Ben , because that 's where you get the best reception , but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation .
there 's a very short list of these places .
but what amaz@@ es me is Simon 's incredible geographic imagination .
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a h@@ ack@@ saw , you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud .
we can see the stars and the planets but we can 't see what holds them apart , or what draws them together .
electr@@ ons disappear in a kind of fu@@ z@@ z , and there is only energy .
( la@@ ughter ) Con@@ sci@@ ousness . I see all your faces ; I 've no idea what any of you are thinking .
it 's much easier if it 's not really there .
how many can we see ?
( la@@ ughter ) As I said , he s@@ wore too much .
there was an important lesson for me in that .
some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
and you can just imagine them .
it was@@ n 't just your standard installation .
now , I 've described two very immer@@ sive exhibitions , but I also believe that collections , individual objects , can also have that same power .
now , in our galleries , we show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread , and , again , hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October .
I want to put people in a contempl@@ ative frame of mind , where they 're prepared to be a little bit lost , to explore , to see the un@@ familiar in the familiar , or to try the unknown .
and , of course , I 'm dedic@@ ating it also to my grand@@ mother , whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles , especially for me when I was an activist , and being harassed by the police .
I 've got a bow@@ l full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here , gets it . "
over the past six months , I 've spent my time traveling . I think I 've done 60,000 miles , but without leaving my desk .
and then I struggled , because I was thinking to myself , " What should I talk ? what should I do ? it 's a TED audience .
you don 't believe me , do you ? ok@@ ay . ( appl@@ ause ) So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don 't understand .
people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen .
you see , I think what 's happened , perhaps , is that we 've not noticed that change I described earlier .
so I 'll put a little line up here which represents learning , and that 's how we used to do it . we could see things , understand them , take the time to put them into practice .
to understand the world that live in , we tell stories .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser .
let 's go to this Google Map , and I 'll show you how you can edit it .
and it 's exactly the same for the people who watch your production .
everything you 've seen today is built with the basic building blocks of the web : HTML , CSS and JavaScript .
that means it 's completely re@@ mix@@ able . it also means there 's no proprietary software . all you need is a web browser .
at the end of a conference in a hotel lobby once , I 'm literally on my way out the door and a colleague ch@@ ases me down .
feelings are tunnels .
wanting is medi@@ ated by this vast d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ er@@ gic network in and beyond the emotional brain .
research over the last 30 years has found that genital blood flow can increase in response to sex @@@ -@@ @ related stimul@@ i even if those sex @@@ -@@ @ related stimul@@ i are not also associated with the subjective experience of wanting and li@@ king .
which is an enormous range .
when I explained this to my husband , he gave me the best possible example .
no .
if you 're experiencing unwanted pain , talk to a medical provider .
is it sex @@@ -@@ @ related to have pressure directly against your cl@@ itor@@ is ?
does that tell him whether she wants or likes what 's happening ?
she recognized and articulated what she wanted and liked .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Appl@@ ause for lu@@ be , absolutely .
but I want to tell you a dar@@ ker listen @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ her @@@ -@@ @ words story .
but she said it again .
imagine you 're on the jury and you learn that the victim had org@@ as@@ ms .
let me remind you , org@@ asm is physiological ; it is a spontaneous , involuntary release of tension , generated in response to sex @@@ -@@ @ related stimul@@ i .
in the US it 's one in three women .
a little easier and safer for the survivors , one in three women .
one in six men .
( appl@@ ause ) Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : E@@ mil@@ y , come up here .
to which my answer in my mind is , what even is normal and why is that what you want your sexuality to be ?
to which the answer is always a res@@ ounding yes .
H@@ W : amazing . thank you so much .
H@@ W : thank you , you 're incredible .
( cell@@ o music starts ) You found me , you found me under a pile of broken memories with your steady , steady love .
you roc@@ ked me , you roc@@ ked me , you roc@@ ked me all through the night with your steady , steady love .
( cell@@ o music continues ) ( T@@ aps rhyth@@ m@@ ically ) You found me , you found me under a pile of broken memories with your steady , your steady , steady love .
and ever since that , migration has somewhat been a theme in my family .
but the question is , why is it obvious ?
when we do , however , make a turn into a side street , our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 @@@ -@@ @ degree angle .
maybe you 've had that experience as well .
but somehow you feel ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rous that day , and you suddenly discover that the two spots were actually only a single building apart .
what 's more , we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them .
so next time , when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place , you grab a be@@ er@@ mat , grab a n@@ ap@@ kin , and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design .
in the 19@@ 30s , Harry Bec@@ k applied the principles of schem@@ atic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever .
now the very key to the success of this map is in the omission of less important information and in the extreme simplification .
so when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago , I tried to make sense of that .
( la@@ ughter ) They were not geographically distorted .
so that 's what I did .
I plo@@ tted it into my own map of Dublin , and in the city center ...
and I built this city center bus map of the system , how it was five years ago .
I 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the qu@@ ays and West@@ mo@@ reland Street .
( la@@ ughter ) Now I can pro@@ ud@@ ly say -- ( Appl@@ ause ) I can pro@@ ud@@ ly say , as a public transport map , this diagram is an utter failure .
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ six people died . nearly 300,000 homes were lost .
there are important distribu@@ tional consequences , and they 're not what you always might think .
but while there might be some short @@@ -@@ @ term individual winners , our collective losses will far out@@ weigh them .
in New Orleans , the I @@@ -@@ @ 10 Twin sp@@ ans , with sections knoc@@ ked out in Kat@@ r@@ ina , have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge .
they 're splitting the cost of installing these green roof@@ s with home and building owners .
so some solutions to heat can provide for win @@@ -@@ @ win @@@ -@@ @ wins .
third , adapting to rising seas .
the Asian Cities Climate [ Change ] Resi@@ li@@ ence Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest man@@ gro@@ ves .
there are no quick fixes .
ok@@ ay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
it comes completely conscious . it 's got state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art lob@@ es .
I don 't know if you can get that here . ( la@@ ughter ) So , z@@ iz@@ zing away , and so - ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) - And for every one - I know , I drew this myself . thank you .
but I got a little bad news for you fol@@ ks . I got some bad news .
the gods are angry with me , or the gods are testing me , right ? or God , sing@@ ular , more recently , is punishing me or judging me .
but it was@@ n 't until we tested it in people that we actually knew .
and that suc@@ ks , right ? so 45 percent of men develop cancer . thirty @@@ -@@ @ eight percent of women develop cancer .
one in four men dies of cancer .
it 's outra@@ ge that we have this information and we can 't use it .
so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous .
fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States .
right ? when I got these results , I started talking to doctors , and they told me not to tell anyone , and my reaction is , " Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease ? "
and in biology , the numbers are even better .
it 's to be naked , dig@@ it@@ ally , in public . so you know more about me and my health than I know about you . it 's asym@@ metric now .
and so it do@@ es@@ n 't take all of us .
it 's sort of the good old , traditional form of terrorism , but it 's sort of been packaged for the 21st century .
one of the big things about countering terrorism is , how do you perceive it ?
because perception leads to your response to it .
you 're not really going to get 72 vir@@ g@@ ins in heaven .
we 've mentioned the health , but it needs consumers to buy into it .
we 've got to reveal the dangers in the product .
our target audience , it 's not just the producers of terrorism , as I 've said , the terrorists .
the father will probably kick himself for years to come that he did@@ n 't take that seat instead of his k@@ id .
the fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense . they are going to make mistakes .
we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive .
if we look at al Qaeda . Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a sou@@ k somewhere which not many people had heard of .
what I 'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently .
the first one has been du@@ bbed " law@@ fare , " for want of a better word .
but one of the first early cases on this was the O@@ mag@@ h Bom@@ bing .
it also meant , then , if you can imagine this , that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in .
but the problem is , we need more and more support for these ideas and cases .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @@@ -@@ @ up calls for us ?
maybe the Rol@@ ling St@@ ones has a place in this .
I did@@ n 't have the tools . I lacked the experience .
more precisely , the timber yard of a hardware store .
what else do tra@@ dies love ?
Tra@@ dies especially , and I 'm a tradi@@ e myself , we love egg and bac@@ on rolls .
do you want to contribute ? because we haven 't got any money . "
I did@@ n 't know about community health .
I had to learn all these things .
for me , it 's really crucial to get to these young , vulnerable men and women .
it 's very empowering and ca@@ th@@ ar@@ tic to do that .
we need those services , and suicide do@@ es@@ n 't discriminate at all .
if you 're going to open up conversations , I tell the guys , you need to find a comfortable place to open up and have a conversation , whether it 's at the pu@@ b , it 's going for a walk , it 's after Fo@@ o@@ ty .
find that really comfortable place to have the conversation .
and I 've seen it . I 've done this .
it 's because perception is grounded in our experience .
now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before .
they begin with a question .
now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . it 's ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily a bad thing . if you 're not sure that 's a pre@@ dat@@ or , it 's too late .
so how can we ever do anything new ? well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
the first step was to ask a question .
B@@ L : " can you help me , Henry ? " what good scientist says that , right ?
what you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
in 1975 , I met in Florence a professor , Car@@ lo Ped@@ ret@@ ti , my former professor of art history , and today a world @@@ -@@ @ renowned schol@@ ar of Leon@@ ardo da V@@ inc@@ i .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
we 're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future .
I am very , very happy to be amid@@ st some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're reflecting on my glasses .
I have listened to the three previous speakers , and guess what happened ?
we import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba .
if the government 's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people , such a government is driven by self @@@ -@@ @ interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion .
they talk to international donors .
( la@@ ughter ) We have 81 units of local government .
Hy@@ per@@ connectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now , 24 / 7 .
the sense of co @@@ -@@ @ ownership , the free publicity , the added value , all helped drive sales .
it may have jeopardized short @@@ -@@ @ term sales , but it builds lasting , long @@@ -@@ @ term loyalty based on shared values .
for the true selves of companies to come through , openness is paramount , but radical openness is not a solution , because when everything is open , nothing is open .
companies can give their employees and customers more control or less . they can worry about how much openness is good for them , and what needs to stay closed .
five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Al@@ ice in Won@@ der@@ land .
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
the other thing I would add is that this is not a new view .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
if you include Internet tele@@ phony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
or think of investment . take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 .
and then finally , the one stati@@ stic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen : the export @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ GDP ratio .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
so de@@ ar@@ th of data in the debate is one reason .
he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world .
which brings me to my second point .
think of France and the current debate about immigration .
" foreign aid is the most aid to poor people , " is about the most home @@@ -@@ @ biased thing you can find .
if any of the more row@@ di@@ er children questioned the authority of the parents , they were s@@ col@@ ded .
" look what they 've been hiding from you , " he said .
so that 's why we 're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
and it 's getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that 's great . we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems .
it 's the system which underp@@ ins all these other systems .
so this is a guy called Se@@ b B@@ acon . he 's a computer program@@ mer , and he built a site called Ala@@ ve@@ tel@@ i , and what it is , it 's a Freedom of Information platform .
I want to see the evidence behind why that 's so .
it was just , " Because I say so .
distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits .
we need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings .
democracy is not simply a question of structures .
I was starting to stay out a little bit late , etc . , etc .
so this was an opportunity . if they were asking me whether I loved them or not , then I mu@@ st@@ n 't love them , which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to .
on the way to the children 's home , I started to ask myself , " What 's happened to me ? "
when I got to the - For the next four , five years , I was held in four different children 's homes .
for doing this , I was incarcer@@ ated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center . it was a virtual prison for young people .
I 'm 17 years old , and they had a p@@ added cell .
I slowly became aware that I knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year .
in the 17th century , a woman named Gi@@ ulia T@@ of@@ ana had a very successful per@@ fume business .
in fact , just having a dise@@ ased appearance or odd sexual acts , these things are also things that give us a lot of dis@@ g@@ ust .
these are dis@@ g@@ ust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like .
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of dis@@ g@@ ust sensitivity .
when the room sm@@ elled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men .
it makes less sense that an emo@@ tion that was built to prevent me from ing@@ esting po@@ ison should predict who I 'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election .
and this gets me back to my research .
I presently , or currently , work with smart materials , and a smart ther@@ mo @@@ -@@ @ b@@ ime@@ tal .
I resolved to give back .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know @@@ -@@ @ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
from the Arab Spring to the Anna Haz@@ are movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
today , even Bi@@ har is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
we need to accelerate these shifts .
we will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
and so I want to tell you about that first , and then go on into where I think love is going .
it 's a little bit like when you are mad@@ ly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot .
but anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them .
I think there 's a Dar@@ w@@ ini@@ an purpose to this .
the whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team .
the kind of part of the mind when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
people live for love .
it can be focused on nobody .
the first is women working , moving into the workforce .
and I think that the television is like the global cam@@ p@@ fire .
foremost , women are starting to express their sexuality .
it may decline some more .
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you 've made love to them .
they want to commit suicide or kill somebody else .
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it , too , the magic of it .
and sure enough -- I 've never been in one , but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it 's crazy and it 's nois@@ y and it 's exciting .
he did@@ n 't want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he did@@ n 't seem very interested in me whatsoever .
as we know , babies are born without their full muscle development , and that includes the brain .
this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable .
I go@@ og@@ led his prisoner ID number .
conditions are so bad that in 2012 the entire prison went on a hunger strike .
as I sc@@ rolled through case after case of human rights violations at this prison , suddenly , he became a person to me again .
my mom 's face just collapsed in on itself .
not a single one tells you how to do it ! "
he 's talking about non @@@ -@@ @ violence .
think about it .
wounds are sc@@ ary , they are nasty , they are ick@@ y , it is why most of us look away when we don@@ ate blood .
anger is important ; it is the fire that cau@@ ter@@ izes our wounds and lets them scar over and heal .
too much anger , and yes , you 'll get third @@@ -@@ @ degree burns .
an ap@@ ology ? an explanation ?
a front @@@ -@@ @ row seat to their torture chamber ?
in all those years , with that guy cha@@ ined to my side , I got a lot done .
pretty soon , that little pos@@ se started to crowd me out of my own body and my own experience .
I told him that I wished him a lifetime full of healing and that I for@@ gave him .
I mean , really alone , giving birth to a stranger , saying hel@@ lo to a girl that I had@@ n 't spoken to in seven years .
( la@@ ughter ) Not him , the mon@@ ster that I created .
you 've probably all heard of Google 's Project Glass .
so these are my illusion glasses .
winter is like magic . it 's a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all dis@@ appears .
Mt : so over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
there is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
wake up .
and that can be seen directly through a micro@@ scope , and I 'm going to show you some of this today .
you have fragments of other shells . you have oli@@ vine .
you have bits of a volcan@@ o . there 's a little bit of a volcan@@ o there . you have tube wor@@ ms .
so here we see , for example , a spon@@ ge sp@@ ic@@ ule , two bits of coral here , that 's a sea ur@@ chin spine . really some amazing stuff .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe it , and I 'd go around dis@@ sec@@ ting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
there are places in Africa where they do the mining of je@@ wels , and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean , and it 's like literally looking at tiny je@@ wels through the micro@@ scope .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
and you can see here that that is -- that 's sort of v@@ apor@@ ized , and that material is holding this little cl@@ ump of little sand grains together .
now here 's a grain of sand that is from the Moon , and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there .
the first thing I 'm going to tell you about this mam@@ mal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly .
so , magnificent creature , is@@ n 't it ?
who here thought of a bat ?
b@@ ats have learned and evolved how to deal with this .
we 're a visual species . when scientists first realized that b@@ ats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night , we did@@ n 't believe it .
and if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e bat , you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it .
very big ears , strange nose leaves , but teen@@ y @@@ -@@ @ tiny eyes .
so among and within b@@ ats is a huge variation in their ability to use sen@@ sory perception .
now this is going to be important for what I 'm going to tell you later during the talk .
however , I also think it 's got to do with the fact that b@@ ats come out at night , and we don 't really understand them . we 're a little frigh@@ tened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us .
b@@ ats are usually synony@@ mous with some type of evil events .
and indeed , in this image , you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five b@@ ats .
so , wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth ?
b@@ ats in the trop@@ ics are major pol@@ lin@@ ators of many plants .
and what about the second ? what about health ?
so I want you to look at the person beside you .
this is where we 're going to go , and as I said before , I really believe that the secret of ever@@ lasting youth lies within the bat gen@@ ome .
but we are going to have to understand it a bit better .
some ? how about 30 ?
it lived for up to 42 years , and this bat 's still alive in the wild today .
well , typically , in mammals there is a relationship between body size , metabol@@ ic rate , and how long you can live for , and you can predict how long a mam@@ mal can live for given its body size .
and hopefully in the next five years , I 'll be giving you a TE@@ D@@ Talk on that .
just imagine what that would be like .
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night sk@@ ies , and you see this beautiful flying mam@@ mal , I want you to smile . thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
my gir@@ l@@ friend at the time , who 's no longer my gir@@ l@@ friend - ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) - h@@ ated it .
parents would shu@@ ff@@ le kids away from us . ( la@@ ughter ) But we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey , and it was a real journey .
so in 2007 , we brought the campaign across here , and it was , it set the stage for the campaign .
so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets .
( la@@ ughter ) And he said , " I 'm doing it for Mo@@ v@@ ember . " and I said , " So am I. " And I said , " T@@ ell me your Mo@@ v@@ ember story . "
we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
so they identified that as a priority , and then they 've got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic , essentially the same topic .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago .
the parad@@ ox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically , we haven 't actually gotten any hap@@ pier .
maybe these people are right . maybe mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering is a bad thing .
any of those yes responses are what we called mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .
this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis , and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they 're focused on the present , when they 're not mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .
it 's amazing .
how does that depend on what people are doing ?
we served together in Iraq and Afghanistan .
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that be so cool , and that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
stic@@ ker templates .
making a switch .
so , there 's this guy , right ? Victor@@ ian era .
but computers don 't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries .
she says , " I don 't know , my mom always did it ! "
they 're just the right tools for the job .
you know , anybody who 's read a children 's book knows that love makes things real .
if you love a word , it becomes real .
we 're missing California from American English .
and this is a little @@@ -@@ @ known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
they show the word , but they don 't show any context .
what newspaper was it in ? what book ?
so I 'm really sorry . but when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language , or a flag stands for the United States , it 's a symbol of the country -- then you 're using it sy@@ nec@@ do@@ ch@@ ically .
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight @@@ -@@ @ track tape .
it was@@ n 't really what people needed .
they 're our natural garbage collectors .
and another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brigh@@ test young minds in the world .
it 's been fantastic .
much of the dec@@ eption is everyday . in fact , a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day , as Da@@ ve suggested .
so it 's about 6 : 30 now , suggests that most of us should have lied .
here we have Di@@ ogen@@ es with his lan@@ tern .
they 're called the But@@ ler , the S@@ ock P@@ up@@ pet and the Chinese Water Army .
now , the S@@ ock P@@ up@@ pet , on the other hand , is a totally different animal . the s@@ ock pup@@ pet is@@ n 't about ambiguity , per se . it 's about identity .
in North America , we call this A@@ stro@@ tur@@ fing , and A@@ stro@@ tur@@ fing is very common now . there 's a lot of concerns about it .
I can assure you there 's dec@@ eption there .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
all right , well , what about online dating ?
and what we found was very , very interesting .
here 's an example of the men and the height .
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile .
that diag@@ onal line is the truth line . if their do@@ t 's on it , they were telling exactly the truth .
but what 's really important here is , look at all those do@@ ts .
the first is , we 're really bad at detecting dec@@ eption , really bad . fifty @@@ -@@ @ four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not .
if I were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ?
most of you would say that one of the cu@@ es you look at is the eyes . the eyes are the window to the soul .
let 's turn to now , the net@@ worked age .
that is crazy . we 're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we 've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear , but we 're in an environment where we 're recording everything .
you remember those A@@ stro@@ tur@@ fing reviews that we were talking about before ? well , when they write a fake review , they have to post it somewhere , and it 's left behind for us .
remember , I study dec@@ eption . I can tell if you don 't raise your hand .
all right . slightly more for B.
excellent . here 's the answer .
those cold , hard w@@ inters , I love it .
let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review . the first is that li@@ ars tend to think about narrative . they make up a story : who ? and what happened ? and that 's what happened here .
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
this is@@ n 't a dec@@ eption @@@ -@@ @ detection machine to tell if your gir@@ l@@ friend 's lying to you on text messaging .
well , let 's forget dec@@ eption for a bit . one of the big ideas , I believe , is that we 're leaving these huge traces behind .
my out@@ box for email is massive , and I never look at it . I write all the time , but I never look at my record , at my trace .
now , if we bring it back to dec@@ eption , there 's a couple of take @@@ -@@ @ away things here .
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms .
when I sat down to write a book about creativity , I realized that the steps were reversed .
so many artists speak about needing to be open , to embrace experience , and that 's hard to do when you have a ligh@@ ted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus .
Jul@@ ie Bur@@ stein : is@@ n 't that a wonderful story ?
he 's standing on the left with his pa@@ int@@ brush in one hand and his pal@@ ette in the other .
Richard Ser@@ ra : I was standing there looking at it , and I realized that Vel@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ ez was looking at me , and I thought , " Oh . I 'm the subject of the painting . "
Jo@@ el is a New Yor@@ ker , and his studio for many years was in Chel@@ sea , with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center , and he photograph@@ ed those buildings in every sort of light .
on 9 / 11 , Jo@@ el was@@ n 't in New York . he was out of town , but he raced back to the city , and raced down to the site of the destruction .
and it was such a blow that it wo@@ ke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , I guess .
I thought , " Oh , if there 's no pictures , then there 'll be no record . we need a record . "
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lin@@ gered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night .
J@@ B : you have to take a picture . that sense of urgency , of the need to get to work , is so powerful in Jo@@ el 's story .
it 's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the finger@@ marks where the po@@ tter pin@@ ched it .
it 's not like I can just check it in the lab .
I need a woman volunteer . where can I get one in India ?
close your eyes . "
because I tried to make it intimate .
they also refused . finally , I decide , use sanitary pad myself .
but I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton . it 's not working .
that is my idea .
that 's all . a school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad .
some people , like John Len@@ non , imagine that without nationalism , the world will be a peaceful paradise .
well , nationalism tells me that my nation is unique , and that I have special obligations towards my nation .
this is something that Christianity knew very well , which is why in Christian art , as [ opposed to ] Hollywood , Satan is usually depicted as a gor@@ geous hun@@ k .
in the 19@@ 30s , when Germans looked in the fascist mirror , they saw Germany as the most beautiful thing in the world .
and dictatorship meant that all the land was owned by a single ruler or by a small olig@@ arch .
ca : but somehow , at least with corporations , you can imagine market mechanisms where they can be taken down .
ca : so in " Hom@@ o De@@ us , " you argue that this would be the century when humans kind of became gods , either through development of artificial intelligence or through genetic engineering .
so being a mechanical engineer , being at MI@@ T and having lots of resources available to me , I thought I 'd try to do something about it .
and we could not believe , and we were telling the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , " Lo@@ ok how easy agriculture is . "
you should see the rub@@ b@@ ish - ( Appl@@ ause ) -- You should see the rub@@ b@@ ish that we have best@@ owed on un@@ suspec@@ ting African people .
the first principle of aid is respect .
we don 't work from offices .
can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
Government ? forget about it !
however , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : none were started by one person .
one first saying that I 'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eye@@ sight worse .
we actually know how to test that statement .
the issue is what happens with these guys that actually indul@@ ge into playing video games like five hours per week , 10 hours per week , 15 hours per week .
another saying that I 'm sure you have all heard around : video games lead to attention problems and greater distr@@ ac@@ tability .
because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color .
the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight .
it do@@ es@@ n 't really feel like playing min@@ dless action video games .
they don 't play 10 hours of action games in a row .
they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks .
there is an entertainment software industry which is extremely de@@ ft at coming up with appealing products that you can 't resist .
it 's about making new forms of life .
narr@@ ator : the mechanical be@@ asts will not get their energy from food , but from the wind .
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .
in fact , this is better than a wheel , because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach , you will notice it 's very hard to do .
as soon as it touches the water -- you should hear a sound of running air .
( sound of running air ) Yes !
thank you .
this is a part of the nose of the Anim@@ aris Per@@ cip@@ i@@ ere .
the wind may turn , but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind .
now , planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do , and let me tell you a story .
you don 't plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework .
now , 20 percent , well , that 's a fairly huge figure , you might think , but you 've still got 80 percent left of the problem , right ?
if you can reduce traffic even somewhat , then congestion will go down much faster than you might think .
now , congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm on January 3 , 2006 , and the first picture here is a picture of Stockholm , one of the typical streets , January 2 .
but it was fun anyway .
I mean , the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared , surely they must be dis@@ content in a way .
and where did they go ? if we can understand this , then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this .
they 're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along .
you should just n@@ udge them in the right direction .
as a cross @@@ -@@ @ country sk@@ ier and member of the Australian ski team headed towards the Winter Olympics , I was on a training bike ride with my fellow team@@ mates .
I was air@@ lifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney .
I broke five ribs on my left side .
I had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above , as if it was happening to someone else .
after 10 days , I made the decision to return to my body .
you 're what we call a partial para@@ ple@@ gic , and you 'll have all of the injuries that go along with that .
how amazing is that ?
how often in life do you get to make friend@@ ships , judgment @@@ -@@ @ free , purely based on spirit ?
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward , we would never be the same .
I remember D@@ ad pushing me outside in my wheelchair , wrapped in a pl@@ aster body cast , and feeling the sun on my face for the first time .
and she said , " You 're going to get depressed . "
in the spinal ward , that 's normal . you 're in a wheelchair . that 's normal .
if I can 't walk , then I might as well fly . "
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) And then I thought , " Why stop there ?
I 'm a multi@@ t@@ asking person , and I push my students to fly through a very creative , multi@@ t@@ asking design process .
so someone tells us the story about super@@ t@@ as@@ kers , so this two percent of people who are able to control multi@@ t@@ asking environment .
any claim that al Qaeda had to being protec@@ tors of Islam against the Western c@@ rus@@ aders was dro@@ wned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims .
but they did@@ n 't spend a lot of time re@@ living the glory days .
when he was writing a Broad@@ way show , I would be outside of the door .
people have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magne@@ ts to let them know that the revolution is near , so stock up .
did I mention they 're gor@@ geous ?
and they 're scientific models ? ( laugh@@ s ) As you might have gu@@ essed , I 'm a tissue engineer , and this is a video of some of the beating heart that I 've engineered in the lab .
and the later it fails , the worse the consequences .
it would be like having a clinical trial on a chip .
so some people think that these models sound well and good , but ask , " Well , are these really as good as the rat ? "
a drug for the heart can get metabol@@ ized in the liver , and some of the by@@ products may be stored in the fat .
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you 're going to take are going to work on your cancer ?
this actually was@@ n 't so great for the development of the aviation industry , and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government was interested in ramp@@ ing up the production of military air@@ planes .
in 2002 , Nelson O@@ tw@@ oma , a Kenyan social scientist , discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment .
AIDS , he heard , was lethal , and treatment was not offered . this was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries .
clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe .
treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly .
today , eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs .
they also stop passing on the virus .
today , all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years .
in 2010 , UNI@@ TA@@ ID established the Medic@@ ines Pat@@ ent Pool for HIV .
so a classic experiment here , in that what we did was we moved the sun .
and look at what the be@@ et@@ le does .
every now and then , when they climb on top of the ball , they wipe their face .
this is a d@@ ung be@@ et@@ le . watch what he 's doing .
so what we 're looking at here is a behavior called path integration .
so let 's see what happens when we put this be@@ et@@ le to the test with a similar experiment .
maybe like an evil laugh : " W@@ u@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha . "
I 'm not supposed to be walking down the a@@ is@@ le , and be like , " H@@ i , Jack . " that 's not cool .
so my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim , so to , you know , Indians , and L@@ ati@@ no@@ s , everyone , if you 're brown -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Here 's my advice to my brown friends .
she 's gone . "
you see , my si@@ bl@@ ings and I are the first generation to go to university , so for a family of immigrants , this was kind of a big deal .
but fortunately , I had a secret weapon with me , which was a chart that had the average income of all of the graduates from Stan@@ ford PhD programs , and then the average income of all the drop@@ outs from Stan@@ ford graduate programs .
thank you .
here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of for@@ aging , or hunting and gathering societies .
I 'm not sure if I had any impact on the one @@@ -@@ @ day strike , but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me .
so it 's a real @@@ -@@ @ time thing . it 's much quicker . it 's happening on a constant basis , and the journalist is always playing catch up .
it was a 7.6 magnitude . it was fairly big .
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source , and in this case , these guys were New York food blog@@ gers .
this is from H@@ ama .
we start to see that it 's got a median , so it 's a two @@@ -@@ @ lane bridge .
we see the distinctive rail@@ ing that we saw the guys throwing the bodies over .
we have free Internet tools that allow us , help us do this kind of investigation .
he may or may not have been the first person to climb E@@ ve@@ rest , more than 30 years before Ed@@ m@@ und H@@ illary .
there is not the s@@ ligh@@ test prospect of any gain whatsoever .
no one had ever done this . I was 26 at the time .
beyond that , I did@@ n 't see anyone for 10 weeks .
peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do .
what do they bring ? they bring this fab@@ ulous diversity , expensive for companies . and what does that deliver ?
when I talked to their CEO , he had this great line .
E@@ ts@@ y is providing goods that people make themselves and they 're selling it in a marketplace .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
who would have thought that two young guys and a start @@@ -@@ @ up would beat out Google Video ? why ?
so I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now , and a Pe@@ ers , Inc. company , because I 've spent the last two years doing that in Paris .
every single decision , I have to think about what is right for both sides .
it took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right .
I 'm a neuro@@ scientist , and I study decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
a few years ago , my colleagues and I were interested in how a brain chemical called ser@@ ot@@ onin would influence people 's decisions in social situations .
( " official ! chocolate stops you being gr@@ um@@ py " ) Che@@ ese ? chocolate ? where did that come from ?
we gave people this horri@@ ble @@@ -@@ @ t@@ asting drink that affected their try@@ p@@ top@@ han levels .
so there you have it : the evolution of a head@@ line .
I think these fol@@ ks meant well , but had I taken them up on their offers , I would have been going beyond the science , and good scientists are careful not to do this .
I have to say , this sounds awesome . ( la@@ ughter ) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so I went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products .
trial or no trial , these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain .
a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuro@@ scientists at MI@@ T fig@@ ured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling ne@@ ural activity in a specific part of their brain .
really cool stuff .
but the promise of neuro@@ science has led to some really high expectations and some over@@ blown , un@@ proven claims .
the brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula , a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion .
so based on the same logic , I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone .
so , Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people 's oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in , this increases their trust , em@@ pa@@ thy and cooperation .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
it 's like , on Facebook , you have friends only from -- it 's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook .
people are c@@ rying , and she came , she read the text , and she started to cry .
if it 's an image , they may read it .
so you can see they are still sh@@ y , they don 't want to show their faces , but they want to spread the message .
it 's a two @@@ -@@ @ way story . it 's Israelis and Iran@@ ians sending the same message , one to each other .
and then it became news .
because you 're not in the Middle East .
and again , something amazing happened , something that we did@@ n 't have on the first wave of the campaign .
just people sending their pictures .
my name is R@@ onn@@ y E@@ dry , and I 'm 41 , I 'm an Israeli , I 'm a father of two , I 'm a husband , and I 'm a graphic designer . I 'm teaching graphic design .
so to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it 's too late , because when it 's going to be too late , it 's going to be too late .
maybe as people , because especially in Israel , we 're in a democracy . we have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
when I was a child , I lived in California , which is , you know , mostly a very nice place to live , but for me as a child , California could also be a little sc@@ ary .
these were the fears that dan@@ ced in the imag@@ inations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name .
but , " as Mel@@ ville put it , " they dre@@ aded c@@ anni@@ b@@ als . "
so the fiscal cl@@ iff , I was told that that 's too partisan a thing to say , although I can 't remember which party it 's supporting or attacking .
they even like Medic@@ aid , even though that goes to the poor and indi@@ gent , which you might think would have less support .
and it has not been the case for most of modern American history .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic .
with complete control of everything the audience can see , mo@@ vi@@ em@@ akers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their dec@@ ep@@ tions .
and that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection .
[ ' Academy Award for Special Effects - ( First Year of Category ) " ] ( Explo@@ sion ) [ " ' 2012 ' ( 2009 ) " ] Governor : it seems to me that the worst is over .
they 're now working on their ninth edition , which they began in 1930 , and they 've reached the letter P.
the World Wide Web , the French are told , ought to be referred to as " la to@@ ile d '@@ ar@@ a@@ ig@@ nee mon@@ di@@ ale " -- the Global Spi@@ der Web -- recommendations that the French g@@ aily ignore .
we see it in the constant appearance of s@@ lan@@ g and j@@ ar@@ gon , of the historical change in languages , in divergence of dialec@@ ts and the formation of new languages .
the problem is , which ver@@ bs go in which constructions ?
the ver@@ b is the chassis of the sentence .
for example , the d@@ ative construction in English .
how are these constru@@ als reflected in language ?
so , when you think of the event as causing the mu@@ ff@@ in to go somewhere -- where you 're doing something to the mu@@ ff@@ in -- you say , " Give the mu@@ ff@@ in to the mouse . "
so which ver@@ bs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the ver@@ b specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change .
it 's very hard to find any example of abstract language that is not based on some concrete met@@ aph@@ or .
I think most people understand the intent behind that .
so the puzzle is , why are bribes , pol@@ ite requests , solic@@ itations and threats so often ve@@ iled ?
the simplest example of this is in the pol@@ ite request .
on the other hand , you want the dam@@ n gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole .
and you can think of it in terms of a game @@@ -@@ @ theore@@ tic pay@@ off matrix .
it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
everything 's going fine , and we see the anxious thought .
and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those stor@@ y@@ lines and patterns of mind .
we can 't change every little thing that happens to us in life , but we can change the way that we experience it .
and the mosqu@@ ito has killed more humans than wars and plague .
so why is it spreading so fast ?
and the answer is this thing .
well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosqu@@ ito population .
clearly the product you 've got has got to be safe to humans .
fine . we don 't want a lasting environmental impact .
the male can 't b@@ ite you , won 't b@@ ite you , do@@ es@@ n 't have the mouth parts to b@@ ite you .
and the second is a phenomenon that males are very , very good at finding females .
so the males will go out , they 'll look for females , they 'll mate . if they mate successfully , then no off@@ spring .
and now what we 're doing is we 're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000 , so we can see this work at big scale .
you want to release them so that you get good coverage of your area .
so if you 've been following the news , you 've heard that there 's a pack of giant aster@@ oids headed for the United States , all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years .
borrow a lot of money , pay it off , pay it off , pay it off , get down to near zero , and ban@@ g ! -- World War I.
but we pay it off , pay it off , pay it off , and then , what 's this ?
now how did we do this ? how did we go from being hun@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ ga@@ there@@ rs 10,000 years ago to building these gig@@ antic cities in just a few thousand years ?
this was a golden age of bi@@ parti@@ san@@ ship , at least in terms of the parties ' ability to work together and solve grand national problems .
so there 's a lot we can do , but who 's going to push them to do it ?
now , why is that happening to us ? why is the inequality rising ?
this graph shows the steady rise of out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ wedlock births since the 1960s .
we are becoming a nation of just two classes .
so once again , we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing .
as before , we 've got a problem , we 've got to start working on this , we 've got to do something , and what 's wrong with you people that you don 't see my threat ?
when I asked people their associations with the wheelchair , they used words like " limitation , " " fear , " " pity " and " restriction . "
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
you 're all part of the art@@ work too .
but well before my imagination was my vocation , my imagination saved my life .
I was the C@@ ous@@ in O@@ liver of the sit@@ com of the K@@ ro@@ soc@@ z@@ ka family , the new k@@ id who came out of nowhere .
and I would like to say that life was totally easy with them .
he ran and worked in a factory .
an author visited our school , Jack Gan@@ tos .
I just cou@@ ld@@ n 't wait to get to that classroom every day .
well , in English class , in ninth grade , my friend John , who was sitting next to me , laugh@@ ed a little bit too hard .
on the evening of my 14th birthday , I was given this table , and we had Chinese food .
I tap@@ ed it to the top left hand of my table , and as you can see , it 's still there .
( la@@ ughter ) And a video camera .
and all the color just dra@@ ined from his face , and he looked at me , and he said , " For@@ get everything you learned . "
because he had just invested a significant amount of money in my college education .
and I received an email from an editor at Ran@@ dom House with a subject line , " Nice work ! " ex@@ clamation point .
the local book@@ store made a big deal of it .
my grand@@ parents , they were in the middle of it .
Mrs. Al@@ is@@ ch cut in front of the line and said , " I taught him how to read . " ( la@@ ughter ) And then something happened that changed my life .
for a two @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old , that is like a tat@@ too . ( la@@ ughter ) You know ? you only get one birthday per year .
I just finished the ninth book in the " Lun@@ ch Lady " series , which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime .
now , I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results .
a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized , and in the absence of good health care systems , almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing .
as funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict , you can see why this context becomes very , very attractive .
now , in order for a clinical trial to be considered eth@@ ically acceptable , participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand , and must freely consent to participate in the trial .
unfortunately , this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries .
in addition , they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends .
thank you .
" I haven 't heard from my d@@ ad in years . "
so I asked the girls , " How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers ? "
it was a huge success .
and the girls decided to make it an annual event .
that 's worse than not having him here at all . "
image is powerful , but also , image is superficial .
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
it 's out of your control , and it 's awesome , and it 's not a career path .
here 's me on the same day as this shoot .
here 's me at a sl@@ umber party a few days before I shot French Vo@@ gue .
and I think the answer that they 're looking for is , " If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er and you have sh@@ ini@@ er hair , you will be so happy and fab@@ ulous . "
thank you .
what you learn when you go to Australia is the Austr@@ alians are very competitive .
now , sunlight , of course , comes into this .
and I as a child was fed co@@ d liver oil by my grand@@ mother .
so what I 'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town .
high vitamin D levels , I think , are a marker for sunlight exposure , and sunlight exposure , in methods I 'm going to show , is good for heart disease .
anyway , I came back from Australia , and despite the obvious risks to my health , I moved to A@@ ber@@ de@@ en .
but I also became interested in research , and in particular I became interested in this substance , nit@@ ric oxide .
and I started doing research , and we found , very ex@@ ci@@ tingly , that the skin produces nit@@ ric oxide .
it arises in the skin .
and I then moved back to Edinburgh .
I actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight .
they still have old black@@ boards and what@@ not .
( la@@ ughter ) And this young man , his name is -- his last name Cruz -- he loved it . that 's all over his Facebook page and it 's gone viral .
ye@@ ah , and then when I ask you a question , there are only three possible answers : yes , si@@ r ; no , si@@ r ; and no excuse , si@@ r .
Don 't start telling me why you did@@ n 't do something .
they come to respect him .
the last chapter in my book is called " The Gift of a Good Start . "
that 's what 's going on . and that 's what I found .
and that 's the key to success .
we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day .
it devastated me when my mother did that to me .
I don 't know how many of you are New Yor@@ kers , but there were these ten@@ ement buildings , and these women were always hanging out one of the windows , lean@@ ing on a pil@@ low .
we don 't have time to waste for that .
we can still make the pieces . we can make the right pieces .
it has eight motors , four on the knees and four on the hip .
but after a very short while , you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch " The Wizard of O@@ z " together .
it totally dominated her imagination for months .
he was only three at the time .
compare this to 1939 with " The Wizard of O@@ z . "
by making friends with everybody and being a leader .
I finished my quest , I got the girl .
and we also have some ter@@ rific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional and del@@ ight@@ ful as Her@@ mi@@ one and Kat@@ n@@ iss are , these are still war movies .
so try to meet that bar .
last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
the definition of man@@ hood is already turning up@@ side down .
maybe it 's not just the spar@@ kly dress .
I want more qu@@ ests like that .
it stops .
I learned about sharing . I learned about cam@@ ar@@ ad@@ er@@ ie .
most of all , I learned about love .
Mar@@ tha G@@ ell@@ horn , who 's one of my heroes , once said , " You can only love one war . the rest is responsibility . "
I went on to cover many , many , many wars after that , so many that I lost count , but there was nothing like Sarajevo .
what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo , and I don 't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .
they don 't get their money out .
and that was just a small percentage of the dead .
and that 's pretty much why I do it .
but there will always be another war . "
who ca@@ res about Syria ? who ca@@ res about Bosnia ?
who here has had surgery ?
it 's hard to teach , and it 's not all that easy to learn .
we build on that and we take people , hopefully , to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant .
and I think that we can develop some tools to do so .
and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can 't talk to .
maybe we have something to learn as well .
so here 's what we think we want to do : imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously .
Don 't they just pop into your head ?
" now you 're showing your true colors , " M@@ om says . she thinks , " Why does he take after his d@@ ad ? "
that 's right -- a novel , basically , is writing one sentence , then , without violating the scope of the first one , writing the next sentence .
take a look at this sentence : " one morning , as Greg@@ or Sam@@ sa was wa@@ king up from anxious dreams , he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a mon@@ strous ver@@ min@@ ous bug . "
we can play all night long .
why ? because it 's ti@@ ring and we feel fatigue .
of course , my work was very amateur , but let 's turn to more famous examples .
so what happens when little artists get locked in , ban@@ ished or even killed ?
some people turn into roc@@ kers like this .
you know the song " I would love to be on TV " ? why would we love it ?
in school , the military or even in a mental institution , once you make people do it , they enjoy it .
just do it !
I don 't look like a typical domestic violence survi@@ vor .
it was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
to me , this is the sadd@@ est and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don 't : it 's incredibly dangerous to leave an ab@@ user .
thank you .
but I 'm slowly coming to this horri@@ fying realization that my students just might not be learning anything .
this happens one day : I 'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology : viruses and how they attack .
it 's b@@ oring , who ca@@ res , and it suc@@ ks . "
but what a lot of people don 't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick . "
now , the story that I start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story .
once upon a time , there 's this happy little bacter@@ ium .
because it took a lot of craf@@ ty work to infec@@ t this bacter@@ ium .
and what 's interesting about this is now , whenever this bacteria has babies , the babies also have the virus DNA in them .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
so a professional science writer would say , " That has to go .
we have to change it to something much more technical . "
it 's the world of people who need to work ultra @@@ -@@ @ flexi@@ bly , if they 're to work at all .
they 'd have to be book@@ able in about the next minute .
and it 's not just cat@@ e@@ rers , it 's hot@@ eli@@ ers , it 's retailers , it 's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses .
they 've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings .
and this booking is within all the parameters for each individual .
and it 's monitoring their reliability .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
she may be interested in providing local services to her community : Babysitting , local deliveries , pet care .
she may have pos@@ sessions that she would like to trade at times she do@@ es@@ n 't need them .
these are good sites , but I believe we can go a step further .
markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
suppose we stopped taking that for granted .
so imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage mark@@ up into each transaction .
and the creator very consider@@ ately offered a re@@ play for her mom .
it 's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies .
a few months later , the country of Estonia decided that all of its first gra@@ ders should learn to code .
you can also code to interact with the physical world around you .
( c@@ ric@@ kets ch@@ ir@@ ping ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( ch@@ om@@ ping ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) As kids are creating projects like this , they 're learning to code , but even more importantly , they 're coding to learn .
when you learn to code , it opens up for you to learn many other things .
he wanted to keep score .
he took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish e@@ ats the little fish .
so then , each time the big fish e@@ ats the little fish , he will incre@@ ment the score , and the score will go up by one .
when you become fluent with reading and writing , it 's not something that you 're doing just to become a professional writer .
I get it .
in fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents bat@@ ted an e@@ yel@@ ash either .
I was not an activist .
[ " what does equality mean to you ? " ] [ " Marriage " ] [ " Freedom " ] [ " Civil rights " ] [ " T@@ reat every person as you 'd treat yourself " ] It 's when you don 't have to think about it , simple as that .
the fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
and we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
almost 8@@ 5,000 people watched that video , and then they started em@@ ailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heter@@ os@@ exual experiences so far ?
because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
so is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
because I already am all of those things .
thank you .
( appl@@ ause ) Ho@@ wever , G@@ add@@ afi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of ty@@ ran@@ ny , corruption and seeds of di@@ versions .
I 'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
for elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya .
what is it , then ?
our society needs the qualitative representation of the femin@@ ine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the femin@@ ine .
thus we are told that " My mercy takes precedence over my anger . "
I am in charge of making this country 's food secure .
it was@@ n 't that they cou@@ ld@@ n 't develop cities .
so let 's move to chapter two : the oil era .
because we lived scattered .
let 's look at today .
the interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water .
there 's also changing di@@ ets .
by elev@@ ating to a higher socio @@@ -@@ @ economic level , they also change their diet .
they start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
on the other hand , there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors .
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : Istanbul , Rome , London , Paris , Damascus , Cairo .
but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells , with your genes and your environment , and you print your own personal medicine .
I live in New York , and I 've been working in advertising for -- ever since I left school , so about seven , eight years now , and it was dra@@ ining .
I worked a lot of late nights . I worked a lot of weekends , and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own .
it 's difficult , sometimes , to pick that one second .
" why did you throw away the shut@@ ters ? " I asked him .
" well , because the street is safer now , " they answered .
" safer ? why ? they have posted more policemen here ? "
the freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of an@@ archy in the city , while the barbar@@ ism of the ' 9@@ 0s brought about a loss of hope for the city .
but people were waiting in long qu@@ eu@@ es under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
it 's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience .
it 's about system , it 's about organization .
we created an online system of control and so spe@@ eded up all the processes .
I love it because it lets me get the message out , but it also lets people get their messages to me .
and finally , this ra@@ vel@@ ing can also lead to more and more damage .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
so then you have asph@@ alt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .
today I use a microwave because I CA@@ N@@ NOT take the big induction machine here on@@ stage .
so I put the specimen in , which I 'm now going to take out to see what happened .
so that 's what we did here . you see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . that 's what we know from practice .
actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works .
" the Taliban are gone ! " my father shou@@ ted .
I did@@ n 't know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
that 's why I co@@ founded SO@@ LA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it 's still risky for girls to go to school .
but today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
( appl@@ ause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
the red do@@ t shows you spending per student relative to a country 's wealth .
the answer is , students in Korea learn in large classes .
people were stun@@ ned by the results .
P@@ isa has transformed that debate , and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany .
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did Hungary .
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success .
high @@@ -@@ @ performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them .
they provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice .
they set very ambitious standards , but then they enable their teachers to figure out , what do I need to teach to my students today ?
now the challenge is to enable user @@@ -@@ @ generated wisdom .
they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices .
now , knowing what successful systems are doing do@@ es@@ n 't yet tell us how to improve .
it was a random encounter when I was young , and since then , I 've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day .
then , predictions can be made and tested .
so these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or inter@@ acting parts : s@@ war@@ ms of birds or fish , ant colonies , ecosystems , bra@@ ins , financial markets .
so what do we know about complex systems ?
this means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions , so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions .
so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which CA@@ N@@ NOT be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system .
so if it 's a cell or a ter@@ m@@ ite or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
so what equations are for physics , complex networks are for the study of complex systems .
this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics , biology , computer science , the social sciences , but what about economics ?
this is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature .
and the links represent the share@@ holding relations , so shareholder A has x percent of the shares in company B.
and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
I think this is an interesting question .
it 's actually not that hard to understand .
there are 146 top players in the core , and they together have the potential to collectively control 40 percent of the TNCs ' value .
ideas relating to finance , economics , politics , society , are very often tain@@ ted by people 's personal ideologies .
reality is so complex , we need to move away from do@@ g@@ ma .
give me novel@@ ty , give me famili@@ arity .
so why does good sex so often f@@ ade ?
and across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
basically , when I look at my partner radi@@ ant and confident .
there is no care@@ taking in desire .
( la@@ ughter ) I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them .
we are the only ones who have an ero@@ tic life , which means that it 's sexuality transformed by the human imagination .
we can h@@ int at it . we don 't even have to do it .
go for it . there 's so much fun out there , " then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separ@@ ateness at the same time .
but if on this side there is somebody who says , " I 'm worried . I 'm anxious . I 'm depressed .
we are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago .
we don 't really have mental health insurance in this country , and it 's -- ( Appl@@ ause ) -- it 's really a crime .
something like 98 percent of all people with depression , and I mean really severe depression -- I have a friend with stun@@ n@@ ingly severe depression -- this is a cu@@ rable disease , with present medicine and present technology .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colon@@ ize the Mil@@ ky Way .
and that is not something that is beyond comprehen@@ sion at this point .
they said , we 've been looking at the oceans for a long time now , and we want to tell you they 're not in trouble , they 're near collapse .
we 're going to have to say , no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years .
you all remember T@@ ed K@@ ac@@ z@@ yn@@ ski , the Un@@ ab@@ om@@ ber ?
this spring -- there 's a colli@@ der at Bro@@ ok@@ haven , on Long Island -- this spring , it 's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes .
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
North Pole goes to the South , South Pole goes to the North , and vice versa .
scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent .
we need to learn how to repair and replen@@ ish the Earth 's ozone layer .
we GO@@ T@@ TA fix that . we GO@@ T@@ TA out@@ law that right away .
it had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs .
nothing to worry about , right ?
it passed directly through Earth 's orbit . we were in that that spot six hours earlier .
this is just a matter of finding ' em , going there , and doing something about it .
science has the power to predict the future in many cases now .
let me tell you a little bit about savings rates , a little bit about language , and then I 'll draw that connection .
it should be noted , of course , that the United States and the U.@@ K. are the next in line .
you understood exactly what I just said in English .
I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have been able to convey so little information .
now , that fasc@@ inated me end@@ lessly as a child , but what fascin@@ ates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time .
it is the only Ger@@ man@@ ic language that requires this .
for example , most other Ger@@ man@@ ic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying , " M@@ org@@ en reg@@ net es , " quite literally to an English ear , " It rain tomorrow . "
if that sub@@ tly n@@ ud@@ ges you to feel about them iden@@ tically , that 's going to make it easier to save .
now while these findings are sugg@@ estive , countries can be different in so many different ways that it 's very , very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences .
and just in summary , no matter how far I push this , I can 't get it to break .
it turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe .
and most gran@@ ularly , I break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world -- so an extreme level of gran@@ ul@@ arity .
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
smoking is in some deep sense negative savings .
and we all talk about bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ms in our daily lives , but we rarely see or listen to one .
and we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature .
everything that we ever do , everything that every human has ever done , do or will do , requires the to@@ il of populations of ne@@ ur@@ ons producing these kinds of storms .
well , she did that because she , at that time , had acquired a new arm .
just fast forward 10 years .
and what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these av@@ at@@ ars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world .
as fast as we can reset our computers , the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool , as if this too was a part of that pri@@ mate 's body .
well , in an experiment that we ran a few years ago , we took this to the limit .
this is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonom@@ ously .
so where are we taking all this ?
people cross oceans to go see them .
the girls are brought up to be mothers .
and everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12 .
we did@@ n 't see him for sometimes even two years .
they wear nice dres@@ ses , high @@@ -@@ @ he@@ eled shoes .
it 's practiced , it 's no an@@ esthe@@ sia , it 's a ru@@ sty old knife , and it was difficult .
there is something about clothes , I think , and shoes .
I told him , " Well , I want to go to where you are , " because this man looked very happy , and I admi@@ red that .
he got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really cou@@ ld@@ n 't tell me what to do next .
so I went back and I had to go back to the tradition .
so I went to him very early in the morning , as the sun rose .
" well , D@@ ad , I need help . can you support me to go to America ? "
I arrived in America . as you can imagine , what did I find ?
I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
as I went back , I started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and I said , " I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you . what do you need ? "
as I spoke to the women , they told me , " You know what we need ? we really need a school for girls . "
because there had not been any school for girls .
and they did . they donated land where we built the girls ' school .
but she was older . she was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade .
five months later , that is Ang@@ eline .
Ang@@ eline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference .
that 's Sharon . that 's five years later .
( appl@@ ause ) I want to challenge you today .
you are somebody who wants to see that war ends , no poverty .
you are somebody who wants to make a difference .
ok@@ ay ? friends , family and financi@@ ers .
but we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been mis@@ educated about it , and we have to admit that .
that 's the honest truth .
when the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime , he is@@ n 't speaking about corruption .
the point I 'm making is that it is a crime .
we 're standing today in the Central Bank , and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I 'm going to be speaking about .
it went right into my heart .
do you get how serious this problem is ?
and what we have here -- I am not saying so , this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement . he said so .
one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
and I was walking around with the protesters looking at the One Wall Street , Occup@@ y Wall Street movement walking around .
what if this is just the first time that the so @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ so@@ s had been caught ?
and I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council , which is a not @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ profit .
the Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
we will continue to work within J@@ CC .
you could see what I applied for and what replies I got .
they have international branches , and it 's important for us to tune into this one .
and we tackle this problem by building giant , dynamically scaled model robot insects that would fla@@ p in giant pools of mineral oil where we could study the aer@@ odynam@@ ic forces .
we have no idea what they do .
so I think , unfortunately , a lot of neuro@@ scientists , we 're all somewhat nar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ stic .
I used to study m@@ ice . when I studied m@@ ice , I used to talk really slowly .
watch it very closely , and you 'll see why my six @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old son now wants to be a neuro@@ scientist .
and it 's a beautifully complex ne@@ ur@@ on .
there are more neuro@@ mod@@ ulators that alter , that In@@ ner@@ vate this structure than actually ne@@ ur@@ ons in the structure , and they 're able to generate a complicated set of patterns .
you can measure the aer@@ odynam@@ ic forces it 's creating .
here 's a fly and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simul@@ ator , and this is a game the flies love to play .
it 's part of their visual guidance system .
and this is what one of these experiments looks like .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
you have weekly reviews . you 're constantly changing .
and these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes .
he read 30 years of Harvard Business Review before stum@@ bling upon an article in 1986 called " The New New Product Development Game . "
in Su@@ therland 's system , companies don 't use large , massive projects that take two years .
Su@@ therland said it was the best Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving ever .
what worked well this week ?
you know , the key idea of ag@@ ile is that teams essentially manage themselves , and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids .
we constantly have to kind of dial them back .
my wife counts them among her most trea@@ sured moments as a mom .
I think the time is right for an Ag@@ ile Family Man@@ if@@ es@@ to .
we 'll make Sunday meals more important . "
it turns out there 's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal .
she told me , " When you 're discipl@@ ing your children , sit in an up@@ right chair with a cus@@ hi@@ oned surface .
so move where you sit . that 's adap@@ tability .
we 've got to ho@@ ok them up with parents .
so plan@@ k number one : adapt all the time .
our instinc@@ t as parents is to order our kids around .
en@@ list the children in their own upbringing .
to me that is a certified ag@@ ile miracle .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And by the way , research backs this up too .
I was talking to W@@ arre@@ n Bu@@ ffe@@ t@@ t 's ban@@ ker , and he was ch@@ iding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance .
so ag@@ ile is great for stimulating progress , but I kept hearing time and again , you need to preserve the core .
we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat .
I made pop@@ corn . actually , I burned one , so I made two .
my wife bought a f@@ lip chart .
what values do we most uphold ?
and we ended up with 10 statements .
we are travelers , not tourists .
a few weeks later , we got a call from the school .
one of our daughters had gotten into a sp@@ at .
and suddenly we were worried , like , do we have a mean girl on our hands ?
the family mission statement was on the wall , and my wife said , " So , anything up there seem to apply ? "
suddenly we had a way into the conversation .
the " do you know " test was the single biggest predic@@ tor of emotional health and happiness .
each un@@ happy family is un@@ happy in its own way . "
I 've mentioned just three here today : adapt all the time , empower the children , tell your story .
what is going to be the future of learning ?
it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
in fact , they need to be able to read discer@@ n@@ ingly .
and so on . so I suddenly fig@@ ured that , how come all the rich people are having these extra@@ ordinarily gif@@ ted children ?
about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
I gave them a speech @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ text engine in a computer , and I said , " Ke@@ ep talking into it until it types what you say . "
I came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , " We 've understood nothing . "
how do I get them to pass ? I have to get them 20 more marks .
we take our children , we make them shut their bra@@ ins down , and then we say , " Per@@ form . "
if you did@@ n 't , you failed .
but the Age of Emp@@ ires is gone .
the net charge on an ion is equal to the number of pro@@ tons in the ion minus the number of electr@@ ons .
I 've tried incredible , incredible questions -- " When did the world begin ? how will it end ? " - to nine @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds .
this one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
so what 's my wish ?
my wish is that we design the future of learning .
and I 've got to -- hang on , I 've got to get this wording exactly right , because , you know , it 's very important .
help me build this school .
it will be called the School in the Cl@@ oud .
the lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything 's done from the cloud .
and just one last thing .
she suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , " Get on with it . "
I 'd like you to ask yourself , what do you feel when you hear the words " organic chemistry ? "
what comes to mind ?
there is a universal anxiety about these two words .
this is what organic chemistry looks like .
no meaning to most people .
the number of ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ rine molecules in here is one quin@@ til@@ lion .
that number is hard to visu@@ alize .
now what I tell you next is the most important part .
that 's what we call a chemical reaction , when at@@ oms exchange partners and make new molecules .
nature is the original organic chem@@ ist , and her construction also fills our sky with the oxygen gas we breathe , this high @@@ -@@ @ energy oxygen .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'd like to do one more word .
now , our dependence on them for energy -- that means that every one of those carbons gets converted into a molec@@ ule of CO2 .
so we all are Africans , and welcome home .
and once you make it there , the big question is where to start .
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
again , another one , " That 's a mon@@ key . " " that 's a pig , " etc .
you either don 't know what you 're looking for , or you 're looking in the wrong place , " he said .
it was then , after such hard work and many frustr@@ ating years that we found Sel@@ am , and you see the face here covered by sand@@ stone .
and in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism , who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there .
but to do that , you need the permanent denti@@ tion , which you don 't see here , because what you have here are the baby teeth .
maybe you 're won@@ dering , " So , you see this ap@@ e feature , human feature , ap@@ e feature .
needless to list them here , and there are more competent people to talk about this .
still , in my opinion , we have two choices .
that 's what I call positive African attitude .
and their eyes would say -- " No@@ body ever sees me .
and meanwhile , I was tour@@ ing locally and playing in night@@ clubs with my band , the Dres@@ den Dol@@ ls .
this is in London .
fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last @@@ -@@ @ minute , spontaneous , free gi@@ g .
I 've always been with my band or my crew .
I maintain cou@@ ch@@ surfing and crow@@ d@@ surfing are basically the same thing .
and meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
and the goal was 100,000 dollars .
asking makes you vulnerable .
and this hurt in a really familiar way .
so a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard stic@@ ker price .
they see it as an unpredictable risk , but the things I 've done , the K@@ ick@@ star@@ ter , the street , the door@@ bell , I don 't see these things as risk .
my music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box .
so blog@@ ging and t@@ wee@@ ting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hang@@ overs , our mistakes , and we see each other .
and I think when we really see each other , we want to help each other .
I think people have been obs@@ essed with the wrong question , which is , " How do we make people pay for music ? "
but I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine .
about two thirds , I would guess , of the world is des@@ erti@@ fying .
that is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form .
almost everybody knows this , from no@@ bel laure@@ ates to golf c@@ addi@@ es , or was taught it , as I was .
and I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of re@@ education and discovery .
now no sooner - this was in the 1950s - and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum @@@ -@@ @ beating people to protect the animals , than the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed .
they did . they agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 ele@@ ph@@ ants to try to stop the damage .
it made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions .
and there 'd been no livestock on this land for over 70 years .
to prevent that , we have traditionally used fire .
thank you .
( music ) narr@@ ator : ( speaking in Japanese ) Sci@@ enti@@ sts : o@@ oh . Ban@@ g ! Oh my God ! W@@ ho@@ a !
this is South Central : liqu@@ or stores , fast food , vacant lots .
so I 'm like , " Co@@ ol . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it 's my responsibility and I GO@@ T@@ TA maintain it . "
and then somebody complained .
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? " ( la@@ ughter ) And I was like , " Co@@ ol . bring it . "
L.@@ A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
that 's the whole idea .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
and I was@@ n 't the only one .
when I was a k@@ id , I used to think that pork ch@@ ops and kar@@ ate ch@@ ops were the same thing .
but the school halls were a batt@@ leg@@ round .
it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
meanwhile , for the same year , the average salary for the CEO of a $ 5 million @@@ -@@ @ plus medical charity in the U.S.
some people say , " Well , that 's just because those M@@ BA types are gre@@ edy . "
but we don 't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity .
our attitude is , " Well , look , if you can get the advertising donated , you know , to air at four o 'clock in the morning , I 'm ok@@ ay with that .
as if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy .
but they have to be asked .
the third area of discrimination is the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue .
so Dis@@ ney can make a new $ 200 million movie that fl@@ ops , and nobody calls the attorney general .
but you do a little $ 1 million community fun@@ dra@@ iser for the poor , and it do@@ es@@ n 't produce a 75 percent profit to the cause in the first 12 months , and your character is called into question .
if you kill innovation in fundraising , you can 't raise more revenue ; if you can 't raise more revenue , you can 't grow ; and if you can 't grow , you can 't possibly solve large social problems .
the fourth area is time .
in the same time , the number of for @@@ -@@ @ profits that crossed it is 4@@ 6,@@ 136 .
they were taught that self @@@ -@@ @ interest was a ra@@ ging sea that was a sure path to eternal dam@@ nation .
what were they to do about this ?
it became this economic sanctuary , where they could do pen@@ ance for their profit @@@ -@@ @ making tendencies -- at five cents on the dollar .
what if the ba@@ ke sale only net@@ ted 71 dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise net@@ ted 71 million dollars because it did ?
I can see I 've got my work cut out for me here .
some of it will dri@@ b@@ ble into the right place , but a lot of it will do more harm than good .
moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific ne@@ ur@@ ons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those ne@@ ur@@ ons .
but can an organism like this teach us anything about emo@@ tion @@@ -@@ @ like states ?
Charles Dar@@ win believed that insects have emo@@ tion and express them in their behavi@@ ors , as he wrote in his 18@@ 72 mono@@ graph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals .
and my e@@ pon@@ y@@ mous colleague , Se@@ ym@@ our Ben@@ zer , believed it as well .
Se@@ ym@@ our recruited me to Cal@@ tech in the late 1980s .
so how do we ask this question ?
now , in humans we often inf@@ er emotional states , as you 'll hear later today , from facial expressions .
now , in gene@@ tics , it 's a little counter@@ intuitive .
is that true of our d@@ op@@ am@@ ine recep@@ tor mu@@ tant flies ?
the kids can 't sit still long enough to focus , so they don 't learn .
now people have been won@@ dering about this for a long time in humans , but in flies we can actually test this .
but in each fly , we put it back only into certain ne@@ ur@@ ons and not in others , and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyper@@ activity .
there was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the he@@ ath hen .
Hen@@ ri , from the Netherlands , with a Dutch last name I won 't try to pron@@ ounce , is working on the au@@ ro@@ ch@@ s .
you get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes fal@@ cons .
Ben Nov@@ ak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
you see , you want to work on protecting the animals out there .
cap@@ tive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species .
now there are 8@@ 80 . they 're increasing in population by three percent a year .
they 're going to work on the gen@@ om@@ es of the passenger pig@@ eon and the band @@@ -@@ @ tailed pig@@ eon .
that 's an Engl@@ ish@@ man asking an Ir@@ ish@@ man to be succ@@ inct .
cut to our century , same country , same pyra@@ mi@@ ds , another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book .
enter the evidence @@@ -@@ @ based activist , the f@@ activist .
and this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this .
that 's what the data is telling us . if the trajectory continues , we get to , w@@ ow , the zero zone .
once you have this knowledge , you can 't un @@@ -@@ @ know it .
by the time we get there , every place with a rough sembl@@ ance of governance might actually be on their way .
R@@ H : you know , because we 're subscription , we don 't have to track it at that level .
and then , really , that 's spread globally , so it 's not as much as it sounds .
everything around us moves really quick .
ca : I mean , there must be something unusual about Net@@ f@@ li@@ x 's culture that allowed you to take such bold -- I won 't say " reck@@ less " -- bold , well thought @@@ -@@ @ through decisions .
we did have one advantage , which is we were born on DVD , and we knew that that was going to be temporary .
and the least likely to want to leave .
but you know , there 's always some shift .
R@@ H : ye@@ ah , we want people to speak the truth .
which ones of these are your best movies ? "
everyone would rate " Sch@@ ind@@ ler 's List " five stars , and then they 'd rate Adam Sand@@ ler , " The Do @@@ -@@ @ Over " three stars .
and it 's fun , and it 's not stres@@ s@@ ful .
and you know , if you have the good mix , you get to a healthy diet .
we just had a talk about how , on YouTube , somehow algorithms tend to , just by actually being s@@ mar@@ ter , tend to drive people towards more radical or specific content .
I mean , that 's your unique advantage .
I think you 're right , which is , when people talk about Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , they talk about the shows that move them : " 13 Re@@ as@@ ons Why " or " The Crown . "
instead , we 've seen great viewing across a whole range -- " Black Mir@@ ror " -- we 're fil@@ ming season five now .
and that was a struggling show when it was only in the BBC .
and if we 're as great as we can be , and we have a variety of mo@@ ods , then more often , people will choose us .
just for reality check , just , " Are we sure that this is the direction we want to go ? "
so think of it as this multiple measures of success .
ca : so , speaking of algorithms that have raised questions : you were on the board of Facebook , and I think Mark Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg -- you 've done some mentoring for him .
and you know , all new technologies -- when television was first popular in the 1960s in the US , it was called a " vast wa@@ st@@ eland , " and that television was going to rot the minds of everybody .
so when I later went into business and became a philanthro@@ p@@ ist , I think I gra@@ vit@@ ated towards education and trying to make a difference there .
there was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made , so we could build and repair them , or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy .
the objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life .
so many times , am@@ ate@@ urs , not experts , have been the inven@@ tors and impro@@ vers of things ranging from mountain bikes to sem@@ icon@@ duc@@ tors , personal computers , air@@ planes .
two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conduc@@ tive ink .
her project 's goal is to highlight the expres@@ sive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the buil@@ der .
we often tackle problems from un@@ conventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things .
back then , computers were these large main@@ frames only scientists cared about , and no one dre@@ amed of even having one at home .
all of a sudden , a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet , including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations , started getting re @@@ -@@ @ rou@@ ted through China .
everything started breaking .
now , of course you cou@@ ld@@ n 't do that today .
thank you very much .
but I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
I was so sca@@ red .
I thought my heart was going to explo@@ de .
if anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
but I managed to control all the emotions inside me , and answer the questions .
just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shoc@@ king phone call .
I lost all hope .
I 'm confident that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
thank you .
Chris An@@ derson : El@@ on , what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all @@@ -@@ @ electric car ?
in fact , even if producing CO2 was good for the environment , given that we 're going to run out of hydrocarbons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating .
you can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness .
so if you drive for three hours , you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes , because that 's normally what people will stop for .
ca : all right . so this is only one string to your energy bow .
em : well actually , I 'm confident that solar will beat everything , hands down , including natural gas .
most people choose to lease .
I think it 's a good thing , because utilities have been this monopoly , and people haven 't had any choice .
you decided to build a space company .
it was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one ?
em : no , we don 't pat@@ ent@@ .@@ CA : you did@@ n 't patent because you think it 's more dangerous to patent than not to patent .
em : since our primary competitors are national governments , the enforce@@ ability of patents is questionable . ( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) CA : that 's really , really interesting .
em : right , so the big innovation - CA : in fact , let 's roll that video and you can talk us through it , what 's happening here .
the space shuttle was an attempt at a re@@ usable rocket , but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time , and the parts that were re@@ usable took a 10,000 @@@ -@@ @ person group nine months to refurb@@ ish for flight .
so the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight .
is that -- could we have some of that secret sau@@ ce ?
em : well , thanks . thank you .
and you have to do that .
otherwise , mentally , you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be able to get through the day .
I was in the third year of my seven @@@ -@@ @ year under@@ graduate degree .
( music ) And we released to YouTube this , the Virtual Cho@@ ir Project , 185 sing@@ ers from 12 different countries .
this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacu@@ um@@ ing during this project .
and that is exactly what we found .
he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design .
he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventil@@ ated .
next I 'm going to show you what happened when we experi@@ mentally manip@@ ulated classrooms .
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation .
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't it be awesome if we all had BL@@ Is on our phones ?
thank you .
so I did@@ n 't give up . I continued .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grand@@ mother .
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
Hollywood has its sex symbols , and the Valley has its sex symbols .
so it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dre@@ amed .
and what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share .
and so chapter one really begins today , with all of us , because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps .
one of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was , " The streets of Hollywood are lit@@ tered with the carc@@ asses of people like you , who think you 're going to come to this town and make movies . "
and I really thought this was going to be a straight @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ PB@@ S charitable initiative .
and all the people in this room have done so through their business lives , or their philanthro@@ pic work , or their other interests .
I 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at .
not anymore .
so what 's super@@ hydro@@ pho@@ bic ?
a fresh@@ ly wa@@ xed car , the water molecules sl@@ ump to about 90 degrees .
it 's a lot of water @@@ -@@ @ based materials like concrete , water @@@ -@@ @ based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well .
well , the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nan@@ op@@ articles that form a very rough and cra@@ gg@@ ly surface .
think about what you might pick .
because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people are@@ n 't doing equilibrium analysis as well .
they 're just choosing randomly .
so we know that those two @@@ -@@ @ step players are doing something differently .
two players who are being scanned using EE@@ G electro@@ des are going to bargain over one to six dollars .
there 's a lot more arrows .
that means that the bra@@ ins are syn@@ ced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity , and the arrows flow clearly from left to right .
next I 'm going to introduce you to some relatives .
and they 're highly experienced , so they 've done this thousands and thousands of time .
( la@@ ughter ) You can see they 're very bl@@ as@@ é and kind of effor@@ tless .
ok@@ ay , so the next part of this study I 'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of T@@ et@@ sur@@ o Mat@@ su@@ z@@ awa .
one ch@@ im@@ p is called a mat@@ cher .
they win if they press left , left , like a seeker finding someone in hide @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ seek , or right , right .
the mis@@ mat@@ cher wants to mis@@ match .
now they get three apple cu@@ bes .
and these are two different groups of humans from Japan and Africa . they replicate quite nic@@ ely .
the other is called the Le@@ ster election .
but you must do extremely well .
the chief policy man took this idea to Cap@@ it@@ ol Hill , and as he reported back to me , the response was , " H@@ ell no !
I can only find cheese . I 'm sorry . so there it is .
block reform .
climate change is mine , but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality .
there 's nothing we can do . "
so would I do nothing ?
I 'm going off to build Google Glass .
do you have that love ?
back in 1995 , we got a new wing next to the museum .
the only thing I had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stu@@ ffed for the collection .
a is my office , B is the place where the duc@@ k hit the glass , and C is from where I watched it .
this is its first time on the U.S. West Coast .
after winning this prize , my life changed .
this is a tur@@ key in Wisconsin on the premises of the E@@ than Al@@ len juvenile correctional institution .
at least , I thought it was till I got these slides .
he sees an intr@@ ud@@ er in his territory , and it 's coming all the time and he 's there , so there is no end to it .
and when it 's over , we go to a Chinese restaurant and we have a six @@@ -@@ @ course duc@@ k dinner .
may I have my duc@@ k back , please ?
so this is the motor .
and as I travel around the world , I love taking photographs like these , so I can remember all the beautiful and interesting things that I 've seen .
but what I can 't do is record and share how these objects feel to touch .
and so , as an engineer , I 'm really fasc@@ inated and I have a lot of respect for how good people are with their hands .
it 's all about interactive touch technology .
so the way we solve this problem is by creating a hand @@@ -@@ @ held tool that has many different sensors inside .
we call it hap@@ to@@ graphy -- hap@@ tic photography .
I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work .
( la@@ ughter ) " In@@ stead , let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mo@@ j@@ it@@ os . "
people built one Bi@@ on@@ icle after another .
and you would spec@@ ulate that the people who love Leg@@ os would build more Leg@@ os , even for less money , because after all , they get more internal joy from it .
soon after I finished running this experiment , I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle .
and I stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people I 've ever talked to .
I asked them , " How many of you now add not @@@ -@@ @ so @@@ -@@ @ k@@ os@@ her things to your expense reports ? "
they worked for much longer .
at 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these efforts .
the bad news is that eliminating moti@@ vations seems to be incredibly easy , and if we don 't think about it carefully , we might over@@ do it .
I can 't say I enjoy the process .
people did not want them , and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
what they fig@@ ured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
we gave them instructions on how to create orig@@ ami , and we gave them a sheet of paper .
but then we told them , " Lo@@ ok , this orig@@ ami really belongs to us .
( la@@ ughter ) On good days .
and one day you went to the park and you met some kids .
he gave an example of a pin factory .
he said p@@ ins have 12 different steps , and if one person does all 12 steps , production is very low .
I think the answer is no .
if anything changes -- if the environment changes , the ground moves , or demand changes -- we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them .
and that 's called self @@@ -@@ @ assembly , which is a process by which dis@@ ordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction .
I now have a 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old of my own who 's exactly the same .
so there 's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to .
there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena .
and I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insec@@ to@@ id thum@@ b clicking .
it had a robot thum@@ b that was clicking on the bu@@ zz@@ er .
and it made me think , what happens when computers are now better at knowing and rememb@@ ering stuff than we are ?
the things we know are still important .
there 's an advantage of volume , and there 's an advantage of time .
there 's just too much .
and they say , " What do you mean ? we just got here . "
it 's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met .
that 's often the advantage of time .
that do@@ es@@ n 't work . that 's just anno@@ ying .
those movies are never about beautiful u@@ top@@ ias .

thank you very much .
if I come over here , he 'll turn to follow me .
if I come over here -- ( L@@ augh@@ s ) He 's smart .
and if I get too close to him , he gets sca@@ red just like any other creature .
thanks , little guy .
( s@@ nee@@ zing sound ) B@@ less you .
and if I want to explore the world -- u@@ h @@@ -@@ @ oh , Rom@@ o 's tired -- if I want to explore the world with Rom@@ o , I can actually connect him from any other iOS device .
so here 's the iPad .
and if I want to control him , I can just drive .
I 've always wanted a picture of a 1,500 @@@ -@@ @ person TED audience .
but the most important thing about Rom@@ o is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see Rom@@ o doing on the left .
and then if you have something you like , you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life , run the program in real life .
and then if you have something you 're proud of , you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world .
it was@@ n 't at four in the morning , but it was closer to midnight .
it 's our trailer , because I know , obviously you guys are busy , many of you may not have had a chance to see it .
if we could roll ?

I don 't think there was anything left from his abdominal down .
this is blood .
I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taj@@ i .
twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad .
there are three featured in the film .
a soldier came up to me and stood , you know really , pretty close , a foot away from me .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him , of course , and I said , you know , " It 's going to be OK . "
do you really care ?
and I would just say it 's my hope , and I would ask you guys to please , you know , reach out a hand .
and there was a designated k@@ ick@@ er every day .
and I looked up and said , " Who is that man ? "
and they decided to do it .
I did not want to have to have hand @@@ -@@ @ me @@@ -@@ @ down books .
that 's a big deal . give me a hand for that . that 's a big deal .
but the other part has to do with the culture of science and engineering on our cam@@ p@@ uses .
how many of you in this audience know somebody who started off in pre @@@ -@@ @ med or engineering and changed their major within a year or two ?
and what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it .
number one : high expectations .
but equally important , it takes an understanding that it 's hard work that makes the difference .
smart simply means you 're ready to learn .
nice story . give him a hand for that too .
one young woman had great grades , but test scores were not as high .
as you know , it 's one thing to earn an A yourself , it 's another thing to help someone else do well .
they had food they had packed out .
let me get the staff to help me out . "
it was that connecting .
give him a big hand for that .
but now we are looking at re@@ designing the human@@ ities and social sciences .
they need to be engaged .
and I 'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound , and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once , and I 'm like , " U@@ h oh , this is bad news . "
so we 're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Lib@@ by 's doing .
this is not a wardrobe malfunction . I have to take my belt off here .

eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members .
I had my own heart sc@@ are years ago in graduate school , when we 're under treatment for the kidney , and suddenly , they 're like , " Oh , we think you have a heart problem . "
and this is a picture of my graduation team from Leg@@ acy .

I 'm sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time .
they felt science had stagn@@ ated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century .
eventually , the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit , and this has become -- fortunately it 's become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today .
Dar@@ win knew what we seem to have forgotten , that science is not only for scientists .
and the cost to the world is immense : 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation .
no one 's going to refuse clean water .
it 's got nutrients in it .
in Rwanda , they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners ' bo@@ wels .
it was no big deal , but it was a lat@@ rine .
she was sca@@ red of sn@@ akes . she was sca@@ red of rape .
somehow , people who 'd been thinking that what they were doing was not dis@@ g@@ usting at all suddenly thought , " O@@ ops . "
it cost nothing . it 's going to save that boy 's life .
it 's the most off @@@ -@@ @ track Millennium Development Goal .
we 're not going to meet targets , providing people with sanitation at this rate .
six thousand children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured .
I mean , cancer seems far more serious .
my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders .
but look at this closely and you can see that actually they 've crossed a different threshold .
the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier , long before the symptoms emerge .
we wait until the behavior becomes manifest .
and so , on an over@@ cast morning in January , I headed north off in a silver Che@@ vy to find a man and some peace .
I flew too , my head bo@@ b@@ bing on broken bones , and when I landed , I was a quad@@ ri@@ ple@@ gic .

was I who I had been before the crash , before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book ?
and so I now went looking for re@@ mor@@ se and threw truth under the bus .
some , as had I , would remember .
was it evidence of guilt , an assertion that he should have been put away longer ?
he 'd served six months in prison , lost his truck license for a decade .

I was so excited .
could you let me share my passion with you through my performance ?
so there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appe@@ tite , and so on .
it 's on . just turned it on .
and the difference between sha@@ king in this way and not -- ( Appl@@ ause ) The difference between sha@@ king in this way and not is related to the mis@@ behavior of 25,000 ne@@ ur@@ ons in her sub@@ thal@@ amic nucle@@ us .

the only way he could get around was cra@@ w@@ ling on his bel@@ ly like this .
so here he was . we operated on him hoping that he would get better . we did not know .
this boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life .
so we wondered , can we place electro@@ des in this area of sad@@ ness and see if we can turn down the thermo@@ stat , can we turn down the activity , and what will be the consequence of that ?
can we use deep brain stimulation to make you s@@ mar@@ ter ?
( la@@ ughter ) An@@ y@@ body interested in that ?
( appl@@ ause ) Of course we can , right ?
so what we 've decided to do is we 're going to try to tur@@ bo@@ charge the memory circuits in the brain .
it uses 20 percent of all your -- even though it only weigh@@ s two percent -- it uses 10 times more gl@@ uc@@ ose than it should based on its weight .
so first there 's speech , and then writing comes along as a kind of arti@@ f@@ ice .
now don 't get me wrong , writing has certain advantages .
or at least , they shou@@ ld@@ n 't if they 're interested in re@@ producing . that -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) is not the way any human being speaks casu@@ ally .
so we naturally tend to think , because we see language written so often , that that 's what language is , but actually what language is , is speech . they are two things .
we see this general b@@ agg@@ iness of the structure , the lack of concern with rules and the way that we 're used to learning on the black@@ board , and so we think that something has gone wrong .
Sus@@ an : " lo@@ l , I see it . "
another example is " sl@@ ash . "

you can 't do that while you 're tex@@ ting , and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium .

and here 's an interesting ratio : starting from zero in 1900 , only 30 years later , the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years .
by 1960 we had telephone bills , bank statements were being produced by computers .

I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this .
and I 've always felt bad about it , in a sense .
I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about p@@ iss , and sort of really sad things , and so I wanted to think about something happy .
and also , as a child , I was the f@@ att@@ est k@@ id in class , so I used to love Che@@ e@@ tos . Oh , I love Che@@ e@@ tos , y@@ um@@ my .
I was looking for some kind of form , and in the end , I made 100 butter @@@ -@@ @ fri@@ es . do you get it ?

the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
in the words " simplicity " and " complexity , " M , I , T occur in perfect sequence .
you know the un@@ i is the most challenging , so number ten is challenging .
I think this is sort of simple more versus less .
this book I wrote because I want to figure out life .

( la@@ ughter ) Your social responsibility is very interesting .
so , as you get older , you may , like , have kids , whatever .
that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire .
sure . it 's the computer .
it 's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution .
the machine won that day , and today , a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grand@@ master .

to create this art@@ work , I bought a lot of packaged instant no@@ od@@ le cups and put them in my studio , making it look like a supermarket .
I think that in art , an artist 's attitude is the most important element .
when people see that , it 's very difficult not to click , because you think , " Come on , are you serious ?
I can stream hours and hours and days and days of YouTube video without my computer ever getting measu@@ ra@@ bly heavier .

right now I can see you , and I can gauge how what I 'm saying is landing with you .
when you fle@@ x your ank@@ le , muscles in the front of your leg contract , simultaneously stretching muscles in the back of your leg .
to solve these problems , at MI@@ T , we invented the agon@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ antagon@@ ist my@@ one@@ ural interface , or AM@@ I , for short .
a few years ago , my good friend J@@ im E@@ wing -- of 34 years -- reached out to me for help .
after his accident , he dre@@ amed of returning to his chosen sport of mountain climbing , but how might this be possible ?
the AM@@ I procedure re@@ established the ne@@ ural link between J@@ im 's ank@@ le @@@ -@@ @ foot muscles and his brain .
all the natural biom@@ echan@@ ics medi@@ ated by the central nervous system emerged via the synthetic lim@@ b as an involuntary , re@@ flexi@@ ve action .
what was most interesting to me is what J@@ im was telling us he was experiencing .
I felt like I had my leg , and it was@@ n 't that I was attached to the robot so much as the robot was attached to me , and the robot became part of me .
in this 21st century , designers will extend the nervous system into power@@ fully strong ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ ons that humans can control and feel with their minds .
during the tw@@ il@@ ight years of this century , I believe humans will be un@@ recogn@@ izable in morph@@ ology and dynamics from what we are today .
( crashing waves ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .
that 's only the beginning .
I 've spent a lot of time studying the circuits in the brain that create the unique percep@@ tual realities that we each have .
and now I bring that together with the capabilities of current technology to create new technology that does make us better , feel more , connect more .
it predic@@ tively told me to bug off .
we get to have our poker face .
your eye responds to how hard your brain is working .
we know this from neuro@@ science .
I could have put the two voices in different spatial locations , I could have made one lou@@ der .
you would have seen the same thing .
we might think we have more agency over the reveal of our internal state than that spi@@ der , but maybe we don 't .
the am@@ al@@ gam@@ ation of sensors pa@@ ired with machine learning on us , around us and in our environments , is a lot more than cameras and micro@@ phones tracking our external actions .
and devices we already have in our homes could , if we let them , give us invaluable insight back .
there 's a dynamic mixture of ac@@ et@@ one , is@@ op@@ rene and carbon dioxide that changes when our heart speeds up , when our muscles tense , and all without any obvious change in our behavi@@ ors .
I believe it is the era of the emp@@ ath .
we can enable a better future for technologies like augmented reality to extend our own agency and connect us at a much deeper level .
and we can have richer experiences from our technology .
let 's face it : driving is dangerous .
but no , this guy is@@ n 't slowing down .
we will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us , to see how fast that guy 's going or stopping .
I mean , they 're New@@ ton@@ ian objects .
that 's very nice about them .
we also attach a discrete short @@@ -@@ @ range communication radio , and the robots talk to each other .
but I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy , just like right now , when I look at your car from the outside , I don 't really know about you .

whether it 's nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
you 'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you 'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas .
and this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what I 've done well .
and I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world .
and this is what it is .
so it 's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here .
that 's between , say at an average use , that 's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that .
and this is buried below ground , which is really important .
they operate anywhere from , you know , maybe 200 to 300 degrees Cel@@ sius .
and this is really important , because the reaction stops .
but I think there 's something really poe@@ tic about using nuclear power to pro@@ pel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
it 's not the possession of any one person .
I 'm asking you to lean forward and imagine my point of view -- what this looks like and feels like to me as a character .
but if you walk into a live theater and you see that the theater is half full , your heart sinks .
you were coming to have the collective experience of laugh@@ ing together , c@@ rying together , holding your breath together to see what 's going to happen next .
that 's the first thing he ever did that was@@ n 't Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
( la@@ ughter ) He did@@ n 't mean it compli@@ ment@@ arily , but Jo@@ e put it up in the lobby , he was so proud of it .
people sle@@ pt out for two nights to get those tickets .
it 's been an extraordinary success , and we 've continued it .
and then there was yet another barrier that we realized we we@@ ren 't crossing , which is a barrier of participation .
and beautifully , he said , " That 's what freedom sounds like . "
I have spent my entire life either at the school@@ house , on the way to the school@@ house , or talking about what happens in the school@@ house .
we know why .
George Washington Car@@ ver says all learning is understanding relationships .
some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship , or you don 't .
I deserve the education that I get here .
and I want you to just see what I 've become . "
can we stand to have more relationships ?
so teachers become great actors and great ac@@ tresses , and we come to work when we don 't feel like it , and we 're listening to policy that do@@ es@@ n 't make sense , and we teach anyway .
teaching and learning should bring joy .
is this job tough ? you bet@@ cha .
I lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , I sw@@ am in our small rivers with our ca@@ im@@ ans .
there I learned different things .
we made a lot of trips , financed development , economic projects in Africa with the World Bank .
but I did much more than that .
when I was a k@@ id , it was more than 50 percent rain@@ forest .
to build development , Brazilian development , we destroyed a lot of our forest .
as you did here in the United States , or you did in India , everywhere in this planet .
to build our development , we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything .
we transformed . we gave this land back to nature .
we worked with a lot of companies in Brazil that put money into this project , the government .
around here , no ? the red@@ wood forests are gone .
here 's An@@ dy 's theory .
why the Greeks ?
M@@ addi@@ e 's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario .
but if we place these technologies before student inquiry , we can be rob@@ bing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers : our students ' questions .
now , when I got this , I was -- press C@@ aps L@@ ock -- absolutely fre@@ aked out , ok@@ ay ?
he said first , his curi@@ osity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure , about what worked and what did@@ n 't work .
and third , through intense reflection , he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure , and then , with a steady hand , he saved my life .
and each case is different .
but the challenge is really for R@@ il@@ ey 's future teachers , the ones she has yet to meet .
so here 's a business plan that simply does not make any sense .
right ? ( la@@ ughter ) Where you say , like , ' 87 was like a good year , right ?
why haven 't we allowed innovation to happen ?
banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3 .
it was@@ n 't about the customers .
they all operate the same way . right ?
it says exactly the same thing : poor kids lose ground in the sum@@ mer@@ time .
they did@@ n 't have any place for their kids to go .
because our business has refused to use science .
how many places in America are going to change ? none .
here 's what we know .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
I used to make stuff up . right ?
maybe July , maybe June .
and the results have great data .
and so , what do you do ?
now you 've got all of this test data from last year .
this stuff h@@ as@@ n 't worked for 55 years .
I dare say it 's a pit@@ tance , what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems .
this year 's sen@@ iors will have 100 percent graduating high school .
and that got me thinking .
in all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predic@@ tor of success .
it was@@ n 't good looks , physical health , and it was@@ n 't I@@ Q .
how do I keep them motivated for the long run ? "
we need to measure whether we 've been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start over again with lessons learned .
but that do@@ es@@ n 't mean that we can 't .
you just had to do things sometimes .
so I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended , and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me .
I was like , " You need to go to a hospital , the school nurse , something . "
but now , shifting an entire paradigm , it h@@ as@@ n 't been an easy journey , nor is it even complete .
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
and as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District , you better believe there was some opposition .
we make our kids feel like they matter to us .
teaching elements of persu@@ asion , it do@@ es@@ n 't get any more real than that .
so what are the barriers to getting it done ?
if someone walks behind , that is " to follow . "
three together , that 's spar@@ k@@ les .
so we have gone through almost 30 characters .
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old .

home@@ work is stres@@ s@@ ful , but when you go home every day and your home is work , you don 't want to pick up any assignments .
( la@@ ughter ) Because whoever thought of that title gets ir@@ ony .
and it 's working beautifully .
what it do@@ es@@ n 't count are all the kids who are in school but being dis@@ engaged from it , who don 't enjoy it , who don 't get any real benefit from it .
America spends more money on education than most other countries .
( la@@ ughter ) Small people wan@@ dering about .

if you 've got two children or more , I bet you they are completely different from each other .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
he used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of ver@@ bs .
but if nobody 's learning anything , she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it .
that 's it .
it 's the common currency of being a human being .
I mean , you may have a dog .
they don 't look for other things that matter just as much .
the thing about work in Finland is this : they don 't obs@@ ess about those disciplines .
I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of -- they 're called alternative education programs .
they have certain common features .
not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley .
the real role of leadership is climate control , creating a climate of possibility .
there 's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Frank@@ lin .
and if we can encourage more people , that will be a movement .
and that 's what we need .
thank you very much .
until recently , over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback : satisfactory .
how would I know who was the best ?
the system we have today is@@ n 't fair to them .
well , unfortunately there 's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems .
so I looked at the countries whose students perform well academ@@ ically , and looked at what they 're doing to help their teachers improve .
the U.S. is@@ n 't number one .
we 're not even in the top 10 .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
they have weekly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what 's working .
we had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices .
for example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
we also had students fill out surveys with questions like , " Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? "
to get started , we 're doing a peer review day , ok@@ ay ?
we would finally have a way to give them feedback , as well as the means to act on it .
and inte@@ res@@ tingly , as I think back , they were the first true environ@@ ment@@ alists .
it 's another subject . it 's another conversation .
this is going back the mid@@ - ' 50s , ' 6@@ 0s .
and that , and more besides , would be in the palm of your hand .
this building was wired for change .
and you can measure the performance , in terms of energy consumption , of that building against a typical library .

first , I told Em@@ ma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital .
I did@@ n 't know the future of Em@@ ma 's career , and no one knows the future of work , but I do know this : identity capital be@@ gets identity capital .
so yes , half of twenty@@ som@@ eth@@ ings are un@@ - or under @@@ -@@ @ employed .
but half are@@ n 't , and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group .
last but not least , Em@@ ma believed that you can 't pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
we can reach them . there are paths that enable us to reach them .
and we concluded a very important insight , which was that as people 's relationships to the things in their lives change , so do their relations with other people .
security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks , keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations .
people are@@ n 't close or distant .
people are always a combination of the two , and that combination is constantly changing .
what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now ?
in the context of this broad range of digital relations , safely seeking str@@ an@@ gen@@ ess might very well be a new basis for that innovation .
we won 't bring anything with us .
the materi@@ ality and fl@@ esh@@ iness and meat of the mush@@ room being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it .
so kids don 't have as hard of a time with this , and I saw in my own son , I gave him this book .
you can see her pointing to it in the picture .
in Taiwan , at an art museum , this 12 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girl made a mush@@ room organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue .

if hundreds of people did@@ n 't buy this , we cou@@ ld@@ n 't put it on the market .

ok@@ ay , just wait for this one . this is good .
I always add humans to any technical -- if you 're drawing a technical diagram , put a human in it .
and a huge erup@@ tion of discussion around accessibility came , and we 're really excited about that .
and I love the car@@ rot on the turn@@ table .
and I also put this little surprise . when you open the li@@ d of the box , it says , " The world is a construction kit . "
I 'm not a ger@@ i@@ at@@ ric@@ ian .
in the last few years , I helped two friends have the end of life they wanted .
I 've put worksh@@ e@@ ets online , so if you 'd like , you can plan your own end .

what do you want to hear at the very end , and from whom would you like to hear it ?
in my experience , you 'll want to hear that whatever you 're worried about is going to be fine .
here 's J@@ im just a few weeks before he died , celebrating a birthday he did@@ n 't expect to see .
( child shou@@ ting ) Man 5 : go !
we 've learned an amazing amount .
it was like cell phones stra@@ pped to your head .
she was rush@@ ed to hospital , but it was too late . she died .
as I thought , that 's most of you .
and I believe you . I 'm sure you 're right .
does it really matter that we 're not walking past them in the street ?
over the coming years , undoub@@ tably the G@@ ates Foundation is going to give a lot more , is going to save a lot more lives .
his name is Mat@@ t We@@ ig@@ er .
he 's already earning enough so that he 's giving a six @@@ -@@ @ figure sum to effective ch@@ arities and still leaving himself with enough to live on .
many people will think , though , that ch@@ arities are@@ n 't really all that effective .
take , for example , providing a guide dog for a blind person .
that 's a good thing to do , right ?
it costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person .
you could provide one guide dog for one blind American , or you could cure between 400 and 2,000 people of blind@@ ness .
so some people think that would be a good thing to give to .
but then the money 's gone , you have to work hard to get more , spend more , and to maintain the same level of happiness , it 's kind of a he@@ don@@ ic t@@ read@@ mill .
you never get off , and you never really feel satisfied .
and that did make me feel a little bit better , because I have given more than 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation and to various other effective ch@@ arities .
this was the first time I 'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity .
but I sat there for hours , and nothing came to mind .
it was destroyed before it ever existed .
I found myself in a state of constant creation , thinking only of what 's next and coming up with more ideas than ever .
and instead of telling each other to seize the day , maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation .
it sol@@ ves the same problem , but instead of spending several million pounds , you spend several hundred pounds .
and that 's where 3D printing gets really , really interesting .
so we can begin to see the seed of a completely open @@@ -@@ @ source , citizen @@@ -@@ @ led urban development model , potentially .
probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Lin@@ us Tor@@ val@@ ds , the open @@@ -@@ @ source pioneer , which was that idea of , " Be la@@ zy like a fox . "
you know , like it or not , welcome to the world 's biggest design team .
as I think Robert Ne@@ u@@ w@@ ir@@ th said , there is@@ n 't a bank or a corporation or a government or an NGO who 's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers .
in order to do that in 20 minutes , I have to bring out four ideas -- it 's like four pieces of a puzzle .
he did that , and the Internet Explorer changed page .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing .
so I said , have what , shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language ? that 's not possible .
although many people tried to comfort and encourage me , their words s@@ ounded like meaningless noise .
it looks like they were inter@@ breeding .
these were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public .
so the same Guardi@@ an rebu@@ ts , " Are video games art : the debate that shou@@ ld@@ n 't be .
so we have Portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so it was not very constructive . ( la@@ ughter ) So , I 'm making fun of it , but we discussed this for so many days . you have no idea .
and it 's too long to explain the acquisition , but if you want to go on the Mo@@ MA blog , there 's a long post where I explain why it 's such a great example of design .
I 've had to do away with a few concepts of design past .
and a lot of men literally don 't get beyond the first sentence as a result .
this comes from the work of the femin@@ ist lingu@@ ist Jul@@ ia Pen@@ el@@ ope .
over the past generation , the term we 've used synony@@ mous with " beaten " is " bat@@ tered , " so we have " Mary was bat@@ tered . "
why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and boys ?
what is going on with men ?
what about all those boys ?
he 's a normal guy in every other way , is@@ n 't he ?
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
there 's been an aw@@ ful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men 's violence against women and children , h@@ as@@ n 't there ?
there 's no question about it .
a few energy ge@@ e@@ ks spread out across the room .
but unfortunately , between here and here , most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat .
so the question is , how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using , and start w@@ asting less of it ?
we 're just moti@@ vating people to pay attention and change their behavior .
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms , and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody 's home .
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future , it is@@ n 't on this slide .
it 's in this room . it 's you , and it 's me .
and we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavi@@ oral science .
they ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it .
the dash@@ board that shows drivers how much energy they 're saving in real time makes former speed dem@@ ons drive more like cautious grand@@ mothers .
you see , two weeks ago , my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility .
we did everything that letter told us to do , and still I know there must be more .
thank you .
so I was trained to become a gym@@ n@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an , China in the 1970s .
but my ti@@ ger mother said , " No . "
but my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
that is me playing my imag@@ inary piano .
an opera singer must start training young to learn ac@@ rob@@ atics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was .
so at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
but that 's so unfair .
books banned in China , of course .
" honor , " I said . " that 's so different , and better , than obey . "
so because of books , I 'm here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
" even in purely non@@ religious terms , homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority marty@@ r@@ dom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a per@@ n@@ icious sickness . "
and at the end of buying our shoes , the sal@@ es@@ man said to us that we could each have a ballo@@ on to take home .
and when I was little , I took it as the greatest compli@@ ment in the world that she would say that about paren@@ ting my brother and me .
and when she said it , it made me anxious .
I went to De@@ af clubs .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite reson@@ ant to me .
and they don 't always coincide .
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
I loved him , that 's all .
Clinton just always had that light in him .
I 'm going to quote from another magazine of the ' 6@@ 0s .
and the change that 's been accomplished there , which is almost equally radical , is one that we pay not very much attention to .
one of the families I interviewed , Tom and Karen Rob@@ ards , were taken ab@@ ack when , as young and successful New Yor@@ kers , their first child was diagnosed with D@@ own syndrome .
and Karen Rob@@ ards said to me , " I 'm with Tom .
for David , I would cure it in an instant , to give him an easier life .
we live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up .

and his father said , " I sure do .
and then she looked back up and said , " I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . "
but I 've come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don 't want to imagine a life without them .
I recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , " she said .
and many people were aston@@ ished and said , " But how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong ? "
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , I wanted to protect my child from illness .
we took him to the M@@ RI machine , we took him to the CAT scanner , we took this day @@@ -@@ @ old child and gave him over for an ar@@ ter@@ ial blood draw .
( la@@ ughter ) But I thought -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I thought how my mother was right .
the sco@@ op was quite a very simple story .
my journalism is hing@@ ed on three basic principles : naming , sha@@ ming and jail@@ ing .
another key story that comes to mind , which relates to this spirit child phenomenon , is " The Sp@@ ell of the Al@@ bin@@ os . "
I show you how you stole it and when , or what you used what you had stolen to do .
what is the essence of journalism if it do@@ es@@ n 't benefit society ?
I know that sometimes people have their own criticisms about under@@ cover journalism .
so with my hidden intention , I kept quiet .
so after collecting the money , when he left , we were waiting for him to bring the goods .
second official : I don 't even know the place called [ unclear ] .
so I 'm surprised .
A@@ NAS A@@ reme@@ ya@@ w An@@ as : this was another story on an@@ tic@@ or@@ ruption .
but you see , when you have the hard core evidence , you are able to affect society .
A@@ AA : that was my president .
it was easier to get cannabis , heroin and cocaine , faster even , in the prison than outside the prison .
and that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars .
I have some questions for you .
how did you end up in jail ? this was just a few weeks ago , I believe , ye@@ ah ?
ca : talk to me just about fear and how you manage that , because you 're regularly putting your life at risk .
now I 'm interested in dol@@ ph@@ ins because of their large bra@@ ins and what they might be doing with all that bra@@ in@@ power in the wild .
well , we know a few things .
and you can really feel the sound . that was my point with that .
and basically , one of these groups will kind of back off and everything will resolve fine , and it do@@ es@@ n 't really escalate into violence too much .
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dol@@ ph@@ in .
they 're outside the dol@@ ph@@ in 's normal reper@@ toire , but they 're easily m@@ im@@ ic@@ ked by the dol@@ ph@@ ins .
let 's see if they might actually understand what that means .
we don 't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whi@@ stles .
for example , right now we can put their own signature whi@@ stles in the computer and request to interact with a specific dol@@ ph@@ in .
they were tour@@ ing one of the new modern factories , and Ford play@@ fully turns to Reu@@ ther and says , " He@@ y Walter , how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues ? "
RE@@ U@@ THER 's problem in that an@@ ec@@ do@@ te is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that 's full of machines , and we see this very clearly in the statistics .
we 're going to call that guy " Bill . "
they 're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at , and they 're actually getting so severe that they 're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement .
I witnessed this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and .
we 're facing very tough challenges .
the realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known .
the great point is to give them the plain facts . "
we did@@ n 't -- a lot of flying , a lot of experiments , a lot of things that did@@ n 't work , and ones that did work , and the plane kept getting a little better , a little better .
( la@@ ughter ) And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt .
but fortunately , Henry Kra@@ mer , who put up the prize for -- that was a one @@@ -@@ @ mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the English Channel , 21 miles .
and he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that .
but while this was going on , in 1982 , I got a prize from the Lind@@ ber@@ gh Foundation -- their annual prize -- and I had to prepare a paper on it , which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years .
and so , the year 2000 , you see there .
ten thousand years ago , the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't even have been visible on such a curve .
which I 'd never , really -- they had never , really , thought about but , now , they think about it .

( appl@@ ause ) That plane is widely used by the military , now , in all their operations .
( video ) ( Music ) Al@@ an Al@@ da : he 's got it , he 's got it , he 's got it on his head .
and that 's it , ye@@ ah , just a few inventions .
everybody around the table laugh@@ ed , but the jo@@ ke was kind of a good solution , so that 's what we ended up doing .
here 's how we did it . we shot Robert with six cameras .
( music ) ( Video ) Robert L@@ epage : [ as usual , Arthur 's drawing did@@ n 't account for the technical challenges .
( la@@ ughter ) But who on Earth would be interested by seven not @@@ -@@ @ yet @@@ -@@ @ built musical instruments inspired by women 's bodies ?
and we teach fact chec@@ kers all around the world .
when we see something interesting , it 's often automatic .
and it 's on us to find a way to rebuild trust , because fake news destro@@ ys it .
you play bas@@ eball when it 's bas@@ eball season and when there 's a game on the schedule .
that 's often given to the girl .
we 're playing against each other .
( la@@ ughter ) And because it 's an internal desire , we actually have some sense of control over that .
ok@@ ay , so when you 're playing bas@@ eball , so if we talk about during sexual activity , when you 're playing bas@@ eball , you 're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time .
you may have noticed in the bas@@ eball and piz@@ za comparison , under the bas@@ eball , it 's all commands .
well , Arthur C. Clar@@ ke , a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s , said that , " We overes@@ timate technology in the short term , and we underes@@ timate it in the long term . "
well of course a main@@ frame computer in 1957 was@@ n 't much use for that job .
so the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
it 's going to come bring it over here and put it down .
you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't want to do this with a current industrial robot .
and when he gra@@ bs an arm , it goes into zero @@@ -@@ @ force gravity @@@ -@@ @ compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen .
now she 's got the robot doing it .
she lifts her game , like the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do .
and it 's gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
and as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 6@@ 5,000 feet into the atmosphere .
the bulk of our research is algorithms .
notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top , which means that it can be located in the space .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) You can notice that this qu@@ ad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced .
( la@@ ughter ) The key to these ac@@ rob@@ atic maneu@@ vers is algorithms , designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory .
we then next calculate how the qu@@ ad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from .
( appl@@ ause ) Mach@@ ines can not only perform dynamic maneu@@ vers on their own , they can do it collectively .
well , I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken you out of the process .
democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power , whether it was of ty@@ rants or of high priests , their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth .
Sunday evening , Brussels , April 2010 .
picture yourselves around the table in Brussels .
again , the An@@ cient Greeks , with all their shortcomings , believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments . in people we trust .
democracy could not work without the citizens deliber@@ ating , deb@@ ating , taking on public responsibilities for public affairs .
so how then do we re@@ unite the two hal@@ ves of the ag@@ ora ?
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
now , more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels .
so that , I think , would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society .
and actually , they 're very quickly becoming a reality .
but time is a factor .
they 'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own .
now if responsibility and transparency are two of the corner@@ stones of representative government , autonomous robo@@ tic weapons could undermine both .
popular movements ag@@ itating for change could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass .
and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of d@@ ron@@ es and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them , both right now and historically .
but notice , this is more an immune system than a weapons system .
I was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rum@@ ors shared in family gatherings , in the streets and in schools .
it was a few weeks later , we started receiving all these " Man wol@@ ves will rape you if you go and drive . "
( la@@ ughter ) I know , I was like this , I was shocked .
so for me , it was@@ n 't only about these attacks I had to face .
Ah , it 's ok@@ ay . this is my favorite .
some 10,000 t@@ wee@@ ts were written in that h@@ ash@@ tag , while the opposite h@@ ash@@ tag , # Os@@ lo@@ Her@@ o , there was like a handful of t@@ wee@@ ts written .
ninety percent said yes , she 's a tra@@ itor .
because I believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you , thank you , thank you , thank you .
a friend once asked me , she said , " So when do you think this women driving will happen ? "
I hope you find clu@@ es to answer that from my speech .
thank you , everyone .
so , as a reflection of this , we started the Financial Crisis Observatory .
they are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable , perhaps control@@ l@@ able .
now , inte@@ res@@ tingly , 99 percent of the peak @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ val@@ leys of different ampl@@ it@@ udes can be represented by a universal power law represented by this red line here .
the root mechanism of a dra@@ gon @@@ -@@ @ king is a slow mat@@ uration towards instability , which is the bubble , and the clim@@ ax of the bubble is often the crash .
so we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them .
perhaps more surprisingly , the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine , par@@ tu@@ ri@@ tion , the act of giving birth , ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tic seizures .
we have applied this theory to many systems , land@@ slides , gl@@ ac@@ ier collapse , even to the dynamics of prediction of success : block@@ bu@@ sters , YouTube videos , movies , and so on .
we all know the Chinese miracle .
this is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble , a factor of three , 300 percent in just a few years .
you know , they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now .
maybe I am very powerful then .
we created the Financial Bu@@ b@@ ble Experi@@ ment .
and before you get off@@ ended and leave , I 've got to say that being too old , in this case , means that pretty much everyone in the room , I think , is over five years of age .
this is a big deal , so the tic@@ ks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
those tic@@ ks and crosses represent the 7,@@ 800 houses we 've looked at nationally around Australia , the same proportion .
and 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet .
that 's our average budget .
they don 't work , we have to fix them .
seventy @@@ -@@ @ five percent of our national team in Australia -- over 75 at the minute -- are actually local , indigenous people from the communities we work in .
( appl@@ ause ) In 2010 , for example , there were 8@@ 31 , all over Australia , and the Torres Strait Islands , all states , working to improve the houses where they and their families live , and that 's an important thing .
our work 's always had a focus on health .
OK , what do we do ?
why ? because that fl@@ ush@@ es the bug out .
we wash the bug out .
we did it . he provided us dust monitors .
they could trap the flies , send them to him in Per@@ th .
he 's got significantly less gu@@ t infection because he 's now got toilets , and there is@@ n 't human waste on the ground .
kan@@ ji Maya , she 's a mother , and a proud one .
we 've never found that .
the common link between all the work we 've had to do is one thing , and that 's poverty .
now , there 's a new technology called op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics which may be able to trick our taste bud@@ s , for instance pref@@ erring vegetables over swee@@ ts .
we call this a control experiment .
G@@ g : you put a fly in each chamber ?
and so what were your findings on ban@@ ana versus bro@@ c@@ col@@ i ?
Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics means that we can control these special ne@@ ur@@ ons whenever they 're exposed to a bright @@@ -@@ @ colored light , causing them to send messages to the brain .
G@@ g : there we go . you got all four .
G@@ g : Oh , he 's back . all right !
G@@ g : so we saw that we were able to rescue bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and make it just as appealing as ban@@ ana to our fruit flies .
so the question is : can we do the same thing in humans ?
and then I 'll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an in@@ cu@@ rable optim@@ ist .
and if this happens , an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley .
well , it depends , really , on what your goals are .
and if it will be , it 's the right thing to do , and if not , re@@ think it . "
let 's review them both . first of all , the meg@@ at@@ ren@@ ds .
it will cause rising seas . it will cause sal@@ ine deposited into wells and into lands .
what will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next 30 years ?
now we 're looking down south , through the K@@ ali G@@ and@@ aki .
and we 're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north , and in the seas rising from the south .
and now let 's look from the south , looking up , and let 's see this in relief .
global warming is something that happens to all of us , all at once .
as are these newly emerging communicable diseases , names that you had@@ n 't heard 20 years ago : Ebola , L@@ h@@ asa fever , mon@@ key po@@ x .
we 've seen the eradication of small@@ po@@ x .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
and we 've seen a new disease , not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases .
more reasons to be optimistic : in the ' 6@@ 0s , and I am a creature of the ' 6@@ 0s , there was a movement .
it 's not ancient history .
and they caught small@@ po@@ x in the one remaining place that had small@@ po@@ x , and they went home to die .
and we had to start all over again .
a disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India , and blin@@ ded half of all of those who were made blind in India , ended .
and most importantly for us here in this room , a bond was created .
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
though many human intellectual and technological le@@ aps had happened in Europe and the rest of the world , but Africa was sort of cut off .
it was a very tragic time . it was a very difficult time .
and U@@ sha@@ h@@ idi means " testimony " or " witness " in S@@ wa@@ hil@@ i .
there are crisis maps , election maps , corruption maps , and even environmental monitoring crowd maps .
we are hum@@ bled that this has roots in Kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they 're dealing with .
and in Kenya , it 's a very different reality , and one thing that remains despite the le@@ aps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem .
this is the reality that we deal with .
so we 've got a jo@@ ke in U@@ sha@@ h@@ idi where we say , " If it works in Africa , it 'll work anywhere . "
this is the BR@@ CK .
and the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects .

so the man who fled down the mountain that night trem@@ bled not with joy but with a stark , pri@@ mor@@ dial fear .
they found the perfect anti@@ do@@ te to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith .
and I , for one , refuse to live that way .
thank you .
and in there is a little town called Lib@@ by , which I visited , which feels kind of lon@@ ely , a little isolated .
it was in the football ground .
we 're all , under certain circumstances , will@@ fully blind .
and that 's not enough .
because the ocean gives us more than half of the oxygen we breathe , food , it absor@@ bs much of the carbon pollution that we throw in the atmosphere .
and fishing near the surface targets mostly species that migrate between the high seas and country 's waters , like tuna and shar@@ ks .
what this economic analysis reveals , is that practically the entire high seas fishing proposition is mis@@ guided .
I can still remember sort of that smell of ro@@ tting flesh as I pulled the cur@@ tain back to see her .
the question that was being asked of me was a different one , which was , did she also need an ampu@@ tation ?
I brought some for her parents .
despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , I 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabol@@ ic syndrome .
you can think of insul@@ in as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insul@@ in resistance .
what if obesity is@@ n 't the cause of insul@@ in resistance at all ?
when we become insul@@ in @@@ -@@ @ resistant , the home@@ o@@ sta@@ sis in that balance devi@@ ates from this state .
what if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong ?
actually , that 's ridic@@ ulous , because when it comes to hum@@ or , 75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for .
nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with hum@@ or except this woman .
generally , about 85 percent of the people liked it .
( la@@ ughter ) " I don 't want to hurt them . that do@@ es@@ n 't seem very funny to me . "
the bars protect us . that 's sort of fun , right ?
( la@@ ughter ) So in dealing with hum@@ or in the context of The New Yor@@ ker , you have to see , where is that ti@@ ger going to be ?
here 's one of his carto@@ ons .
and of course , that is not New Yor@@ ker hum@@ or .
it 's actually put together by Mat@@ t Di@@ ffee , one of our carto@@ onists .
but the next week , this was the first cartoon .
these carto@@ ons are not about them . they 're about us .
" I started my vege@@ tari@@ anism for health reasons , Then it became a moral choice , and now it 's just to anno@@ y people . "
" you sle@@ pt with her , did@@ n 't you ? "
like , this cartoon would puzzle many people .
" it sort of makes you stop and think , do@@ es@@ n 't it . "
I 'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about .
and this introduces a very important ethical point , and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up .
OK . let me talk to you about the Laz@@ ar@@ us Project .
it has a little c@@ ough and a hic@@ cup , and out comes spra@@ ys of little fro@@ gs .
and you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well .
if we could understand how that fro@@ g is managing the way its tum@@ my works , is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves ?
and I said , " Mike , by any chance -- " This was 30 or 40 years ago .
and normally , when water free@@ zes , as you know , it expands , and the same thing happens in a cell .
well , we looked at the tissue under the micro@@ scope .
so we thought , let 's give it a go .
we took the eggs of a related species , a living fro@@ g , and we in@@ activated the nucle@@ us of the egg .
we used ultra@@ violet radiation to do that .
that was a miracle , but it was workable .
and just last February , the last time we did these trials , I saw a miracle starting to happen .
what we found was most of these eggs did@@ n 't work , but then suddenly , one of them began to divide .
we even DNA @@@ -@@ @ tested some of these cells , and the DNA of the extin@@ c@@ t fro@@ g is in those cells .
but it 's a long way along the journey to producing , or bringing back , an extin@@ c@@ t species .
and this is news .
we haven 't announced this publicly before .
I think we 're going to have this fro@@ g hop@@ ping glad to be back in the world again .
but it 's also a tragic history .
the first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about 25 million years ago , and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
it 's not what you usually think about as a k@@ ang@@ ar@@ o@@ o , but these are meat @@@ -@@ @ eating k@@ ang@@ ar@@ o@@ os .
and cro@@ co@@ dil@@ es were not be@@ having at that time either .
these cro@@ co@@ dil@@ es were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground .
we had , in Australia , drop cro@@ cs . they really do exist .
at any rate , it was a fascinating place , but unfortunately , Australia did@@ n 't stay this way .
by 10,000 years ago , they had disappeared from New Guinea , and unfortunately , by 4,000 years ago , some@@ bodies , we don 't know who this was , introduced d@@ ing@@ oes -- this is a very archa@@ ic kind of a dog -- into Australia .
but immediately , the government said , that 's it , let 's get rid of them , and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw .
have a look at this bit of film foot@@ age .
does it have to stay this way ?
in 1990 , I was in the Australian Museum .
it was a eu@@ re@@ ka moment . we were very excited .
we would hope that we 'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form , and then , much like we 've done with the Laz@@ ar@@ us Project , get that stuff into an egg of a host species .
it has to be a different species . what could it be ?
th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine , Tas@@ man@@ ian devil ? that 's going to hurt .
they give birth to babies that are the size of a j@@ el@@ ly bean .
Andrew P@@ ask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time .
they took some of this same pic@@ k@@ led th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine DNA and they spl@@ iced it into a mouse gen@@ ome , but they put a tag on it so that anything that this th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine DNA produced would appear blue @@@ -@@ @ green in the mouse baby .
or has Tas@@ man@@ ia changed so much that that 's no longer possible ?
I 've even spoken to people , like Peter Car@@ ter here , who when I spoke to him , was 90 years old , but in 1926 , this man and his father and his brother caught th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
he looked at the hu@@ t . we went inside .
and I 'd like to ask the question . we need to think about this .
and I 'm positive it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't .
could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them , maybe they won 't go extin@@ c@@ t ?
it went like this .
that , of course , was the meta @@@ -@@ @ narrative dis@@ til@@ led from the theories of Kar@@ l Mar@@ x .
the story was a best@@ seller .
about one third of the entire world 's population lived under that meta @@@ -@@ @ narrative .
here I am in my home@@ town , my business growing le@@ aps and bounds .
now here are the facts .
so the Party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70 .
see , some have decided a pri@@ ori what kinds of changes they want to see , and only such changes can be called political reform .
indeed , corruption is a big problem , but let 's first look at the larger context .
once a year , the department reviews their performance .
they interview their superi@@ ors , their peers , their sub@@ ordinates . they vet their personal conduct .
just to show you how competitive the system is , in 2012 , there were 9@@ 00,000 Fu@@ ke and ke levels , 600,000 Fu@@ ch@@ u and ch@@ u levels , and only 40,000 fu@@ ju and ju levels .
he started as a village manager , and by the time he entered the Pol@@ it@@ bur@@ o , he had managed areas with a total population of 150 million people and combined G@@ D@@ Ps of 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars .
well , apparently he had@@ n 't heard of the Organization Department .
democracy is becoming a perpe@@ tual cycle of elect and regret .
but most analysts mis@@ diag@@ nose the disease .
perhaps a more interesting age is upon us .
( appl@@ ause ) B@@ G : many seem to agree .
one of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself .
and you have shown figures about the support that the government and the authorities have in China .
ex@@ l : there 's a vibrant civil society in China , whether it 's environment or what @@@ -@@ @ have @@@ -@@ @ you .
for thousands of years , you have civil society , yet they are consistent and coherent and part of a political order , and I think it 's a big cultural difference .
for all of these different critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve problems in , we basically know nothing at all .
and what we 're looking at here is a tr@@ uc@@ k@@ ful of data .
truck after truck after truck , filled with stack after stack after stack of data .
they went out into the field to answer a particular question .
happens all the time .
the top movie of the year was " Di@@ e H@@ ard with a Ven@@ ge@@ ance . "
what do you know ?
but the problem is , 20 or 30 programs , like , training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology , that is a tiny drop in the buc@@ ket .
I 'd been trained that the way you distribute technology within international development is always consultant @@@ -@@ @ based .
now we knew when we built this system , the whole point of it , just like with the Pal@@ m@@ Pil@@ ots , was that you 'd be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set .
that 's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation .
and so people think of clouds as things that get in the way .
let 's start with this one . it 's the cir@@ rus cloud , named after the Latin for a lock of hair .
not a very sn@@ app@@ y name . needs a re@@ brand .
clouds are the most eg@@ al@@ itarian of nature 's displays , because we all have a good , fantastic view of the sky .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous an@@ vil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .
by combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face , now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pixels with your bare hands .
architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly .
I 'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .
what would such a future look like ?
at MI@@ T Media La@@ b , along with my advisor Hiro@@ shi I@@ shi@@ i and my collabor@@ ator Re@@ h@@ mi Post , we created this one physical pix@@ el .
what we did was essentially cancel@@ ing gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic lev@@ itation and mechanical actu@@ ation and sensing technologies .
( appl@@ ause ) On ban@@ jo is 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old J@@ onn@@ y .
so , it started when J@@ onn@@ y was little , and he first started the ban@@ jo , he would play on his back with his eyes closed , and we 'd say it looked like he was sleeping .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
yes , it is . what is worse is that it is very expensive .
phosph@@ orus , a nutrient essential to life , which is becoming increasingly scarce , yet nobody is talking about it .
and if I make a comparison with oil , there 's an oil crisis , we talk about it , we talk about global warming , yet we never mention the phosph@@ orus crisis .
in 2030 , we 'll reach the peak .
do we have a solution , or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosph@@ orus use ?
I 've been fasc@@ inated by this little mush@@ room for over 16 years now .
it will go in search of phosph@@ orus , but only within the one mil@@ lime@@ ter which surro@@ unds it .
it CA@@ N@@ NOT go further in its search for phosph@@ orus .
now , imagine this tiny , micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic mush@@ room .
now let 's add a my@@ cor@@ rh@@ iza plant into the diagram I used earlier .
if you recall the graphs I showed you earlier , 85 percent of phosph@@ orus is lost in the soil , and the plants are unable to access it .
the mush@@ room is capable of dis@@ solving this in@@ soluble form and making it available for the plant to use .
these are trials in a field of sor@@ gh@@ um .
in other words , as I already said , I have invented nothing .
I 'm passionate about this topic .
the vast majority of its people are living in really mis@@ erable poverty despite an income per capita that 's on a par with that of Portugal .
so O@@ bi@@ ang junior , well , he bu@@ ys himself a $ 30 million man@@ sion in Mali@@ b@@ u , California .
I 've been up to its front gates .
now get this : until recently , he was earning an official monthly salary of less than 7,000 dollars .
and there 's Dan E@@ te@@ te .
well , at 22 , I was very lucky .
my first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African iv@@ ory .
and will the people of Congo , will they ever get their money back ?
in 2011 , natural resource exports out@@ weighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa , Asia and Latin America . nine@@ teen to one .
now let 's go back to the oil and mining companies , and let 's go back to Dan E@@ te@@ te and that $ 1 billion deal .
in a globalized world , corruption is a truly globalized business , and one that needs global solutions , supported and pushed by us all , as global citizens , right here .
I 'll tell you why with three stories .
the first one : I 'm from Lima , a product of mixed blo@@ ods , as you can see : my mother , a daughter of the coastal area , ari@@ stoc@@ ratic and Vice@@ reg@@ al , and my father , a son of the An@@ des , the In@@ c@@ as , from Cu@@ z@@ co .
( la@@ ughter ) And he wanted to add Par@@ mes@@ an cheese to everything .
first , the world was becoming connected through internet .
as important as a French dish ? "
as a result , full of fear , we hid this love from our parents , to protect it .
the third story does not bring very good news .
from the Industrial Revolution until now , we have been forced into a lifestyle that promp@@ ts us to consume products we don 't really need .
they are " A@@ my K@@ ro@@ use Ros@@ en@@ thal . "
please don 't wait .
well , guess what ?
there is no separation between life and death other than a thin line that connects the two .
birth , or the joy@@ ous , wonderful , vital parts of life , and death , those things we want to get rid of , are said to be faced equally .
answer in : 3 2 1 .
you add your way towards it , being careful not to hit any of the numbers you 've hit so far .
I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York .
and we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials , depending on where we are .
but the challenge is , as we move to cities , cities are built in these two materials , steel and concrete , and they 're great materials .
almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry , and if we look at energy , it 's the same story .
that challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways , and I think wood is going to be part of that solution , and I 'm going to tell you the story of why .
as an architect , wood is the only material , big material , that I can build with that 's already grown by the power of the sun .
so I believe that we have an eth@@ ic that the Earth grows our food , and we need to move to an eth@@ ic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes .
now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation .
the first sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ per , technically -- and the definition of a sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ per is 10 stories tall , believe it or not - but the first sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ per was this one in Chicago , and people were terri@@ fied to walk under@@ ne@@ ath this building .
we 've discovered that our universe is va@@ stly gran@@ der than our ancestors imagined and that life seems to be an almost imper@@ cep@@ ti@@ bly small per@@ turb@@ ation on an otherwise dead universe .
now , AI can generate fake faces and simulate your face saying stuff that you never said .
so all this amazing recent progress in AI really be@@ gs the question : how far will it go ?
and the obvious take@@ away is to avoid careers at the water@@ front -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) which will soon be automated and disrupted .
this brings us to the second part of our rocket met@@ aph@@ or : the steering .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's much better to be proactive rather than reactive ; plan ahead and get things right the first time because that might be the only time we 'll get .
no .
( la@@ ughter ) W@@ ow , that 's a lot of hands .
I 've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dol@@ ph@@ ins for the past 30 years .
we did this work in my lab with the dol@@ ph@@ ins and ele@@ ph@@ ants , and it 's been recently shown in the mag@@ pi@@ e .
so the dol@@ ph@@ ins could hit a key , a symbol , they heard a computer @@@ -@@ @ generated whi@@ stle , and they got an object or activity .
what was remarkable is , they explored this keyboard on their own . there was no intervention on our part .
beyond that , though , they started learning associations between the symbols , the sounds and the objects .
I 'm a farm boy . I grew up surrounded by animals , and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there ?
he approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people , for animals .
and then when Peter showed me that , I realized we had missed something , which is the rest of the planet .
so if we could switch to the audio from this computer , we 've been video conferencing with cognitive animals , and we 're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them .
we participate in the Ap@@ ps for Ap@@ es program O@@ ran@@ gu@@ tan Outreach , and we use iP@@ ads to help stimulate and enrich the animals , and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals .
well , my name is All@@ ison G@@ in@@ sburg , and we 're live in Balti@@ more at the National Aqu@@ arium .
they 're not really used to having cameras here at 8 o 'clock at night .
thirty years ago , we turned it on .
just last year , we turned on the production Internet .
the production version , it uses IP version 6 .
what we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together .
you 're launching this idea here at TED - PG : today .
the idea is this will be -- much like the Internet functions as a network of networks , which is V@@ int 's core contribution , this will be a wrap@@ per around all of these initiatives , that are wonderful individually , to link them globally .
what 's special about it ?
this is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work , and we just got our first seed money today towards that , so it 's our first project .
that 's older than my d@@ ad .
and that 's because when we 're looking for pan@@ cre@@ atic cancer , we 're looking at your blood@@ stream , which is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein , and you 're looking for this min@@ is@@ cul@@ e difference in this tiny amount of protein .
they were just there , but they had no significance .
and you can see that the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page , while birds that were once in that mead@@ ow are represented in the signature across the top .
( nature sounds ) Well , a year later I returned , and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions , I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn ch@@ or@@ uses , and now this is what we 've got .
well , I 've returned to Lin@@ col@@ n Me@@ ad@@ ow 15 times in the last 25 years , and I can tell you that the bi@@ op@@ hon@@ y , the density and diversity of that bi@@ op@@ hon@@ y , has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation .
whether or not we understand it is a different story .
and when there 's enough moisture in the soil in the spring , fro@@ gs will di@@ g themselves to the surface and gather around these large , ver@@ nal pools in great numbers .
and they do that for two reasons .
it 's a very sad story , but it really illustrates how animals can sometimes show emo@@ tion , a very controversial subject among some older bi@@ ologists .
( be@@ a@@ ver c@@ rying ) Y@@ ea@@ h . well .
I can 't speak even one word of its more than 2@@ 2,000 dialec@@ ts .
except , for many of those years , I 've had to carry around this funny little pink card with green lines running through my face identifying me as a permanent alien .
( la@@ ughter ) And if " Where do you come from ? "
it 's like a project on which they 're constantly adding upgrades and improvements and corrections .
I think about my swee@@ the@@ art or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be .
suddenly you 're alert to the secret patterns of the world .
more and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past .
and when I got out of my car , the air was pul@@ sing .
I just took walks along the monastery road and sent post@@ cards to loved ones .
and , of course , I 'm not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery .
but I do think it 's only by stopping movement that you can see where to go .
the most effective bow for me would be like this .
two : bel@@ ly is drawn inward for higher draw weight , which means more power .
I was so proud of myself for inven@@ ting a perfect bow on my own .
you need to console and communicate with the wood material .
it connects us with other people as almost nothing else can , across language barriers , across social and cultural and economic divides .
there are lots of music venues on our map .
next , and this is a very big one , we need leadership , and we need a strategy .
they 're volunteer councils , and they work directly with a designated advocate inside of city hall or even the chamber of commerce .
show up . be that recep@@ tive and engaged audience that is so necessary for a music city to thrive .
seek out leadership that do@@ es@@ n 't just pay lip service to your city 's music , but recognizes its power and is prepared to put a strategy in place to elev@@ ate it , grow it and build collaboration .
and that is a place where I want to live .
thank you .
we are living in an age of sur@@ ging income inequality , particularly between those at the very top and everyone else .
the 0.1 percent in the U.S.
they are where the One Per@@ cent was 30 years ago .
Bu@@ ffe@@ t@@ t likes to point out that in 1992 , the combined wealth of the people on the For@@ bes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans -- was 300 billion dollars .
changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .
think of your dishwasher or your t @@@ -@@ @ shirt .
and that 's no mere hypo@@ the@@ tical example .
let 's start with technology .
after all , for all its gri@@ m , sat@@ anic mills , it worked out pretty well , did@@ n 't it ?
( Be@@ at@@ boxing ) Party , party , ye@@ ah .
and last but not least , the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice .
our leaders , some of our great institutions are failing us .
and this is unacceptable .
and today I 'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that 's what 's crucial , how and why they set meaningful and aud@@ acious goals , the right goals for the right reasons .
let 's go back to 1975 .
An@@ dy was a superb leader and also a teacher , and he said to me , " John , it almost do@@ es@@ n 't matter what you know .
and when N@@ UN@@ A was founded , they used data to serve the health needs of lots of workers at large companies .
well , it 's a personal why .
and when he was seven , he had his first grand mal seizure at Dis@@ ne@@ yland .
they came to the country with limited resources speaking little English , so it was up to J@@ ini to en@@ roll her family in Medic@@ aid .
the first is debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
the next is universal access to anti @@@ -@@ @ HIV drugs .
JD : I love that .
what he really said was , " We don 't have any other way to manage this company , so we 'll give it a go . "
it could be ad clic@@ ks or engagement .
he got to 37 million users .
thank you .
what keeps you up at night ?
in this condition , the brain is hunting for potential threats , making it impossible to ignore any slight discomfort or night@@ time noise .
managing the stress that leads to hyper@@ ar@@ ous@@ al is one of our best @@@ -@@ @ understood treatments for in@@ som@@ nia , and good sleep practices can help rebuild your relationship with bed@@ time .
make sure your bedroom is dark and comfortably cool to minimize " threats " during hyper@@ ar@@ ous@@ al .
this clock , or cir@@ cad@@ ian rhythm , is also sensitive to light , so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body that it 's time for sleep .
so I think , I found the best way to describe my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life .
( music ) Y@@ ay !
why consciousness ?
now , whenever somebody tells me that , I think , you want to see spirituality move something ?
now , that 's the common @@@ -@@ @ sense definition . that 's our target .
it consciously seems to us , but that 's not really happening .
ok@@ ay , the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us , and that is , all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them .
the disappointment of robo@@ tics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot , so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing .
now , think of what I told you .
I don 't think we need to worry about that .
we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
you can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that 's what neuro@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts do .
I won 't demonstrate pain behavior , but I can tell you I 'm not having any pa@@ ins right now .
so it 's an obvious mistake . why did they make the mistake ?
and if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like U.@@ K. , Germany , and so on , they 're actually much lower .
so that 's getting really interesting here , a really interesting dynamic going on .
and , you know , as a parent , especially for the first time , why is he not going to be better than us ?
he was looking at us .
we realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario .
I mean , at the end , my wife and myself are quite different , but we have many things in common .
and one time , when he finally got his box of Fro@@ sted F@@ lakes back , it was cra@@ w@@ ling with ro@@ aches .
but he did have one thing .
it takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean .
so we see a clear need of active health promotion , especially in the case of the old people .
so this air@@ plane has no windows anymore , for example .
it will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment .
at the one hand , we have 1.2 kil@@ os , and at the other hand 0.6 kil@@ os .
this is an am@@ bu@@ cycle .
it has everything an ambulance has except for a bed .
when I was looking at these pictures , it brought me back many years to my past when I was a child .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
he just needed someone helping him .
one day , we received a call about a seven @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child cho@@ king from a hot dog .
we 're not interested in your help . " and he threw me out of the room .
I ran there by foot . I had no medical equipment .
these am@@ bu@@ cycles are an ambulance on two wheels .
we don 't transfer people , but we stabilize them , and we save their lives .
that 's why we get there so fast .
we started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs .
its motion push@@ es the fluid within the long chambers of the co@@ ch@@ le@@ a .
they send the results of their analysis up to the aud@@ itory cor@@ te@@ x .
hearing loss is the third most common chronic disease in the world .
because I get to talk about one of my favorite crit@@ ters , which is the Western gre@@ be . you haven 't lived until you 've seen these guys do their cour@@ t@@ ship dance .
and they said , you know what happens is , mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .
and there 's many of them , all over its entire body .
and a team has now just been able to m@@ im@@ ic that hydrogen @@@ -@@ @ ju@@ ggling hydro@@ gen@@ ase .
that little guy over there is a tar@@ di@@ grade .
a guy named Bru@@ ce Ros@@ ner looked at the tar@@ di@@ grade -- which dri@@ es out completely , and yet stays alive for months and months and months , and is able to regener@@ ate itself .
luc@@ k@@ ily , there are millions and millions of gen@@ i@@ uses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
Jan@@ ine Ben@@ y@@ us : Oh really ?
J@@ B : OK , put this -- OK , I 'll just hold this thing . OK , great .
this is a loc@@ ust . there can be 80 million of them in a square kilome@@ ter , and yet they don 't colli@@ de with one another .
and she 's actually fig@@ uring out how to make a collision @@@ -@@ @ avoidance circu@@ itry based on this very large ne@@ ur@@ on in the loc@@ ust .
" she is going to the library . "
a subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don 't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
I was referred to a psychi@@ atr@@ ist , who likewise took a gri@@ m view of the voice 's presence , subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of lat@@ ent in@@ san@@ ity .
it was like , " Don 't m@@ ess with me .
( la@@ ughter ) And to be honest , sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well .
it also makes you very good at e@@ av@@ es@@ dropping , because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously .
you saw many examples of my work up there , but it 's one that people know .
I love that people are willing to fill in the blan@@ ks .
it 's a movie . I did " The T@@ emp@@ est " on a stage three times in the theater since 1984 , ' 86 , and I love the play .
Trin@@ cul@@ o : misery acquain@@ ts a man with strange bed@@ fellows .
Cali@@ ban : this island is mine .
but I 'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema .
the medium was apparent . it was ban@@ al . we saw it .
the m@@ asked actors , the pup@@ pe@@ teers , they disappear , and the audience makes that leap into this world , into this imag@@ inary world of " The T@@ emp@@ est " actually happening .
I 'm on the precip@@ ice looking down into a dead volcan@@ o to my left .
I 'm in th@@ ongs and sar@@ ongs . it was many years ago .
it 's my trial by fire .
it 's a huge amount of data .
let 's pick a bit of data from another three @@@ -@@ @ month @@@ -@@ @ old patient .
it was deemed to be an unpredictable event .
two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignor@@ ant .
the Arabic language do@@ es@@ n 't satisfy today 's needs .
if we did so , they 'd strip us of our clothes .
how ?
Gibr@@ an Khal@@ il Gibr@@ an , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
all his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , sm@@ elling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
so , this is an example no one can argue with .
language is@@ n 't one , two or three words or letters put together .
I have a fran@@ cop@@ hone friend who 's married to a French man .
but don 't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
( appl@@ ause ) ( Bo@@ omer@@ ang no@@ ises ) It was coming straight for me . I had to . it was , ye@@ ah .
let 's call this the rhetor@@ ical model , where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand .
it makes it advers@@ arial ; it 's pol@@ ar@@ izing .
and the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph -- glorious triumph -- or ab@@ ject , ig@@ nom@@ ini@@ ous defeat .
there 's no magic w@@ and that 's going to make it disappear .
I don 't have an answer .
now , as you know , sun@@ flowers track the sun during the course of the day .
now , I know my clock do@@ es@@ n 't tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
so during the course of the day , five different sm@@ ells are dispersed throughout that environment .
one thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
( Motor@@ cy@@ le rev@@ ving ) [ Sound ] [ Touch ] [ S@@ ight ] [ Sm@@ ell ] [ Ta@@ ste ] J@@ L : and that 's how the five senses graph works .
now , for a period of three years , I gathered data , not just me but also some of my friends , and I used to teach in university , so I forced my -- I mean , I asked my students to do this as well .
these people I still do hang out with .
however , it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste .
it is time that students of design in Africa read the works of tit@@ ans like Che@@ ikh An@@ ta Di@@ op , Senegal 's Che@@ ikh An@@ ta Di@@ op , whose semin@@ al work on Egypt is v@@ indicated by this discovery .
they 've been looking outward for a long time , yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp , right within them .
( appl@@ ause ) I think that 's just fantastic .
you know , there 's this little child who can 't see , can 't really understand much about the world , has no one in the family who plays an instrument , and yet he taught himself to play that .
so as soon as I tried to get near the piano , I was firmly sho@@ ved off .
I think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little , De@@ rek , was that by the time you were two , your musical ear had already out@@ stripped that of most adults .
DP : g minor .
most pi@@ an@@ ists would have a heart attack if you said , " Sor@@ ry , do you mind playing ' F@@ light of the B@@ um@@ ble@@ be@@ e ' in B minor instead of A minor ? " as we went on .
DP : somebody played " Ch@@ op@@ sticks " like this . A@@ O : just te@@ asing , right ? here we go .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . I had one big problem .
that was the problem .
then I completed the Pom@@ p@@ id@@ ou Center in Met@@ z .
it 's a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
so they hire us to visu@@ alize their power and money by making monu@@ mental architecture .
and also I found out there 's many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church -- all the building was totally destroyed .
so I proposed to rebuild . I raised -- did fundraising .
the color coordination is very important .
he said , " As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . "
it stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
in 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
and in 2008 , in Ch@@ eng@@ du , Sic@@ hu@@ an area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
he said , " As long as you bring your money , you can do it . "
and I was very lucky .
this is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
people suffer mentally and physically .
they don 't have enough flat area to build standard government single @@@ -@@ @ story housing like this one .
but that 's not really how we learn biology early on , is it ?
but we 're always shown evolution portra@@ yed something like this , a mon@@ key and a ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee , some extin@@ c@@ t humans , all on a forward and steady march to becoming us .
but why does it matter ?
without understanding evolution the right way .
about three billion years ago , mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ul@@ arity evolved .
ca : have you met anyone interesting ?
I was very glad to see Gol@@ die Ha@@ wn , because I had an ap@@ ology to make to her .
and in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline , and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company , I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline .
RB : well , I like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a Virgin company , they -- CA : they are quality , Richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?
RB : no , but I was going to move on this .
I mean , Virgin Bri@@ des -- what happened there ?
I mean , what are the numbers on this ?
how much -- what 's the total revenue ?
ca : OK .
RB : of course .
RB : nobody 's ever called me Sir Richard .
ca : OK . so can you use your kn@@ igh@@ thood for anything or is it just ...
RB : no . I suppose if you 're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something , that might be worth using it .
RB : I 'll go get the secretary to use it .
and when you land , you 'll be able to go back into this giant eye .
but he 's an absolute gen@@ ius when it comes to design .
and it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- CA : what did you write to your family ?
here 's a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net .
I mean , there 's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field , aged four , and saying " OK , walk home . "
so the police knoc@@ ked on the door , and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word ven@@ e@@ real disease .
RB : I don 't actually think that the stereo@@ type of a business@@ person t@@ reading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works .
how do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ?
RB : yes , I mean , we 've got -- we 're setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word .
now , there is a sound -- ( Alar@@ m clock ) Ah , it worked !
we throw it away .
well , most of us anyway .
all of those combine , and they send projections down to the brain stem here .
but what I haven 't explained is what sleep is about .
it 's gone in and out of fashion .
now , I would say that a hot dog bu@@ n is kind of a me@@ ager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep .
so I 'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea .
what 's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is h@@ ug@@ ely enhanced by a night of sleep .
it 's not even an upgrade from economy to first class .
but what you must be so aware of is that alcohol do@@ es@@ n 't provide sleep .
another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain .
so , if you 're ac@@ utely stressed , not a great problem , but it 's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that 's the problem .
so at this point in the talk , this is a nice time to think , " Well , do you think on the whole I 'm getting enough sleep ? "
good . we 'll talk more about that later , about what are your tips .
well , it 's not rocket science .
no . poor things .
well , genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep , when mut@@ ated , when changed , also pre@@ dispose individuals to mental health problems .
the other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate , make worse , the mental illness state .
if you have good sleep , it increases your concentration , attention , decision @@@ -@@ @ making , creativity , social skills , health .
did@@ n 't get much s@@ exi@@ er than the Sp@@ ence at university , let me tell you .
and I wanted to let you know , a lot of the things you 've heard about Austr@@ alians are true .
now I was@@ n 't trying to be smart .
the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties .
( la@@ ughter ) Ano@@ ther thing about pri@@ mes , there is no final biggest prime number .
we know there are an infinite number of pri@@ mes due to the brilliant mathemati@@ cian Eu@@ cl@@ id .
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
if you 've got that , you 're with me for the entire journey . ok@@ ay ?
a random odd number is a lot harder to test .
you think that 's big .
it 's an absolute bru@@ te .
we did@@ n 't know for almost 40 years until Frank Nelson C@@ ole came along .
frank Nelson C@@ ole did not stop there .
he admitted afterwards it was@@ n 't that hard to do .
it took focus . it took dedication .
it was the year I left university .
if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file , that 's 22 me@@ g .
that fills me with almost sexual excitement .
and who am I kid@@ ding when I say almost ?
you think that 's cool .
it was@@ n 't my highlight of 2012 .
and he post@@ ulated a suggestion that there 's this infinite , incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe , and as other particles go through those particles and interact , that 's where they get their mass .
with Syria to the north , Israel and Palestine to the south , and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable .
however , for one day a year , we truly stand united , and that 's when the mar@@ athon takes place .
in 2005 , our prime minister was assass@@ inated , and the country came to a complete standstill , so we organized a five @@@ -@@ @ kilome@@ ter United We Run campaign .
they even hosted juice stations .
it gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community .
as simple as that .
so ye@@ ah , this task does seem to be daunting .
XL : so we attach this light @@@ -@@ @ sensitive switch of chann@@ el@@ rho@@ d@@ op@@ sin to the sensor we 've been talking about and in@@ ject this into the brain .
do I shake their hand ? do I turn around and run away ?
are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment ?
we were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique .
XL : and this is what we saw .
and then we published our findings in the journal Nature .
but is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie cli@@ p so that we can make it different from the original ?
we can shoot light into the brain to re@@ activate the memory of the blue box .
so what would happen here if , while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box , we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks ?
my early can@@ v@@ ases ended up being things that you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't expect to be used as canvas , like fri@@ ed food .
( la@@ ughter ) E@@ ven harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a gra@@ pe@@ fruit .
it just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself .
we got a pool . we filled it with milk .
in the past year , I want you to just raise your hand if you 've experienced relatively little stress .
( la@@ ughter ) You can see why this study fre@@ aked me out .
it 's getting more oxygen to your brain .
it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage .
your pit@@ u@@ itary g@@ land pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response .
people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress @@@ -@@ @ related increase in dying .
caring created resilience .
and when you choose to connect with others under stress , you can create resilience .
I was as reck@@ less and fool@@ ish as only young men can be .
but as soon as the wol@@ ves arrived , even though they were few in number , they started to have the most remarkable effects .
the rivers changed in response to the wol@@ ves , and the reason was that the regener@@ ating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often , so that the rivers became more fixed in their course .
why would that possibly have happened ?
it means taking down the f@@ ences , it means blocking the drainage d@@ it@@ ches , it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea , but otherwise stepping back .
there 's one estimate which suggests that in the United States , two thirds of the land which was once fore@@ sted and then cleared has become re@@ fore@@ sted as log@@ gers and farmers have ret@@ re@@ ated , particularly from the eastern half of the country .
perhaps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost meg@@ af@@ a@@ una .
yes , ladies and gent@@ lemen , there were lions in Tra@@ fal@@ gar Square long before Nelson 's Col@@ umn was built .
it 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
where 's the right finger ?
J@@ ake Bar@@ ton : so I have to say I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry .
G@@ len@@ n L@@ ow@@ ry , the head of Mo@@ MA , put it best when he said , " We want visitors to actually cease being visitors .
this is Pic@@ as@@ so , of course embo@@ dying so much of it from the 20th century .
and so our next interface , which I 'll show you , actually le@@ verages that idea of this line@@ age of creativity .
it 's the original , excav@@ ated wall at the base of the World Trade Center that with@@ stood the actual pressure from the H@@ ud@@ son River for a full year after the event itself .
and so you can hear oral hi@@ stories -- so people who were actually working the so @@@ -@@ @ called buc@@ ket brigades as you 're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment .
" how could 9 / 11 have happened ? "
and so when you go to the memorial , you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves .
in this case , Harry Ram@@ os , who was the head trader at an investment bank , who stopped to aid Victor Wal@@ d on the 5@@ 5th floor of the South Tower .
when I was in high school , I got my first Philips reel @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ reel tape rec@@ order , and tape rec@@ orders became my sort of pre @@@ -@@ @ computer medium of learning .
one of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lo@@ is would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
it had a speech synthe@@ siz@@ er .
( la@@ ughter ) I no longer would be cen@@ sored .
there are many people who have helped me in my life , and many that I haven 't met .
I grew up with family , friends , reading to me , and I loved the warmth and the breath and the clos@@ eness of people reading .
but it 's not legal to transport the books from Spain to Latin America .
we 've known how to prevent malaria since 18@@ 97 .
so malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve , and yet to this day , hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the b@@ ite of a mosqu@@ ito .
and I think there 's three main reasons why .
it lives half its life inside the cold @@@ -@@ @ blo@@ o@@ ded mosqu@@ ito and half its life inside the warm @@@ -@@ @ blo@@ o@@ ded human .
so the in@@ sect is continually trying to fight off the paras@@ ite , and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off .
we kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives .
but just if you take malaria out , deaths from everything else go down .
and it 's the parad@@ ox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least .
when I told my relatives in India that I was writing a book about malaria , they kind of looked at me like I told them I was writing a book about war@@ ts or something .
and when you think about the bed net , it 's sort of a surgical intervention .
I mean , these are minor in@@ conveni@@ ences .
and I was writing terrible poetry and k@@ nit@@ ting swe@@ aters for him .
( la@@ ughter ) And that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
so , I hopefully am writing , you know , books that are good for children and for adults .
and so , I was able to put that into this story , which is an alphabet , and hopefully go on to something else .
OK . so , the first one I was very tim@@ id , and I 'll begin .
so , shot dead , sm@@ acked over the head , you know , thrown away .
well , not so aw@@ ful .
and he says , " It is impossible not to lie .
and I really spend a lot of time won@@ dering , how much truth do we tell ?
and so , you know , I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they 're singing Russian songs .
some of you might be won@@ dering what a cyber@@ security specialist looks like , and I thought I 'd give you a quick insight into my career so far .
this is what someone that specializes in malware and h@@ acking looks like .
today 's cyber@@ criminal , what do they look like ?
an interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo , it em@@ beds GPS data about where that photo was taken .
you see , technology 's changing at a st@@ agg@@ ering rate , and that 250,000 pieces of malware won 't stay the same for long .
find these resources . apply them .
but for myself , in the past , I 've spent the last 20 years studying human behavior from a rather un@@ or@@ thodox way : picking pockets .
every phone has something in common .
do you have an American Express in your wal@@ let ?
hi , si@@ r , how are you ?
I wanted his wal@@ let , he gave me his number .
while we 're focused on the hand , it 's sitting on your shoulder .
it 's back on your shoulder .
do you remember what it was ?
can I show them ? rather b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re . is this yours , si@@ r ?
( la@@ ughter ) H@@ op@@ efully it matches his taste .
and we have a few other things , these all belong to you , along with a big round of appl@@ ause from all your friends .
( la@@ ughter ) ( H@@ es@@ itant appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) At@@ tention is a powerful thing .
so , I guess I 'd like to pose that question to you .
so , robots .
and it can be very impressive to watch them at work .
well , for many years , robots have been designed to emphasize speed and precision , and this translates into a very specific architecture .
so let 's talk about them a moment .
well , nature teaches us the opposite .
you see the camera fixed on top .
this makes it possible to reach many different targets , such as tum@@ ors , deep inside a solid organ by using one single insertion point .
so clearly , this is a pretty exciting time for robo@@ tics .
but of course , we are not even close to what nature fig@@ ured out in millions of years of evolution .
be@@ es get all of the protein they need in their diet from pol@@ len and all of the car@@ bo@@ hyd@@ rates they need from nec@@ tar .
these people are moving pol@@ len from flower to flower with a pa@@ int@@ brush .
tom@@ ato grow@@ ers now put bum@@ ble@@ be@@ e colonies inside the greenhouse to pol@@ lin@@ ate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pol@@ l@@ ination when it 's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes .
and I was permanently ho@@ oked .
now this society has no central authority .
so in my lab , we study how be@@ es keep themselves healthy .
it kills off bacteria and mol@@ ds and other ger@@ ms within the colony , and so it bol@@ sters the colony health and their social immunity .
in our collective conscience , in a really pri@@ mal way , we know we can 't afford to lose be@@ es .
now we have the best data on hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es , so I 'll use them as an example .
we stopped planting cover crops .
one of these class of insecti@@ cides , the neon@@ icon@@ tin@@ oids , is making head@@ lines around the world right now .
public enemy number one for be@@ es is this thing .
it 's called var@@ ro@@ a de@@ struc@@ tor .
it turns out , it 's hopeful . it 's hopeful .
set aside farm@@ land .
we 're kind of at a ti@@ pping point .
we can 't really afford to lose that many more .
but we can also pull up , using speech @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ text translation , we can pull the entire trans@@ cript , and that works even for people with kind of funny acc@@ ents like myself .
and we call that the mem@@ e @@@ -@@ @ ome .
and we 've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint remin@@ is@@ cent of a conversation that is happening everywhere .
they come from the network structure of interconnected ideas . keep going .
and of course , from here , we can go and zoom in and see , well , what are young people looking at ?
what 's tren@@ ding now ? what 's the popular talk now ?
but there 's so much creative content that 's just buried at the bottom .
and we should begin by re@@ imag@@ ining leather .
it 's environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live .
strange term , but in some ways , he is .
Blo@@ om@@ berg in New York was a Democ@@ rat , then he was a Republican , and finally he was an Independent , and said the party label just gets in the way .
and as a result , mayors and city coun@@ cillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level , and this is the third feature about mayors , than national governing officials .
when cities interact , they interact like this .
we heard more about who will be number one .
they work together in climate change , for example .
Bogo@@ ta , where Mayor M@@ ock@@ us , when he was mayor , he introduced a transportation system that saved energy , that allowed surface buses to run in effect like sub@@ ways , express buses with corridors .
in that journey from pol@@ is to Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ is , we can re@@ discover the power of democracy on a global level .
and the only question is , are you ?
and one night , the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal .
and really , that 's where this case should have ended .
and we found that once we planted this false memory , people did@@ n 't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor pic@@ nic .
but meanwhile , we should all keep in mind , we 'd do well to , that memory , like liberty , is a fragile thing .
we all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts , this accumulation model of science , as many have called it , and it seems imp@@ regn@@ able , it seems impossible .
how can you ever know all of this ?
so what do we do about this ? well , the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect , if you will .
because it 's not always quite so straightforward .
so what do we have to do ? we have to give our students a taste for the boundaries , for what 's outside that circum@@ ference , for what 's outside the facts , what 's just beyond the facts .
well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
and that 's meant as a warning .
and Lu@@ ria said , " At the North Pole , there is always snow .
you can 't do science without making it logically consistent .
so the ten@@ or of education has changed .
and you can get moral argument off the ground , then , because you 're not treating moral principles as concrete entities .
now how did all of this arise out of I.@@ Q. tests ?
that is , they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question .
Lord Cur@@ z@@ on once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea , and he said , " Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have ? "
you would probably begin by saying , " To do what ? "
secondly , what about the aim ?
the aim is to have more trust .
well frankly , I think that 's a stupid aim .
but if , on the other hand , they 're unreliable , we might not .
and I 'm very glad to say , I don 't think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dis@@ honest .
well every day , all over the place , it 's being done by ordinary people , by officials , by institutions , quite effectively .
let me give you a simple commercial example .
it is relationships in which people are trust@@ worthy and can judge when and how the other person is trust@@ worthy .
this idea has a lot of traction with us .
how many of you know what I 'm talking about ?
it can be pronounced on a computer , does something like this .
it collap@@ ses into a three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional shape that turns it into a nan@@ om@@ ach@@ ine that actually cuts DNA .
so you send an e @@@ -@@ @ mail with these sequences in it to a company , and the company pronoun@@ ces them on a DNA synthe@@ siz@@ er , a machine about the size of a photo@@ cop@@ ier .
I mix them together , add a little bit of salt water , and then add this long str@@ and I was telling you about , that I 've stolen from a virus .
and then what happens is , you heat this whole thing up to about boiling .
so the net effect of all 250 of these str@@ ands is to fold the long str@@ and into the shape you 're looking for .
what we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self @@@ -@@ @ assembly so we can build anything , right ?
and if it 's the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic .
we need to speak up and shat@@ ter the silence .
so he says , " All right . "
and ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it , principally having to do with vision .
his story is their story .
she likes to make people laugh " alo@@ t . "
what I am trying to do as a photographer , as an artist , is to bring the world of art and science together .
what I am trying to do is I 'm trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer 's heart but also to the viewer 's brain .
what was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the P@@ han@@ tom of the Opera for the rest of the week .
now this looks already quite interesting , but let me now add some water@@ colors to it .
so that 's how those images were made .
thank you very much .
Arm@@ strong and Al@@ dr@@ in were alone , but their presence on the moon 's gray surface was the culmination of a con@@ vul@@ sive , collective effort .
A@@ pol@@ lo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
why did they go ? the cy@@ n@@ ical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets .
why , 35 years ago , fly the Atlantic ?
landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological trium@@ phs .
in the middle years of the century , polio was eradicated and small@@ po@@ x eliminated .
so " Som@@ ething happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology " has become a common@@ place .
but I don 't think that explanation is good enough .
we could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the outline of a plan .
but going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .
we want alternative energy sources that can compete on price . none exist .
but 30 years of research have taught us that fam@@ ines are political crises that catastro@@ ph@@ ically affect food distribution .
hard problems are hard .
it is not 1961 .
there is no galvan@@ izing contest like the Cold War , no politician like John Kennedy who can hero@@ ize the difficult and the dangerous , and no popular science fic@@ tional my@@ th@@ ology such as exploring the solar system .
we are left alone with our day , and the solutions of the future will be harder won .
here 's a question we need to re@@ think together : what should be the role of money and markets in our societies ?
eighty @@@ -@@ @ two dollars a night .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
so now , for lob@@ by@@ ists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don 't like to wait , there are companies , line @@@ -@@ @ standing companies , and you can go to them .
the difference is this : a market economy is a tool , a valuable and effective tool , for organizing productive activity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale .
how many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try ?
let 's see by a show of hands .
and then , if you stop paying them , what happens then ?
MS : now , let 's see if there 's someone who fav@@ ors , who thinks it 's worth trying this .
MS : and measure . and what would you measure ?
now , what this , even this brief debate , brings out is something that many economists overlook .
do we want a society where everything is up for sale , or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money CA@@ N@@ NOT buy ?
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
I 'm not a social problem guy .
you know , this is a low point in the respect for business .
we 've been aware of these problems for decades .
we 've got to confront that reality .
well there , I think the answer is very clear : they 're in business .
we 're now seeing companies embrace this idea .
for the first time in history , most people live in cities , and the U.@@ N. estimates that over the next 40 years , the population is going to double on the planet .
it was like a Star Tre@@ k episode , you know ?
where they 'd been , I don 't know , but they were there .
so we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of la@@ wn chairs , and we put those la@@ wn chairs out on the street .
and the la@@ wn chairs became the talk of the town .
you can have fun with paint .
so if you di@@ g below the head@@ lines , though , you 'll see that the people were far ahead of the press , far ahead of the politicians .
that 's 280 times around the globe .
quite radical .
we 've also brought this approach to our buses , and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America , the slow@@ est bus speeds .
the Iran@@ ians built a special t@@ arma@@ c at the airport in Tehran , far away from the central terminal , so that no one would notice the large number of Israeli planes shu@@ tt@@ ling between Tel Aviv and Tehran .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evapor@@ ated .
ir@@ onically , this was happening at a time when Iran was more interested in peacemaking with Washington than to see to Israel 's destruction .
we need mental health professionals to join rescue teams during times of active crisis .
one of the few aid organizations in the world that specializes in providing psychosocial aid and first @@@ -@@ @ response mental health interventions to refugees and displaced populations .
the impact on the soul is hardly visible , but the damage can be there for life .
thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
this has never made much sense to me , this argument .
you can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
is it prey ? is it pre@@ dat@@ or ? is it mate ?
if I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a pin@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?
it 'll p@@ at his brother on the shoulder , it 'll answer the phone when it rings , it 'll wave good@@ b@@ ye .
but however , about half the patients , this do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
and this gets wired into the circu@@ itry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
it was a paraly@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom arm .
" now , " I said , " now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom -- your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . "
but he 's not stupid . he knows it 's not real .
now , I said , " M@@ ove your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . "
" Oh , nothing . it 's cl@@ en@@ ched again . "
it goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals .
this has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
he pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculi@@ arity : every time they see a number , it 's colored .
these people m@@ ud@@ dle up their senses .
syn@@ esthe@@ sia runs in families , so Gal@@ ton said this is a he@@ red@@ itary basis , a genetic basis .
why would that be ?
now , that 's not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
so we said , there 's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
so , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that 's why you get syn@@ esthe@@ sia .
remember I said it runs in families ?
normal people say , she 's warm like the sun , she 's radi@@ ant like the sun , she 's nurturing like the sun .
now , none of you is a Mar@@ tian . how did you do that ?
so , this area is about eight times the size in higher -- especially in humans -- as in lower pri@@ mates .
there were many epidemics there .
after 10 years of working overseas , I was exhausted .
I wanted to come home .
I 'd seen a lot of death , in particular epidemic death , and epidemic death has a different feel to it .
malaria had been stuck .
what do the graphs look like ?
and that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed .
and then a bun@@ ch of community activities for changing norms .
in fact , there have been three independent evaluations of this now .
and even a movie was made around our work .
my business friends said , " G@@ ary , you 're being criticized tremend@@ ously .
many of the major cities in the U.S. , including New York City and Balti@@ more and Kansas City , their health departments are running this now .
some of them were new stories .
and for a while they were familiar formats , but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium .
he gave them " Wo@@ ol 2 , " which was a little bit longer than the first one , " Wo@@ ol 3 , " which was even longer , culmin@@ ating in " Wo@@ ol 5 , " which was a 60,000 @@@ -@@ @ word novel .
there was no mediator between him and the audience .
it was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
they respond to it .
I double checked the newspapers .
it ended , a true narrative conclusion .
one of my favorite examples of something that 's happening on Twitter right now , actually , is the very absur@@ dis@@ t Cri@@ mer Show .
Cri@@ mer Show 's creator has said that it is a par@@ ody of a popular type of show in the U.@@ K. , but , man , is it we@@ ir@@ d .
I think borrowing all of these trop@@ es from television and additionally presenting each Cri@@ mer Show as an episode , spelled E @@@ -@@ @ P @@@ -@@ @ P @@@ -@@ @ A @@@ -@@ @ S @@@ -@@ @ O @@@ -@@ @ D , " ep@@ pas@@ od , " presenting them as episodes really , it creates something new .
something totally new has been created here out of par@@ od@@ ying something on television .
" give me liberty or give me death . "
its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is un@@ matched . "
if you will indul@@ ge me , I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they 've come to this belief .
finally , China is also providing innovative solutions to age @@@ -@@ @ old social problems that the world faces .
I want to be able to do what China 's doing .
and I suggest that they have two options .
so we have these studies that tie weight to in@@ activity , but even more , we now have studies that tie weight to where you live .
and I learned a new word last week .
San Francisco , the same thing . Portland , the same thing .
the environmental movement in America has historically been an anti @@@ -@@ @ city movement from Je@@ ff@@ er@@ son on .
and then the American environmental movement has been a classi@@ cally Ar@@ cad@@ ian movement .
Canadian cities , they consume half the gasoline of American cities .
European cities consume half as much again .
I would argue the same thing that makes you more Sustain@@ ble is what gives you a higher quality of life , and that 's living in a wal@@ k@@ able neighborhood .
this was actually used by the May@@ ans as an artificial tooth replacement .
their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function .
those stem cells are really important in the embry@@ o when it develops , and they also sort of wake up if you have a frac@@ ture to help you with repairing the bone .
so it creates , in essence , an artificial cav@@ ity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
so it 's very , very low in terms of after @@@ -@@ @ pain compared to an ili@@ ac c@@ rest harvest .
you can see here a very squ@@ ish@@ y one and now a material that 's also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable tough@@ ness , and it 's no longer b@@ rit@@ tle .
now 60 years later , the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for , like here , where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall .
as the length of the construction takes years , workers end up forming a rather rough @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ ready informal city , making for quite a ju@@ x@@ tap@@ o@@ sition against the sophisticated structures that they 're building .
over the past seven years , I 've been following my fasc@@ ination with the built environment , and for those of you who know me , you would say that this ob@@ session has led me to live out of a suit@@ case 365 days a year .
being constantly on the move means that sometimes I am able to catch life 's most unpredictable moments , like here in New York the day after the San@@ dy storm hit the city .
designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven 't had any education in architecture or design .
and with each inhabit@@ ant finding their own unique way of coming by , this tower becomes like a living city , a place which is alive with micro @@@ -@@ @ economies and small businesses .
from the outside , behind this always @@@ -@@ @ changing facade , you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic , intuitive way that responds directly to their needs .
they 're descendants of farmers who began mig@@ rating from the upper Egypt in the ' 4@@ 0s , and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo .
despite having limited access to space and money , the homes in the area are designed with care and detail .
I 'm a writer and artist , and I make work about technology .
last year , I built my own self @@@ -@@ @ driving car .
( la@@ ughter ) And I do these things mostly because I find them completely fascinating , but also because I think when we talk about technology , we 're largely talking about ourselves and the way that we understand the world .
it 's basically a video of someone opening up loads of chocolate eggs and showing the toys inside to the viewer .
so this is where we start .
I hope that 's what they 're doing it for , because there 's easier ways of making ad revenue on YouTube .
it 's basically fake news for kids , and we 're training them from birth to click on the very first link that comes along , regardless of what the source is .
that 's do@@ es@@ n 't seem like a terri@@ bly good idea .
here 's another thing that 's really big on kids ' YouTube .
this is the " F@@ inger Family Song . "
is this a person ? is this a tro@@ ll ?
and also , on the other side of the screen , there still are these little kids watching this stuff , stuck , their full attention gra@@ bbed by these we@@ ir@@ d mechanisms .
this is the way we 're actually constructing the world today out of this data .
it 's like , how much do we really understand -- by agency , I mean : how we know how to act in our own best interests .
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that I was then .
he was the China representative for the American So@@ y@@ bean Association .
( la@@ ughter ) " Travel the world and have lots of kids . "
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do .
I 'm looking for a cure .
then another year goes by .
this time it 's on the intensive care ward when a twenty@@ something resident that I 've never met before tells me that Te@@ rence is dying , perhaps tonight .
I say , " Ke@@ ep him alive if you can . "
it was an ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating fight , and I 'd repeat the fight today without a moment 's hes@@ itation .
and they were readily available .
yet I will tell you that denial is@@ n 't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through .
the medical professionals too , you out there , you 're in denial too .
and during Te@@ rence 's illness , I , we , we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too .
as a result , he spent just four days in hosp@@ ice , which I 'm sure , as you all know , is a pretty typical outcome , and we never said good@@ b@@ ye because we were un@@ prepared for the end .
and he 's been a pretty good general .
and is@@ n 't that what we 're missing ?
in the same span of time , computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude .
so essentially , we can start from an anonymous face , offline or online , and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data .
and what is happiness ?
the great Indian economist , A@@ marty@@ a S@@ en , was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply , but rather the ability to acquire or entit@@ le oneself to that food through the market .
and that business is agriculture .
this meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather in@@ efficiently -- and let the private market do its magic .
well , what happened over the last 25 years ?
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ?
we know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market , and the risks of trans@@ acting in rural , agriculture markets , are extremely high .
to give you an example , between 2001 and 2002 , Ethiopian ma@@ ize farmers produced two years of bum@@ per harvest .
and we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002 .
not six months later , in July 2002 , Ethiopia announced a major food crisis , to the same proportions as 1984 : 14 million people at risk of starvation .
and this is not just specific to Ethiopia , but happens over and over , all over Africa .
in the American Mid@@ west , farmers used to load grain onto bar@@ ges and send it u@@ pri@@ ver to the Chicago market .
and over the last decade , you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade .
the EC@@ X E@@ dge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself .
we believe that the winds of change are here , and that we can do it .
I worked on forestry issues in WW@@ F .
about 25 years in total , and then three years ago , I found myself talking to I@@ K@@ EA 's CEO about joining his team .
but first , let 's just take three numbers .
the second number is six : this is six degrees centi@@ grade , what we 're heading towards in terms of global warming .
you can see my grand@@ mother there .
it 's about what we do right here , right now , and for the rest of our working lives .
yields increase , and you hal@@ ve the input costs .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
take the topic of 100 percent targets , actually .
but then it comes to your operations .
we 've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children 's rights .
we also have a foundation that 's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015 .
back in the ' 7@@ 0s , no one touched the continent with a bar@@ ge pole .
ten percent 's come from India .
it 's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia .
you might choose China , which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line , where there 's 200 million young people , and every year until 2010 that 's getting bigger .
I 'm showing you democracy versus auto@@ c@@ racy .
and what you 'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don 't always succeed , but they try and deliver .
but what I 'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing .
no offense .
twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan African growth is slightly better than India .
life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years .
and when I present this in Africa -- Nairobi , Lag@@ os , Accra -- I get one question .
you can go and buy some of the great tun@@ es .
these hall@@ uc@@ inations appear suddenly , and can last for mere minutes or rec@@ ur for years .
and the same is true for other senses .
so one theory is that L@@ SD and p@@ si@@ loc@@ y@@ bin cause hall@@ uc@@ inations by disrup@@ ting the sign@@ aling involved in sen@@ sory integration .
as we learn more , we 'll likely come to appreciate just how subjective and individual each person 's island universe of perception really is .
Amazon battle scenes decorated the Par@@ th@@ en@@ on on the Ath@@ en@@ ian Ac@@ ro@@ pol@@ is ; paintings and stat@@ ues of Amaz@@ ons ador@@ ned temples and public spaces .
were Amaz@@ ons merely figures of myth , or something more ?
so who were the real women warri@@ ors known as Amaz@@ ons ?
their culture flour@@ ished for about 1,000 years beginning around 800 BC .
this amaz@@ ed the ancient Greeks , whose women led restricted indoor lives .
the earliest stories of the S@@ cy@@ th@@ ians , and Amaz@@ ons , may have been exagg@@ erated rum@@ ors .
early depic@@ tions of Amaz@@ ons showed them with Greek weapons and arm@@ or .
until recently , no one was sure how strong the links were between S@@ cy@@ th@@ ians and the Amaz@@ ons of Greek myth .
more than 1,000 ancient S@@ cy@@ th@@ ian k@@ ur@@ gans , or burial moun@@ ds , have been excav@@ ated , containing sk@@ elet@@ ons and weapons .
is it possible that the my@@ thic realm of thr@@ illing Amazon tales was a way to imagine women and men as equal compan@@ ions ?
why do none of these places have any of the charming characteristics of our older cities ?
well , it matters because most people around the world are gra@@ vit@@ ating to urban areas globally .
first : mass production .
cars travel at very high speeds .
they 're susceptible to human error .
a wheelchair necessitates a landscape of minimal slopes and redundant vertical circulation .
now , I said there was a third reason for all this sa@@ men@@ ess , and that 's really a psychological one .
and I bet you don 't because you don 't want processed food in your life .
when we invented the automobile , what happened is , the world all bent towards the invention .
in the 21st century , technology can be part of the solution -- if it ben@@ ds to the needs of the world .
so what do I mean by that ?
all of these ideas , to me , are no@@ st@@ alg@@ ia @@@ -@@ @ free .
and then I did it .
so , in a f@@ ren@@ zy , I corrected everybody 's marks , not imagin@@ atively .
I don 't understand why I was never caught .
it 's so mysterious , and it 's so pervasive .
we forget how pi@@ til@@ ess he is .
is it something as obvious as that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , which bo@@ ils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
we tell ourselves a story about other people 's lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed to make us feel terrible .
when S@@ wan@@ n is in his je@@ alous thro@@ es , and suddenly he 's listening at door@@ ways and bri@@ bing his mi@@ stress ' servants , he def@@ ends these behavi@@ ors .
is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
I can 't give the world D 's , as much as I would really like to , some days .
I mean , we 're all good citizens of social media , are@@ n 't we , where the currency is en@@ vy ?
but I 've always preferred [ Inspector ] Le@@ stra@@ de , who is the rat @@@ -@@ @ faced head of Scotland Y@@ ard who needs Hol@@ mes desper@@ ately , needs Hol@@ mes ' gen@@ ius , but res@@ ents him .
Oh , it 's so familiar to me .
so Le@@ stra@@ de needs his help , res@@ ents him , and sort of se@@ eth@@ es with bit@@ ter@@ ness over the course of the myster@@ ies .
we 're proud of you . "
it seems to treat je@@ al@@ ous@@ y as a problem of geometry , not emo@@ tion .
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
you would have to wait a really long time before it happens , but believe me , quantum tun@@ n@@ eling is a real phenomenon , and it has been observed in many systems .
so armed with this information from the L@@ HC , together with some colleagues here at CER@@ N , we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra @@@ -@@ @ dense H@@ ig@@ gs state , and we found a very intri@@ gu@@ ing result .
the H@@ ig@@ gs field is in a w@@ ob@@ bly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse .
at first , the first thing I thought was , I want to run away .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
and I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with per@@ for@@ ations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a filtered way .
with these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like , " This is not a shopping m@@ all . we did@@ n 't ask for that . "
and it 's where all the neighbors , they can go up and soci@@ alize , and do activities such as having a two @@@ -@@ @ kilome@@ ter run in the morning , jumping from one building to another .
they are more dynamic .
it 's kind of been taking on that risk . bring it on .
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and I was living on the dark side .
I 'm a novel@@ ist , and I 'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common .
they 're both stories , interpretations .
we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breath@@ less .
we all know that the Internet has sh@@ run@@ k space as well as time .
I remember my grand@@ father revising the capitals of the world with me .
Bud@@ a and P@@ est were separated by the Danube , and Vienna had a Spanish riding school .
night after night , he took me up on the terrace , on his shoulders , and pointed out J@@ up@@ iter and Satur@@ n and the Great Be@@ ar to me .
by archiving everything , we think that we can store it , but time is not data .
one of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention , and definitely from my grand@@ mother , love and attention were one and the same thing .
but then , I looked into the distance , and I saw some smoke coming from a farm@@ house , and I 'm thinking , who could be living here ?
they did so illegally .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run deci@@ de@@ dly differently .
( la@@ ughter ) And she said to me , when I asked her the obvious , " Radiation do@@ es@@ n 't sc@@ are me . starvation does . "
the World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl @@@ -@@ @ related deaths at 4,000 , eventually .
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education .
you 're in and out of traffic all day , and it 's zo@@ oming around you .
that 's really bad for the worker .
I also learned about the relent@@ lessness of tra@@ sh .
and then there 's the stigma .
you know when to expect them .
so in the flow of your days , in the flow of your lives , next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you , take a moment to acknowledge them .
if we assume that the Nar@@ cos only have access to the wholesale part , which we know is false , that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars .
think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described .
they have invented d@@ ron@@ es to transport drugs , cat@@ ap@@ ults , you name it .
we see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will .
I don 't know about you -- I love to look at the development of technology to learn about what people did with the materials and tools available to them at the time .
I 'm not going to go into the reasons for these tragedies , but they are part of the reason why technological change happens quite slowly .
it 's no good taking a leap in the dark , and civilization has learned from mistakes since the beginning of time -- no one more so than engineers .
right now if we use the high @@@ -@@ @ strength steel wire available to us , we can span , practically speaking , around about five or six kilometers if we really push it .
now , what about concrete ?
they need to be servic@@ eable and durable .
it enhances our well @@@ -@@ @ being .
so yes , technology happens a bit slowly sometimes in my world .
but I 'm really excited about what we can do with it .
I still remember this decisive moment .
these words , they stuck with me .
but how to make it happen ?
my idea : we awak@@ en this network .
my idea : replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk .
so here imagine an electro@@ de im@@ planted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver pain@@ less stimulation .
immediately , the paraly@@ zed rat can stand .
we did not aim to repair the spinal cord , yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remo@@ del@@ ing of ax@@ onal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mam@@ mal after an injury .
the truth is that we don 't know enough yet .
this is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury , but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people 's quality of life .
and this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all .
they are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrong@@ do@@ ings .
they 're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
but now we do .
and what this really means is that an E.@@ U. country 's intelligence agency is bre@@ aching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.@@ U. country on purpose , and they discuss it in their slides completely casu@@ ally , business as usual .
part of it might be , and there are terrorists , but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an exi@@ st@@ ential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them ?
I 'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
and if we indeed need a Big Bro@@ ther , I would much rather have a domestic Big Bro@@ ther than a foreign Big Bro@@ ther .
what am I sending to worry about this ? am I sending naked pictures or something ?
privacy is non@@ negotiable .
so why do we learn mathematics ?
now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
from the standpoint of calculation , they 're as easy to understand as one plus one , which is two .
add nine to that , we get 15 .
six is two times three , 15 is three times five , 40 is five times eight , two , three , five , eight , who do we appreciate ?
stepping onto the side@@ walk , I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete side@@ walk in front of me .
I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful , active life without sight .
my training had started .
and then I was also surprised by the city 's pro@@ pens@@ ity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
that was a little curious to me .
some of it 's helpful . a lot of it 's kind of reversed .
you 've got to figure out what they actually meant .
disability is an equal @@@ -@@ @ opportunity provider .
so my final take@@ away for you is that not only is the city good for the blind , but the city needs us .
with nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .
he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
maybe a year passes , nothing .
he eventually gets married .
that small town k@@ id with the big city dreams was the suicide bom@@ ber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
for young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Mad@@ ina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
I remember standing in front of that bullet @@@ -@@ @ rid@@ den hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
what if I had been forced into that same state of wai@@ thood ?
what makes his story different ?
it em@@ powers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desper@@ ately seeking .
and he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he 's now working on creating Mogadishu 's first public park in 22 years .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a City started in the most unique way imagin@@ able .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's not really all that funny -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- but it allows me to see what type of audience I 'm dealing with , so I appreciate the feedback .
you 're welcome .
the price of energy dropped .
now you know the lists I 'm talking about .
the media and the Internet love to rank cities .
you know , these are cities that , typically , you 're not embar@@ ras@@ sed to be associated with .
but nonetheless , I did@@ n 't like being on the list .
and I weighed 220 pounds .
I had always exercised .
we had also not required developers to build side@@ walks on new developments for a long , long time .
suddenly , it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace .
and then came the next stage of the equation .
it was time to push what I called MA@@ PS 3 .
we 're building a downtown stree@@ t@@ car to try and help the wal@@ k@@ ability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there .
we 'll have over 100 miles when we 're through building it out .
granted , we have a long way to go .
when we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west , it appears that what we 're seeing now is the wrath of grapes .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) The grand@@ children are coming home .
so we could get three thum@@ bs together , and Peter could join us .
so you can see up here .
now , if we had more people in the room , instead of just wrestling in a closed node , we might reach out and try and grab some other people .
and in fact , that 's what we 're going to do right now .
and this one 's called the M@@ ö@@ bi@@ us Strip .
any science ge@@ e@@ ks , you get that one .
this is the hardest level . this is the extreme .
everybody , up up up up up !
all right .
ok@@ ay ? one , two , three , go !
so I provoked a little curi@@ osity .
creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thum@@ bs into the node .
we had joy . you were laugh@@ ing , smil@@ ing . look at your faces . this room is full of joy .
and the last emo@@ tion of pride .
you lost both your thum@@ bs .
you learned , from scratch , a game you never knew before .
how many of you won just won thum@@ b ?
pick off the one that looks easiest .
so , here 's the first story .
19@@ 06 . this man , John Philip S@@ ous@@ a , traveled to this place , the United States Cap@@ it@@ ol , to talk about this technology , what he called the , quote , " talking machines . "
this is what he had to say .
we will not have a vocal ch@@ ord left , " S@@ ous@@ a said .
and in its place , we 'd have the opposite of read @@@ -@@ @ write culture , what we could call read @@@ -@@ @ only culture .
never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced , and displaced because of these , quote , " infer@@ nal machines . "
since time im@@ memorial , the law had said , you can 't fly over the land without permission of the landow@@ ner , so this flight must stop .
and B@@ MI was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its reper@@ toire , including African American music for the first time in the reper@@ toire .
( music ) So , this is re@@ mix , right ?
I 'm not talking about nor justifying people taking other people 's content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner .
instead , the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies , as they interact , have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal .
this , for example , is a pair of r@@ hin@@ oc@@ er@@ os taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the low@@ lands of Nepal .
so what is a dr@@ one ?
usually it does , and when it does , it even lands automatically .
we 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest bu@@ ff@@ alo@@ s in Gabon , ele@@ ph@@ ants , and even tur@@ tle ne@@ sts .
but besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves , we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in , because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats .
since then , we 've been building d@@ ron@@ es for our collaborators from around the world , and these include fellow bi@@ ologists and partners from major conservation organizations .
now these coll@@ ars are put onto animals .
now , conservation d@@ ron@@ es began as a crazy idea from two bi@@ ologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology .
in some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
so , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
and so we took a step back and we said , " What is it that we are trying to achieve ? "
so they said , " We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what 's best . "
" Oh , we should measure this . " " no , we should measure that . "
they published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
once a year , they publish the league table : who 's best , who 's at the bottom ?
in my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
they actually thrive from peer recognition .
take for example the case of lions .
that 's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation .
this video shows the actual hunting view@@ sh@@ eds of male lions on the left and females on the right .
Red and dar@@ ker colors show more dense vegetation , and the white are wide open spaces .
and this is the view@@ shed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions .
so how can we save what we don 't understand ?
so I created this , the Car@@ ne@@ gie Air@@ borne Observatory , or CA@@ O .
the ho@@ tt@@ est p@@ inks are the fastest @@@ -@@ @ growing plants .
the first questions is , how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests ?
unfortunately , global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector .
and let me tell you , Peru alone is an amazing place , totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today .
we can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red , and the Amazon River and flo@@ od@@ plain cutting right through it .
the 2010 mega @@@ -@@ @ drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe .
this area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil , totally un@@ explored , almost totally unknown scientifically .
one of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak .
and in this case , we found gold mining activity , all of it illegal , set back away from the river 's edge , as you 'll see in those strange poc@@ k@@ marks coming up on your screen on the right .
so what we 've been doing is using the laser @@@ -@@ @ guided spec@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ y from the CA@@ O to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rain@@ forest .
here you see actual data showing different species in different colors .
re@@ ds are one type of species , bl@@ ues are another , and gre@@ ens are yet another .
for example , how much and where to use fire as a management tool ?
in the foreg@@ round is an area with lots of fire and lots of ele@@ ph@@ ants : wide open sav@@ anna in blue , and just a few trees .
thank you .
my name is Henry Ev@@ ans , and until August 29 , 2002 , I was living my version of the American dream .
from my home in California , I sha@@ ved Char@@ lie in Atlanta . ( la@@ ughter ) I handed out H@@ allo@@ ween can@@ dy .
last year , K@@ ai@@ j@@ en H@@ si@@ ao of Wil@@ low Gar@@ age connected with me Chad Jen@@ kins .
that 's the part that works .
today , we 're using small qu@@ ads .
these are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes .
the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network .
here we are flying in Haiti last summer , where we 've done our first field trials .
well , it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle is just 24 cents .
so we said , ok@@ ay , how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world ?
and we said , what if we wanted to cover an area span@@ ning around 140 square kilometers ?
it 's decentralized , it 's peer @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ peer , it 's bi@@ directional , highly adap@@ table , with very low infrastructure investment , very low ecological footprint .
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
half a billion of us live in meg@@ ac@@ ities .
one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food .
one is our Prote@@ stant work eth@@ ic which places high value on work , so older people who are no longer working are@@ n 't respected .
another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people .
we Americans move on the average every five years .
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repos@@ itories of knowledge .
they usually love their grand@@ children , and are eager to spend time with them .
in short , many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern , big societies .
but what 's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well .
they almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and the other non@@ communicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today .
features of the modern lifestyle pre@@ dispose us to those diseases , and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them .
we 're not talking each other . we 're facing forward .
we 're going to do working memory today .
now , working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day .
if you turn it off , that 's called a com@@ a , ok@@ ay ?
now working memory has four basic components .
they tend to solve and do well on standardized tests , however important that is .
ok@@ ay . what I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight .
it allows us to problem @@@ -@@ @ solve , critical think .
so we need to think about it here .
it 's very positive .
if you read a book , pull things up .
everything we do is an approxim@@ ation of sophistic@@ ation .
this means that two bra@@ ins of the same size , like these two , with a respec@@ table 400 grams , should have similar numbers of ne@@ ur@@ ons .
so that would give us extra cor@@ te@@ x to do more interesting things than just operating the body .
maybe the human brain actually has the most ne@@ ur@@ ons of any brain , regardless of its size , especially in the cere@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x .
take rod@@ ents and pri@@ mates , for instance : in larger ro@@ dent bra@@ ins , the average size of the ne@@ ur@@ on increases , so the brain infl@@ ates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains ne@@ ur@@ ons .
the result is that a pri@@ mate brain will always have more ne@@ ur@@ ons than a ro@@ dent brain of the same size , and the larger the brain , the larger this difference will be .
it is just a large pri@@ mate brain .
what is it that we have that no other animal has ?
and that is that all of us want to be happy .
you haven 't traded it in . you haven 't worked for it .
and those who fail get another opportunity .
so how can we find a method that will harness this ?
it 's so simple that it 's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street .
and that little stop , look , go , is such a potent seed that it can revolu@@ tion@@ ize our world .
social Finance , the organization I helped set up , ca@@ res about social stuff .
also , they make a reasonable return , and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things , they 're going to have to believers .
investors have put in 3.1 million pounds .
others , around homelessness in London , around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country .
so when you 're trying to do something like this , you need the flexibility to adapt the program .
actually , for creating social change , we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work .
in men , pu@@ ber@@ ty begins when the te@@ stes start sec@@ re@@ ting testosterone .
we call it an organ @@@ -@@ @ on @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ chip .
they 've tried many different approaches .
they 've even tried to grow little mini @@@ -@@ @ organs in the lab .
we could , for example , m@@ im@@ ic infection , where we add bacterial cells into the lung .
now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can flu@@ id@@ ically link them .
we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household clean@@ ers .
children are not adults .
I debate people who literally want to obl@@ iter@@ ate everything I believe in -- in some cases , who don 't want me and people like me to even exist .
one , I care that you spell it right .
you 'd totally be surprised .
( la@@ ughter ) So we 're still publishing all the designs online , encouraging anyone to build these themselves .
so you 're probably all won@@ dering : the cave .
then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy ?
it is a very difficult battle .
they are a right , just as side@@ walks are , unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility , without the risk of getting killed .
and we are living in a unique moment in history .
the cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future .
they can operate with small crews .
and that was a surprise to me .
we know about man 's impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and over@@ fishing , but we don 't really know much about what 's happening under@@ ne@@ ath the water .
light do@@ es@@ n 't penetrate beneath the surface of the water , so ocean creatures like wh@@ ales and dol@@ ph@@ ins and even 800 species of fish communicate by sound .
and the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right wh@@ ale has been reduced by up to 90 percent .
and when I arrived in Singapore , and I apolog@@ ize for this , but I did@@ n 't want to get off my ship .
they had good salaries , but theirs is still an isol@@ ating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element .
I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope .
I am an example of that .
today , not so much has changed .
but I was lucky .
since I was a student , I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gan@@ do .
" a clay building is not able to stand a rainy season , and Francis wants us to use it and build a school .
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques .
so I could do a lot of projects , and here I am going to share with you only three of them .
the first one is the school extension , of course .
the community is looking . it still works .
( la@@ ughter ) The next project is the library in Gan@@ do .
something we have in Gan@@ do are clay pots .
we wanted to use them to create openings .
very simple .
how do you cast mud ?
another factor in Gan@@ do is rain .
when the rains come , we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain .
Don 't conf@@ ound with Chris@@ to and Je@@ anne @@@ -@@ @ Cla@@ ude .
but for us , the rain is good .
we take the sand , we mix it with clay , and we keep building .
that is it .
( la@@ ughter ) She just answered , " They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community . "
the second most exciting thing for a cave explo@@ rer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .
he and I have both been exploring ca@@ ves a long time and we 've been climbing mountains a long time , but neither one of us had ever really explored a gl@@ ac@@ ier cave before .
back in 2011 , B@@ rent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hi@@ kers that stum@@ bled across the entrance to one of these ca@@ ves .
well , cave maps are@@ n 't like trail maps or road maps because they have p@@ its and holes going to overlapping levels .
and we cou@@ ld@@ n 't understand why this cave was so much col@@ der than S@@ now Dragon until we got to the end and we found out why .
B@@ rent named this cave P@@ ure Im@@ ag@@ ination , I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined .
it 's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years , and it 's just now starting to s@@ pro@@ ut .
I 'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time , which is to choose a ligh@@ the@@ ar@@ ted theme .
it 's better than Pro@@ z@@ ac , but I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't recommend it .
not only would it lift , but it might never return .
can you bring one of them to us ? "
they thought , " Well , we 'll try 55 vol@@ ts , two @@@ -@@ @ ten@@ ths of a second .
and to their amaz@@ ement , after it was over , he began speaking like he was perfectly well .
it did@@ n 't work very well on the sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ics , but it was pretty clear in the ' 30s and by the middle of the ' 4@@ 0s that electro@@ con@@ vul@@ sive therapy was very , very effective in the treatment of depression .
six weeks , you 're back in the operating room .
well , you know what bo@@ vine ster@@ cus is ?
I shu@@ ff@@ led when I walked . I was bow@@ ed over .
and it was clear -- not to me , because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore -- that I would need long @@@ -@@ @ term hospitalization in that aw@@ ful place called a " mental hospital . "
it was founded in the 18th century , the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of Connecticut , other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time .
they tried every medication available in those days .
and they did have T@@ of@@ ran@@ il and other things -- m@@ ell@@ ari@@ l , who knows what .
and finally , because I was well @@@ -@@ @ known in Connecticut , they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff .
all the senior staff got together , and I later found out what happened .
you 've seen this painting by Ed@@ v@@ ard Mun@@ ch , " The S@@ cream . "
and he du@@ g in his he@@ els and said , " No . I know this man better than any of you .
again , not a single one of them -- I think there are about seven or eight of them -- thought this would do any good .
but , lo and behold , by 16 , by 17 , there were demon@@ stra@@ ble differences in the way I felt .
I need some thing to say to myself when I begin thinking ob@@ ses@@ sionally , ob@@ ses@@ sively .
well , the Gil@@ bert and Sul@@ li@@ van fans in this room will remember " Rud@@ dig@@ ore , " and they will remember M@@ ad Marg@@ aret , and they will remember that she was married to a f@@ ella named Sir Des@@ par@@ d M@@ urg@@ atro@@ y@@ d .
and she would say , " Bas@@ ing@@ sto@@ ke , it is ! " and she 'd be fine for a little while .
and they have always to do with my own personal experiences .
there is redemption .
through this act of immense open @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ tedness , he was to become the embo@@ di@@ ment of what in South Africa we call " u@@ buntu . "
without you , I 'm just a guy talking to an empty room , and I spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it 's not the same as this .
it goes to b@@ ite me a second time .
now although the root word is about people , I thought that maybe u@@ buntu was only about people .
and then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
she got vi@@ sibly -- ears came forward , she had a full go of it and half@@ way up , her legs gave way , and she fell back@@ wards .
and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
what did it mean that he was dead ?
this is , if you like , our curse .
there were always rockets going up into the sky , up into space , going up there .
and every time , you get the same result : people who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever .
now , one group was asked to think about being dead .
ancient Egypt had such my@@ ths , ancient Babylon , ancient India .
but again , there are skep@@ tics who doubt whether legacy really is im@@ mortality .
wo@@ ody Al@@ len , for example , who said , " I don 't want to live on in the hearts of my country@@ men .
so those are the four basic kinds of im@@ mortality stories , and I 've tried to give just some sense of how they 're ret@@ old by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashi@@ ons of the day .
they only know the moments that make up their story , even when the book is closed .
and most of our audience was representative of the 82 percent African @@@ -@@ @ American population in the city at that time .
the fruits of their lab@@ ors would afford them a home , for many the first piece of property that they would ever know , and a community with other first @@@ -@@ @ time African @@@ -@@ @ American home buyers .
now , there 's a third wave of migration happening in De@@ tro@@ it : a new asc@@ end@@ ant of cultural entrepreneurs .
the good news is , there is a future for the next generation of De@@ tro@@ iters , both those there now and those that want to come .
( la@@ ughter ) NASA 's been expecting to see an inter@@ stell@@ ar com@@ et pass through the solar system since the 1970s , but until now , we 'd never seen anything .
now this is@@ n 't a particularly close approach or unusual distance .
it 's just much easier to see objects close by .
this was my w@@ ow moment .
OK , let me not min@@ ce words . it was a fierce battle .
because after all , it passed very close to the Earth , and we did@@ n 't know about it until afterwards .
well , we we@@ ren 't going to get any second chances here .
it 's centered in the middle .
it started f@@ aint and then it got brigh@@ ter , f@@ ain@@ ter , brigh@@ ter , and f@@ ain@@ ter again , as sunlight is reflected off of four sides of an obl@@ ong object .
assuming it 's dark , this means it 's about half a mile long .
now could we send a spacecraft to ' O@@ um@@ u@@ am@@ ua and answer this question once and for all ?
this unexpected gift has perhaps raised more questions than its provided answers , but we were the first to say hel@@ lo to a visitor from another solar system .
E@@ in@@ stein said that " I never think about the future - it comes soon enough . "
first , the Industrial Revolution brought us machines and factories , railways , electricity , air travel , and our lives have never been the same .
it 's jet engines , locomo@@ tives , gas turbines , medical devices , communicating seam@@ lessly with each other and with us .
we 've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft .
or take healthcare .
ten years ago , that cost was 30 cents , six times as much .
by 2020 , they will account for over 50 percent of all digital information .
let 's stop and think about this for a minute , because this is a very important point .
and innovation is disrup@@ tive .
but let me stress two things here .
it makes products more affordable .
human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward .
we will need a robust cyber@@ security approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyber@@ attacks .
and finally , after four full hours of my lying and st@@ aring at it , the phone ran@@ g , and somehow I managed to pick it up , and it was my father , and I said , " I 'm in serious trouble . we need to do something . "
I had two advantages as I went into the fight .
what are the mechanisms that allow people to survive ?
but then I discovered something .
and I get letters , I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what 's worked for them .
they did@@ n 't include dr@@ um@@ ming or music to get people 's blood going .
they did@@ n 't involve the whole community .
( la@@ ughter ) Now at the other end of alternative treatments , let me tell you about Frank Rus@@ sa@@ k@@ off .
and the other present was a photo of my grand@@ mother , who committed suicide .
and so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression .
I wish I could stop the pain . "
and major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken .
people will come to me and say , " I think , though , if I just stick it out for another year , I think I can just get through this . "
one of the key areas we 've been working on recently is medical devices , and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq 's electricity grid then , there are some common@@ alities .
so you can think about how unstable that would be .
and we 've been able to develop a knee , a poly@@ centric knee , so that type of knee that acts like a human knee , m@@ im@@ ics human ga@@ it , for 80 dollars retail .
( appl@@ ause ) But the key is , you can have this great invention , you can have this great design , but how do you get it to the people who most need it ?
regardless of your income level , you want the most beautiful , the best product that there is .
now this is a video of Kam@@ al .
he 's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee , and he 's doing that same 10 @@@ -@@ @ meter walk test .
and most medical devices , we 've learned , as we 've du@@ g in , are really designed for We@@ ster@@ ners , for we@@ alth@@ ier economies .
but the reality is our users , our customers , they do different things . they sit cross @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged more .
so the second thing we learned , and this leads into my second point , which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user @@@ -@@ @ centric .
do they all get there on time ? the supply chain .
so I wanted to show you some of the iter@@ ations we did between the first version , the J@@ ai@@ pur K@@ nee , so this is it right here .
we 'd seen that users had actually modified it .
so I 'm going to show you some of the modifications we did .
the other thing we did is that we smooth@@ ed the profile .
and this goes into my last point .
right now , our knees are worn in 12 countries .
so I want to end with a story of P@@ our@@ n@@ ima .
the shar@@ k experts are the best in the world -- large pre@@ dat@@ ors below .
and we 've been on a journey .
when I turned 60 , it was@@ n 't so much about the athle@@ tic accomplishment , it was@@ n 't the ego of " I want to be the first . "
( singing ) Im@@ ag@@ ine there 's no heaven ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Len@@ non 's " Im@@ ag@@ ine , " I have sw@@ um nine hours and 45 minutes ...
exactly .
and as you come over toward the side of the boat -- not allowed to touch it , not allowed to get out , but B@@ onn@@ ie and her team hand me nutrition and ask me how I 'm doing , am I all right .
I am seeing the Ta@@ j Mah@@ al -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Over here .
and in my case , it 's reaching for the horizon .
( la@@ ughter ) B@@ onn@@ ie said to the doctor , " I 'm not worried about her not breathing .
the three things I did sort of blur@@ t out when we got there , was first : never , ever give up .
I did@@ n 't give up .
there 's B@@ onn@@ ie St@@ oll .
( appl@@ ause ) My bud@@ dy .
( appl@@ ause ) The Henry David Tho@@ reau quote goes , " When you achieve your dreams , it 's not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them . "
I want you to , for a moment , think about playing a game of Mon@@ opol@@ y .
( la@@ ughter ) And over the course of 15 minutes , we watched through hidden cameras what happened .
one person clearly has a lot more money than the other person , and yet , as the game un@@ folded , we saw very notable differences , dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players .
the rich player started to move around the board lou@@ der , literally sm@@ acking the board with the piece as he went around .
they wonder what that bow@@ l of pre@@ tz@@ els is doing there in the first place .
I 'm pretty much un@@ tou@@ cha@@ ble at this point .
we told the participants they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves , or they could share a portion of it , if they wanted to , with a stranger , who 's totally anonymous .
they 'll never meet that stranger ; the stranger will never meet them .
what we found was as the expen@@ siveness of a car increased ...
in 1993 , the differences between the different quin@@ tiles of the population , in terms of income , are fairly eg@@ regi@@ ous .
in fact , the top 20 percent of our population own close to 90 percent of the total wealth in this country .
we 're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality .
not just the people at the bottom , everyone .
( loud che@@ ering ) My name is May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id , and I am not drunk , but the doctor who delivered me was .

upon graduating , I moved back home , and my first acting gi@@ g was as an extra on a daytime soap opera .
I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show " Coun@@ t@@ down with Ke@@ ith Ol@@ ber@@ mann . "
and we were live , right ?
the disabled are the largest - Y@@ ea@@ h , cla@@ p for that , man . come on .
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 D@@ NC .
D@@ anny H@@ ill@@ is actually has an update on that -- he says technology is anything that do@@ es@@ n 't quite work yet .
but I was interested in another definition of technology .
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
so this is a very rough attempt to think out loud .
what are its tendencies over time ? one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms , which we 've heard a lot about .
and I 'm applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? what does technology want ?
we have really no idea .
Bri@@ an Far@@ rel@@ l 's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth .
but a more interesting way , the current way to take the long view , is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective .
they 've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here .
and we see a drift towards complexity that 's very intuitive .
and actually , we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co @@@ -@@ @ evolution .
this is all the contents of a Japanese home .
I suggest that , in fact , technology is the seventh kingdom of life .
this is N@@ iles El@@ dre@@ dge . he was the co @@@ -@@ @ developer with Stephen J@@ ay G@@ ould of the theory of punc@@ tu@@ ated equilibrium .
so I suggested this to an histor@@ ian of science , and he said , " Well , what about , you know , come on , what about steam cars ?
maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way .
all of them are still being produced . so you 've got corn sh@@ ell@@ ers .
I don 't know who needs a corn sh@@ eller .
it 's short , bone handle , 50 buc@@ ks . and in fact , what 's important is that this information actually never died out .
it 's not just that it was resur@@ rec@@ ted . it 's continued all along .
and in Papua New Guinea , they were making stone axes until two decades ago , just as a course of practical matters .
even when we try to get rid of a technology , it 's actually very hard .
we 've heard about the Japanese giving up guns .
that 's what it 's for . it 's so that ideas don 't die out .
so if you have life h@@ acking -- life means h@@ acking , the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .
that is what we call an " infinite game . "
and I think it 's really important . because if you can imagine Moz@@ art before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be .
we want a trillion z@@ il@@ lion species of one individuals .
that recur@@ sive nature is the infinite game .
this is my office . it 's out there .
OK , it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask .
and a mobile phone , it turns out , is a great recovery tool .
so we forget , but we 're also adap@@ table , and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .
and that 's that moment when you 're walking out of a space , and you turn around , and quite often you tap your pockets .
and you turn around , and you look back into the space , and some people talk al@@ oud .
it 's where you expect to find stuff .
OK , so when we did this research , we found the absolutely , 100 percent , guaranteed way to never forget anything ever , ever again .
so this is -- probably the thing I 'm most passionate about is the research that we 've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate .
OK , there 's two things I like about this .
it brings ru@@ di@@ mentary banking services to places where there 's no banking infrastructure .
and OK , if you break one of these things here , you return it to the carrier .
if you go on the streets of India and China , you see this kind of stuff .
and China is a country where you get a lot of f@@ akes .
and what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the sh@@ ack in rural Uganda .
when those extra three billion people 's identity is mobile , it is@@ n 't fixed ?
when everyone 's connected .
as a neuro@@ scientist , I wondered , why is this so hard ?
Dr. Rud@@ y Le@@ i@@ bel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 cal@@ ories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
that 's a lot of food .
this may explain a very sad fact : set points can go up , but they rarely go down .
psychologists classify e@@ aters into two groups , those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through will@@ power , like most di@@ e@@ ters .
the height of the bars is the risk of death , and those zero , one , two , three , four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had .
now let 's look at what happens in over@@ weight people .
adding just one healthy habit pul@@ ls over@@ weight people back into the normal range .
if I 've convinced you that di@@ e@@ ting might be a problem , the next question is , what do you do about it ?
and my answer , in a word , is mind@@ fulness .
think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop , and let your hunger decide when you should be done .
it took about a year for me to learn this , but it 's really been worth it .
I forget we have chocolate in the house .
at worst , they ru@@ in lives : weight ob@@ session leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
in the U.S. , we have 80 percent of 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girls say they 've been on a diet .
my d@@ ad 's the guy with the cigarette .
in other words , are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does , it 's not going to be worth it ?
let 's create a giant fund .
so we did this math , and we fig@@ ured out , OK , well , you need about 80 to , say , 150 , or something like that , drugs .
but it turns out there are lots of other fol@@ ks that would be interested .
that 's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and 401 ( k ) plans and all this other stuff .
there 's 100 trillion dollars of capital currently invested in fixed @@@ -@@ @ income securities .
and we said , could you start a work stream on credit risk ?
and we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams , and then we held a conference .
thank you .
for instance , this is a bird 's @@@ -@@ @ eye view of the EP@@ FL campus .
the Venice Time Machine , the project I 'm going to talk to you about , is a joint project between the EP@@ FL and the University of Venice C@@ a '@@ F@@ os@@ car@@ i .
so the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain : speech recognition .
if you divide this huge archive into smaller sub@@ sets where a smaller sub@@ set actually shares similar features , then there 's a chance of success .
if we reach that stage , then there 's something else : we can extract from this document events .
" what was the salary of a glass maker in Mur@@ ano maybe over a decade ? "
maybe there 's not a single map .
I share that view .
these are early deaths that take place .
the world of vaccines is getting better .
it 's getting more systematic .
but notice immediately the distinc@@ tly different curve that we achieve with the blue line .
that 's what 's achieved with the Nan@@ op@@ at@@ ch ; the delivered dose of the Nan@@ op@@ at@@ ch is a completely different immun@@ ogen@@ icity curve .
that 's a real fresh opportunity .
suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines .
the WHO estimates that within Africa , up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the cold chain has fallen over .
so it 's a big problem , and it 's tied in with the needle and sy@@ rin@@ ge because it 's a liquid form vaccine , and when it 's liquid it needs the refrigeration .
within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Cel@@ sius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all .
( appl@@ ause ) We 're delighted about it as well .
so for those two reasons , with the attributes of the Nan@@ op@@ at@@ ch , we 've got into the field and worked with the Nan@@ op@@ at@@ ch , and taken it to Papua New Guinea and we 'll be following that up shortly .
P@@ at M@@ itch@@ ell : your first time back on the TE@@ D@@ Women stage .
Sher@@ yl Sand@@ berg : first time back . nice to see everyone . it 's always so nice to look out and see so many women .
and you looked at me and said , you have to tell that story .
and I did . and I think that 's a really important part of the journey .
so he started paying attention , and as he waited for raised hands , he realized the men 's hands were up .
PM : and in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you 've learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons .
and the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it .
what they want in their careers . the kind of partners they want , if at all .
right , which , I admit , I do . right ? I 've talked about it before .
and it turns out , everywhere in the world , women need more self @@@ -@@ @ confidence , because the world tells us we 're not equal to men .
we sh@@ y away from the word " femin@@ ist , " a word I really think we need to embrace .
we have to get rid of the word bos@@ sy and bring back -- ( Appl@@ ause ) I think I would say in a lou@@ der voice , we need to get rid of the word " bos@@ sy " and bring back the word " femin@@ ist , " because we need it .
and in a way , this is also another default selection .
Leon@@ ardo had taught me , during that three years , about what a picture can do .
all the conversations were done at very peculiar times of the day -- over the phone .
in the end , I accepted the job without actually having been here .
my head , also still full of the Leon@@ ardo exhibition that was about to open , and I came across this .
and I thought to myself : what the hell have I done ?
sil@@ ly at a level that I had@@ n 't yet understood sil@@ liness to be .
and then there 's little pretty s@@ pri@@ gs of flowers everywhere . ( la@@ ughter ) And finally , that pink . that dam@@ ned pink .
I realized this was an ele@@ phant that had absolutely nothing to do with a maj@@ estic march across the Se@@ ren@@ ge@@ ti .
it was a Dum@@ bo night@@ mare . ( la@@ ughter ) But something more profound was happening as well .
I and my colleagues had always thought that these objects , in way , summed up the idea of , you know -- no wonder there was a revolution .
( la@@ ughter ) So , there I was -- in a sort of par@@ oxy@@ sm of horror .
but I took the job and I went on looking at these v@@ ases .
they had this kind of odd sort of fasc@@ ination , like a car accident .
and then the play between -- actually really quite carefully disposed color and g@@ il@@ ding , and the sculp@@ tural surface , is really rather remarkable .
so what you would have had were cand@@ les on either side .
it 's about an escap@@ ism that happens -- that the ari@@ stoc@@ racy in France sought very deliberately to distinguish themselves from ordinary people .
and the ex@@ tran@@ eous orna@@ ment is seen as really , essentially , criminal .
it 's a triumph , in a way , of bourgeois values rather than ari@@ stoc@@ ratic ones .
except for the fact that it becomes a kind of sequestration of imagination .
it 's actually amazing to look out of a high building nowadays there .
and there he was .
he 's a Sta@@ f@@ for@@ d@@ shire figure made in the middle of the 19th century .
he represents the actor , Ed@@ m@@ und K@@ ean , playing Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are 's Richard III .
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war , having just finished the washing up . ( la@@ ughter ) He seems also to have forgotten his sword .
I really hope that others , all of you , visiting objects in the museum , and taking them home and finding them for yourselves , will allow those objects to flourish in your imagin@@ ative lives .
thank you very much .
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's what my mom was like when I did it .
whenever they did news stories about building violations in New York , they would put the report in front of our building , as kind of , like , a backdrop to show how bad things are .
so , if you want to find the right motion for a character , don 't think about it -- go use your body to find it .
I 'm not an actor .
and it 's the same structure , just the motion is different .
he was already dead !
( la@@ ughter ) But , moving in a gr@@ ac@@ eful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human @@@ -@@ @ robot interaction .
when humans and robots interact , it 's much more like a chess game : the human does a thing , the robot analyzes whatever the human did , the robot decides what to do next , plans it and does it .
then the human wa@@ its , until it 's their turn again .
but I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player , and more like a do@@ er that just clic@@ ks and works together .
( la@@ ughter ) And this book was kind of waiting for 100 years to be re@@ discovered for robo@@ tics .
and this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emo@@ tion that they want to express .
they thought it was more intelligent , more committed , a better member of the team , contributed to the success of the team more .
whatever that means .
so let 's look at a few seconds from this performance , where the robot list@@ ens to the human musi@@ cian and impro@@ vis@@ es .
and I thought , we already have a robot musi@@ cian on stage , why not make it be a full @@@ -@@ @ fledged musi@@ cian ?
I think .
( music ) Now it 's looking at me , showing that it 's listening .
and at some point -- we are in Atlanta , so obviously some rap@@ per will come into our lab at some point -- and we had this rap@@ per come in and do a little j@@ am with the robot .
you kind of want to move your own head when it does it .
somewhere in your future , there will be a robot in your life .
maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them , because in the end , we are human .
Fa@@ iza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception , pregnancy , and delivery .
this is the modern Middle East , where two mill@@ enn@@ ia after the coming of Christ , vir@@ gin births are still a fact of life .
like so many who stra@@ d@@ dle East and West , I 've been drawn , over the years , to try to better understand my origins .
now to be sure , the Arab world is vast and varied .
but running across it are three red lines -- these are topics you are not supposed to challenge in word or deed .
if you don 't tie the k@@ not , you can 't move out of your parents ' place , and you 're not supposed to be having sex , and you 're definitely not supposed to be having children .
not so for women , who are expected to be vir@@ g@@ ins on their wedding night -- that is , to turn up with your hy@@ men intact .
this is not a question of individual concern , this is a matter of family honor , and in particular , men 's honor .
when her condition became hard to hide , Fa@@ iza 's mother helped her flee her father and brothers .
the En@@ cycl@@ ope@@ dia is just one in a long line of Arabic ero@@ tica , much of it written by religious scholars .
and it is the product of a complex historical process , one which has gained ground with the rise of Islamic conserv@@ atism since the late 1970s .
women , and increasingly men , who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home .
well , that would be fine if it was just a secondary pre@@ occupation in life .
there might be storms , but the depth of the ocean is still there , unchanged .
it can only be a state of being , not just a fle@@ e@@ ting emo@@ tion , sensation .
mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors CA@@ N@@ NOT happen at the same time .
they are real Olympic champions of mind training .
now , here with 256 electro@@ des .
( la@@ ughter ) So what did they find ?
of course , same thing .
now , compassion is supposed to be put in action .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
now many of you will recognize her symptoms .
and the second is that we are@@ n 't taking what we have learned , and routinely applying it in clinical care .
the money had been spent and we did@@ n 't learn how women fa@@ red .
I want to introduce you to Hor@@ tense , my go@@ d@@ mother , H@@ ung We@@ i , a relative of a colleague , and somebody you may recognize -- D@@ ana , Christop@@ her Re@@ eve 's wife .
and what they found was that the genetic mu@@ tations that the drug targeted were far more common in women .
this is what we can accomplish when we don 't leave women 's health to chance .
but even though we know that these differences occur , 66 percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified .
and here 's what I suggest : first , I suggest that you think about women 's health in the same way that you think and care about other causes that are important to you .
and this is so important , not only for ourselves , but for all of those whom we love .
I have spent the last years trying to resolve two en@@ ig@@ mas : why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work ?
why do people feel so mis@@ erable , even actively dis@@ engaged ?
and Mr. repa@@ i@@ rability creates the repa@@ i@@ rability process .
the connections , the interactions , the syn@@ ap@@ ses .
whenever people cooperate , they use less resources . in everything .
you know , the repa@@ i@@ rability issue is a cooperation problem .
no wonder they dis@@ engage .
the hard approach is unable to foster cooperation .
and why I try not to impose trade@@ offs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife .
we need to go beyond the boxes , the job descriptions , beyond the surface of the container , to understand the real content .
by removing layers .
they don 't understand reality and they add the compl@@ ic@@ at@@ ed@@ ness of metrics , K@@ P@@ Is .
but after a couple of years , just writing songs was@@ n 't enough .
( la@@ ughter ) I have never been more terri@@ fied -- until now .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer @@@ -@@ @ s@@ ong@@ writer .
and having the stage f@@ right song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance .
the last year has seen the invention of a new four @@@ -@@ @ letter word .
education really h@@ as@@ n 't changed in the past 500 years .
so at ed@@ X and a number of other organizations , we are applying these technologies to education through MO@@ O@@ Cs to really increase access to education .
and we had no marketing budget .
so here 's what we can do .
then they come into the classroom for some in @@@ -@@ @ person interaction .
so there , the students would , again , the instructors f@@ li@@ pped the classroom , bl@@ ended online and in person , and the results were st@@ agg@@ ering .
I don 't think I 've still received some of my home@@ works from my under@@ graduate days .
but when I became the attorney general , two things happened that changed the way I see criminal justice .
the second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Cam@@ den , New Jersey police department .
now , at that time , Cam@@ den , New Jersey , was the most dangerous city in America .
I ran the Cam@@ den Police Department because of that .
I spent the day in the police department , and I was taken into a room with senior police officials , all of whom were working hard and trying very hard to reduce crime in Cam@@ den .
and they would take a yellow stic@@ ky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board .
we took Cam@@ den off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in America .
it impacts crime and violence .
the great news for us as well is that it 's the way that we can transform the American criminal justice system .
and why is that ?
and the idea that we 're just animals can be really un@@ settling , because it can be this reminder of our own mortality .
there 's another reason that talking to your doctor about your health and gross stuff is really , really important .
so , take the California brown sea h@@ are .
so , let 's see .
you can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it .
but first , what do we call complexity ?
I call this simplifying complexity , and it 's what we do at the chair of systems design at E@@ TH Zurich .
at the first bend in the line , it left its course , and crash@@ ed into a wall .
it could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather er@@ ratic , really .
to understand this system , we built a computer model of ro@@ osting , based on simple , individual rules , and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony .
in fact , the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group .
they adapt very simple rules , and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encro@@ achment into their natural habitat .
NP : well , I would say there are also counter @@@ -@@ @ examples to these stereotypes .
so that 's it .
our special is tracking cookie .
I built my first website myself in HTML , and I 'm learning JavaScript and Py@@ th@@ on .
I need to call on the rest of the Pol@@ lin@@ ators !
( music ) Than@@ k you . ( appl@@ ause ) All of my anim@@ ations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
ideas truly are what make the world go round .
for example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
these events can bring on feelings of danger and helpl@@ essness , which activate the brain 's alarm system , known as the " fight @@@ -@@ @ flight @@@ -@@ @ freeze " response .
using the 2@@ x@@ 7 leaves a gap that can only be filled by a rectangle with a width of 1 .
going lower , the next range that works is 8 to 14 , leaving out the 3@@ x@@ 3 square .
there 's no trick or formula here - just a bit of in@@ tuition .
and for larger grids , expert mathemati@@ cians are@@ n 't sure whether they 've found the lowest possible scores .
give it a try and post your results in the comments .
for instance , researchers have studied facial expression in people who are born blind , hypo@@ the@@ sizing that if expressions are universal , they would be displayed in the same way as sighted people .
further evidence can be found in our evolutionary relatives .
anger is accompanied by lowered eye@@ bro@@ ws drawn together , tense and narrow@@ ed eyes , and tight lips ; dis@@ g@@ ust , by the lips pulled up and the nose cr@@ ink@@ ling .
and why are they expressed in these particular ways ?
one is that certain expressions are important for survival .
there 's still much research to be done in understanding emotional expression , particularly as we learn more about the inner work@@ ings of the brain .
but if you ever find yourself among str@@ angers in a strange land , a friendly smile could go a long way .
just lots and lots of prescriptions .
the result is that I was launched into acute opi@@ oid withdrawal .
at the time , I thought this was all pretty mis@@ erable .
" try again later , " he responded .
and so we stuck to riding it out and dropped another dose .
S@@ adi@@ ye got back on the phone with the prescri@@ ber and this time he recommended that we contact our pain management team from the last hospitalization .
we called surge@@ ons and pain doc@@ s and general practitioners -- anyone we could find on the internet , and not a single one of them would help me .
I was broken and beaten , and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't do it anymore .
I took the little orange prescription bottle , I set it on my night@@ stand ...
I fell asleep , I sle@@ pt through the night and when I wo@@ ke up , the most severe symptoms had abated dramatically .
well , after I initially published my story in an academic journal , someone from the C@@ DC sent me their pocket guide for tap@@ ering opi@@ oids .
this is a four @@@ -@@ @ page document , and most of it 's pictures .
( appl@@ ause ) Six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four percent . now , how did we get there ?
the media became fix@@ ated .
and in the 200@@ 0s , over 7,000 .
we were obviously making a difference .
so , step four : we needed to engage men .
and all of a sudden , he looked at the back of the room , and he saw his daughter , and he called out his daughter 's name , Mic@@ ha@@ ela , and he said , " Mic@@ ha@@ ela , come up here . "
I get it , knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college cam@@ p@@ uses that are so widespread and so under @@@ -@@ @ reported .
( appl@@ ause ) I 'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life , the Op@@ tim@@ ist Club .
five years ago , I was a Ph.D. student living two lives .
in one , I used NASA super@@ computers to design next @@@ -@@ @ generation spacecraft , and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smu@@ ggl@@ ers of sensitive nuclear technologies .
how much oil is stored in all of China ?
and so we moved into a cra@@ mp@@ ed , w@@ indow@@ less office in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab .
we had found our compromise .
so now we had our constraint .
the problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing .
so instead , we turned to a new generation of video sensors , originally created for use in night vision go@@ gg@@ les .
we have talked about it end@@ lessly over the last decade or so .
and we 've accomplished close to zi@@ p .
what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating .
but in fact , they 're growing faster .
here 's some data from actually just 10 days ago , which shows this year 's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice , and it 's the lowest by far .
really , we 're doing this , basically . really , not very much .
but nevertheless , that 's not what I 'm going to talk to you about tonight .
so this problem is absolutely soluble .
this geo @@@ -@@ @ engineering idea , in it 's simplest form , is basically the following .
and the reason is , it 's been done .
but if you do this , it 's quick .
and there are times you might like to do something quick .
so , in a sense , there 's not much new .
not as something that was fool@@ proof , but as an idea to think about .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric life@@ times -- much longer than before -- because they 're le@@ vit@@ ated .
nobody but maybe one or two very odd fol@@ ks really suggest this .
let 's say that we don 't do geo @@@ -@@ @ engineering , we do what we ought to do , which is get serious about cutting emissions .
that 's an absolutely possible scenario .
and the problem is the following : knowledge that geo @@@ -@@ @ engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fear@@ some , and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today .
right now we may think of a big , rich country like the U.S. doing this .
I 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to trans@@ gress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls .
or the garage doors that are brought from San Di@@ ego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
and I 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retro@@ fitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on ster@@ oids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
this is a story of a group of teenagers that one night , a few months ago , decided to inv@@ ade this space under the free@@ way to begin constructing their own sk@@ ate@@ board park .
two weeks later , the police stopped them .
they were lucky , they said , because they began to di@@ g under an arm of the free@@ way that belongs to the local municipality .
they were also lucky , they said , because they began to di@@ g in a sort of Bermuda Tri@@ angle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
they came to the city attorney 's office .
the city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO , and of course they did@@ n 't know what an NGO was .
now this journey from the bottom @@@ -@@ @ up to the transformation of the top @@@ -@@ @ down is where I find hope today .
thank you .
one is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Mal@@ evich 's abstract compositions .
so here I 'm going to show you two tandem clips .
the next work is dec@@ oy .
you see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desper@@ ation .
so from where I 'm standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
so here if you see we 're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
is there a single equation for intelligence ?
how predic@@ tive is it ?
does it predict human @@@ -@@ @ level intelligence ?
to find out , we developed a software engine called En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a , designed to maximize the production of long @@@ -@@ @ term ent@@ ro@@ py of any system that it finds itself in .
and the more you think about it , the stranger that is .
a couple of years ago , I had the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of England .
I can love j@@ og@@ ging .
whereas my wife , she calls me the star of her life .
next , a process of political democratization , which has fostered individual rights .
now it is quoted in the stock exchange .
hence the anxiety of contemporary man .
he is obs@@ essed : " am I desirable ? how desirable ?
it is rather what is sw@@ allowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love , or rather in the name of se@@ duction capital .
so they are artists of picking up ch@@ ic@@ ks .
( la@@ ughter ) Yes , I 'm useless .
I don 't have any inherent value .
in contrast to this attitude , I call upon ten@@ derness -- love as ten@@ derness .
I advise designers and inno@@ v@@ ators around sustainability , and everyone always says to me , " Oh Le@@ yl@@ a , I just want the eco @@@ -@@ @ materials . "
but how do we know if we 're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment ?
most of the things , the waste that we produce , end up in landfill .
those same molecules , they become methane , and methane is a 25 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
but if you 're throwing it in the bin , and your local landfill facility is just a normal one , then we 're having what 's called a double negative .
anyway , I 'm clearly obs@@ essed .
we 've had to clear land .
all of the embodied impacts in that let@@ tu@@ ce get lost from the system , which makes it a far bigger environmental impact than the loss of the energy from the fridge .
so we need to design things like this far better if we 're going to start addressing serious environmental problems .
so I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modern@@ ity , but we actually haven 't really changed the design of them that much since the 1950s .
a little bit , but essentially they 're still big boxes , cold boxes that we store stuff in .
so imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those problems .
because obviously energy 's a problem with this product .
and this is what I call behavior @@@ -@@ @ changing products : products , systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front .
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
they burn the electronic waste in open spaces .
design for dis@@ assembly , design for light @@@ -@@ @ weighting .
since 1997 , researchers at the University of Sus@@ sex have monitored global trends in armed conflict .
in the last 20 years , 20 million youth have entered the Nigerian workforce alone .
building on this strength , they attracted investment and started to process , being able to export higher @@@ -@@ @ value products like st@@ arch from c@@ assa@@ va .
we kept doing what we promised , slowly we gained their trust .
but if we can tap into commercial debt , it is a small number -- only 0.1 percent of all the debt in the world today , 10 cents out of every 100 dollars .
I know these driven , ambitious young men will make the right choice .
they 're economic issues , and that makes them relevant to risk and return .
they started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success .
that 's a really big bet . why did they do that ?
I mean , come on , really ?
that 's the world 's largest economy .
( la@@ ughter ) I like it because it po@@ kes fun at both sides of the climate change issue .
now that 's millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices , including Professor H@@ aw@@ king , who uses an American @@@ -@@ @ acc@@ ented voice .
we did@@ n 't have the luxury of pre @@@ -@@ @ recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surro@@ gate .
I met her when she was nine , and since then , my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice .
what happens next is best described by my daughter 's analogy . she 's six .
who have donated their voices , and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices .
and as a scientist , I 'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have real @@@ -@@ @ world impact .
about five years ago , we built our very first voice for a little boy named William .
imagine that .
this is what William said : " never heard me before . "
thirteen years ago , we set ourselves a goal to end poverty .
it 's a common reaction .
she 's one of 13,000 orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support .
I did@@ n 't have any change to give him , and she was disappointed .
it 's so sweet , and more generous than D@@ ad would have been .
but of course I explained to her , " You can 't do that ; it 's not allowed . "
to which I get the classic four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old response : " why not ? "
together , the central banks of the U.S. , U.@@ K and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by 3.7 trillion dollars .
well , this is where Dor@@ oth@@ y and the Man@@ go Tree charity that supports her comes in .
today there are universally agreed aims for international aid .
and 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidi@@ ze agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have over@@ produced .
the oil price goes through the floor . that company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil price back up .
we conducted a study of 4,000 companies , and we asked them , let 's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs .
and those differences can be biological , physical , functional , political , cultural , socioeconomic .
all right . are you with me ? ye@@ ah . ye@@ ah . all right .
so we 're extremely closely related to them , and as you 'll see in terms of our behavior , we 've got some relationship as well .
I 'm not saying that they did@@ n 't love the people they were having sex with .
it goes into anthro@@ pology as well .
non@@ violence is a choice like vege@@ tari@@ anism , but it 's not who you are .
but the body does have its inherent evolved trajec@@ tories .
I 'd cl@@ en@@ ch my ja@@ w a little tigh@@ ter , hold my coffee pot with a little more ven@@ ge@@ ance .
and it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a k@@ id anywhere between three and 10 years old , I was ready to fight .
there is no harder , there is just hard .
and the battle of gay rel@@ at@@ ability had begun .
" ash , have you ever been to the Castro ? "
sure , it would have been easy to point out where they felt short .
it 's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying .
you are speaking your truth .
and that 's a remarkable achievement for humanity .
some of my best friends live in San Francisco , I live in Mountain View , about 40 miles away .
and I said U@@ ber , but I really think we need to congratulate the Ly@@ ft bran@@ ding team for their forward thinking in choosing their brand .
( la@@ ughter ) So in that example , OK , there are a few extra steps , I admit .
commercial flights are already automated for most of their duration , and I believe there will come a day when we won 't even trust an air@@ plane that required a human to fly .
it has multiple redundant motors and batteries , you can lose one , it will continue flying and land normally .
it 's pretty quiet .
my best guess is in the next five years , you 'll start seeing verti@@ ports in some cities , and little air@@ plane icons on your ride @@@ -@@ @ sharing apps .
and it will fundamentally transform our relationship with local travel .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : OK , so when these things first roll out -- right now , it 's a single person aircraft , right ?
this thing takes off .
the technology need to mature in terms of safety , to get to the safety levels that we expect from aircraft .
R@@ L : my personal view is that ride sharing actually allows you to operate that entire business much more efficiently .
ca : cool . thank you for that .
and so it 's no surprise that many h@@ ackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
they asked citizens to write the content .
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the House .
they asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper , and they offered a prize of 9,@@ 300 dollars -- 10,000 times cheaper than the government contract , and they gave the entr@@ ants 10 days .
thank you .
we need these last wild places to re@@ connect with who we really are .
four years ago , it was declared that 50 percent of all wildlife around the world had disappeared in just 40 years .
by 2020 , global wildlife populations are projected to have fallen by a st@@ agg@@ ering two @@@ -@@ @ thirds .
I 'm doing this because we need this information to benchmark this near @@@ -@@ @ pris@@ tine wilderness before upstream development happens .
you 're living on rice and beans , bathing in a buc@@ ket of cold water and p@@ add@@ ling a mar@@ athon six to eight hours every single day .
after 121 days of this , I 'd forgotten the PIN numbers to my bank accounts and log@@ ins for social media -- a complete systems re@@ boot .
you ask me now if I miss it , and I will tell you I am still there .
I go into the Ok@@ av@@ an@@ go on my mo@@ kor@@ o .
this year , we start the process , with the Angolan government , to establish one of the largest systems of protected areas in the world to preserve the Ok@@ av@@ an@@ go @@@ -@@ @ Zam@@ be@@ zi water tower we have been exploring .
there is no doubt this is the biggest conservation opportunity in Africa in decades .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
and it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for .
and so if you do this , then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in English , but what you 're conveying is really a meaning , the meaning of a sentence in English .
it 's a past tense .
let 's take this sentence : " I told the car@@ pen@@ ter I could not pay him . "
now this happened in the past , so I 'm going to make that " told . "
so I tried this out with kids with au@@ tism , and I found that there was an incredible amount of identification .
but if you think about the brain , the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one @@@ -@@ @ dimensional .
now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays , and almost all of that is done in the language domain .
but let 's look at this in a little more detail .
but if you look at what 's inside the engine , it 's actually not very complicated .
John I saw just last week in the clinic .
and I 've asked John to tell us something about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor ne@@ ur@@ on disease .
I 've got weakness in my hands , my arms and my legs .
well , you know what ? I think there is hope .
and so again , there are two things I want to show you .
this is spontaneous repair .
but actually it does , but it just do@@ es@@ n 't do it well enough .
so the question is , why , if we 've known that for some time , as we have , why do we not have those treatments ?
and then you need to spend 15 years and spend over a billion dollars , and even then , you may not have a winner .
now , the idea of that at medical school -- this is a recurring theme , is@@ n 't it , me and medical school ? - would have been ridic@@ ulous , but it 's an absolute reality today .
[ " I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist ; on his present showing this is quite ridic@@ ulous . " ] So they did@@ n 't think much of him then .
I think there are two ways you can think about this : as a fantastic 21st @@@ -@@ @ century drug discovery tool , and / or as a form of therapy .
that 's straightforward , because that 's what pl@@ uri@@ potent cells can do .
and what you 're looking at , and this is amazing , these are living , growing , motor nerve cells from a patient with motor ne@@ ur@@ on disease .
and again there are two ways to think about this , and they 're not mutually exclusive .
and that 's a good thing to measure in M.@@ S. , because patients with M.@@ S. sadly suffer with problems with vision -- loss of vision , unclear vision .
we then gave the stem cell in@@ fusion and repeated the measurement twice -- three months and six months -- and to our surprise , almost , the line 's gone up .
so I just want to end with the theme I began on , which was regeneration and hope .
they are these huge collections of gal@@ ax@@ ies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
but more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
the second things is very hot .
it 's actually X @@@ -@@ @ ray light that we 're seeing .
and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide .
if you 're a particle phy@@ sic@@ ist , you want to know what happens when we sm@@ ash things together .
so , it 's very funny .
similarly , cos@@ m@@ ologists understand why the universe is expanding .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
well , the problem with the large @@@ -@@ @ scale structure of the universe is that it 's horri@@ bly complicated .
here is a computer simulation .
if I want to understand the sin@@ king of the Tit@@ anic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
the most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
and I would like to explain to you not only why it 's time to change this , but also how we can do it .
rating agencies are rating companies .
well , ratings affect you .
and this is the reason why you should care , because sovereign ratings affect everyone .
but that 's actually what 's going on in the rating agency sector every single day .
we are allowing the rating agencies to be in@@ transparent about their work , and we need to change this .
it would be based on a non@@ profit model that would be based on a sustainable endow@@ ment .
well , a country has many gar@@ den@@ ers , and one of them is the government , so we have to ask the question , how is a country governed ?
a poster child example was the enc@@ ycl@@ ope@@ dia business .
most of the cost was the commission to the sal@@ es@@ men .
and what I 'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third , and it maps exactly on to the kind of Por@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ Hen@@ derson logic that we 've been talking about .
but it was still at that point overwhel@@ mingly analog .
it 's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present .
this , I would submit , is a sea change , a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in .
now , in the days when mapping a gen@@ ome cost millions , or even tens of thousands , it was basically a research enterprise .
but there 's one thing that do@@ es@@ n 't get much attention .
there are those today that dispute that , and lots of debates about how the mind works , but for me it 's simple : mental images , for most of us , are central in inven@@ tive and creative thinking .
so let me set this up for you .
you think the Internet was big .
and why on earth could that be so ?
there 's a new no@@ tation in the 19th century that expressed this , and if you use that no@@ tation , the equations get a lot simpler .
let 's look . you don 't have to know what these things mean , do@@ es@@ n 't make any difference .
the 2011 Arab Spring captured the attention of the world .
to respond , they ramp@@ ed up surveillance of activists , journalists and dis@@ sid@@ ents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries .
of course , he 's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments , he has no way of knowing how it can be used .
the video they 've produced is very sex@@ y , and so I 'm going to play you a cli@@ p just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it 's marketed to their government clients .
and so I went online and I did some research , and ultimately I hit the mother lo@@ de when I went to Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , the social networking site for job seekers .
and that 's primarily because scal@@ ability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
this picture is Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi in the ' 4@@ 0s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnos@@ ing T.@@ B. in his ash@@ ram in Sev@@ agra@@ m in India .
what you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a to@@ y , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stom@@ p on it .
I have these two micro@@ sc@@ opes that I 'm going to turn -- go to the back of the wall -- and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
can we get the lights back on again ?
[ this talk contains graphic images Vie@@ wer discretion is advised ] I collect objects .
I have a realization that white supremacy is there , but the biggest force of white supremacy is not the K@@ K@@ K , it 's the normalization of systemic racism .
there was something else I realized .
it 's in a shopping m@@ all , and it sells fish eggs .
this is the Art @@@ -@@ @ o @@@ -@@ @ mat , an art @@@ -@@ @ ven@@ ding machine that sells small artistic cre@@ ations by different artists , usually on small wood blocks or mat@@ ch@@ boxes , in limited edition .
you can kind of tell from their reactions .
I started collecting a whole group of my friends ' DNA in small vi@@ als and categor@@ izing them .
this is what that looked like .
is this person more rare than the other one ? "
they were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in .
but that made me think about collecting toys , and what 's going on right now in the to@@ y world with blind box toys , and being able to collect these rare toys .
but when you open them , you have different r@@ arities of the toys .
and for some reason , I was one night drawing a ven@@ ding machine , thinking of doing paintings of a ven@@ ding machine .
the vial of my DNA was sitting there , and I saw a beautiful collaboration between the str@@ ands of DNA and the co@@ ils of a ven@@ ding machine .
we 're in the first edition of 100 pieces , hoping to do another edition pretty soon .
I 'd like to get it into more of a metro hub , like Grand Central or Pen@@ n Station , next to some of the other ven@@ ding machines in that location .
how much will these samples be worth ?
will you buy someone else 's sample ?
and what will you be able to do with that sample ?
and to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
in the workplace , real equality means valu@@ ing family just as much as work , and understanding that the two reinforce each other .
workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused , more efficient , more results @@@ -@@ @ focused .
he 's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
and caregi@@ ving itself develops patience -- a lot of patience -- and em@@ pa@@ thy , creativity , resilience , adap@@ tability .
and a 2012 study of employers showed that deep , flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adap@@ tability in a global service economy .
si@@ e@@ sta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day .
they 're psychi@@ atri@@ sts .
or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules ?
and what criteria should they use to make that decision ?
or who has the most flexible b@@ oss ?
the same @@@ -@@ @ sex perspective helps us see that ju@@ ggling work and family are not women 's problems , they 're family problems .
millions of men and women have to be both bread@@ winners and caregivers just to earn the income they need , and many of those workers are sc@@ ram@@ bling .
they routinely rank among the top 15 countries of the most globally competitive economies , but at the same time , they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index .
it 's certainly not complete .
they are in the bir@@ thing rooms .
thank you .
let me start by asking you a question , just with a show of hands : who has an iPhone ?
actually , it is@@ n 't .
the dairy business in Kenya is a $ 463 million business , and the difference between a subsistence farmer and an abundance farmer is only a couple of lit@@ ers of milk a day .
this is innovation over the edge .
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h , you did .
for many decades , bi@@ ologists actually felt that the hec@@ to@@ co@@ tyl@@ us was a separate organism altogether .
we have to think about function as well , and when it comes to sex , function relates to the contributions made by the ga@@ me@@ tes , or the sperm and the eggs .
and quite frankly , that 's exactly what it is .
a group of males will grab a female , hold her down , and ball@@ istically ejac@@ ulate their spiral @@@ -@@ @ shaped penis into her cor@@ k@@ screw @@@ -@@ @ shaped vag@@ ina over and over and over again .
from fl@@ ac@@ ci@@ d to ejaculation in less than a second .
now , I like to share stories like this with my audiences because , ye@@ ah , we humans , we tend to think sex , sex is fun , sex is good , there 's rom@@ ance , and there 's org@@ asm .
meet Jo@@ e .
I 'd like you to imagine this place .
it looks and feels like it sounds : wor@@ m@@ wood S@@ cru@@ bs .
these individuals have committed acts of un@@ speak@@ able evil .
the prison war@@ den , looking equally indifferent , said , " Any trouble , just press the red bu@@ zz@@ er , and we 'll be around as soon as we can . "
( la@@ ughter ) Over the subsequent months , we tested Jo@@ e and his fellow inmates , looking specifically at their ability to categor@@ ize different images of emo@@ tion .
the fact that this developmental progression is universal , irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you in@@ habit , strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are in@@ born .
it is more ak@@ in to a Swiss army knife with fixed mental modules fin@@ ely hon@@ ed during development and a sharp sense of fairness .
the brain could only change within certain set limits .
m@@ ice rea@@ red in a standard c@@ age , by contrast , not dis@@ similar , you might say , from a prison cell , have dramatically lower levels of new ne@@ ur@@ ons in the brain .
this is the inter@@ play between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes .
when you think about it , it is ir@@ onic that our current solution for people with stressed am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ ae is to place them in an environment that actually inhib@@ its any chance of further growth .
of course , imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society .
I 'd like to leave you with three lessons that I learned .
most of the be@@ et@@ les are sp@@ it up hours later , amaz@@ ingly alive and well .
now , the most stren@@ uous of these trips are taken by the country 's 290 million migrant workers , for many of whom this is the one chance a year to go home and see parents and their left @@@ -@@ @ behind children .
so most of them , they choose the train .
and they still had to deal with near @@@ -@@ @ stam@@ pe@@ de conditions when travel day finally arrived .
when explaining the rapid growth of the Chinese tech industry , many observers will cite two reasons .
at the same time , China is deploying facial recognition across many of its 170 million closed @@@ -@@ @ circuit cameras .
it 's about 80 percent larger than Amazon .
so even in its im@@ perfection , the growth of the Chinese internet should not be dismissed , and it 's worthy of our closer examination .
he ended up in Shen@@ zh@@ en , which is one of China 's tech hubs .
there have been many years of consumption growth across China 's major cities .
just imagine for a minute what more could be possible if the global needs of the under@@ served become the primary focus of our inventions .
and you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud .
those situations don 't really define themselves more until the second decade of life .
and then I got really confused , because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming .
does this make so @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ so straight ? "
in other words , one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other .
sometimes their parents would reject them , si@@ bl@@ ings , their own children , and then their divor@@ cing spouse would for@@ bid them from seeing their children .
they look normal .
she 's 12 years old there , she was living as a girl , but she was being beaten up .
( la@@ ughter ) And some of them have been re@@ arranged a little bit , but it 's all her DNA .
these are Nic@@ ole and brother Jon@@ as , identical twin boys , and proven to be identical .
he 's got angular bones to the face , a mu@@ stac@@ he , and you can see there 's a height difference , because he 's gone through a growth spur@@ t that she won 't get .
do you ever wonder what 's feeding them ?
those are Pro@@ chloro@@ coc@@ cus .
so as we studied these more and more and kept finding more and more diversity , we thought , oh my God , how diverse are these things ?
if each cell is a smartphone and the apps are the genes , when you get your smartphone , it comes with these built @@@ -@@ @ in apps .
those are the ones that you can 't delete if you 're an iPhone person .
as we studied -- I said we 've sequ@@ enced hundreds of these cells , and we can now project what is the total genetic size -- gene pool -- of the Pro@@ chloro@@ coc@@ cus federation , as we call it .
perhaps reason is over@@ rated .
reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reason@@ er wants peace and harmony , but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reason@@ er del@@ ights in conflict and strife .
in particular , can it explain a moment@@ ous historical development that I spoke about five years ago here at TED ?
k@@ nights waged constant war on each other by trying to kill as many of each other 's peasants as possible .
and even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are un@@ connected with us fall mis@@ er@@ ably short , a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by Adam Smith .
R@@ NG : well , you did@@ n 't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels : reason .
few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hang@@ ings or beating children .
but then , why does he write so many books about manifest truth ?
whatever is unfortunate in war , is severely so indeed , and whatever , on the contrary , is called good fortune , is a sav@@ age and a cruel good fortune , an un@@ generous happiness deriving its existence from another 's wo@@ e .
SP : but everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emo@@ tion .
on the contrary , it produces pleasure .
to dispose others to engage in the same practices .
R@@ NG : the appeal to religion to justify the otherwise un@@ justifiable , such as the ban on contraception .
I 've come here today to talk to you about a problem .
whether it 's the ru@@ th@@ less Mexican drugs car@@ tel , the Zetas , who use anonymous companies to la@@ under profits while their drugs @@@ -@@ @ related violence is te@@ aring communities apart across the Americas .
but if you 're anything like me , you 'll want to see some of that for yourself , so let me show you .
it might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual , but what about all of us , the public ?
it was the night before New Year 's Eve .
companies were created to give people a chance to inno@@ vate and not have to put everything on the line .
this is a human issue which affects us all .
together , let 's k@@ ick@@ start this global movement .
let 's just do it , let 's end anonymous companies .
and I want you to help me do that in this next cli@@ p .
see any common themes ? principles ?
they can locomo@@ te on sub@@ str@@ ates that vary as you saw -- in the probability of contact , the movement of that surface and the type of fo@@ oth@@ olds that are present .
the leg is acting as a foot .
the foot is distributed along the whole leg .
look carefully : this is slowed down 100 times , and watch what it 's doing with the rest of its leg .
and the next behavior I 'll show you of this animal just stun@@ ned us the first time that we saw it .
this one disgu@@ ises itself as floating algae .
in 1951 , E@@ sch@@ er made this drawing . he thought he created an animal fantasy .
what you 'll see , in fact , is that it 's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot .
and my assistant 's going to help me here .
RF : so if you look carefully at this , what you see is that they have sp@@ ines and until a few weeks ago , no one knew what they did .
they assumed that they were for protection and for sen@@ sory structures .
but of course , we can deal with that because we can produce artificial sp@@ ines .
we did that by putting these artificial sp@@ ines on cra@@ bs , as you see here , and then we tested them .
this is really , really difficult .
but look at this animal do it !
it looks , in fact , like it 's swimming up the surface .
so here 's R@@ He@@ x with p@@ add@@ les , now converted into an incredibly maneu@@ ver@@ able swimming robot .
did you touch it ?
ca : I did .
so it 's pretty tough to do .
very strange . how do they stick ?
the g@@ ec@@ ko has a billion of these 200 @@@ -@@ @ nan@@ ometer @@@ -@@ @ sized split ends .
and they don 't stick by glue , or they don 't work like Vel@@ c@@ ro , or they don 't work with suction .
there 's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields .
we took some ha@@ irs from a mol@@ ting g@@ ec@@ ko ; put three rolls of them on here , and then made this B@@ and @@@ -@@ @ Aid .
it 's six @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged and has a tail . here it is on a fence and a tree .
these tun@@ ed structures allow the sp@@ ines , friction p@@ ads and ultimately the adhesive ha@@ irs to grab onto very challenging , difficult surfaces .
you 've been called many things in the last few months .
but when I think about it , this is@@ n 't the question that we should be struggling with .
ca : so just to give some context for those who don 't know the whole story -- ( Appl@@ ause ) - this time a year ago , you were stationed in Hawa@@ ii working as a consultant to the N@@ SA .
now , what propelled you to do this ?
if we could have a slide up , and E@@ d , I don 't know whether you can see , the slides are here .
these are all metadata events .
what that means to an actual N@@ SA analyst , someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting , Chinese cyber @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ackers , things like that , in Hawa@@ ii , is the pro@@ ven@@ ance of that data is directly from their servers .
bound@@ less Inform@@ ant is a program that the N@@ SA hid from Congress .
ca : ed , there was a story broken in the Washington Post , again from your data .
in another event , they intercep@@ ted all the calls in Washington , D.C. , by accident .
ES : well , so the first thing is , you 're giving up your rights .
we have a right to privacy .
ca : some people are fu@@ rious at what you 've done .
the public interest is not always the same as the national interest .
they 're programs through which the N@@ SA intentionally mis@@ leads corporate partners .
the F@@ BI went to Congress and did make the case .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be threatening dis@@ sid@@ ents .
ES : it is . I think it 's very true .
and I believe that a Mag@@ na Car@@ ta for the Internet is exactly what we need .
or another way to say it is , what 's the most dangerous thing that you 've ever done ?
and why did you do it ?
in the astr@@ on@@ aut business -- the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle ; it 's the most complicated flying machine ever built .
and in the astr@@ on@@ aut business , we have a saying , which is , there is no problem so bad that you can 't make it worse .
( la@@ ughter ) And so you 're very conscious in the cock@@ pit ; you 're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do , all the switches and all the wic@@ kets you have to go through .
it 's an entirely different perspective , you 're not looking up at the universe , you and the Earth are going through the universe together .
but unfortunately , without gravity , tears don 't fall .
and that spi@@ der -- not only that , but that spi@@ der has beautiful markings on it , it 's like " I 'm dangerous . I got a big radiation symbol on my back , it 's the black widow . "
if you 're outside on a spac@@ e@@ walk and you 're blin@@ ded , your natural reaction would be to panic , I think .
we knew everything there is to know about the spac@@ e@@ suit and we trained underwater thousands of times .
it 's certainly quite a strong statement that the N@@ SA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here .
they actually do .
so there are things , let me talk there a little bit more , there are things that we need to be transparent about : our authorities , our processes , our oversight , who we are .
ca : you 're sitting there with the American flag , and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure .
first , we 're all in the same network .
it 's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call .
you had a follow @@@ -@@ @ on a week later to a Qatari company .
and you 've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public .
would you accept that at least , even if you disagree with how he did it , that he has opened a debate that matters ?
but I do think it 's an important conversation .
but you 've been quoted as saying that , if S@@ now@@ den could prove that he was sur@@ rendering all un@@ disclosed documents , that a deal maybe should be considered .
so that 's the idea worth spreading .
mainly we want to talk about the future .
and maybe I 'll just nar@@ rate this one quickly .
the computer 's on the left , and it 's just rac@@ king up points .
I think the follow @@@ -@@ @ up to that is our knowledge .
because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make ballo@@ ons possible , they did@@ n 't have to be te@@ thered .
there 's so much more information about you , and that 's an important thing , and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions .
we spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are .
LP : ye@@ ah , and people are super positive .
I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it .
there 's 20 million people or more injured per year .
LP : ye@@ ah , and also saving space and making life better .
we need , especially in technology , we need revolutionary change , not incremental change .
we 've had a more rapid turnover of companies .
and I said , what did they fundamentally do wrong ?
and usually it 's just that they missed the future .
a hundred trillion means if you took a blade of grass and planted it for every micro@@ be living in your gu@@ t , that could fill a million football fields .
now , of course , we were very interested to find out what are these so @@@ -@@ @ called invasive species that are taking over in the zo@@ o .
now , we did study some other species of pri@@ mate .
and the final group that we studied , all the way on the right , is people living in the USA .
are these micro@@ bes actually causing the obesity , or is the obesity causing a change in the micro@@ bes ?
you see , in patriarchal societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her birth is not celebrated .
she is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them .
if she is married very early , she has to accept .
yes , I must mention it .
it was lethal to human rights and particularly to women 's rights .
it was called Tali@@ ban@@ ization .
it spread like a c@@ res@@ cend@@ o all around the world .
people ask me , what special is in my ment@@ orship which has made Mal@@ ala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and po@@ ised ?
many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectac@@ les in the natural world .
it 's not safety in numbers .
it 's actually the exact opposite .
c@@ ric@@ kets are really ro@@ om@@ y . who knew ?
the tap@@ e@@ wor@@ m and the Gor@@ dian wor@@ m are not alone .
why , for example , does this c@@ ater@@ pillar start viol@@ ently th@@ ra@@ sh@@ ing about when another in@@ sect gets close to it and those white co@@ co@@ ons that it seems to be standing guard over ?
no .
Israeli scientists Freder@@ ic Liber@@ sat and R@@ am G@@ al found that the ven@@ om is a very specific chemical weapon .
now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
and scientists like Jo@@ anne Web@@ ster have shown that if Tox@@ o gets into a rat or a mouse , it turns the ro@@ dent into a cat @@@ -@@ @ seeking missile .
the cat e@@ ats the rat . TO@@ X@@ O gets to have sex .
on one particularly hot summer day , we visited a drum @@@ -@@ @ shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting .
for the first time , I realized people were smart 2,000 years ago . ( la@@ ughter ) This had never crossed my mind .
for strength and ligh@@ tness , the d@@ ome structure used five rings of co@@ ff@@ ers , each of diminishing size , which im@@ parts a dramatic forced perspective to the design .
the smartphone is a perfect example .
they need to be nur@@ tured and encouraged from when they 're little kids .
it 's sometimes said of Facebook that the users are@@ n 't the customer , they 're the product .
let 's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter .
and that 's not just an issue for me , or for Twitter , it 's an issue for you .
this simple but powerful idea was a call to arms , to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability , and ultimately , the disability of others .
technology had eliminated my disability , and allowed me a new climbing pro@@ w@@ ess .
this bi@@ onic propulsion is very important clin@@ ically to patients .
that can be sent out wi@@ relessly to the bi@@ onic lim@@ b , then [ sen@@ sory information ] on the bi@@ onic lim@@ b can be converted to stimul@@ ations in adjacent channels , sen@@ sory channels .
l@@ m : yes ! I 'm not even -- I can 't even describe it .
the story of Adri@@ anne Has@@ let @@@ -@@ @ Dav@@ is .
Adri@@ anne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack .
Adri@@ anne breath@@ es and lives dance .
we will not be intim@@ idated , brought down , diminished , conqu@@ ered or stopped by acts of violence .
but there was no one left to speak for me . "
this is an insight at the core of intelligence .
we could call it clu@@ efulness .
it 's a certain kind of test : can you recognize an underlying threat and respond ?
so I was a little put off by this .
it is every time , every single important issue .
now if you know Aaron S@@ war@@ tz , you know that we lost him just over a year ago .
and so they developed a platform , which we are announcing today , that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform .
we 're in the age of the Super PA@@ C .
it is now an official word in the dictionary .
and the basic way this works is this .
what is that number ? half a billion ? a billion ?
here is mine .
every day , I am so grateful because I am a woman .
there is a Buddhist go@@ dd@@ ess of compassion .
all of a sudden , I was introduced to the world of beauty p@@ age@@ ants .
that was all I needed to hear .
I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror .
and sometimes it works , sometimes it do@@ es@@ n 't , so - But it 's just , gender identity is in the core of our being , right ?
there should be a space of curi@@ osity and asking questions , and I hope all of you guys will be my allies .
it 's now 2.7 degrees .
and the thing that 's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing , though that is awesome .
and that amaz@@ es me .
Chris An@@ derson : so , this is an interview with a difference .
it was incredible . bill had never taken that much time off from work .
and at the end of the trip , we went out to Zan@@ zi@@ bar , and took some time to walk on the beach , which is something we had done a lot while we were dating .
ca : so , given that this vacation led to the creation of the world 's biggest private foundation , it 's pretty expensive as vac@@ ations go . ( la@@ ughter ) MG : I guess so . we enjoyed it .
our na@@ ï@@ vet@@ é is pretty incredible , when we look back on it .
Ma : ye@@ ah , in ' 97 , we read an article about diar@@ rhe@@ al diseases killing so many kids around the world , and we kept saying to ourselves , " Well that can 't be .
and so we picked those two things , and everything the foundation does is focused there .
ca : so , I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work , and Mel@@ in@@ da , this is what you picked .
and I would come back and talk to global health experts , and they 'd say , " Oh no , contraceptives are stoc@@ ked in in the developing world . "
and so condoms were stoc@@ ked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.
and even though I 'm Catholic , I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives , and I shou@@ ld@@ n 't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back .
we used to have consensus in the United States around contraceptives , and so we got back to that global consensus , and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars around exactly this issue for women .
so this is a story largely of vaccines .
ca : I mean , you do the math on this , and it works out , I think , literally to thousands of kids ' lives saved every day compared to the prior year .
an air@@ liner with 200 @@@ -@@ @ plus deaths is a far , far bigger story than that .
B@@ G : ye@@ ah , because it 's a silent thing going on .
these causes have been a bit invisible .
ca : maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big , sad face to get engaged .
there 's some venture capital investments that were well @@@ -@@ @ meaning and did@@ n 't go well .
you shou@@ ld@@ n 't just say , ok@@ ay , because of that , because we don 't have a perfect record , this is a bad endeav@@ or .
you should look at , what was your goal ?
we can spend aid s@@ mar@@ ter .
it is not all a pan@@ ac@@ ea .
we can do better than venture capital , I think , including big hits like this .
how have you guys managed it ?
mg : ye@@ ah , I 've had a lot of women say to me , " I really don 't think I could work with my husband .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : but now you are , and we 're very happy that you are .
that must have been hard , adjusting to that . no ?
( appl@@ ause ) CA : that 's cool .
B@@ G : no , I 'm kid@@ ding . mg : Oh , you mean , the employees did@@ n 't go away .
Sunday , 11 o 'clock , you 're away from work , what comes up ? what 's the argument ?
I had that with Paul Al@@ len in the early days of Microsoft .
for me , I come at it from in@@ tuition .
so I think it 's been more a coming to over time towards each other 's point of view , and quite frankly , the work is better because of it .
can you talk about a failure and maybe what you 've learned from it ?
it took three more years to get it than we expected , and then there was no way it was going to get out there .
are there any failures that you can talk about ?
but the thing that we learned from that work , and what turned out to be the fundamental key , is a great teacher in front of the classroom .
all our kids have been to Africa quite a bit , actually .
actually , the go@@ ats had been there , I think , living in that particular little hu@@ t on their little compound before we got there .
it was a very loving relationship .
this was a Ma@@ as@@ ai warri@@ or and his wife , but they had decided to get married , they clearly had respect and love in the relationship .
their children , their six children , the two in the middle were tw@@ ins , 13 , a boy , and a girl named G@@ race .
so she kept wanting to talk to me and Jen@@ n .
ca : Oh , w@@ ow .
I can 't pay for private school , and she may end up on this farm like my wife . "
B@@ G : all right . well , W@@ arre@@ n was a close friend , and he was going to have his wife Su@@ z@@ ie give it all away .
it 's allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically .
ca : and I think you 've pledged that by the time you 're done , more than , or 95 percent of your wealth , will be given to the foundation .
I 'm curious , can you make the pitch ?
so people will then say , " Well , Chris , you describe the guy who is going through some aw@@ ful training but you 're also describing these powerful educators .
the reality is , the fol@@ ks I described as the master teachers , the master narrative builders , the master stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ers are far removed from classrooms .
they study the way that he walks pro@@ ud@@ ly across that stage .
they think of buildings and streets and sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers , nois@@ y cab@@ s .
and for developers , they are ideal .
there 's nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .
and when I sat down on that test bench with sand still sw@@ ir@@ ling all around me , the rail@@ ing hit exactly at eye level , blocking my view and ru@@ ining my experience at the water 's edge .
well , I did@@ n 't have any idea .
so what were we going to do ?
and if we had to go up , we had to go up in places where you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't need to own a car .
so that meant using one of our greatest assets : our transit system .
well , this was an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably ambitious idea , ambitious because communities had to approve those plans .
it 's not something you can just fake .
my mission was always to create great public spaces .
here you see what was two miles of abandoned , degraded water@@ front in the neighbor@@ hoods of Green@@ point and Willi@@ am@@ sburg in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , impossible to get to and impossible to use .
I wanted to make sure that there were tree @@@ -@@ @ lined paths from the upl@@ and to the water , that there were trees and plan@@ tings everywhere , and , of course , lots and lots of places to sit .
well , a developer sees just one thing : customers .
at the other extreme , there are things that move too fast for our eyes , but we have technology that can look into that world as well .
a spi@@ der also has great secrets , because sp@@ id@@ ers ' sil@@ k thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic .
the big image is our story , our poetry , our roman@@ ticism .
voice off@@ stage : four point five .
even , I think , we copy our way to reproduce , you know what I mean , and something of -- oh no , forget it .
and this territory is fantastic .
because every generation thinks we are the final one .
that 's why , perhaps , you will try to have this angle of vision .
I raise the angle of vision , but it 's still very -- sel@@ fish , sel@@ fish , eg@@ o@@ i@@ ste -- yes , sel@@ fish .
the more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
that means intelligent people are in this angle . that is intelligence .
because at the vertical of us , if you look like that , " Ah ! my God , there is God . Ah ! God ! "
because some cycle , there is a spot in the cycle , and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle .
we have time to think , we have time to I don 't know what , speak about art and things like that .
with many , many , many , many face of bar@@ b@@ aria .
you must go back to fight , to battle .
that 's why today I 'm so ashamed to make this job .
no , you must really understand that .
because we have almost finished , I 'll repeat this story .
that 's why I continue to work , even if it 's for toilet brush .
however , Sierra Leone is in@@ famous for a decade @@@ -@@ @ long rebel war in the ' 9@@ 0s when entire villages were burnt down .
even in the developed world , it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket , if ever .
such soc@@ kets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the lim@@ bs of the patient , leaving them with pressure so@@ res and bli@@ sters .
people don 't realize that .
MK : and on that Saturday morning , I got this horri@@ ble phone call from Gab@@ by 's chief of staff .
MK : ye@@ ah , we were friends for a long time .
G@@ g : Nelson .
MK : that 's our political action committee , where we are trying to get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country , and to try to pass some reasonable legislation .
it 's not too difficult to do that .
this issue , like many others , has become very pol@@ ar@@ izing and political , and we 're trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington .
and not surprisingly for this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure , you just keep challenging yourself , and the sky seems to be the limit .
take a look at Gab@@ by .
good stuff . gor@@ geous . Oh , thank you .
thank you for inviting us here today .
I 'm working hard , lots of therapy -- speech therapy , physical therapy , and yoga too .
be your best . thank you very much .
T@@ yl@@ er Ed@@ mon@@ ds , Bob@@ by Johnson , Dav@@ on@@ ta@@ e San@@ ford , Mar@@ ty Tan@@ k@@ le@@ ff , Je@@ ff@@ rey Des@@ ko@@ vic , Anthony Car@@ a@@ vel@@ la and Tra@@ vis Hay@@ es .
in March of 2006 , police interrogated B@@ ren@@ dan D@@ as@@ sey , a 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old high school student with an I@@ Q around 70 , putting him in the range of intellectual disability .
so here 's just a brief sn@@ ip@@ pet of his four @@@ -@@ @ hour interrogation .
I told you before that 's the only thing that 's going to help you here .
P@@ 2 : and she 's behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here .
P@@ 1 : that 's what she said , because she thinks you know more , too .
P@@ 1 : we already know what happened , now tell us exactly . Don 't lie .
so by honesty , they meant a confession , and his confession would definitely not end up setting him free .
there was no physical evidence against B@@ ren@@ dan at all .
the fact is , D@@ as@@ sey 's interrogation itself is actually not all that unique , and to be honest with you , I 've seen worse .
so I understand the public out@@ cry about injustice in B@@ ren@@ dan D@@ as@@ sey 's individual case .
but what we do know is that false confessions or ad@@ missions were present in approximately 25 percent of wrongful convictions of people later ex@@ on@@ erated by DNA evidence .
more than 70 percent of the te@@ ens in our study said that the police had tried to " be@@ friend " them or indicate a desire to help them out during the interrogation .
in his 91 @@@ -@@ @ page decision to over@@ turn D@@ as@@ sey 's conviction earlier this year , the judge made a big deal about the fact that D@@ as@@ sey had no parent or other allied adult in the interrogation room with him .
other studies tell the same story .
Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world .
Adam II sav@@ ors inner consistency and strength .
Adam I asks how things work .
nothing we do , however virtu@@ ous , can be accomplished alone ; therefore we must be saved by love .
no virtu@@ ous act is quite as virtu@@ ous from the standpoint of our friend or fo@@ e as from our own standpoint .
therefore we must be saved by that final form of love , which is forgiveness . " thanks .
I have been looking at what under@@ lies these data for three years , and children are not the problem .
specifically , I don 't think we know what paren@@ ting is supposed to be .
how is it that we are all now navi@@ gating a child @@@ -@@ @ rearing universe without any norms to guide us ?
well , for star@@ ters , there has been a major historical change .
once kids stopped working , the economics of paren@@ ting changed .
rather than them working for us , we began to work for them , because within only a matter of decades it became clear : if we wanted our kids to succeed , school was not enough .
this was true even when I was young .
when I was a k@@ id , high school specifically , I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese .
and you know what ? I 'm doing ok@@ ay .
so it 's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers .
and I have to tell you , I think it leads to some very strange exc@@ esses .
the off@@ ending M@@ up@@ pet , right there .
scientists started ma@@ stering the techniques for reading DNA .
our approach was to think of the gen@@ ome as the operating system of the cell , with the cell containing the hardware necessary to boot up the gen@@ ome .
throughout the process , we found ways to write DNA faster , more accurately and more reliably .
four hundred parts per million : that 's the approximate concentration of CO2 in the air today .
for every 400 molecules of carbon dioxide , we have another million molecules of oxygen and nitrogen .
so what I 'm showing you here is what a system might look like to do just this .
it takes a power plant to capture CO2 directly from the air .
Clim@@ e@@ works uses heat from the earth , or geothermal , or even excess steam from other industrial processes to cut down on pollution and costs .
a synthetic forest has a significant advantage over a real forest : size .
one thing I 'll absolutely say is positive about the carbon markets is that they allow for new capture plants to be built , and with every capture plant built , we learn more .
the universe is te@@ em@@ ing with planets .
my colleagues at the NASA J@@ et Pro@@ p@@ ulsion Laboratory at Prin@@ ce@@ ton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years .
the moon has moved in front of the sun .
it blocks out most of the light so we can see that di@@ m cor@@ ona around it .
Sp@@ it@@ zer 's suggestion was we do this in space .
it 's about 10 billion times di@@ m@@ mer than it was before , and we can see the planets beam out just like that .
that 's not science fiction .
so those are four pe@@ tals .
I think this is the cool@@ est possible science .
I 'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there .
here are the ty@@ pe@@ faces , at least the lower cases .
it does hide its methods .
this is not a hosp@@ itable environment for a ty@@ po@@ graphic designer .
so the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions .
they wanted a small core set of fon@@ ts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen , which were their co@@ ar@@ se resolution displays .
thanks to the engineers , the technical problems went away .
Microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away .
not to me , if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow , although that standard may be well short of the ideal .
well , it 's been 18 years now since Ver@@ d@@ ana and Georgia were released .
I 'm not sure , but they 've had a good run so far .
the ten ring from the standard 75 @@@ -@@ @ yard distance , it looks as small as a mat@@ ch@@ stick tip held out at arm 's length .
but I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what 's so rare to g@@ lim@@ pse , that difference between success and ma@@ stery .
the pursuit of ma@@ stery , in other words , is an ever @@@ -@@ @ onward almost .
how many inven@@ tors and un@@ told entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
it 's a wisdom understood by Duke El@@ l@@ ington , who said that his favorite song out of his reper@@ toire was always the next one , always the one he had yet to com@@ pose .
the Paris Review got it out of James Bal@@ d@@ win when they asked him , " What do you think increases with knowledge ? "
one of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver med@@ alists and bronze med@@ alists after a competition .
if I ask you to en@@ vision what a great day looks like next week , you might describe it in more general terms .
masters are not experts because they take a subject to its conceptual end .
coming close to what you thought you wanted can help you attain more than you ever dre@@ amed you could .
so the whole planet needs a lot of energy , and so far we 've been running mostly on fossil fuel .
now , it 's very energy @@@ -@@ @ dense , it produces solid , reliable power , and it do@@ es@@ n 't make any CO2 .
it works pretty good .
so you take two small nuc@@ lei , you put it together , and you make hel@@ ium , and that 's very nice .
it makes lots of energy .
it would run for billions and billions of years .
now , if fusion is so great , why don 't we have it ?
and then I was looking at my good work , and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests around here in B.@@ C.
and bur@@ ying you , all of you , in millions of tons of jun@@ k mail .
others get a mi@@ stress .
you see the laser beam and the pel@@ let in the center .
now , this do@@ t here is called J@@ ET , the Joint European Tor@@ us .
it 's a big to@@ kam@@ ak don@@ ut in Europe , and this machine in 1997 produced 16 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of fusion power with 17 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of heat .
so this one is the real one .
so those have a couple of very good advantages .
the liquid metal absor@@ bs all the neutr@@ ons and no neutr@@ ons hit the wall , and therefore there 's no damage to the machine .
so when you com@@ press that , the plasma co@@ ols down faster than the compression speed , so you 're trying to com@@ press it , but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing .
however , plasma is difficult to com@@ press .
so he starts out with one line , and then two , and then four , and then 16 , and so on .
now , mathemati@@ cians thought this was very strange because as you shr@@ ink a ruler down , you measure a longer and longer length .
you get the human lun@@ gs , you get ac@@ ac@@ ia trees , you get fer@@ ns , you get these beautiful natural forms .
your body is covered with frac@@ tals .
the B@@ a @@@ -@@ @ ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter .
now , the tin@@ i@@ est cal@@ ab@@ ash in here keeps the woman 's soul .
but that turns out not to be true .
here 's an aerial photograph of one of the An@@ as@@ azi ruins ; you can see it 's circular at the largest scale , but it 's rectangular at the smaller scale , right ?
so in Man@@ ghet@@ u sculpture , you 'd see this recur@@ sive geometry .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
now , the tight rows up at the very top , they really hold out the wind and dust .
and I said , " Well look , I 'll pay you , you can be my teacher , and I 'll come each day and pay you . "
and finally , he revealed the truth of the matter .
and then you take this symbol , and you put it back in so it 's a self @@@ -@@ @ generating diversity of symbols .
this is a ge@@ om@@ antic chart drawn for King Richard II in 13@@ 90 .
it 's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship , the ethical power of democracy .
and if you don 't think that capitalism , which is self @@@ -@@ @ organizing , can have destructive effects , you haven 't opened your eyes enough .
these are robust algorithms .
but Western Australia is not alone in this .
and I have for you today the story of that journey , but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention .
and professor Nathan H@@ art and his team had just written a paper which tells us , confirms that pre@@ datory shar@@ ks see in black and white , or gra@@ y@@ scale .
we 're eth@@ ically precluded from even using human@@ oid shapes and ba@@ iting them up in the water .
from the perspective of Shar@@ k Att@@ ack Mitigation Systems , we 're a biotechnology licensing company , so we don 't make we@@ tsu@@ its ourselves .
it took up the entire fair@@ ing of a rocket just to launch it .
and we call this satellite " D@@ ove " - Than@@ k you .
we 've launched them .
now , what has bonded our team over the years is the idea of democrati@@ zing access to satellite information .
and this is what has bonded us .
it 's like some of the smallest satellites ever are being launched from the biggest satellite ever .
( la@@ ughter ) So we did@@ n 't just launch two of them like this , we launched 28 of them .
it 's going to be the largest con@@ stell@@ ation of satellites in human history .
and we have decided , therefore , that the best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it .
we want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data .
in short , we want to democrati@@ ze access to information about our planet .
how do we create such extreme temperatures ?
when they 're moving more slowly , we perceive it as cold .
the slow down effect comes from the transfer of momentum between the atom and the pho@@ ton .
this technique was developed in the 1980s , and the scientists who 'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for the discovery .
first of all , cold at@@ oms can make very good detectors .
so they 're used in devices that find underground oil and mineral deposits , and they also make highly accurate atomic cl@@ ocks , like the ones used in global positioning satellites .
that 's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie . "
we had nothing in common .
for me , that home has always been writing .
vol@@ t@@ ages sometimes oscill@@ ate , but since there are only two options , a value of 1 vol@@ t would still be read as " low . "
you need context to tell whether you 're hearing Russian , Spanish , or English .
so the first anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants were made from , of all things , rocket fuel , left over after World War II .
which is fitting , seeing as today , one in five soldiers develop depression , or post @@@ -@@ @ traumatic stress disorder or both .
and yet , despite how common@@ place these disorders are , our current treatments , if they work at all , only suppress symptoms .
maybe a break@@ up or an exam , you missed a flight .
stress resilience is the active biological process that allows us to b@@ ounce back after stress .
so , in other words , a biological stres@@ sor without a psychological component .
depression and PT@@ SD are chronic , often lifelong , clinical diseases .
by increasing resili@@ ency , we can dramatically reduce her suscep@@ tibility to depression and PT@@ SD , possibly saving her from losing her job , her home , her family or even her life .
and when you think about it , this makes a lot of sense , that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily .
they 're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions , and when you couple these robots with a video projector , you have these physical tools for inter@@ acting with digital information .
this is a video editing application where all of the controls for manip@@ ulating the video are physical .
this is a video chat application .
but au@@ tism is not a single condition .
he 's actually quite remarkably gif@@ ted in mathematics .
it was actually re@@ tracted from the journal Lan@@ ce@@ t , in which it was published , and that author , a physician , had his medical license taken away from him .
in fact , there 's probably not one single answer .
in addition , another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant .
one of the genetic factors that we don 't understand , however , is the difference that we see in terms of males and females .
remarkably , though , it 's not 100 percent .
this baby we know is going to be in the clear .
as we think about something that 's potentially a solution , how well does it work ?
thank you .
and I remember many nights , I would be sitting at home , just , like , concentrating and focusing , trying to feel the Force , and I did@@ n 't feel anything , don 't worry .
I joined the MI@@ T faculty and started working on wireless signals .
pretty accurate , is@@ n 't it ?
there are two key differences .
sleep .
sleep , actually , is something very dear to my heart , because my sleep is a disaster .
so here is our device , transmitting very low power wireless signal , analyzes the reflections using AI and sp@@ its out the sleep stages throughout the night .
in fact -- perhaps you know -- two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the cost of health care in the US is due to chronic diseases .
so glad you 're breathing .
and then consider that U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t started by prop@@ elling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as human@@ ly possible .
listen to it again .
only 530 are left .
if you look at it from that perspective , fewer than ten new men per [ year ] have joined the sub @@@ -@@ @ four mile club since Sir Rog@@ er B@@ anni@@ ster .
now , 530 is a lot more than one , and that 's partly because there are many more people training today and they 're training more intell@@ igently .
and that guy who won the 1904 Olympic mar@@ athon in three in a half hours , that guy was drinking rat po@@ ison and bran@@ dy while he ran along the course .
in 1972 , Ed@@ dy Mer@@ ck@@ x set the record for the longest distance cycl@@ ed in one hour at 30 miles , 3,7@@ 74 feet .
but then in 2000 , the International Cycling Union decre@@ ed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Ed@@ dy Mer@@ ck@@ x used in 1972 .
in fact , if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the 20th century , it looks like this .
suddenly , anybody who could be an N@@ BA player wanted to be , and teams started scour@@ ing the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships .
almost overnight , the proportion of men in the N@@ BA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to 10 percent .
the average N@@ BA player is a sh@@ ade under 6 ' 7 , " with arms that are seven feet long .
now in some cases , the search for bodies that could push athle@@ tic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that we@@ ren 't previously competing at all , like Kenyan distance run@@ ners .
still , even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don 't account for all of the changes in performance .
this is a vertical as@@ cent of more than 8,000 feet , and K@@ í@@ li@@ an went up and down in under three hours .
we 'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators .
now , all that 's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone .
and it costs just 500 dollars .
we go to them in their homes and we give them the most comprehensive , high @@@ -@@ @ tech , accurate examination , which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training .
here are people who are blind from a cu@@ rable condition cat@@ ar@@ act .
what 's more , we 've learned that this is something that we haven 't built just for the community but with the community .
in time , from mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds to mill@@ enn@@ ia , again around 14 orders of magnitude .
what does that mean ?
so what does a climate model look like ?
we do it one piece at a time .
we can look at the flu@@ xes .
we can look at the rate at which snow turns to ice , and we can code that .
we can enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ate that in code .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
there are other pieces : the winds changing the ocean currents .
and there 's lots of different ways to kick the system .
there are changes in the solar cycles , every 11 years and longer , that change the climate .
if it does , it 's sk@@ ill@@ ful .
we can look at other examples .
I could go through a dozen more examples : the skill associated with solar cycles , changing the ozone in the strat@@ osphere ; the skill associated with orbital changes over 6,000 years .
and we can get a good match to the data .
we can look at this across the world .
bill collectors call constantly , reading verbatim from a script before expressing pol@@ ite sympathy for my plight and then demanding payment arrangements I can 't possibly meet .
I was tired of fa@@ king normal .
I was@@ n 't seeing myself in the popular press .
the median household in the US only has enough savings to replace one month of income .
that would be zero .
among 55 @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds who do have a retirement account , the median value of that account is 10@@ 4,000 dollars .
social security was never supposed to be the retirement plan .
it 's not nearly enough .
I 've had to come out of the shad@@ ows , stand here openly , and I 'm inviting you to do so as well .
I said , " I 'm not doing that . "
if you need to take in a bo@@ ar@@ der to help you pay your mortgage or pay your rent , do it .
so I am calling on change agents and social entrepreneurs , artists and elders and impact investors .
I don 't need to know more . I don 't want to know .
Don 't say , " Oh my God . "
it was really too much .
but everybody , please do enjoy that , and again , I think that you do throw a cracking good party here at TED .
like , not that there 's anything wrong with that , but my mom , she 's like , like , why do you have to wear p@@ ants that , like , objec@@ ti@@ fy your body ? I like my p@@ ants .
and this guy 's older .
ok@@ ay , well , I 'm just g@@ onn@@ a answer this really fast , as , like , three or four different people .
stop running around star@@ ving .
I 'm g@@ onn@@ a start off by telling y '@@ all that this is my first time here at TED .
AB : multiply 22 times 47 , make sure you get 1,0@@ 34 , or the calcul@@ ators are not working .
so quickly , a two @@@ -@@ @ digit number please .
AB : 23 squ@@ ared , OK .
AB : thank you very much .
anyone I point to , call out a three @@@ -@@ @ digit number .
AB : 9@@ 87 squ@@ ared is 97@@ 4,@@ 169 .
( la@@ ughter ) Good , then I shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the impro@@ b@@ able .
I think I only heard five numbers . I -- wait -- 44@@ 8@@ 75 -- did you leave out the number 6 ?
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) For my next number -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) while I mentally re@@ charge my batteries , I have one more question for the audience .
yes ! I 'll go way to the back right now , how about you ?
of course , I could just make up an answer and you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't know , so I come prepared for that .
who wanted to know their birth day ?
what year was it , first of all ?
audience : 1966 .
I believe that was a Sunday .
AB : 18@@ 24 , OK .
AB : June what ? ca : sixth .
AB : was that a Sunday ?
ca : it was . AB : and it was clou@@ dy .
( la@@ ughter ) Good , thank you very much .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) But I 'd like to wrap things up now by all@@ ud@@ ing to something from earlier in the presentation .
there was a gent@@ l@@ eman up here who had a 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit calculator .
OK , what I 'm going to try and do , is to square in my head a five @@@ -@@ @ digit number requiring a 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit calculator .
but to make my job more interesting for you , as well as for me , I 'm going to do this problem thinking out loud .
so you can actually , honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size .
call out a single digit -- that will be the five @@@ -@@ @ digit number that I will try to square , go ahead .
six .
Y@@ uck .
by the way , one last instruction , for my judges with the calcul@@ ators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here .
( la@@ ughter ) Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right , because this is my big finish , OK .
we are in our best suits .
we look like sh@@ in@@ y new pen@@ n@@ ies .
you see , my mother was ru@@ th@@ lessly realistic .
my mother looked at me and she said , " How did they treat you ? "
you know , there was institutionalized , at one time leg@@ alized , discrimination in our country .
I have succeeded in my life beyond my wil@@ dest expectations , and I have been treated well by people of all races more often than I have not .
but I 'll be the first one to tell you , this subject matter can be hard , aw@@ k@@ ward , uncomfortable -- but that 's kind of the point .
now , my favorite example of color bra@@ very is a guy named John Sk@@ ip@@ per .
now , I told you , my mother , she was ru@@ th@@ lessly realistic .
she was an un@@ beli@@ evable role model .
this brutal prag@@ m@@ atism that she had , I mean , I was four and she told me , " Mom@@ my is Santa . " ( la@@ ughter ) She was this brutal prag@@ m@@ atism .
so right now , what I 'm asking you to do , I 'm asking you to show courage .
they were not intelligent .
they were illu@@ sions , a cle@@ ver combination of mechanical engineering and the dec@@ ep@@ tiveness of the con@@ ju@@ rer 's art .
EDI : I have two seven @@@ -@@ @ axis arms - MT : core of sensing - EDI : a 360 @@@ -@@ @ degree son@@ ar detection system , and come complete with a warranty .
Mt : sorry . now , one way of persu@@ ading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
technology can do the same .
to create the robo@@ tic illusion , we 've devised a set of ethical rules , a code that all robots would live by .
we give them a friendly face and a reas@@ suring voice .
EDI : Marco , you 're standing on my foot !
( appl@@ ause ) ( Music ) MT : and that 's it . thank you very much , and thank you , EDI . EDI : thank you , Marco .
in the summer of 2010 , there was a massive leak of classified documents that came out of the Pent@@ agon .
but the question often came , who needed to know ?
who needed , who had to have the information so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed ?
we had to change from who needs to know to the fact that who do@@ es@@ n 't know , and we need to tell , and tell them as quickly as we can .
" you can just decl@@ assi@@ fy them . "
the fact that I know something has zero value if I 'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it .
so as a consequence , what we did was we changed the idea of information , instead of knowledge is power , to one where sharing is power .
H@@ W : thank you so much . thank you .
beyond that , companies are offering us all kinds of internet @@@ -@@ @ connected devices .
there are smart lights , smart locks , smart toilets , smart toys , smart sex toys .
but once your appliances can talk to you , who else are they going to be talking to ?
in that two months , there was@@ n 't a single hour of digital silence in the house -- not even when we went away for a week .
SM : Don 't be embar@@ ras@@ sed , it 's just metadata .
favorite shows include " Di@@ fficul@@ t People " and " Party D@@ own . "
kh : we know what some of you are thinking : this is the contract of the modern world .
it was , " Alex@@ a , ask the Be@@ h@@ m@@ or to run quick start . "
and I 'd be like , " No , you can 't !
the math is not all that advanced , and really it 's like nothing more than solving a su@@ do@@ ku puzzle .
so what I did , I went through all of this information , spent a day or two research@@ ing .
you could always look at the Google recruitment messages that they post .
KS : I have a cross@@ f@@ ader .
Michael T@@ il@@ son Thomas : is it a mel@@ ody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude ?
Adam Oc@@ k@@ el@@ ford : in your brain is this amazing musical computer .
the other good thing about watching TED Tal@@ ks , when you see a really good one , you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend , don 't you ? like , just for a day .
they constantly use the argument to de@@ value rap and modern pop , and these arguments completely miss the point , because the dam has burst .
so I hope you enjoy this . here we go .
I study ants in the desert , in the tropical forest and in my kitchen , and in the hills around Sil@@ icon Valley where I live .
all that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants .
in the desert , operating costs are high because water is scarce , and the seed @@@ -@@ @ eating ants that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water .
it turns out that colonies are different .
so just as a ne@@ ur@@ on adds up its stimulation from other ne@@ ur@@ ons to decide whether to fire , an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to for@@ age .
and guess what we call this analogy ?
in the early days of the Internet , when operating costs were really high and it was really important not to lose any data , then the system was set up for interactions to activate the flow of data .
in the middle , there 's an ant plug@@ ging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions with another species .
but we might be able to learn something from ants about treating cancer .
so ants are using interactions in different ways in a huge variety of environments , and we could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control .
and the answer to that is that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud .
in other words , a cor@@ oner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy .
so we knew again about this crisis .
we had incredibly early warnings of it , and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest l@@ ender would make loans in this fashion .
so let 's take a look at the reaction of the industry and the regulators and the prosecutors to these clear early warnings that could have prevented the crisis .
and this is despite a warning from the industry 's own anti@@ fraud experts that said that these loans were an open invitation to fraud@@ sters , and that they had a fraud incidence of 90 percent , nine zero .
I recently retired from the California Highway Pat@@ rol after 23 years of service .
he never made it there .
a witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1 : 58 p.m. the previous day .
who h@@ as@@ n 't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness ?
my prayers are with you for your fight .
" dear Mr. Brig@@ gs , No@@ thing will er@@ ase the events of March 11 , but you are one of the reasons K@@ ev@@ in is still with us .
my grand@@ father committed suicide by poisoning .
horri@@ ble , absolutely horri@@ ble .
I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
what is that ? that is some deep , deep emo@@ tion , when you would want to do that .
and so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
it means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
it could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
and so they came up with a fur@@ l@@ ough program .
they are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
and is@@ n 't that the organization we would all like to work in ?
thank you very much .
that 's a san@@ e response to war .
a hundred and fifty men were absorbing almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces in the country , for a couple months .
at Re@@ stre@@ po , every guy up there was almost killed , including me , including my good friend T@@ im He@@ ther@@ ington , who was later killed in Libya .
there were guys walking around with bullet holes in their uniforms , rounds that had cut through the fabric and did@@ n 't touch their bodies .
" Ma '@@ am , I miss almost all of it . "
he 's not a psych@@ op@@ ath .
what he missed was connection to the other men he was with .
friendship happens in society , obviously .
the bullet had just knoc@@ ked him out .
I reached the point of no return and I don 't know if I 've been burned from the burned bridges in my life , thin@@ kin ' you were wrong and I was right .
with time I clearly lost my sight , thin@@ kin ' I was wrong to ever leave your side .
I 'm a fo@@ ol for a dead rom@@ ance .
can 't we make better sto@@ ves ?
it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation .
now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this : people need to cook , and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it .
and these are the bri@@ qu@@ et@@ tes that we made .
it 's cow d@@ ung .
and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area .
that 's an aw@@ ful lot for a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars .
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who are@@ n 't making their own .
and we need to re@@ think our development strategies , so that we 're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers .
that 's the best way to do it .
ca : what 's the bottlenec@@ k preventing this stuff getting from scale ?
and this was not good enough for him , and this question be@@ de@@ vil@@ ed him for years .
this was one of the most brilliant break@@ through@@ s in all of food science .
and he said , " There is no perfect pic@@ kle ; there are only perfect pic@@ k@@ les . "
Cam@@ p@@ bell 's made P@@ reg@@ o , and P@@ reg@@ o , in the early 8@@ 0s , was struggling next to R@@ ag@@ ù , which was the dominant sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti sau@@ ce of the 7@@ 0s and 8@@ 0s .
and sure enough , if you sit down , and you analyze all this data on sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti sau@@ ce , you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups .
and of those three facts , the third one was the most significant , because at the time , in the early 1980s , if you went to a supermarket , you would not find extra @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ un@@ ky sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti sau@@ ce .
it 's what people always say when you ask them .
what were they obs@@ essed with in the early 8@@ 0s ?
they don 't give you five options on the reduction .
they had a Plat@@ onic notion of what tom@@ ato sau@@ ce was .
the culture of tom@@ ato sau@@ ce was thin .
now in medical science , we don 't want to know , necessarily , just how cancer works , we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer .
I 'll give you one last illustration of variability , and that is -- oh , I 'm sorry .
this studies the circu@@ itry in two people 's bra@@ ins that acti@@ vates while they interact .
that is to say , if we attend to the other person , we automatically em@@ path@@ ize , we automatically feel with them .
and if that person is in need , if that person is suffering , we 're automatically prepared to help . at least that 's the argument .
and the str@@ an@@ gl@@ er says very matter @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ fac@@ tly , " Oh no . if I 'd felt the distress , I could not have done it .

( la@@ ughter ) Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something , and I 'm thinking , this man is the Ty@@ pho@@ id Mary of ideas worth spreading , and I have infected him .
I was surprised at the TE@@ D@@ ster / " Ru@@ gr@@ ats " overlap .
( video ) D@@ idi P@@ ick@@ les : it 's four o 'clock in the morning .
( video ) Ro@@ y Ne@@ ary : get up , get up ! I 'm not kid@@ ding . R@@ onn@@ ie Ne@@ ary : is there an accident ?
right ? four in the morning as this s@@ cap@@ eg@@ o@@ at hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur .
( video ) Wil@@ ma F@@ lin@@ t@@ stone : like how early ?
but I was also thinking what you might be thinking , which is really , cou@@ ld@@ n 't you do this with any hour of the day ?
first of all , you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon .
you can click on that red " refres@@ h " button .
half a globe away , a teen@@ ager made an In@@ st@@ agra@@ m video of it and sent it to me , a stranger .

AI is po@@ ised to make an incredible impact on our lives in the future .
after that , I would then go to an expert physician , who would then analyze those images for me .
and this is exactly what my group at MI@@ T Media La@@ b does .
we have invented a variety of un@@ or@@ thodox AI architec@@ tures to solve some of the most important challenges facing us today in medical imaging and clinical trials .
so how did we do it ?
these information pac@@ kets included colors , pixels , geometry and rendering of the disease on the medical image .
more importantly , our algorithms can accept , in the future and even right now , some very simple , white light photographs from the patient , instead of expensive medical imaging technologies .
as a scientist , and also as a human being , I 've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder .
I think J@@ ason We@@ bl@@ ey last night called it " consp@@ iring to be part of the magic . "
in person , fi@@ ref@@ lies are charming .
how do they do that ?
to answer this question , we need to f@@ lip back in the family album to some baby pictures .
fi@@ ref@@ lies completely re@@ inv@@ ent their bodies as they grow .
every single Fi@@ ref@@ ly lar@@ va can light up , even when their adults can 't .
it took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential pre@@ dat@@ ors but to bring in potential mates .
I still find it very romantic .
it 's her " come hi@@ ther " sign .
when we tested females using bl@@ inking LED lights , we discovered they prefer males who give longer @@@ -@@ @ lasting fl@@ ashes .
now we get to see what happens when the lights go out .
the main cul@@ pri@@ t : Habitat loss .
yet every time a species is lost , it 's like extinguishing a room full of cand@@ les one by one .
you might not notice when the first few fl@@ ames fl@@ ick@@ er out , but in the end , you 're left sitting in darkness .
we 're mammals . we produce a lot of smell .
you cou@@ ld@@ n 't demonstrate it was chemical .
the reason for that , of course , is that each of these animals produces tiny quantities , and in the case of the dog , males dogs can smell it , but we can 't smell it .
but he created the model for how you should go about pher@@ om@@ one analysis .
he basically went through systematically , showing that only the molec@@ ule in question was the one that stimulated the males , not all the others .
so we know that pher@@ om@@ ones exist right the way across the animal kingdom .
as any dog owner can tell you , we smell , they smell .
and I understand that the major role of parents is to stop kids putting their fingers in po@@ o , because it 's always something nice to smell .
now , smell was the hardest of the senses to crack , and the Nobel Prize awarded to Richard A@@ x@@ el and Lin@@ da B@@ uck was only awarded in 2004 for their discovery of how smell works .
there is one good reason , which is , the great ap@@ es have ar@@ mp@@ its as their unique characteristic .
her n@@ ip@@ ple is completely hidden by the baby 's head , but what you 'll notice is a white dro@@ ple@@ t with an arrow pointing to it , and that 's the sec@@ re@@ tion from the are@@ ol@@ ar g@@ lands .
there could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pher@@ om@@ ones that we simply don 't know at the moment .
there 's something like 80 coastal countries .

if you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins , obviously , fish is a good business decision .
in the oceans , biodiversity is not at war with abundance .

what were you eating ?
the answer is not really .
we don 't know how to read the sentences .
there are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk , they 're going to go on to get some symp@@ tom .
where are we going to look ?
six months ago , we locked down the screening key for this dec@@ o@@ der .
and so we started asking people such as Hak@@ on at the Children 's Hospital in Philadelphia .
they said , " Hu@@ h , not only do we have samples , but often we 've analyzed them , and we would be glad to go into our anonym@@ ized samples and see if we could find those that you 're looking for . "
what are our genes ? "
the specific sound of a speaking voice is the result of many an@@ atom@@ ical variables , but it 's mostly determined by the age and health of our vocal cor@@ ds and the size of our lar@@ yn@@ xes .
and I 've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning .
but over time , I 've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant .
forge meaning and build identity .
forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right .
it only makes what was wrong precious .
which is to say , you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell .
but as a gay American , I 've experienced prejudice and even hatred , and I 've forged meaning and I 've built identity , which is a move I learned from people who had experienced far worse priv@@ ation than I 've ever known .
" therefore , I take pleasure in in@@ firm@@ ities , " St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians , " for when I am weak , then I am strong . "
people ex@@ to@@ l a difference only because it 's theirs .
a friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself , once suggested that we organize Gay Hum@@ ility Week .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) It 's a great idea .
in 29 states in the US , I could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay .
and in Nigeria , gay people can legally be st@@ oned to death , and ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ings have become common .
in Saudi Arabia recently , two men who had been caught in car@@ nal acts were sentenced to 7,000 l@@ ashes each , and are now permanently disabled as a result .
and yet , every step forward is so sweet .
in 2007 , six years after we met , my partner and I decided to get married .
mar@@ rying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence .
I want my children to be happy , and I love them most ach@@ ingly when they are sad .
as a gay father , I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives , but I believe that if I succeed in shel@@ tering them from ad@@ versity , I will have failed as a parent .

he felt like that would go against his code as a sports@@ man .
a few days later , the scene was mem@@ ori@@ alized in a political cartoon back in Washington .
it looked really helpl@@ ess , like you just wanted to swee@@ p it up into your arms and reas@@ sure it .
so some of my favor@@ ites include that the more television a person watches in Up@@ state New York , the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear .
wild tur@@ keys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea ot@@ ters , and pan@@ d@@ as are twice as lo@@ vable as lad@@ y@@ bugs .
nature could only start to seem this pure and ad@@ orable because we did@@ n 't have to be afraid of it anymore .
and you can see that cycle playing out again and again with all kinds of animals .

by the time I finished that up and I re@@ joined my military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan , there were soldiers in my unit who were now on their second and third deployments before I even had my first .
but you get a chance to talk to your soldiers , and you ask them why did they sign up .
I said it because it s@@ ounded like the right thing to say to people who had served overseas .
but I had no idea what the context was or what that even , what it even meant to the people who heard it .
when I first came back from Afghanistan , I thought that if you make it back from conflict , then the dangers were all over .
please forgive us if we don 't like being in big crow@@ ds .
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me , " What did you do ? "

these are the people who I served with , and these are the people who I honor .
but how many of you have had your doctor ask you about money ?
one day , a mom asked us why we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do her taxes while she waited for the doctor .

they sat me down and said , " L@@ iz@@ z@@ ie , the only thing different about you is that you 're smaller than the other kids .
you have this syndrome , but it 's not going to define who you are . "
they said , " Go to school , pick your head up , smile , continue to be yourself , and people will see that you 're just like them . "
and so that 's what I did .

that civilization could program self @@@ -@@ @ repl@@ icating pro@@ bes to visit every planetary system in the gal@@ axy .
if they launched the first pro@@ bes just after midnight one August day , then before breakfast same day , they could have colon@@ ized the gal@@ axy .
in 2016 , astronom@@ ers confirmed there 's a planet in the habit@@ able zone of the closest star , Pro@@ xim@@ a Cen@@ ta@@ uri -- so close that Break@@ through Star@@ shot project plans to send pro@@ bes there .
the development of technological civilization is a third barrier .
a 2011 study showed that ele@@ ph@@ ants can cooperate to solve problems .
a 2010 study showed that an oc@@ top@@ us in captivity can recognize different humans .
but there 's an obvious answer : we 're alone .
ward and Brow@@ n@@ le@@ e said there might be more .
we ended up with a large moon and that permitted Earth to have both a stable ax@@ ial til@@ t and a slow rotation rate .
the moon is just the right size : big but not too big .
that seems like a pretty counter@@ intuitive thought .
come back when you 're a teen@@ ager . "
right ?
now there 's a difficulty with proceeding in that way , which is that Christianity is extremely , even on that list , it 's an extremely specific tradition .
and it is@@ n 't just e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al things like values and personality .
I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
it al@@ ters our personalities .
the person you are right now is as transient , as fle@@ e@@ ting and as temporary as all the people you 've ever been .
now - for a breath I tar@@ ry N@@ or yet disper@@ se apart - Take my hand quick and tell me , What have you in your heart .
[ A. E. Hous@@ man ] Now , this po@@ em has appealed to science fiction writers .
it 's about the Garden of E@@ den and the Fall and the Bi@@ blical story of the Fall , in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time .
the red that means fertility can also mean po@@ ison .
the good stars , P@@ ale hel@@ ms and sp@@ ik@@ y spur@@ s , Run away .
the sun comes up in the morning through branches , dis@@ p@@ els the dew , the eyes , on the grass , and defe@@ ats stars envisioned as armies .
unlike the sun , human beings think .
remarkably , cock@@ ro@@ aches can self @@@ -@@ @ stabilize running over rough terrain .
robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail @@@ -@@ @ safe .
it looks like a rapid , smooth , vertical climb , but when you slow it down , you see something very different .
they had fixed behavi@@ ors .
it 's about the thickness of a table n@@ ap@@ kin .
we can see your thoughts create your brain , which is really key to how it works .
well , computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x .
they 'll go into our brain through the cap@@ ill@@ aries and basically connect our ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x to a synthetic ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x in the cloud providing an extension of our ne@@ oc@@ or@@ te@@ x .
it 'll be expanded without limit .
election night 2008 was a night that t@@ ore me in half .
many of us never thought that this was possible until the moment that it happened .
and then it got even worse .
and on the other side , some African @@@ -@@ @ Americans dismissed or ignored hom@@ ophobia that was indeed real in our community .
now , I 'm a documentary fil@@ m@@ maker , so after going through my p@@ is@@ sed off stage and y@@ elling at the television and radio , my next instinc@@ t was to make a movie .
but then something else happened after that election in 2008 .
the campaign lasted a year , and it galvan@@ ized the civil rights movement like nothing had before it .
( video ) Sam@@ an@@ tha Masters : that 's what 's up , man , this is a righteous man over here .
man : no . Ka@@ ress Taylor @@@ -@@ @ Hu@@ gh@@ es : ok@@ ay . how old are you ?
it was a complete turn@@ around from that night in 2008 when Pro@@ position 8 was passed .
you know , when people in wheel@@ chairs come to school , they usually say , like , inspir@@ ational stuff ? "
ye@@ ah , we 've been sold the lie that disability is a B@@ ad Th@@ ing , capital B , capital T.
you may have seen images like this one : " the only disability in life is a bad attitude . "
but what if you are that person ?
we do overcome some things .
I 'd rather stretch my tongue with truth , our bridge to cross when we look one another in the eye .
close our eyes and pray for the hum@@ ility and the guidance to follow them to the way .
( che@@ ers ) ( Appl@@ ause ) We will be bridging time , we will bridge memory , we will bridge disparity and injustice , and we can 't wait to see you all on the other side .
thank you .
they wanted her to be more like them .
just a small amount of her was more than they could stand .
they wanted to un@@ ra@@ vel the mystery of her design .

but right now , companies like Trans@@ Canada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute non@@ violent protesters as terrorists .
today , in multiple countries , corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms .
they even included this nice little write @@@ -@@ @ up of my book .
and I feel the same way .
they sc@@ are us .
but the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all .
I knew that I might get h@@ acked for giving this talk , so let me save you the effort .
but it would be difficult for you to find me in it , because I 'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side .
he learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the Internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those rou@@ ters , no password needed .
and so for more conservative organizations , it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace h@@ acker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it .
they have been called many names from criminals to terrorists , and I CA@@ N@@ NOT justify their illegal means , but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all .
it was high season for low tech , which the government cou@@ ld@@ n 't block , but when the Net went completely down , T@@ elec@@ om@@ ix brought in the big guns .

my years in the h@@ acker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about h@@ ackers : they just can 't see something broken in the world and leave it be .
thank you very much .
thing number one : play with fire .
these myster@@ ies are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it .
and you can think of the open @@@ -@@ @ pit fire as a laboratory .
( la@@ ughter ) Number two : own a poc@@ ket@@ knife .
it turns out that our bra@@ ins are actually wired for throwing things , and like muscles , if you don 't use parts of your brain , they tend to atro@@ phy over time .
but when you exercise them , any given muscle adds strength to the whole system , and that applies to your brain , too .
next time you 're about to throw out an appliance , don 't throw it out .
( la@@ ughter ) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case , digital media .
it 's an important lesson for kids to understand , that some of these laws get broken by accident , and that laws have to be interpreted .
that 's something we often talk about with the kids when we 're fo@@ oling around with things and breaking them open , and taking them apart and using them for other things .
this happens about the same time that they get lat@@ ched onto things like din@@ osa@@ urs , these big things in the outside world , that they 're trying to get a grip on .
now this cloud is an inherent part of research , an inherent part of our craft , because the cloud stands guard at the boundary .
that was un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
that way of thinking got turned on its head when by chance I went to hear E@@ vel@@ yn Fox K@@ eller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science .
it 's not by chance . it 's a matter of values . "
I 'm on it . many of you are on it , whether you know it or not , and you can see the links .
we have just 17 links between us .
but does it really matter ?
I found out I 'm connected to Albert E@@ in@@ stein , so I told my seven @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old son that , and he was totally engaged .
I found a link to Je@@ ff@@ rey Dah@@ mer , the serial kill@@ er , but I will say that 's on my wife 's side .
we all come from the same ance@@ stor , and you don 't have to believe the liter@@ al Bible version , but scientists talk about Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al Adam and mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al Eve , and these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago .
we 're part of the same family .
we share 9@@ 9.9 percent of our DNA .
I thought , what can I do with this information ?
Paul Mc@@ Car@@ t@@ ney is 11 steps away , so I 'm hoping he brings his guitar .
and on the other side of the political spectrum , George H.@@ W. Bush , number 41 , the father , he has agreed to participate , and N@@ ick K@@ roll , the com@@ edi@@ an , and Dr. O@@ z , and many more to come .
my dinner companion and I both know what the ver@@ b " def@@ ri@@ end " means , so when does a new word like " def@@ ri@@ end " become real ?
who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words , anyway ?
I think most people , when they say a word is@@ n 't real , what they mean is , it do@@ es@@ n 't appear in a standard dictionary .
( la@@ ughter ) But how real are they if we use them primarily as s@@ lan@@ g and they don 't yet appear in a dictionary ?
with that , let 's turn to dictionaries .
now , don 't get me wrong , dictionaries are fantastic resources , but they are human and they are not tim@@ eless .
they 're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what 's going to stick and what 's not going to stick .
every January , we go to the American Di@@ al@@ ec@@ t Society annual meeting , where among other things , we vote on the word of the year .
to give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting , it occurs right before happy hour .
( la@@ ughter ) But some of the past winners now seem completely un@@ remarkable , such as " app " and " e " as a pre@@ fix , and " go@@ ogle " as a ver@@ b .
now , a few weeks before our vote , Lake Superior State University issues its list of ban@@ ished words for the year .
we 're notic@@ ing words that are coming into prominence .
it 's really a question of attitude .
in 17@@ 60 , Benjamin Frank@@ lin wrote a letter to David Hum@@ e giving up the word " colon@@ ize " as bad .
they include academ@@ icians , journalists , creative writers .
now here 's what I do to fill out the ballot .
I will be honest with you : I do not like the word " imp@@ ac@@ tful , " but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether " imp@@ ac@@ tful " is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written pro@@ se .
so to be responsible , what I do is go look at usage , which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Bo@@ oks .
there are going to be changes where you think , " Re@@ ally ?
it 's not . it is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it .
dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource , but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbit@@ er about what words mean .
that word might be s@@ lan@@ gy , that word might be informal , that word might be a word that you think is il@@ logical or unnecessary , but that word that we 're using , that word is real .
or whether to don@@ ate your life savings to charity .
what makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate .
in any easy choice , one alternative is better than the other .
you could have high fiber br@@ an ce@@ real or a chocolate don@@ ut .
suppose what matters in the choice is t@@ as@@ tin@@ ess and health@@ fulness .
I really loved philosophy .
well , that struck me as the height of extra@@ vag@@ ance and fri@@ vol@@ ity .
fear of being an unemployed phil@@ os@@ op@@ her led me to become a lawyer , and as I discovered , law@@ y@@ ering did@@ n 't quite fit .
suppose the bank , wo@@ oing you , adds 500 dollars a month to your salary .
so now we 've got a puzzle .
so how are we supposed to choose ?
when we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that , we wholeheartedly become the people that we are .
now , people who don 't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are dri@@ f@@ ters .
and that 's why hard choices are not a curse but a go@@ d@@ send .
however , in every religion , in every population , you 'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fer@@ ven@@ tly to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
they thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
by the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood did@@ n 't really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
being the perpe@@ tual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bul@@ lies .
another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Bus@@ ch G@@ ardens , an am@@ us@@ ement park .
we have more and more time @@@ -@@ @ saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .
and when you speak of the sab@@ bath , look at the Ten Comm@@ and@@ ments -- there 's only one word there for which the ad@@ jec@@ tive " holy " is used , and that 's the Sab@@ bath .
I have never once had to use a cell phone there .
and a few people do that for us by going nowhere .
but , if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope , in love with the world , I think you might want to try considering going nowhere .
but you know , it 's a very funny kind of art .
it 's fed by ...
and the life of the architect is also amazing .
they are .
adventure , it 's adventure in real life , not adventure in spirit .
and this is another site in Japan , building the K@@ ans@@ ai Airport .
again , all the rock clim@@ bers , Japanese ones .
you know , making buildings together is the best way to create a sense of cooperation .
and society is never the same .
and architecture is a mirror of those changes .
that was back in time , ' 77 .
( la@@ ughter ) It was really only a few years after May ' 68 .
and a pi@@ az@@ za is the beginning of urban life .
and , you know , in some way , you create the essence of the city .
and this is the K@@ ans@@ ai Airport , in Japan .
to make a building , sometimes you need to make an island , and we made the island .
this building is the California Academy of Sciences .
so this was also a place for people that will stay a long time .
this is the new Wh@@ it@@ ney , in the me@@ at@@ packing District in New York .
well , another flying vessel .
it 's telling a story ; it 's telling a story about the identity of the people living in that hu@@ t .
after rain , everything becomes bl@@ u@@ ish .
in the sunny evening , everything is red .
on this picture on the left , you have the Men@@ il Collection , used a long time ago .
and this is in Amsterdam .
this building is fl@@ ir@@ ting with water .
this monastery is playing with the silence and the forest .
and this is in the center of Paris , in the bel@@ ly of the wh@@ ale .
but I love sailing , because sailing is associated with slow@@ ness .
( la@@ ughter ) Well , there is very little I can do about that .
art and nature .
it 's about pure beauty .
and making buildings for this beauty makes cities better places to live .
he perished in the Holocaust .
but all of that is about to change with 3D printing , and it all started with this , the very first part that was ever printed .
so think about useful things .
and we did . we built her an amazing suit .
a real moon@@ shot , powered by 3D printing .
that will take new tools .
not everybody knows how to use CAD , so we 're developing hap@@ tics , percep@@ tual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay .

( la@@ ughter ) He tells me I 'm in the default option .
I said , " D@@ id you just say tobacco ? "
now , I know you can only see one person standing here on this big red do@@ t , on this enormous stage .
number four , Philip Mor@@ ris .
and then I realized it was@@ n 't just me .
it was the entire global finance sector , completely tang@@ led up with the tobacco industry .
question three relates to the concept of engagement .
" no " is the answer for tobacco companies .
we also have governments aligned on tobacco , 180 of them , bu@@ si@@ ly trying to implement the provisions of the UN tobacco treaty .
in March 2017 , the International Labour Organization issued a report which stated : " in tobacco @@@ -@@ @ growing communities , child labor is rampant . "
everywhere else is younger .
now for the good news .
the finance sector is coming to the party .
in the past year alone , major tobacco @@@ -@@ @ free moves have been made by leading financial organizations in eight different countries .
since tobacco @@@ -@@ @ free portfolios began , more than six billion dollars has been re@@ directed away from investment in the tobacco industry .
but the capacity to change things does not rest exclusively with these highly influential people .
as an educ@@ ator , designer , I 'd like to share with you five simple concepts that I 've developed through my work .
I think e pl@@ uri@@ bus un@@ um is global .
they tried to sell all of their community gardens , and B@@ ette Mid@@ ler developed a non@@ profit , the New York Restoration Project .
and so they called me , and I designed one in Jamaica , Que@@ ens .
you mean G @@@ -@@ @ Unit ?
( la@@ ughter ) And they said , " Y@@ ea@@ h ? "
and we said , homeless people can be in the same space as people who wear suits .
and everyone was like , " That 's never going to work .
so in this new design , the ground will erup@@ t , and it will talk about this tension that sits below .
the columns and the ground is made of tab@@ by sh@@ ales sco@@ op@@ ed up from the Atlantic , a reminder of that aw@@ ful crossing .
pu@@ zzles and magic .
ok@@ ay .
so as you can see , we are always solving .
come on guys , really ?
ok@@ ay , and pick up another marker out of the cup and take off the cap and color in the don@@ key for me , color in the don@@ key .
and pick up another marker for me and take off the cap . is@@ n 't this fun ?
and color in the ow@@ l for me .
ok@@ ay , and rec@@ ap that marker and pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the ro@@ o@@ ster for me , color in the ro@@ o@@ ster .
I think this is still going to work , mostly .
ok@@ ay , great . so we have a cobalt horse , amber ow@@ l , a silver ox , yes , ok@@ ay , a red don@@ key , and what was the emer@@ ald color ? a ro@@ o@@ ster .
I believe you colored a red don@@ key , G@@ w@@ en .
that was pretty much what my life was like .
( la@@ ughter ) But let 's keep things in proportion .
sc@@ ro@@ tal temperature reflects intr@@ at@@ es@@ tic@@ ular temperature and is lowered by sha@@ ving .
( la@@ ughter ) 4 am in the morning .
however , when we looked at the survey data , we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords , and the long passwords were a lot more usable , and in some cases , they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords .
is that a nick@@ name ?
I don 't know if you 've noticed , but there 's been a sp@@ ate of books that have come out lately contempl@@ ating or spec@@ ulating on the cogn@@ ition and emotional life of dogs .
do they think , do they feel and , if so , how ?
how bad would it be if there were a truly exi@@ st@@ ential catastrophe ?
the earth will remain habit@@ able for 500 million years to come .
is the human race even really worth preserving ?
here is where we would expect everyone to be better off than the richest person alive today .
perhaps here is where we discover an entirely new form of art , a form of music we currently lack the ears to hear .

Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us was a model public servant .

he was trying to improve the citiz@@ en@@ ry and in@@ still discipline .
many of the chemicals inside cigarettes can trigger dangerous mu@@ tations in the body 's DNA that make can@@ cers form .
and it 's not just lung cancer .
just 20 minutes after a smoker 's final cigarette , their heart rate and blood pressure begin to return to normal .
a day after ce@@ asing , heart attack risk begins to decrease as blood pressure and heart rates norm@@ alize .
qu@@ itting can lead to anxiety and depression , resulting from nic@@ o@@ tine withdrawal .
so why should we believe the science ?
in fact , they would contrast science with faith , and they would say belief is the domain of faith .
indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calcul@@ us of P@@ asc@@ al 's w@@ ager .
he made that leap of faith leaving science and ration@@ alism behind .
we can 't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases .
why do they believe each other 's claims ?
so what I 'd like to argue is yes , we should , but not for the reason that most of us think .
most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method .
and that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun .
that was a pretty star@@ t@@ ling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in 1919 , and lo and behold it turned out to be true .
Star@@ light actually does bend as it travels around the sun .
it was considered proof of the truth of this radical new idea , and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe .
now , it turns out , though , that there are several problems with this model .
so just because the prediction comes true do@@ es@@ n 't actually logically prove that the theory is correct .
this is a picture of the P@@ tol@@ em@@ aic universe with the Earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it .
when he collected these fin@@ ches , he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant .
besides induc@@ tive science , scientists also often participate in modeling .
and by that he meant it 's organized because they do it collectively , they do it as a group , and skep@@ ticism , because they do it from a position of distrust .
so despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts , what we find is that actually , really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively rare in the history of science .
or , they can say , well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evidence .
it 's the authority of the collective community .
so why is that ? why do cars work so well ?
our story begins over 200 years earlier , when Vi@@ kings began to settle on the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandin@@ avian exodus across northern Europe .
in 10@@ 66 , William , the Duke of Nor@@ man@@ dy , disputed the claim of the new English king , Har@@ old God@@ win@@ son .
he lived up to his nick@@ name " William the Con@@ quer@@ or " through a massive survey known as the Dom@@ esday Book , which recorded the population and ownership of every piece of land in England .
but the Nor@@ mans did more than just fight .
so if the Nor@@ mans were so successful , why are@@ n 't they still around ?
and today , I want to , well , share with you something I love , and also why .
in fact , I would invite all of you to join me in just ge@@ e@@ king out .
ok@@ ay , great . now I 'm going to copy and paste this , and then just change some of these numbers , 2@@ 20.@@ 5 , 440 I shall leave it as that , and .@@ 5 and 8@@ 80 .
it 's good practice .
and when we do this - ( T@@ ones ) - that 's going to go on for a while .
that 's the actual name , and I actually use one of these to make sal@@ ad at home as well , I k@@ id you not .
ok@@ ay .
( music ) And finally , let 's see , this is a totally different interaction , and I think you have to imagine that there 's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage , and I 'm going to ban@@ g it .
then we have tim@@ bre .
try not to do that .
we speak not very well to people who simply are@@ n 't listening in an environment that 's all about noise and bad ac@@ ous@@ tics .
that would be a world that does sound beautiful , and one where understanding would be the norm , and that is an idea worth spreading .
it 's how computers think .
cyber is an integral part of all of our lives , because computers are an integral part of all of our lives , even if you don 't own a computer .
suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building , and he wants to do this again and again in the future .
so after a while , I thought I had found the piece I was looking for .
I do this for a living .
it 's easy to not see the forest through the trees .
instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem , we should have been making the problem fit our minds , because our bra@@ ins have a tremendous potential for analyzing huge amounts of information , just not like this .
when I gather up enough of these sequences , I begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be .
I don 't mean to be r@@ ude , but you know what a psych@@ op@@ ath is .
what they see is card@@ board cu@@ tou@@ ts , and it 's very sad and it 's very lon@@ ely , and it 's very rare , fortunately .
in my day job , I 'm a policy adviser .
in 2005 , I launched a study called the Nation Bran@@ ds Index .
if a country has a great , positive image , like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland , everything is easy and everything is cheap .
I haven 't got time to explain in detail .
we don 't admire countries primarily because they 're rich , because they 're powerful , because they 're successful , because they 're modern , because they 're technologically advanced .
those are the countries we like .
I s@@ wear that as I get older , my ideas become simpler and more and more chil@@ dish .
I do not mean morally good .
this is a country which simply gives more to humanity than any other country .
I don 't talk about how they behave at home because that 's measured elsewhere .
( appl@@ ause ) According to the data here , no country on Earth , per head of population , per dollar of GDP , contributes more to the world that we live in than Ireland .
this means that as we go to sleep at night , all of us in the last 15 seconds before we drift off to sleep , our final thought should be , go@@ dam@@ mit , I 'm glad that Ireland exists .
the only reason why it 's below Ireland is because its lowest score is lower than Ireland 's lowest score .
ultimately , that , I think , is what will make the change .
but this story is incomplete .
it 's called " urban mining . "

AI will work with humans as analytical tools that humans can wrap their warmth around for the high @@@ -@@ @ compassion jobs .
but other times we 're proud of it .
( video ) An@@ derson Co@@ op@@ er : gets to your question , the question in the hall , on foreign aid ? yes , ma '@@ am .
regardless of your politics , many people feel proud to be American , and they favor Americans over other countries .
he left to go to university in France , because as a Jew , he cou@@ ld@@ n 't go to university in Poland , and then he en@@ listed in the French military in World War II .
Taj@@ fe@@ l said what we see in the Holocaust is just an exagg@@ eration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us .
and to explore this , he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents .
they probably had@@ n 't heard of the artists .
( la@@ ughter ) We see this sort of in @@@ -@@ @ group , out @@@ -@@ @ group psychology all the time .
so often they 're rational and useful , but sometimes they 're ir@@ rational , they give the wrong answers , and other times they lead to plain@@ ly immoral consequences .

so Stalin ap@@ oc@@ ry@@ ph@@ ally said , " A single death is a tragedy , a million deaths is a stati@@ stic , " and Mother Te@@ res@@ a said , " If I look at the mass , I will never act .

people don 't tend to del@@ u@@ ge people with facts and statistics .
and you would say , well that 's too bad , and you 'd go on to the rest of your life .
and this last part is what is often described as the principle of impartiality .
and it 's in this way that reason helps us create a better world .

and if you could do that for all of the millions of images coming down per day , then you basically create a database of all the siz@@ able objects on the planet , every day .
in time , we could get more sophisticated browsers that people pull in from different sources .
so , Planet 's Mission 1 was to image the whole planet every day and make it accessible .
planet 's Mission 2 is to index all the objects on the planet over time and make it quer@@ y@@ able .
it has emotions , anger and happiness .
it has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you .
each of us is conscious .
we all have our own inner movie , you and you and you .
at least , I know about my consciousness directly .
but at the same time , it 's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe .
some people say a science of consciousness is impossible .
and since then , there 's been a real explosion , a flow@@ ering of scientific work on consciousness .
and this work has been wonderful . it 's been great .
we saw some of this kind of work from N@@ ancy Kan@@ w@@ isher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago .
right now , we don 't really have a be@@ ad on that .
and here , the standard paradigm of emergence , even the standard paradig@@ ms of neuro@@ science , don 't really , so far , have that much to say .
the whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion .
at the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply denying the dat@@ um of consciousness to be satisfactory .
the first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
this do@@ es@@ n 't mean you suddenly can 't do science with it .
but the thought is maybe pho@@ tons might have some element of raw , subjective feeling , some primitive precursor to consciousness .
if it 's fundamental , like space and time and mass , it 's natural to suppose that it might be universal too , the way they are .
wherever there 's information processing , there 's consciousness .
well , on the pan@@ psych@@ ist view , you can leave the equations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness .
and , oh by the way , this h@@ as@@ n 't changed for 25 years .

when I was a k@@ id , I was always , like , taking apart boxes and stuff .

we just looked at what was@@ n 't working and used the amazing power of the Internet to get around it .
we set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education .
all of our materials come free .
moreover , for every nine @@@ -@@ @ week course , they meet a new peer , a whole new set of students from all over the world .
by the end of the course , they take the final exam , get a grade , and follow to the next course .
this is true off the playing field as well .
the end result is that we m@@ ess up .
in one study , we asked college soccer players to dri@@ b@@ ble a soccer ball and to pay attention to an aspect of their performance that they would not otherwise attend to .
in dance , the great chore@@ ograph@@ er , George Bal@@ anch@@ ine , used to urge his dancers , " Don 't think , just do . "
when the pressure 's on , when we want to put our best foot forward , somewhat ir@@ onically , we often try and control what we 're doing in a way that leads to worse performance .
it often gets ho@@ oked on the wrong things .
so how do we un@@ ho@@ ok it ?
something as simple as singing a song , or paying attention to one 's pin@@ ky to@@ e , as pro gol@@ fer Jack N@@ ick@@ la@@ us was rum@@ ored to do , can help us take our mind off those pes@@ ky details .
and it 's quite socially acceptable to talk about cho@@ king or performing poorly in math .
but where does this math anxiety come from ?
and it turns out that this is more prevalent in girls than boys .
of course , it 's not just what happens in the classroom .
social media plays a big role here , too .
and let 's not forget about the parents .
from the classroom to parents to media , and it can really make a difference in terms of whether we cho@@ ke or thrive .
fast @@@ -@@ @ forward from my high school soccer game to my fresh@@ man year in college .
I was in the chemistry sequence for science maj@@ ors , and boy did I not belong .
even though I studied for my first midterm exam -- I thought I was ready to go -- I bombed it .
I literally got the worst grade in a class of 400 students .
but when I walked into the final , my mind was quiet , and I actually got one of the highest grades in the entire class .
it was@@ n 't just about learning the material ; it was about learning how to overcome my limits when it mat@@ tered most .
because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard .
we are really excited to see what bi@@ ologists will create with it and what new insights they 're able to gain from finally being able to anim@@ ate their own model figures .
perhaps you have watched the movie " The Li@@ ves of Others . "
its origins are located in Russia .
when the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945 , it immediately expanded there , and soon it started to train the German Communi@@ sts to build up their own secret police .
for instance , the central jail for political prisoners , which was established by the Russians , was taken over by the St@@ asi and used until the end of Commun@@ ism .
you see it here .
but the Germans are known to be very effective , so the St@@ asi grew very quickly , and already in 1953 , it had more employees than the Ge@@ st@@ ap@@ o had , the secret police of Nazi Germany .
in 1989 , more than 9@@ 0,000 employees worked for the St@@ asi .
at the top of this tremendous apparatus , there was one man , E@@ rich Mi@@ el@@ ke .
and it was not only active in East Germany , but all over the world .
it could stop people on the street and arrest them in its own prisons .
but let 's look in more and more detail at the tools of the St@@ asi .
please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented .
in this picture , you can see me as a young man just in front of this building where we are now , photograph@@ ed by a St@@ asi agent .
the St@@ asi even collected the smell of people .
the one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters , for good reasons , because if one agent quit the St@@ asi , his knowledge was very small .
and in a way , the minister was right , because technical instruments can only register what people are doing , but agents and sp@@ ies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking .
the St@@ asi had its own university , not far away from here , where the methods were explored and taught to the officers .
the main reasons why people cooperated with the St@@ asi were political conviction and material benefits .
we took those who were around you . "
that 's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime .
it preferred to paraly@@ ze them , and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions .
in addition , the regime was dependent on the loans from the West .
so that makes a fundamental difference .
I did@@ n 't know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing .

in fact , we appear to be employing more CE@@ Os and senior managers than ever before .
Washington state is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation .
when restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants , that 's not bad for the restaurant business .
it 's not that they don 't have good entrepreneurs in other places , even very , very poor places .
it 's just that that 's all that those entrepreneurs ' customers can afford .
let me tell you a story , see .
once upon a time , there was a woman named M@@ iss Marg@@ aret .
miss Marg@@ aret had been a front @@@ -@@ @ desk specialist for almost 20 years .
and she can tell if you are a boy or a girl , black or white , American or non @@@ -@@ @ American .
so much so that she mar@@ ched down to that human @@@ -@@ @ resource department to see if she was eligible for an early retirement .
why they ma@@ kin ' you ask this question ?
( la@@ ughter ) But then I had to turn on the other side of me , the more professional speaker @@@ -@@ @ poet side of me .
and everybody knows what bad data does .
because I remember , being the front @@@ -@@ @ desk specialist , and when I went to the office of equity to start working , I was like , " Is that why they asked us to ask that question ? "
see , now I know people are more likely to share information when they are treated with respect by knowledgeable staff members .
now I know that you don 't have to be a st@@ atisti@@ cian to understand the power and the purpose of data , but you do have to treat people with respect and have comp@@ assi@@ onate care .
and don 't forget the food , the food , the food , the food .

and you are rarely , if ever , seen by your actual doctor , just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day .
I said , " Well , why don 't we just do it again ?

where are we here with this mis@@ carriage thing ?
well , we had data that told a different story .

ye@@ ah , that 's a story you want to tell at your k@@ id 's wedding reception . ( la@@ ughter ) I remember like it was yesterday .
and so your body he@@ ats up in anticipation of housing this new little fertil@@ ized egg .
so if there was a fertility issue or some problem , I had data to show : look , we got pregnant , our temperature shifted , we somehow lost this baby .
your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body .
if it gets too cold , your thyroid says , " He@@ y , we need to heat up . "
if it gets too hot , your thyroid co@@ ols you down .
fine . but the problem with that test is it do@@ es@@ n 't tell you how active the hormone is in your body .
cl@@ og@@ s you up every time . here , take this one instead . "
what story is this data telling you ?
he was a Vietnam veteran . corrections suited him .
there were eight men to a cell .
and just in case you wondered , they shared one toilet in those small confin@@ es .
hundreds of men stream@@ ed out of their cells .
take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up , and what you get is chaos .
places became safer because those inmates who were most violent or disrup@@ tive could now be isolated .
even in prison , it 's no small thing to lock someone up .
my next assignment was to one of the state 's deep @@@ -@@ @ end prisons where some of our more violent or disrup@@ tive inmates are housed .
we met violence with force and chaos with chaos .
we were pretty good at putting out fires .
and then we did something even more radical .
now the biggest and most controversial component of this design , of course , was the toilet .
let me be clear on what 's going on here , though .
of@@ ten@@ times , they know more about our own systems than the people who run them .
reducing reci@@ di@@ vism may be our ultimate goal , but it 's not our only goal .
prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability , re@@ popul@@ ating endangered species and environmental restoration .
we can contain and control and provide humane environments .
these are not opposing qualities .
we need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement , on interaction , on safe environments .

we find it sc@@ ary . we find it somehow evil .
and power governs how any form of government operates , whether a democracy or a dictatorship .
these are questions that play out in every single place on the planet .
this is the challenge and the opportunity for us .
our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work .
if we do that , then together we can make ci@@ vic@@ s sex@@ y again .
together , we can democrati@@ ze democracy and make it safe again for am@@ ate@@ urs .
and we also have , if you 've read the book about the filter bubble , the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like .
so here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have .
you have your list .
there are lots of sites where people have started to put together a Mag@@ na Car@@ ta , a bill of rights for the web .
and the stories of hero@@ ism go well beyond just a k@@ id getting a few extra chicken n@@ ug@@ gets on their lunch tra@@ y .

we set ourselves a modest target of 500 farmers insured after our first season .
after a couple of months ' intense marketing , we had signed up the grand total of 185 farmers .
everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance , but our prime customers simply we@@ ren 't buying .
they were waiting to see what would happen , did@@ n 't trust insurance companies , or thought , " I 've managed for so many years .
we 'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about 6,000 farmers in that area , and we called them up and said , " Lo@@ ok , we know about the drought .

the anti@@ anxiety medication Li@@ bri@@ um was given to cats selected for their me@@ ann@@ ess in the 1950s and made them into peac@@ eable f@@ elines .
today , however , we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects , but they 're giving them these drugs as patients , both in ethical and much less ethical ways .
it 's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs , but I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry is immense and growing , from seven billion dollars in 2011 to a projected 9.@@ 25 billion by the year 2015 .

now , we know many important things about cell types .
and something as complex as the function of our bra@@ ins is shaped by the interaction of thousands of genes .
I want to tell you a short story about a discovery we recently made about the gene@@ tics of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
a scientist in my lab developed a new way to analyze DNA with computers , and he discovered something very surprising .
this is@@ n 't big B , but it 's an insight about a molec@@ ule that matters .
complement proteins like C@@ 4 were known for a long time for their roles in the immune system , where they act as a kind of molecular Post @@@ -@@ @ it note that says , " E@@ at me . "
and that Post @@@ -@@ @ it note gets put on lots of debris and dead cells in our bodies and invites immune cells to eliminate them .
now , the creation and elimination of syn@@ ap@@ ses is a normal part of human development and learning .
scientists at many drug companies tell me they 're excited about this discovery , because they 've been working on complement proteins for years in the immune system , and they 've learned a lot about how they work .
there is so much more we can do .
consider cancer .
those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be .
and in the same kind of tr@@ ance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you 're reading , there 's something really so@@ oth@@ ing and easy .
it took me a while to understand it , but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people , I finally decided to really embrace this passion .
what you find at the store at the corner , without going to any kind of fancy store , is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated .
and New York has another kind of kn@@ ack for contemporary art .
I 'm always amaz@@ ed -- three @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds know who Richard Ser@@ ra is and take you to the galleries .
but design , for some reason , is still mis@@ understood for decoration .
and you see ID@@ EO there .
and this lets me introduce a very important idea about design : designers are the biggest synthe@@ siz@@ ers in the world .
therefore , he was not following everybody 's lead , and therefore , he was a ma@@ ver@@ ick .
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Her@@ ald Tri@@ b@@ une in Istanbul .
in moments of war there 's great technological innovation , and in the world you have to do without -- well , during the Second World War , you had to do without steel , you had to do without aluminum .
I think that this is a strange moment .
she says that everything you see she ow@@ es to sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti .
and I 've gained spirituality .
so how can I stay passionate ?
unless you are ill or very poor , you have choices .
the other day , one of my co@@ workers asked me if I could save that file as a PDF , and I said , " Well , of course , " and he said , " Aw@@ es@@ ome . "
ladies and gent@@ lemen , here are 10 things that are truly awesome .
then you can thank the hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e , that 's the one , because if crops are@@ n 't pol@@ lin@@ ated , we can 't grow food , and then we 're all going to die .
Wood@@ stock , 1969 : rolling Stone Magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll .
and by the way , this is what most Americans today believe .
but that 's a very primitive view of what a physical law is , right ?
they don 't have any on@@ tic cloud of their own .
what breath@@ es fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe ?
now , in taking this met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sical way out , these physi@@ ci@@ sts and also philosoph@@ ers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to Pla@@ to .
it 's as far removed from no@@ th@@ ingness as it could possibly be .
so we have these two extre@@ mes now .
it 's stup@@ idly constructed , it 's got way too many arbitrary coupling con@@ stants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles , and what the hell is dark energy ?
they 're a mixture of chaos and order , of mathematical elegance and ug@@ liness .

in order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint , we started utilizing local biomass as soil A@@ MEN@@ DE@@ R and fertilizers .

you may think this is far .
what if we re@@ defined art 's value -- not by its price tag , but by the emotional connection it creates between the artist and the audience , or the benefits it gives our society , or the fulfillment it gives the artists themselves ?
since its early an@@ arch@@ ist years , Bur@@ ning Man has grown up .
one thing that sets this work aside from the commercial art world is that anyone who makes work can show it .
( la@@ ughter ) They z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag from art@@ work to art@@ work like some b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , random public transportation system , pul@@ sing with light and sound .
and what 's amazing is that , by and large , when people first come to Bur@@ ning Man , they don 't know how to make this stuff .
but in the desert , there are no g@@ ate@@ keepers and no plac@@ ards explaining the art , just natural curi@@ osity .
( la@@ ughter ) Art becomes a place for extended interaction , and although the display might be short @@@ -@@ @ lived , the experience stays with you .
" even a broken cra@@ yon still colors . "
the collective emo@@ tion in this place is over@@ powering and in@@ descri@@ b@@ able , before it 's set a@@ fire on the last night of the event .
what is art for in our contemporary world if not this ?
for over a decade as a doctor , I 've cared for homeless veterans , for working @@@ -@@ @ class families .
in fact , three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time , she went to an emergency room in Los Angeles .
the results are normal , so here 's some pain medication , and follow up with a primary care doctor , but if the pain persists or if it worsen@@ s , then come on back . "
when she came to our clinic , though , we tried a different approach .
our approach started with our medical assistant , someone who had a GE@@ D @@@ -@@ @ level training but knew the community .
it comes from chron@@ ically rub@@ bing one 's nose up and down , trying to get rid of those all@@ ergy symptoms , and yet , here was Ver@@ on@@ ica , a grown woman , with the same tell@@ tale sign of aller@@ gies .
I think you have chronic aller@@ gies , and I think you have mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and some sin@@ us congestion , and I think all of those are related to where you live . "
what was it about this different approach we tried that led to better care , fewer visits to the E.@@ R. , better health ?
well , quite simply , it started with that question : " Ver@@ on@@ ica , where do you live ? "
let 's usher more people to safety by building this raft , coordinating those branches together .
she 's in the water . she 's swimming away from them upstream , rescu@@ ing children as she goes , and they sh@@ out to her , " Where are you going ?
in healthcare , we have that first friend - we have the specialist , we have the trauma surgeon , the IC@@ U nurse , the E.@@ R. doctors .
all together , living and working conditions account for 60 percent of preventable death .
that study illustrates what my friends in public health often say these days : that one 's zi@@ p code matters more than your genetic code .
they matter to our health , and therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it .
in healthcare , we often pay for volume and not value .
we don 't ask about where you live and where you work , because if there 's a problem there , we don 't know what to tell you .
there are not nearly enough of that third friend , that person who is going to find out who or what is throwing those kids in the water .
they can be nurses , other clin@@ icians , care managers , social workers .
it 's not so important what specific degree up@@ stream@@ ists have at the end of their name .
it 's one , two and three .
let 's say , for instance , let 's try to help children who are b@@ ouncing in and out of the hospital with asth@@ ma .
perhaps , for children with asth@@ ma , it 's what 's happening in their home , or perhaps they live close to a free@@ way with major air pollution that triggers their asth@@ ma .
in the U.S. , for instance , that would mean that we need 25,000 up@@ stream@@ ists by the year 2020 .
we can also make sure that these schools certify a backbone of the upstream approach , and that 's the community health worker .
health is a common good .
thank you .
today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a ne@@ ural portrait of the human mind .
ok@@ ay , here 's another one . it 's a brain , of course .
so this picture 's nice , if I do say so myself , but it shows only an@@ atom@@ y .
bra@@ ins are like muscles .
so that 's pretty cool , but how do we know this is@@ n 't a flu@@ ke ?
well , the easiest way is to just do the experiment again .
maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round .
to tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function , you need to m@@ ess with it and see what happens , and normally we don 't get to do that .
so let 's get started . here 's my right hemisphere .
do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses , like hearing ?
( ch@@ om@@ ping ) ( Dr@@ um roll ) ( Toilet fl@@ ush@@ ing ) Ok@@ ay . next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selec@@ tively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech .
now , everything I 've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception , vision and hearing .
so it 's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language , but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selec@@ tively .
studying that fly , I thought , " W@@ ow , it 's changing directions in mid@@ air with acute angles , and it 's going so fast , it 's a bl@@ ur .
I was seized with a compul@@ sion , a pri@@ mor@@ dial urge to learn how to fly , like a human .
I really think it has to do with curi@@ osity and not taking yourself so seriously .
rather than " pain , " say , " another rather interesting , foreign sensation . "
I thought , " Well , why don 't we inv@@ ent an impact technique ?
in 2003 , we were invited to go to Kit@@ ty H@@ aw@@ k to celebrate the 100th anniversary of flight with the W@@ right Brothers .
and if we wanted to go higher , faster , sooner , harder , it was necessary that we create our very own spac@@ es@@ hips .
but it felt we@@ ir@@ d to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own home@@ town .
what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel , and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible .
and right now , we 're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way .
never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving .
the night watch@@ man had caught an employee who was ste@@ aling s@@ ocks -- it was a ho@@ si@@ ery mill , and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was sho@@ vel@@ ing in mountains of s@@ ocks .
Mr. T@@ es@@ z@@ ler went down to the plant and confronted the th@@ ief and said , " But why do you steal from me ? if you need money you have only to ask . "
well , maybe he was too tr@@ usting , because he stayed where he was long after the Nazi An@@ sch@@ l@@ uss in Austria and even after the arrests and de@@ portations began in Budapest .
they were to be his seed group , his future fore@@ men .
" live each day as if it is your last , " said Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi .
" learn as if you 'll live forever . "
this is what I 'm passionate about . it is precisely this .
I am trying , or will try to convey this inspiration .
the circulation in our body distribu@@ tes fresh blood , which feeds , nur@@ tures and supports us , and brings the used blood back to be renewed .
we 'll start by talking about the power of all these processes .
rains all over the world . what do you see ?
the equ@@ atorial region , in general , and the Amazon specifically , is extremely important for the world 's climate .
what phenomenon -- if it 's not a desert , what phenomenon makes water g@@ ush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
what phenomenon is this ?
but we have something that plays the same role , with much more elegance though : the trees , our good old friends that , like ge@@ y@@ sers , can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere .
any idea ? a really big kettle .
it 's a vivid and extremely powerful plant , providing environmental services .
we , scientists -- You see that I 'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other .
the dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our air@@ ways .
like endoc@@ r@@ inal g@@ lands and hormones , there are those gases which I told you about before , that are formed and released into the atmosphere , like hormones , which help in the formation of rain .
he replied : " the spirit of the forest told us . "
each tree , each tree top , has up to 10,000 species of insects in it , let alone the millions of species of fun@@ gi , bacteria , etc .
I 'm going to end my talk here -- I have a few seconds left -- by showing you this wonderful being .
when we see the morph@@ o bu@@ tter@@ fly in the forest , we feel like someone 's left open the door to heaven , and this creature escaped from there , because it 's so beautiful .
a robo@@ tic hand is technological , mine is biological , and we don 't think about it anymore .
( la@@ ughter ) But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers ' classes that I cut the pot@@ tery that I made , ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) and they gave me passing grades .
and that 's how I got out of high school .
you remember we used to make steel in Pit@@ ts@@ burgh ?
( la@@ ughter ) I said to my boy , " When you raise the money , we 'll put your taste on the wall . "
that 's intentional .
because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech .
I said , " Well , I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there . "
and so in my building , which is full of sunlight and full of flowers , we believe in hope and human possibilities .
and he said , " But we 've heard about you .
I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen .
the reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they sp@@ it out the other end , not the children who read .
and this is the arts program I started in 1968 .
we 've made a fascinating discovery : there 's nothing wrong with the kids that affec@@ tion and sun@@ shine and food and enthusiasm and Her@@ bie 's music can 't cure .
I beat out all the Ph.D. ' s because I fig@@ ured that if you treat children like human beings , it increases the likelihood they 're going to behave that way .
these were children who the whole world had given up on , who were fl@@ un@@ king out of public school , and that 's what they 're capable of doing with affec@@ tion and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and he got 10 parents and then 20 parents .
and there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents .
my only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old . "
and that 's the room that 's initiating the relationship .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Music ) I only have a couple more slides , and this is where the story gets kind of interesting .
and a guy named D@@ iz@@ zy G@@ ill@@ es@@ pi@@ e showed up to play there because he knew this man over here , Mar@@ ty Ash@@ by .
so , we 've become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the United States of America ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) If you 'd have dropped a bomb on that room , you 'd have wi@@ ped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there .
and P@@ at Meth@@ en@@ y and J@@ im Hall were there and they recorded with us .
and I 'm very pleased to tell you that the building 's done .
and you ought to come and see it -- it 's going to be a hell of a story .
( la@@ ughter ) The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and I 'll tell you where I made my big mistake .
I want one of those . "
and so I kind of accepted the flat@@ tery and the praise and put it out of my mind .
he said , " Well , that 's the electronic commerce network . "
and I ran the story and I said , " What do you think ? "
I 'm going with you , man . "
we won 't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around .
it 's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pit@@ ts@@ burgh Medical School .
did it almost double , did it remain more or less the same , or did it hal@@ ve ?
the world has been much , much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this , you know .
here , you can see men went eight years .
when you answer , you answer according to the worst places , and there you are right , but you miss the majority .
well , it 's very clear that poverty here was almost hal@@ ved , and in U.S. , when we asked the public , only five percent got it right .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's very difficult , this . it 's very difficult .
and then , lately , from the European Union media .
do we have any ideas ?
it 's Hu@@ di@@ k@@ sv@@ all . it 's a city in northern Sweden .
we have all different experiences from communities and people we meet , and on top of this , we start school , and we add the next problem .
ok@@ ay , this was good ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily , but now when it comes to the world@@ view , it is the exact reason why it 's up@@ side down .
so now we come to the practical tric@@ ks .
now , the next pre@@ conceived idea is first countries and people need to be very , very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters .
( appl@@ ause ) That 's a systematic approach .
if you have a fact @@@ -@@ @ based world@@ view of today , you might have a chance to understand what 's coming next in the future .
that 's when I was born , and I selected the West .
the Western domination is over , as of today .
there 's draw@@ ers you can pull out and get citrus so you don 't get s@@ cur@@ vy .
because we believe that A@@ x@@ e Body Sp@@ ray is something that you should only find on the battlefield , not under your arms . ( la@@ ughter ) And these are robot emo@@ tion chips , so robots can feel love or fear .
( la@@ ughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
there 's a term called meta@@ fiction , and that 's just stories about stories , and meta 's having a moment now .
it 's when an actor will turn to the audience and say , " I am an actor , these are just ra@@ f@@ ters . "
and even that supposedly honest moment , I would argue , is in service of the lie , but it 's supposed to foreg@@ round the arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ality of the fiction .
for me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
and it 's about a k@@ id who gets a blue wh@@ ale as a pet but it 's a punishment and it ruins his life .
( la@@ ughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
he 's got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
and when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the outgoing message , it 's just wh@@ ale sounds and then a be@@ ep , which actually sounds a lot like a wh@@ ale sound .
( audio ) Nic@@ o : Hello , R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph , this is Nic@@ o .
he 's left over 25 messages for R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph over four years .
but Nic@@ o 's the best reader I could hope for .
meta@@ sta@@ sis is a complicated process .
now , like anything else in nature , when things get a little too tight , the signal is enhanced , causing the cancer cells to move away faster from the primary site and spread to a new site .
and fortunately , I work for someone who is open to running with my crazy ideas .
we , on the other hand , came up with the drug cocktail that targets meta@@ sta@@ sis not by targeting tumor growth , but by targeting the complex mechanisms that govern it , through the targeting of the Has@@ ini effect .
as I reflect on this success I 've encountered with the Has@@ ini effect , I keep coming back to the people that I was fortunate enough to work with .
the under@@ graduate students who demonstrated super@@ human powers through their hard work and dedication .
the support staff , the friends and family , people who lifted our spirits , and never let us give up on our ambitious endeav@@ ors .
we can 't sustain suburbs , so let 's design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit .
on the left is Manhattan today : blue for housing , red for office buildings , retail .
on the right , we re@@ configured it : the office buildings form the base , and then rising 75 stories above , are apartments .
there 's a street in the air on the 25th level , a community street .
it does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city , and light perme@@ ates everywhere .
and Colombo .
thank you .
I first visited Beijing 25 years ago to teach at the People 's University of China .
China 's planning to scale back coal .
now , the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I 've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing .
this is profound structural change .
we risk temperatures we haven 't seen for tens of millions of years over a century .
you can 't make a peace treaty with the planet .
you can 't negotiate with the laws of physics .
those are the stakes we 're playing for , and that 's why we have to make this second transformation , the climate transformation , and move to a low @@@ -@@ @ carbon economy .
those two transformations face us in the next two decades .
surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world .
now , with cities , like life but particularly cities , you have to think ahead .
now , some things in cities do take time .
for those of you live outside London in the U.@@ K.
this was the 1950s .
we have to invest strongly in energy , we have to use it much more efficiently , and we have to make it clean .
it would be in the top 10 countries in the world if it was independent .
those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rap@@ idity of change .
do the first one well , the structural , the second one on the climate becomes much easier .
again , I think it 's a strong ambition but it is a pl@@ au@@ sible one .
it 's working in the rehabilitation of land .
you look at supermarket sales of 30 @@@ -@@ @ centi@@ meter p@@ ies that are frozen , and apple wins , no contest .
in this case , it allows us to see what America 's favorite pi@@ e is : not apple .
it is true that there is a lot of hy@@ pe around the term , and that is very unfortunate , because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance .
so what is new about big data ? what is the big deal ?
sharing it is easier . processing it is easier .
by contrast , all of the files that Edward S@@ now@@ den took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a finger@@ nail , and it can be shared at the speed of light .
think , for example , the question of location .
take , for example , Martin Lu@@ ther .
the general idea is that instead of instruc@@ ting a computer what do do , we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself .
it plays itself . it collects more data .
machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online : search engines , Amazon 's person@@ alization algorithm , computer translation , voice recognition systems .
that makes sense , but the problem , of course , is that it 's not simply going to stop on location data , it 's going to go down to the level of the individual .
big data is going to transform how we live , how we work and how we think .
we now need to rec@@ ast our gaz@@ e at the I , the information , which is less apparent , but in some ways a lot more important .
my work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions , and created a lasting stigma for me and my family .
in front of a police compound in Gaza City during the first war in Gaza , an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound and break my nose .
Mohammed got the bathtub on the top of the rub@@ ble and started giving his kids an every morning bubble bath .
as I assessed him , I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him , and like so many other cases , he looked me in the eye and asked that question : " am I going to die ? "
regardless of religious belief or cultural background , there 's a need for forgiveness .
I had once cared for an elderly gent@@ l@@ eman who was having a massive heart attack .
I believed what you saw in the movies : when you 're in those last moments that it 's strictly terror , fear .
there 's one worker down there .
he 's got a face mask on , but no shirt .
so you ask yourself , how can we solve this and why don 't we just build Western @@@ -@@ @ style fl@@ ush toilets for these two and a half billion ?
and the answer is , it 's just not possible .
so let 's start with the human user interface .
we need to make it more robust , and we 're going to do more testing in Malawi and South Africa this coming year .
so Tu@@ b@@ man fled with two of her brothers , Ben and Harry .
Sim@@ one George : I met Mark when he was just blind .
it was called " Op@@ tim@@ ist , Re@@ alist or Som@@ ething El@@ se ? "
I wanted to gather him in my arms , but I cou@@ ld@@ n 't move him , and so I kis@@ sed him the way you k@@ iss a newborn baby , terri@@ fied of their fragility .
( la@@ ughter ) And he said , " Lo@@ ok , you signed up for the blind@@ ness , but not this . "
and when you no longer need me , then we talk about our relationship . "
multiple infections , nerve pain , sp@@ as@@ ms , shortened life sp@@ ans are common .
it was like the formal medical system was cancel@@ ing hope in favor of acceptance alone .
Don 't worry , it turns out OK in the end . "
big problems need big solutions , spar@@ ked by big ideas , imagination and aud@@ acity , but also solutions that work .
the subjects are familiar - basic and clinical sciences - but there are major differences .
third , they learn public health : to assess their patients ' drinking water , housing , social and economic conditions .
dozens of projects give us an ink@@ ling of what they 're capable of doing .
they spoke easily to each other in Spanish and listened to their patients in Cre@@ ole thanks to Haitian medical students flown in from E@@ LA@@ M in Cuba .
E@@ lam 's graduates , some from right here in D.C. and Balti@@ more , have come from the poorest of the poor to offer health , education and a voice to their communities .
so what 's women 's experience as it relates to mentoring ?
that 's what enables that breakthrough from middle management to leadership at the top .
one young scientist that works in a bio@@ tech firm used her insight about the missing 33 percent to we@@ ave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room .
thank you .
I am not that caring .
I did@@ n 't have any use for it , but I missed writing .
and I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans .
but I think blogs are basically just an evolution , and that 's where we are today .
you have your Google search , where you say , " What is M@@ ena Tro@@ t@@ t ? "
I 'm probably going to get people telling me I haven 't updated .
( la@@ ughter ) And I remember instantly : I am in Germany in this -- I had to go for a one @@@ -@@ @ day trip .
that was an amazing thing .
well , here is the image .
then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
and me as the Queen .
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time .
and also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin La@@ den , Saddam Hussein , the links that were put about pre @@@ -@@ @ Iraq war .
it was a bit of a road stop@@ per , which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crow@@ ds , but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance .
and sometimes asking the real celebr@@ ity , mista@@ king them for someone who just looks like the real person , which is highly embar@@ ras@@ sing . ( la@@ ughter ) .

and I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions .
the complexity of the music does become an issue , and actually the opinions of others - parents , friends , media - they start to count .
it 's very nice to be here tonight .
not infinite concentration of wealth , but the higher the gap between r and g , the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to conver@@ ge .
so fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between the United States and Europe over the past century .
wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration .
so let me come to some of the explanations and spec@@ ulations about the future .
the first thing is that I think we need more financial transparency .
in the current political context , how realistic are those ?
what do you answer to that ?
TP : ye@@ ah , I think inequality is not a problem per se .
and also , extreme inequality can be bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very unequal access to political voice , and the influence of private money in U.S. politics , I think , is a matter of concern right now .
it looks like it 's chance because we rarely see all the le@@ vers that come into play to make people lucky .
but I 've realized , by watching so long , that luck is rarely a lightning strike , isolated and dramatic .
it 's easy , but it 's not obvious .
and this requires us to get out of our comfort zone and take some risks .
we sort of lock down the sense of who we are and don 't stretch anymore .
now , with my students , I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks .
at the end of the flight , we exchanged contact information .
I said , " Fun@@ ny you should ask . "
( appl@@ ause ) Now , you might say , " Oh , you 're so lucky . "
( la@@ ughter ) So they hand all the ideas to me , I read the great ideas out loud , and then I ri@@ p them up and throw them away .
within about 10 seconds , someone says , " This is a fab@@ ulous idea . "
it turns into a su@@ shi bar with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients .
she 's just turned one and started to walk .
because apparently we don 't .
ten thousand people every month go@@ ogle , " A@@ m I ug@@ ly ? "
but what 's leading them to do this ?
never before have we been so connected , so continuously , so instan@@ taneously , so young .
there 's simply no privacy .
and it 's also really hard to tell the difference between what 's authentic and what 's dig@@ it@@ ally manip@@ ulated .
one in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don 't feel good about it .
and this is consistent across Finland , the U.S.
so to be super clear , we 're talking about the way you think you look , not how you actually look .
and we don 't grow out of it .
well , talking , on its own , only gets you so far .
now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this .
the bad news is that most of them don 't work .
it is not ok@@ ay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their hair@@ cuts or the size of their brea@@ sts , or to inf@@ er that the determination or the success of an Olymp@@ ian is down to her not being a loo@@ ker .
we can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks .
giving them the air@@ time , because only then will we create a different world .
a world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves , where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life .
think about what this might mean for someone in your life .
this diagram shows the body 's lym@@ ph@@ atic system , which has evolved to meet this need .
it takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells , it collects them , and then dum@@ ps them into the blood so they can be disposed of .
so if we were to zoom into this guy 's head , one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lym@@ ph@@ atic vessels in the brain .
but that do@@ es@@ n 't make a lot of sense , does it ?
I mean , the brain is this inten@@ sely active organ that produces a correspond@@ ingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared .
it was ing@@ en@@ ious , but it was also beautiful .
so we measured how fast am@@ y@@ lo@@ id @@@ -@@ @ beta is cleared from the brain when it 's awa@@ ke versus when it 's asleep , and we found that indeed , the clearance of am@@ y@@ lo@@ id @@@ -@@ @ beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain .
I 've always rejected it and all the legacy it was born into .
my students come from war @@@ -@@ @ torn countries .
my story is like that of so many other refugees .
my mother was his second wife , married to him at the age of 16 .
my community was constantly under attack .
I remember my mother was pregnant , when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister .
no gun@@ shots .
I remember the faith that he put in me over the couple of years to come .
but I was missing something : my mother .
I was alone , in school , when I heard of her death .
boarding school was heaven , but it was also so hard .
when I finished my high school career , I moved my sisters to Nairobi , where they live with my step@@ sister .
it 's about discovering our destiny .
it was easy , as children , to come together , blend all of our beliefs to form our own unique , multicultural environment .
so everyday I would get up , go to school , sit in my desk and never learn a thing .
when I first started wearing it , I was excited .
I remember ad@@ m@@ iring my mother 's , and I wanted to em@@ ulate her beauty .
but when I started middle school , the students te@@ ased me about not having hair , so to prove them wrong , I started showing them my hair -- something that goes against my beliefs , but something I felt pres@@ sured to do .
it was at this moment that I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and compete in a p@@ age@@ ant wearing a hij@@ ab and bur@@ kin@@ i .
you have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe , one day , you 'll get to sit at a table where a decision is being made .
I don 't have the answer , just in case .
Marshall Mc@@ Lu@@ han once said that politics is solving today 's problems with yesterday 's tools .
because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stac@@ king up preferences , one on top of each other , but that our healthy and robust public debate should be , once again , one of its fundamental values .
and if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue , you can always delegate your vote to someone else , allowing for a dynamic and emerging social leadership .
it suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in Congress .
and yes , we failed .
I 'm not saying it 's easy .
and in my heart , it 's most definitely worth trying .
my father was a government worker .
these are people who live in a country other than their country of birth .
in Tajikistan , remittances are 42 percent of GDP .
remittances are dollars wrapped with care .
money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor .
many rich nations also have a blan@@ ket ban on sending money to specific countries .
so , if I have to send money to my father in the village , I must send money through that particular money transfer company , even if the cost is high .
first , relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars .
that is larger than , or almost similar to , the total aid budget of the United States government , the largest donor on the planet .
a construction worker from Bangladesh , on an average , pays about 4,000 dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only 2,000 dollars per year in income .
most of that money is par@@ ked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate .
we must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper .
my parents are not there anymore .
not a single person has taken me up on that offer .
now , there 's a reason why privacy is so cra@@ ved universally and instinc@@ tively .
there are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched , the behavior they engage in is va@@ stly more conform@@ ist and compliant .
and crucial to this design was that the inmates could not actually see into the pan@@ op@@ tic@@ on , into the tower , and so they never knew if they were being watched or even when .
there are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well .
it renders off @@@ -@@ @ limits all kinds of behavi@@ oral choices without our even knowing that it 's happened .
we can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or un@@ detec@@ table , but the constraints that it imposes on us do not become any less potent .
the first one is personal to you .
and I 'm sure many people in the room are won@@ dering the same question .
in France , voter turnout hit a record low .
that was the lowest turnout the city had seen in 100 years .
this is where over 70,000 of the city 's poorest residents live .
instead , countries where urbanization has already pe@@ aked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy .
so how do we start building cities that make us care ?
we need a participation revolution , and we need it fast .
in other Brazilian cities , those systems have helped solve up to 80 percent of missing persons cases .
Le@@ and@@ ro started a campaign using one of our tools , the Pressure Co@@ ok@@ er , the same one that B@@ ia and J@@ ov@@ ita used , and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve .
diar@@ rhe@@ a and pneum@@ onia are among the top two kill@@ ers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases is@@ n 't some smart , new technological innovations .
actually , soap is available .
why is it that May@@ ank , this young boy that I met in India , is@@ n 't washing his hands ?
and when you think about this , you think about what is required to make hand@@ washing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
on October 15 , we will celebrate Global Hand@@ washing Day .
what 's required , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , creative thinking that drives advocacy .
I come from Mali , one of the world 's poorest countries .
almost a year ago , my a@@ unt started suffering back pa@@ ins .
we have 21st @@@ -@@ @ century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer , but we still have 20th @@@ -@@ @ century procedures and processes for diagnosis , if any .
however , the problem with micro@@ R@@ NA@@ s is that we CA@@ N@@ NOT use existing DNA @@@ -@@ @ based technology to detect them in a reliable way , because they are very short sequences of nucle@@ oti@@ des , much smaller than DNA .
we believe that we have found a way to do so , and this is the first time that we 've shown it in public .
then , if we take this specific pattern of micro@@ R@@ NA of this person 's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that cor@@ relates micro@@ R@@ NA patterns with a specific presence of a disease , this is how pan@@ cre@@ atic cancer looks like .
this entire platform is a working prototype .
and currently , we 're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Can@@ cer Research Center with 200 women for breast cancer .
you only need one mill@@ il@@ iter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools .
that is , at stage 3 or 4 , and I believe that is too late .
it not only costs us billions of dollars , but it also costs us the people we love .
however , I want fights like this to become very rare .
I had this company that I 'd spent 15 years building . it 's called Future ; it was a magazine publishing company .
fifteen years earlier , I was a science journalist who people just laugh@@ ed at when I said , " I really would like to start my own computer magazine . "
and what was really most exciting -- and I think Richard W@@ ur@@ man discovered this at least 20 years before I did -- was that all this stuff is connected .
you can ask what are the psychological causes of it : nature ? nurture ? current circumstance ?
you can view it as a computing problem , an artificial intelligence problem : do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly ?
are we the victims of a mass del@@ usion ?
it 's true .
number three : I do want to , if I can , find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit .
and then , fourthly : I want to mention the Sa@@ pling Foundation , which is the new owner of TED .
it only has four million citizens , and there are one million Syrian refugees living there .
I 'm reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq , and I met this girl , and I thought , " She 's beautiful , " and I went up to her and asked her , " Can I take your picture ? "
and she said yes , but she refused to smile .
you might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state .
with wars going on and on , the average time a refugee will spend in exile is 17 years .
but I 'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day .
and there are more and more victims .
how about a place of healing , of learning , and even opportunity ?
we should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people langu@@ ish waiting for the war to end .
I visited this camp .
she should be and she is the future of Somalia .
this is a blessing . "

there are many when low , who stop growing .
few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has , but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives .
it was an opportunity to emerge , to re@@ kin@@ dle life force , to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation .
turns out , it 's the wind .
now , the wind is obviously a natural phenomenon .
and you can see it 's a pretty rich and interesting list .
I 'm a big fan of being pregnant near free@@ ways , personally .
so as business@@ people , as consumers , as patients , as citizens , we have a responsibility , I think , to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills .
great , right ?
because of the coup d 'état , my family had to leave my native home of Ghana and move to the Gambia .
then at the age of 12 , my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe .
everything was different .
it had shat@@ tered into pieces .
but I also realized that making Africa great would require addressing this issue of leadership .
you see , all these countries I lived in , the cou@@ ps d 'état and the corruption I 'd seen in Ghana and Gambia and in Zimbabwe , contra@@ sted with the wonderful examples I had seen in Botswana and in South Africa of good leadership .
you become the president of the United States .
but if you become the president of Zimbabwe , and you say , " You know , I really like this job .
we 've had three generations of leaders , in my mind .
generation one are those who appeared in the ' 50s and ' 6@@ 0s .
the good news is that most of these leaders have moved on , and they were replaced by generation three .
they 've stopped the fighting , and I call them the stabil@@ izer generation .
the first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent .
in 2006 , Eric@@ k quit his job as a char@@ tered accoun@@ tant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat dro@@ pp@@ ings .
it 's spreading so quickly that it 's possible to imagine reaching billions of the world 's poor this way .
that 's what we 've started to do at Gi@@ ve@@ Direc@@ tly .
we 're the first organization dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor .
today , the logic behind aid is too often , well , we do at least some good .
I believe in aid .
this device consists of a large , round table and some machinery .
their brain does not s@@ los@@ h around like ours does .
three years , four years , still sm@@ elled pu@@ tri@@ d .
I am going to tell you about just a very few of the other medical @@@ -@@ @ related prizes we 've given .
keep in mind , we 've given 230 prizes .
one typical thing that happens is people will come from the high@@ lands , where there are not many co@@ con@@ ut trees , down to visit their relatives on the coast , where there are lots .
and then they wanted to be able to see , they needed light , so they 'd put in a light source , which in the 1950s was very hot .
thank you .
but they did@@ n 't test for curi@@ osity .
it 's about seeing what 's around that next coral head or what 's around that next tree , and learning more not only about our environment but about ourselves .
when we sw@@ am towards this after many mo@@ ons of torture and two years of preparation , this habitat waiting to invite us was like a new home .
it was@@ n 't about living at something the size of a school bus .
for us , it 's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone .
well , within that 31 days , we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers on each one of these topics .
it gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for 31 days and never normally would have paid attention to , such as her@@ mit cra@@ bs .
one of the most precious gifts that we had underwater is that we had WiFi , and for 31 days straight we were able to connect with the world in real time from the bottom of the sea and share all of these experiences .
and I dream of the day that we have underwater cities , and maybe , just maybe , if we push the boundaries of adventure and knowledge , and we share that knowledge with others out there , we can solve all sorts of problems .
my father , " How can people protect what they don 't understand ? "
you just have to learn how to look past their disgu@@ ise .
as animals blessed with the power of rational thought , we can mar@@ vel at the intr@@ ic@@ acies of life .
but as humans with hearts , we can all rejoice in the unity of life , and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave .
most people answer that there 's not enough information to tell .
Lin@@ da must be either married or not married - there are no other options .
being provided with these reliable statistics from a trusted official source made people more likely to accept the reality that the earth is warming .
and it 's not just that simple ; you can 't just throw money at this problem and think that it 's going to disappear .
and so in order for that to happen , we needed to get the village elders together , we needed to get the tribal leaders together , the religious leaders .
and I thought , if I 'm going to get involved in this thing , then they also need to agree that I preside over it .
and most importantly , the engagement was terminated and Nag@@ h@@ ma was free .
with every case that I take , I realize that as much as I 'm standing behind my clients , that they 're also standing behind me , and that 's what keeps me going .
Mat@@ t Ros@@ en@@ berg is a journalist in Afghanistan .
they burned her body .
in addition to this , we also decided to sue for civil damages , again using a law that 's never been used , but we used it for her case .
you give it a little tw@@ ist .
so this le@@ ash has some additional electronics .
and it was here that fate brought Frank into contact with a journalist and ge@@ ologist named Charles Mac@@ la@@ ren .
after the war 's end , Frank Cal@@ vert began to survey the site , but lacked the funds for a full excav@@ ation .
eager to find the ancient city , Sch@@ li@@ eman@@ n t@@ ore massive tren@@ ches all the way to the base of the hill .
but inside the m@@ ound was indeed evidence for a city that had thri@@ ved during the B@@ ron@@ ze Age , with char@@ red stone , broken ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads , and damaged human sk@@ elet@@ ons suggesting a violent end .
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fuel @@@ -@@ @ efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
so , what is the social result of this ?
this will apply to people across all of America .
you know it 's going to really transform how we feel about travel , and it will also , I think , enhance our freedom of mobility .
it 's when you charge a premium for people to drive on con@@ ge@@ sted roads .
K@@ en Liv@@ ing@@ stone was re@@ elected .
we 've tri@@ pled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982 .
how do we create a big network ?
" where did you do it ? " " in his car . "
we could have a coast @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ coast , free wireless communication system .
maybe we should use a good one . when are we going to do it ?
what is the point ?
what you can do with that tool : we can create an economic engine .
you should be immune .
like , maybe I should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket , because I 'm on the force .
so now you know .
the only reason I did not kill him with my bare hands was because I could not lift my right arm .
" this means you 're going to be wearing the pink ri@@ b@@ bon and the pink t @@@ -@@ @ shirt and the head@@ band and the ear@@ rings and the brac@@ el@@ et and the pan@@ ties . "
Don 't let it claim you .
many years ago , I had a patient , just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff , and so it was something of a shock to us to realize that he had no friends .
he lived by himself , he would come in for chem@@ otherapy by himself , he would receive his treatment , and then he 'd walk home alone .
it could be a recent one , or it could be one that you 've been carrying around for a really long time .
what it means today may not be what it means a year from now , or 10 years from now .
but we all know that with any resurrection story , you have to die first .
we have to let that cruci@@ fied self die so that a new self , a tru@@ er self , is born .
so as part of this campaign , he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good G@@ and@@ hi@@ an organizer would use .
but then he decides , " Let me t@@ weak my tactics a little bit . "
so a note for a dating tip here , in some cultures , if you want to please your lover , you call them and hang up . ( la@@ ughter ) So why do people leave missed calls ?
well , the reason of course is that they 're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts .
so when Haz@@ are asked people to leave him a missed call , let 's have a little guess how many people actually did this ?
thirty @@@ -@@ @ five million .
so this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history .
I hope you see the resem@@ bl@@ ance .
and so , I went on to discover some better tools .
so what 's the moral of this story ?
this is Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without ow@@ ning a single square foot of real estate .
let 's look a little bit at this .
old power is held by a few .
new power is not inherently positive .
it 's absolutely about that beautiful , perfect thing des@@ cending upon us in perfection .
it 's extraordinary .
I think they 'd make good allies .
that guy could teach it .
a lot of people who work there are members at my courts .
about 12 years ago , I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place .
they are in issues that I 'm passionate about : gun control and drug policy .
Brazil is also one of the world 's largest consumers of drugs , and the War on Drugs has been especially painful here .
this high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies .
but even worse , it also generated massive negative unintended consequences .
third lesson : use data to drive your argument .
thank you .
" ye@@ ah , right , if he do@@ es@@ n 't do that , he 's going to get killed . "
you can see the pictures here . I 'll show you a couple .
and then we decided to work with society .
so this evolutionary foil safeguards the plant against these rather cu@@ te animals , and protects it and of course ensures its survival .
but the harsh reality is that this particular plant is in fact considered to be vulnerable in its natural habitat .
so who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide to reveal all its secrets .
Africa is the continent which is getting younger , and whenever one talks about population explosion , one talks about the issue of food security as being the other side of the same coin .
there 's one from Africa , one from Australia , and six are endemic to the island of Madagascar .
and this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world , they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food .
why should we , especially if you can afford it ?
so we asked ourselves : does the typical office building help us in that sense ?
we just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares , outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building .
you don 't require sophisticated programming .
you may know that Chile , in 2010 , was hit by an 8.8 Rich@@ ter scale earthquake and tsunami , and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the Constitu@@ ci@@ ón , in the southern part of the country .
as in the housing process , we had to include the community in the way of finding a solution for this , and we started a participatory design process .
go to the Open House and express your options .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ five fishermen work for me .
it is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question .
so we thought that we had to produce a third alternative , and our approach was against geographical threats , have geographical answers .
but Vil@@ a Cru@@ ze@@ iro is also the place where our story begins .
so what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands , without a master plan and like a giant work in progress .
also the same color as the prison cell .
they were hired , and then they were trained as pa@@ inters , and together they transformed their own neighborhood , the whole street , into a giant pat@@ ch@@ work of color .
( appl@@ ause ) And at the end , the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment .
J@@ K : so now we had painted a whole street .
he 's a very demanding person .
-- that 's why when we 're talking about sustainability , it 's not enough , green buildings .
if you cut two zer@@ os , it 's much better .
some people , especially in Latin America , think it 's not really about drugs .
I got a security clearance .
well , in Latin America , they 'd say to me , " You can 't really cut off the supply .
the answer lies over there , in cutting off supply and demand . "
it 's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform .
that 's my drug education man@@ tra : safety first .
thank you .
is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this issue in the next five years ?
of course , these are extreme examples .
it do@@ es@@ n 't have to be a moment of shame and embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment , as it used to be in the past .
it is an opportunity to share lessons learned and build em@@ pa@@ thy .
( appl@@ ause ) The idea is that when the new regulation comes into force , entrepreneurs will be able to close their businesses in an online procedure that is faster and inexpensive .
for instance , when my social enterprise died , the worst part was that I had to go back to the indigenous community and tell the women that the business had failed and it was my fault .
for some people this could be seen like a great learning opportunity for me , but the truth is that the closure of this business represented much more than that .
and I want to propose a new man@@ tra : fail mind@@ fully .
when a firm dies , some people will lose their jobs .
how , maybe , is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema ?
and actually , why do we record ?
from Pho@@ eni@@ x playing by the E@@ i@@ ff@@ el Tower to Tom Jones in his hotel room in New York .
by living in such a way , by working without any structure , I was able to react to the moment and to decide , oh , this is important to make now .
I just want to represent them in a beautiful light .
I was research@@ ing . I was still keeping this idea in mind : what 's the point ?
maybe a few more extracts now .
from j@@ ath@@ il@@ an , a popular tr@@ ance ritual on the island of Java , to Um@@ ban@@ da in the north of Brazil .
I really believe cinema teaches us to see .
you walk into sacred rit@@ uals , private moments in a village , a town , a group of people .
V@@ M : " H@@ í@@ bri@@ dos " is - I really believe Brazil , far from the clic@@ hes , is the greatest religious country in the world , the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experi@@ mentations in spirit@@ u@@ alities .
V@@ M : I 'll just make it very short .
so they gave Albert Alexander , this Oxford policeman , the drug , and within 24 hours , he started getting better .
day five , they ran out of pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , and the poor man died .
this is serious .
we have drug discovery processes , screening molecules , we have clinical trials , and then , when we think we have a drug , then we have the FDA regulatory process .
we 've got to slow the pace of co@@ evolution down , and there are ideas that we can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well .
well , turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibio@@ tic would really work , so that could include improving hospital infection control or vacc@@ inating people , particularly against the seasonal influenza .
and certainly consumer education works .
now , there 's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well .
that price is also a signal that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies , in the same way that gasoline prices are a signal and an impetus , to , say , the development of electric cars .
thousands of patients are dying because the second @@@ -@@ @ line drugs are so expensive , and in some instances , even those don 't work and you have X@@ DR TB .
viruses are becoming resistant .
right now , much of the world depends on one drug , ar@@ tem@@ isin@@ in drugs , essentially to treat malaria .
resistance to ar@@ tem@@ isin@@ in has already emerged , and if this were to become widespread , that puts at risk the single drug that we have to treat malaria around the world in a way that 's currently safe and effic@@ acious .
now , I did@@ n 't know if this was a good or bad thing , but then came the response : " too bad it was@@ n 't a real bomb . "
now , imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle , 2,000 miles away , to find their son in a com@@ a .
let me ask you differently : if hiding is@@ n 't the answer , what if we did the opposite ?
" but this is not what she wants , " I said , " and we have documents . "
how would you have liked to grow up without your mother ? "
that openness , that trust , is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavi@@ oral model of disease .
his name was Simon Kuz@@ nets and the report that he delivered was called " National Income , 1929 @@@ -@@ @ 1932 . "
and you 're absolutely right .
it 's dry as a bone .

and because Kuz@@ nets ' invention was found to be so useful , it spread around the world .
it 's in the introductory chapter .
it can 't count happiness or community .
am I safe ?
but I believe that we 're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution .
it 's a whole new way of looking at the world .
not indicators of effort or intention , but real achievement .
( appl@@ ause ) Well done ! never been ; must go .
my country , the United Kingdom , is sort of mid@@ dling , sort of d@@ ull , but who ca@@ res - at least we beat the French .
( la@@ ughter ) And then looking at the emerging economies , top of the BRICS , pleased to say , is Brazil .
so this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress .
and with more and more of the world 's population living on this part of the curve , it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development .
and look , Brazil 's above the line .
but that is only half a plan .
what you really want is for Brazil to get ever more efficient at creating social progress from its GDP , so it becomes more like New Zealand .
imagine if we could work together - government , business , civil society , me , you - and make this century the century of social progress .
thank you .
you 'd follow that guy back to his cu@@ bic@@ le and you 'd say , " Why my chair ? "
( la@@ ughter ) Every day , we allow our co@@ workers , who are otherwise very , very nice people , to steal from us .

people tend to diag@@ nose au@@ tism with really specific check @@@ -@@ @ box descriptions , but in reality , it 's a whole variation as to what we 're like .
but I love to talk .
this gives me so much energy , and I 've got to have an outlet for all that energy .
but that 's fine with me , because it sorts the wheat from the cha@@ ff , and I can find which people are genuine and true and I can pick these people as my friends .
thank you .
I said , " S@@ ure , we 'll come in . "
but then our leader , Pe@@ te , set the vision , and talked to us just like we were his new team .
we 're going to move the needle , and I 'm going to get it in front of philanthro@@ pi@@ sts like Bill G@@ ates . "
so at the end of their talk , the panel , they had questions and answers , and boom , my hand went right up , and I get the microphone , and I look at them and I say , " Than@@ k you .
and not only that , where 's the f@@ lip chart with the action items and the follow @@@ -@@ @ up and the accountability ?
and then I turned around and there was about 200 pairs of eyes just st@@ aring at me .
two and a half years ago , Pe@@ te was hitting home runs at bas@@ eball fields .
he can 't hold his head up any longer .
and it was very significant , because he wrote it using his eye gaz@@ e technology .
so week one , Boston media .
week two , national media .
it was interesting .
they had a clinical trial for a drug that they 've been developing .
( appl@@ ause ) And YouTube has reported that over 150 countries have posted Ice Buc@@ ket Challenges for AL@@ S .
all she said was , " Ja@@ w @@@ -@@ @ dropping . "
because the night Pe@@ te was diagnosed , he told us that he was going to get AL@@ S in front of philanthro@@ pi@@ sts like Bill G@@ ates , and he did it .
would any of you blame me if I just was in the fe@@ tal position and pulled the covers over my head every day ?
the second thing I want to leave you with is the person at the middle of the challenge has to be willing to have the mental tough@@ ness to put themselves out there .
because he wants them to see what the reality of this is , and how he 's never , ever going to give up .
I 'm going to save my son , and if it do@@ es@@ n 't happen in time for him , I 'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what I 'm going through .
so now , everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells .
but it actually turns out that your cells sit in this m@@ esh of complicated fi@@ bers , proteins and sug@@ ars known as the extrac@@ ell@@ ular matrix .
and it actually turns out that the extrac@@ ell@@ ular matrix is different from every single part of the body .
now , all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants , and different animals call them home .
you see , I 've been thinking about this a lot .
violence is mig@@ rating to the me@@ tropol@@ e .
Manuel E@@ is@@ ner and others have shown that for centuries , we 've seen this incredible drop in murder , especially in the West .
what 's more , violence is moving south , to Latin America and the Caribbean , to parts of Central and Southern Africa , and to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia .
so urban geograph@@ ers and demo@@ graph@@ ers , they tell us that it 's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predic@@ ts violence , no .
I call this tur@@ bo @@@ -@@ @ urbanization , and it 's one of the key drivers of fragility .
the Big Apple , it took 150 years to get to eight million people .
it 's a function of reductions in child mortality rates .
now , it 's not just youth that necessarily predic@@ ts violence .
right here in Brazil , the life expectancy is 7@@ 3.6 years .
but if you 're young , you 're un@@ educated , you lack employment , you 're black , and you 're male , your life expectancy drops to less than 60 years old .
there 's a reason why you@@ th@@ fulness and violence are the number one kill@@ ers in this country .
after all , cities are hubs of innovation , dynamism , prosperity , excitement , connectivity .
and this explosion , the Internet , and mobile technology , means that the digital divide separating the North and the South between countries and within them , is shrinking .
in Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez in Mexico , where I 've been working , groups like the Zetas and the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel are hij@@ acking social media .
violence is going virtual .
so this is just a partial sketch of a fast @@@ -@@ @ moving and dynamic and complex situation .
we can 't only focus on those cities that work , the Sing@@ apo@@ res , the Kuala Lum@@ pur@@ s , the Du@@ ba@@ is , the Shang@@ ha@@ is .
one way to do this might be to start tw@@ inning our fragile cities with our healthier and we@@ alth@@ ier ones , k@@ ick@@ starting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices , of what works and what do@@ es@@ n 't .
we have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children , our youngest children , and val@@ or@@ ize them , not stig@@ mati@@ ze them .
if I have one single message for you , it 's this : there is nothing inevitable about lethal violence , and we can make our cities safer .
fol@@ ks , we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop hom@@ ic@@ idal violence in half within our lifetime .
and that tool is very simply , as Chris suggested , looking at us and the world from the plants ' or the animals ' point of view .
it 's not my idea , other people have hit on it , but I 've tried to take it to some new places .
and suddenly mo@@ wing the la@@ wn that day was a completely different experience .
but then I realized , " No , this is exactly what the gra@@ s@@ ses want us to do .
I 'm a du@@ pe . I 'm a du@@ pe of the law@@ ns , whose goal in life is to out@@ compete the trees , who they compete with for sunlight . "
now , the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conce@@ it -- is what does it get us ?
so what plants have -- while we have consciousness , tool making , language , they have bio@@ chemistry .
and that is this : the farm is called Poly@@ face , which means ...
the idea is he 's got six different species of animals , as well as some plants , growing in this very elaborate sym@@ bio@@ tic arrangement .
it 's a very elaborate and beautiful dance , but I 'm going to just give you a close @@@ -@@ @ up on one piece of it , and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chick@@ ens , his laying hen@@ s .
and I 'll show you , if you take this approach , what you get , OK ?
the E@@ gg@@ mobile is a very ric@@ ke@@ ty contra@@ ption -- it looks like a pra@@ i@@ rie scho@@ oner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chick@@ ens .
so the chick@@ ens do their kind of little break@@ dance and they 're pushing around the manure to get at the g@@ ru@@ bs , and in the process they 're spreading the manure out .
but look at it from the point of view of the grass , now .
how could it be that when I look at a person , an object , or an event , I see something very different than somebody else does ?
across the world , people are struggling to manage their weight , and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off .
but before they did that , we asked them to estimate the distance to the finish line .
but so too can our mind .
how far away was the finish line ?
here 's a photograph of a beautiful street in Stockholm , with two cars .
the car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front .
we all see the world through our mind 's eye , but we can teach ourselves to see it differently .
thank you .
who would you rather be treated by ?
hyper@@ tension causes over 10 percent of all deaths on the planet every day .
the biggest an@@ te@@ ater in the world lives in the rain forest , tips the scale at 90 pounds .
the gol@@ i@@ ath bird @@@ -@@ @ eating spi@@ der is the world 's largest spi@@ der .
these are the people who know nature best .
these are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature .
here 's why .
from the N@@ uk@@ ak lands , I want to take you to the southwest , to the most spectacular landscape in the world : Chi@@ ri@@ bi@@ qu@@ ete National Park .
it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues , it has now expanded .
no scientist has been at@@ op them .
in fact , nobody has been at@@ op the Bell Mountain since Sch@@ ul@@ tes in ' 43 .
let me show you what it looks like today .
we see illegal logging coming from the south , and drug run@@ ners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil .
and if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry , here 's why .
this is their perception of why you shou@@ ld@@ n 't m@@ ess with un@@ contacted Indians .
these are Indians again on the Peru border , who were over@@ flown by flights sponsored by mission@@ aries .
so the question is , in conclusion , is what the future holds .
the youth can beat you .
[ " party youth militia " ] Some have died because they rebel@@ led .
Mary and her friends forced the ruling political party not to use violence during the election , and saved hundreds of lives .
I would like to share with you two clips from this project .
both of them were broadcast in Israel , and it created a massive debate .
and I have to warn you , some of you might find them quite explicit .
the m@@ asked men you will see in the first clips are Jewish settlers .
the guy in green is Palestinian .
more or less around the same time , I 'm approached by a great guy named U@@ ri Fru@@ ch@@ t@@ mann .
security has to be the priority .
this is a much more powerful and much , much more effective weapon .
so you can imagine that 's a transition that h@@ as@@ n 't been entirely seamless .
one of the interesting side effects seems to be that my short @@@ -@@ @ term memory is entirely shot .
so I 've had to write some notes to avoid too much gr@@ unting and swe@@ aring in the next 17 minutes .
it was a journey , an expedition in Antarctica , the col@@ dest , w@@ indi@@ est , dri@@ est and highest altitude continent on Earth .
it 's twice the size of Australia , a continent that is the same size as China and India put together .
Scot@@ t 's last expedition , the Ter@@ ra Nova Ex@@ pe@@ dition in 1910 , started as a giant siege @@@ -@@ @ style approach .
Scot@@ t 's team ended up on foot .
how come this has remained the high @@@ -@@ @ water mark ?
no one 's come close to that ever since .
you 've heard that the average American spends 90 percent of their time indo@@ ors .
and we blog@@ ged live every evening from the tent via a laptop and a custom @@@ -@@ @ made satellite transmit@@ ter , all of which were solar @@@ -@@ @ powered : we had a flexible photo@@ volta@@ ic panel over the tent .
we traveled up and down one of the largest and most dangerous gl@@ aci@@ ers in the world , the B@@ ear@@ d@@ more gl@@ ac@@ ier .
it 's 110 miles long ; most of its surface is what 's called blue ice .
you can see it 's a beautiful , sh@@ immer@@ ing steel @@@ -@@ @ hard blue surface covered with thousands and thousands of cre@@ v@@ asses , these deep cracks in the gl@@ ac@@ ial ice up to 200 feet deep .
planes can 't land here , so we were at the most risk , technically , when we had the s@@ lim@@ m@@ est chance of being rescu@@ ed .
there 's a permanent American base , the A@@ mun@@ d@@ sen @@@ -@@ @ Scot@@ t South Pole Station at the South Pole .
but there is also a pole at the South Pole , and we got there on foot , un@@ assisted , un@@ supported , by the hardest route , 900 miles in record time , dra@@ gging more weight than anyone in history .
and if we 'd stopped there and flown home , which would have been the emin@@ ently sensible thing to do , then my talk would end here and it would end something like this .
high on the Antarctic plat@@ eau , over 10,000 feet , it 's very win@@ dy , very cold , very dry , we were exhausted .
Tar@@ ka took this photo of me one evening after I 'd nearly passed out with hypo@@ therm@@ ia .
we both had repeated b@@ outs of hypo@@ therm@@ ia , something I had@@ n 't experienced before , and it was very hum@@ bling indeed .
you become utterly in@@ capac@@ itated .
it 's like being a drunk to@@ dd@@ ler .
it was a peculiar , peculiar feeling , and a real surprise to me to be de@@ bil@@ itated to that degree .
I 've put on 30 pounds in the last three weeks .
I don 't regret calling for that plane for a second , because I 'm still standing here alive , with all digits intact , telling this story .
they needed repairing almost every hour .
there 's something in that .
right now , I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel bu@@ ffe@@ ts .
the hospital 's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day .
so before I show you the rest of the world , what does this mean for Germany ?
eight million people are missing , which is more than 20 percent of our current workforce , so big numbers , really big numbers .
let 's take Germany again .
sixteen years later , you 'd probably say the opposite .
yes and no .
in 1980 , less than 10 percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts .
in 1980 , no one had the s@@ ligh@@ test clu@@ e that such a job would ever exist .
as a matter of fact , the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades , in spite of robots and automation .
yes , technology will replace a lot of jobs , but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon , and that means technology will worsen our overall skill mis@@ match .
and this kind of de @@@ -@@ @ averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses .
so people , high @@@ -@@ @ skilled people , talents , will be the big thing in the next decade .
are@@ n 't we all looking for recognition in our jobs ?
every company , but also every country , needs a people strategy , and to act on it immediately , and such a people strategy consists of four parts .
I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
you know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
some pl@@ uck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
they may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
some physicians can be real sno@@ bs about doctors who are not M.@@ D. ' s .
what I was witnessing was not only news , but also history .
with this realization , I was free from the photo@@ journ@@ alistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine .
there were lines of bodies laid in the street .
and there was blood all over the pa@@ vements .
the following day , President Yanu@@ kov@@ ych fled Ukraine .
many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead .
and the color of their pa@@ st@@ el co@@ ats , their sh@@ in@@ y hand@@ bags , and the bun@@ ches of red car@@ nations , white t@@ uli@@ ps and yellow ro@@ ses that they carried j@@ ar@@ red with the black@@ ened square and the black@@ ened men who were enc@@ am@@ ped there .
we brought it on air in November 2009 .
why stop at 436 when you can expand that to 8,@@ 0@@ 40 , minute by minute , and do the ic@@ onic journey in Norway , the coastal ship journey Hur@@ ti@@ g@@ ru@@ ten from Ber@@ gen to Kir@@ ken@@ es , almost 3,000 kilometers , covering most of our coast .
so being on a ship , it 's not the first time .
what do you want us to film ? how do you want this to look ?
it 's the other strong memory .
they made all the stories .
we turned it into a complete TV control room .
it 's 14 hours of bir@@ d@@ watching on a TV screen , actually 87 days on the web .
and get this , almost 20 percent of the Norwegian population tun@@ ed in , 20 percent .
so on our next project , we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a swe@@ ater , and J@@ im@@ my Kim@@ mel in the AB@@ C show , he liked that .
some of you start won@@ dering , is the farmer at home ?
one of the key technologies driving mass location tracking is the inno@@ cu@@ ous @@@ -@@ @ s@@ ounding Automatic License Pl@@ ate Reader .
sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don 't understand what it is I 'm drawing .
well , I went to Rho@@ de Island School of Design in the second half of the ' 6@@ 0s to study architecture .
I was lucky enough to spend my last year , my fifth year , in Rome as a student . it changed my life .
I 've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years .
part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organ@@ ically .
so I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick .
they bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint I@@ vo , that little spiral structure you see there .
she continues on her way over Pi@@ az@@ za Nav@@ ona .
they continue without their tabl@@ ec@@ lo@@ th , looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch .
the phone rings anyway , he 's called to the pal@@ az@@ zo .
he 's actually in television repair , which is why people know him .
adap@@ tations all get buried under the st@@ uc@@ co .
I could pe@@ el out a page of this pal@@ az@@ zo to show you what 's going on inside of it .
if it was a hom@@ ing pig@@ eon , it would be called " Hom@@ er 's O@@ dys@@ sey . "
so it 's a homeless pig@@ eon now and it 's going to have to find another place to live , and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things , and we start with the tall ones and so on .
so I kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pig@@ e@@ ons .
( la@@ ughter ) . that 's really going to go a long way .
past the Py@@ ra@@ mid of C@@ esti@@ us -- these will seem very familiar to you , even if you haven 't been to Rome recently -- past the g@@ ate@@ house .
and if you want the information , so that we complete this cycle of understanding , all you have to do is read these paragraphs .
thank you very much .
today , I want to show you a new kind of map .
so if we 're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more in@@ tractable problems , we need to start to think about diversity in a new way .
because I do this work every day , and I see all my bi@@ ases . "
seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white .
you know , one of the things that you probably are thinking about , and you 're probably like , you know what , I 'm just going to double down on my color blind@@ ness .
it 's a false ideal .
so in fact , what the scientists are telling us is , no way .
please , please , just get out of denial and go looking for dis@@ confirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong .
and I saw this person across the street , and I was thinking , " Oh great , black guy . "
the guy across the street , he was a black guy .
I 'm saying , just do an inventory , expand your social and professional circles .
who 's in your circle ?
you start to say things like , " Gran@@ d@@ ma 's a big@@ ot . "
and you know , we love Gran@@ d@@ ma and we love Un@@ cle Jo@@ e . we do .
and we 've got to be willing to not shelter our children from the ug@@ liness of racism when black parents don 't have the luxury to do so , especially those who have young black sons .
they are incredible scientists and artists and writers .
Bra@@ hu@@ i , or Bro@@ hi , means mountain dwel@@ ler , and it is also my language .
but then , living in two extre@@ mes between the traditions of my culture , of my village , and then modern education in my school was@@ n 't easy .
while going to school in Kar@@ achi and Hy@@ der@@ abad , a lot of my cou@@ sins and childhood friends were getting married off , some to older men , some in exchange , some even as second wives .
honor killings is a custom where men and women are suspected of having relationships before or outside of the marriage , and they 're killed by their family for it .
we know that it 's music , language , and embro@@ i@@ dery .
these women you see here , they have strong skills and potential to be leaders .
we live between , still , Kar@@ achi and B@@ alo@@ ch@@ istan .
are there issues there ?
KB : this question has come to me a lot of times before , and I feel like the word " fear " just comes to me and then drops , but there is one fear that I have that is different from that .

today I want to talk to you about the mathematics of love .
now , I think that we can all agree that mathemati@@ cians are fam@@ ously excellent at finding love .
and it also gives Peter a 1 in 28@@ 5,000 chance of bum@@ ping into any one of these special ladies on a given night out .
because I believe that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of looking at almost anything .
( la@@ ughter ) Let me show you how this works .
so Por@@ tia 's scores would all be clu@@ stered around the four because everybody agrees that she 's very beautiful , whereas Sarah Jes@@ sica Par@@ ker completely divides opinion .
that 's much better than everybody just thinking that you 're the cu@@ te girl next door .
( la@@ ughter ) than everybody that you 've seen before .
( la@@ ughter ) OK , so this method do@@ es@@ n 't give you a 100 percent success rate , but there 's no other possible strategy that can do any better .
now , I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce , apart from , I don 't know , Pi@@ ers M@@ organ 's wife , maybe ?
where couples let things go and only brought things up if they really were a big deal .
now of course , it takes a bit more than just a low neg@@ ativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship .
so in the following week , I was back in the streets , but that time , I was@@ n 't a member of any media outlet anymore .
we were not planning to make money out of this , which was wise , because you shou@@ ld@@ n 't try to make money out of journalism now .
they were against the bus fare hi@@ ke that had just happened in the city .
it 's written there , " The@@ ft . "
but it was@@ n 't about the bus fare hi@@ ke anymore .
it was about everything .
we are not using big cameras .
and that turned M@@ í@@ dia N@@ IN@@ J@@ A into something else , more than a media outlet , than a media project .
and that also turned M@@ í@@ dia N@@ IN@@ J@@ A very soon to be seen as almost an enemy of c@@ ops , unfortunately , and we started to be severely beaten , and eventually arrested on the streets .
but that was also useful , because we were still at the web , so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country .
perhaps the first big success of machine learning commercially was Google .
since that time , there have been many commercial successes of machine learning .
deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works , and as a result it 's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do .
the New York Times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which I 'm going to show you now .
( in Chinese ) ( Appl@@ ause ) There 's much work to be done in this area .
it 's not often , actually , at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous appl@@ ause , although of course sometimes at TE@@ D@@ x conferences , feel free .
since that time , a lot has happened .
the similar images actually have similar backgrounds , similar directions of the faces , even some with their tongue out .
complex , nu@@ an@@ ced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms .
as you can see here , this Stan@@ ford @@@ -@@ @ based system showing the red do@@ t at the top has fig@@ ured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment .
deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things .
this algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people , none of whom speak or understand any Chinese .
each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures .
in each of those two cases , they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts , but as of last year , we 're now beyond that too .
so these images are entirely un@@ lab@@ eled , so I have to start from scratch .
with our deep learning algorithm , it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images .
and at this point , we can start to quite quickly grab whole big sections , check through them to make sure that there 's no mistakes .
the problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over 80 percent of employment .
well , not really .
so if you think , oh , it 's all happened before , we 've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs , what are these new jobs going to be ?
but in five years ' time , computers will be off this chart .
I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate , and if they did@@ n 't pass a course , they got the grade " Not Y@@ et . "
some of them reacted in a sh@@ ock@@ ingly positive way .
in another study , after a failure , they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves .
on the left , you see the fixed @@@ -@@ @ mind@@ set students .
in one year , fourth @@@ -@@ @ grade students in the South B@@ ron@@ x , way behind , became the number one fourth @@@ -@@ @ grade class in the state of New York on the state math test .

it was supposed to be for a photo shoot that was going to take place on the steps where the veterans were at that time .
but on luck -- I have to say , the photo shoot we did might not have worked out so well .
so over the past few centuries , micro@@ sc@@ opes have revolu@@ tion@@ ized our world .
when we look at this video of Ste@@ ve here , it appears to us like a static picture , but once we look at this video through our new , special micro@@ scope , suddenly we see a completely different image .
and we can do that not just to visu@@ alize the pulse , but also to actually recover our heart rates , and measure our heart rates .
( la@@ ughter ) And you know , presumably he 's wearing make@@ up , the lighting here is kind of challenging , but still , just from the video , we 're able to extract his pulse and show it quite well .
we basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded at every pix@@ el in the video over time , and then we c@@ rank up those changes .
so here I took the motions and I magn@@ ified them 30 times , and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing .
and ever since we discovered this new technology , we made our code available online so that others could use and experiment with it .
( la@@ ughter ) People have used it to magn@@ ify pul@@ sing ve@@ ins in their hands .
so as scientists , we started won@@ dering , what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure ?
those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them , which is how we hear and how we record sound .
we actually extract audio signals from video signals .
that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other .

in prison there are things that can 't be done .
in prison , you can 't dream . in prison , you can 't cry .
in order to write , they need to appropriate the moment of writing which is a moment of extraordinary freedom .
they want the bodies of their loved ones .
we 'll take that DNA and then we 'll compare it with the DNA of the families , of course .
the 300 means " executed " and the date means when they were executed .
now that 's going to come into play in a second .
that 's right , six as well .
his mother went to the river to wash clothes , and she left him with a neighbor .
or the children remain with their family and the child welfare system provides help and support .
so how can we fix it ?
they go out to the home , but before the children are removed , the case worker must come back to the office and present what they found .
in 2011 , 57 percent of the kids going into foster care were black .
on this particular day , she cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe her eyes .

so now in Brazil , we have this system , DE@@ TER , where every month , or every two months , we get information on where deforestation is happening so we can actually act when it 's happening .
so supermarkets , the sla@@ ugh@@ ter@@ houses , and so on that buy products from illegal clear @@@ -@@ @ cut areas , they also can be liable for the deforestation .
and also we work a lot on land tenure issues .
it 's very important for conflicts .
but it 's interesting to know that it 's quite the opposite .
now this is all good news , and it 's quite an achievement , and we obviously should be very proud about that .
so we can 't be satisfied , not even close to satisfied .
that 's our next step .
what we see here , those brown trees , these are really dead trees .
and so what we need to do is to be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person , per year , into something like one .
it 's such a big problem , so complex . can we really do it ?
we don 't need to clear @@@ -@@ @ cut all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy .
I guess you can call it a low @@@ -@@ @ fat factory .
actually , no .
this dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields , which is a great solution for California , which faces major water shortage .
how do they do that ?
now , I talked about fru@@ gal innovation , initially pione@@ ered in the South , now being adopted in the North .
literally , because you have to do@@ dge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi .
and yet more effective .
thank you very much .
ten thousand years ago , there were about five million human beings on Earth .
( la@@ ughter ) Un@@ fortunately , I heard the bil@@ lion@@ aire Ste@@ ve For@@ bes , on Fox News , saying exactly the same thing , but seriously .
if you have more consideration for others , you will have a caring economics , where finance is at the service of society and not society at the service of finance .
and first of all , does it exist , true al@@ tru@@ ism , or are we so sel@@ fish ?
he 's very kind .
so now , we love cooperation .
and then not only humans .
and look at those great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ mothers .
and of course we are sometimes sel@@ fish , and some people more than others .
but he found that systematically , no matter what , there 's a significant number of people who do behave al@@ tru@@ istically , no matter what .
so that 's good news .
( la@@ ughter ) But that 's not the end of it .
so what is al@@ tru@@ ism ?
with T@@ ania Sing@@ er at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute of Le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g , we showed that the brain networks for em@@ pa@@ thy and loving @@@ -@@ @ kindness are different .
it can be extended even to other species .
this is the first time I went after two and a half hours .
and then the result has been published in many scientific papers .
it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the al@@ tru@@ istic love .
before , you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class , their least favorite child , an unknown child , and the sick child , and they have to give stic@@ kers away .
now where do we go from there ?
we have 25,000 kids in school , four percent overhead .
so I will also go back to my her@@ mitage to find the inner resources to better serve others .
it started four years ago , when a friend and I opened our first Ram@@ adan fast at one of the bu@@ si@@ est mosques in New York City .
frustrated by this my@@ op@@ ic view , my friend and I had this crazy idea : let 's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of Ram@@ adan and share those stories on a blog .
what emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America .
and whenever I 'd go to the local but@@ cher to purchase some hal@@ al meat , something felt off .
for many , it is their first time inter@@ acting with Islam on such an intimate level .
it is simply because our communities are so dam@@ n unique and so dam@@ n beautiful .
thank you .
I 'm very worried today about this notion , this world , this prevailing kind of force of security .
people change us . nothing is secure .
you can 't open yourself to new experiences , new people , new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course .
you cl@@ ing to your land because it is your secure place .
you must fight anyone who encro@@ aches upon it .
one of the amazing things that I 've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species .
I venture there are many in this room .
and , I love this story so much .
they raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred .
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa , and I had no idea where I was .
I do not use them as weapons .
thank you very much .
on a typical day , do you wake up with hope or glo@@ om ?
when I start to pre@@ tend that what I 'm seeing is@@ n 't impacting me , and is@@ n 't changing my heart , then I get in trouble .
imagine that you 've been raped and you 're bringing up a boy child .
well , first of all , how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale ?
we need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomo@@ tion , and we need the sensors , power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi @@@ -@@ @ intelligent ant robot .
so I 'll start with mobility .
so these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water , for example .
the hard material here is silic@@ on , and the soft material is silic@@ one rubber .
this is actu@@ ated with a method that we call in my lab " graduate student with t@@ wee@@ zers . " ( la@@ ughter ) So what you 'll see in the next video is this guy doing amaz@@ ingly well for its jum@@ ps .
that 's almost 100 times its own length .
and it survi@@ ves , b@@ oun@@ ces on the table , it 's incredibly robust , and of course survi@@ ves quite well until we lose it because it 's very tiny .
we all move in this kind of b@@ oun@@ cy way when we run .
so this is a micro @@@ -@@ @ fabricated energetic material , and we can create tiny pixels of this , and we can put one of these pixels on the bel@@ ly of this robot , and this robot , then , is going to jump when it senses an increase in light .
and you 'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off , and the robot tum@@ bling through the air .
so there was that big flash , and you can see the robot jumping up through the air .
and there will be zer@@ oes in the positions corresponding to the numbers that are@@ n 't used .
turns out there can only be two - any more would require additional digits like 3 or 4 to count them .
and speaking of that , it 's time to find out what the leading digit is .
the safe sw@@ ings open , and inside you find ...
we do know it had lecture halls , classrooms , and , of course , shelves .
he invited scholars to live and study in Alexand@@ ria at his expense .
these efforts brought hundreds of thousands of books to Alexand@@ ria .
they made some ast@@ ounding discoveries .
I did@@ n 't follow along with the crowd .
but I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding .
so it is fitting and sc@@ ary that I have returned to this city 16 years later and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding .
the study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion programs , employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe conformity is critical to their long @@@ -@@ @ term career advancement .
how does her father feel ?
( la@@ ughter ) But that 's a different talk , and a different neuro@@ scientist needs to talk about that .
we had no ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ on , we had no patients , we had nothing done .
and that 's pric@@ eless .
but realizing later on how important were sanitation and the disposal of cra@@ p in a proper way , we went into the arena of sanitation .
and so you build these toilets and very often , we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses .
and they build a toilet and a bathing room .
this is in a village where most of the people are even illiterate .
so there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
but girls , it has gone to about 90 percent and boys , almost to 100 percent .
so this is a democracy in action because there is a general body , a governing board , the committee .
I was a young humanitarian aid worker , and I met this woman who was my age .
it 's a story about minerals and rape .
but today I want to tell you a different story .
well , the reason why militias had attacked Is@@ ab@@ elle 's village was because they wanted to take the land that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive .
the second central observation is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture .
when I was three , war broke out in Sierra Leone in 1991 .
the next day , I wo@@ ke up , bombs were dropping everywhere , and people were trying to kill me and my family .
she 's a wonderful , smart woman , that one , and we were lucky .
before we were meant to travel , my mom came home one day , and said , " We 're going on a little holiday , a little trip . "
I scre@@ amed , I cried , and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop , but all she did was say , " Be quiet . "
we settled and we liked it .
my mom then had this brilliant idea that I should go to a girls school because they were less racist .
I was a black angry woman . ( la@@ ughter ) Oh ye@@ ah .
I did it for your own good .
and I thought , her definition of empowerment was very strange . ( la@@ ughter ) That was the end of our first conversation .
I want to do that too -- " Oh ! Oh ! " and all of that .
did@@ n 't happen .
and I thought to myself , I had an inner jo@@ ke in my head that said , " I will marry a white man .
you have invaded me in the most sacred way .
I want to get hor@@ ny , dam@@ mit , as well . "
I said to her , " I feel like I 'm not a woman because of what was done to me .
when I started having my period around the age of 14 , I realized I did@@ n 't have normal periods because of FGM .
then I got married .
her children would have been flown over to Malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives .
do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that ?
the aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them , because every child has a right to pleasure .
can I borrow 7,500 dollars ? "
in fact , he was hurt and felt gan@@ ged @@@ -@@ @ up on .
this is what I call money shame .
money can no longer be a tabo@@ o topic .
letting go of the past happens through surrender , faith and forgiveness .
so try this : follow your dollars .
and then ask yourself : do I really value all this stuff ?
and get curious about what you 're feeling when you 're spending .
I call this your money auto@@ biography , and as a money coach , this is the first step I take with my clients .
were you excited , proud or confused ?
did you run with the can@@ dy store , or did you run to the bank ?
and she num@@ bed the pain with sugar and shopping .
so what did we do ?
I did the opposite .
Inter@@ passion , Inter@@ passion , Inter@@ passion .
are you from California ?
the hopes they righ@@ tfully raised are not really matched by what they were able to have as a result in the end .
now , I believe so .
they too use digital technology extensively , so that 's not it .
we had met in the afternoon , and he was already way over @@@ -@@ @ ca@@ ffe@@ inated .
modern representative democracies are being str@@ ang@@ led in many countries by powerful interests .
and politics and democracy without an effective challenge hob@@ bles , because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial .
now , some people have argued that the problem is today 's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before , and that is not true .
when our relatives die , we can 't take care of them as our tradition demands .
( appl@@ ause ) Now , this do@@ es@@ n 't mean that the job is done , obviously .
there 's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there .
but what we saw was something very different .
this caused not only problems , obviously , for the countries themselves , but also for the response .
and what we saw then was something also we had@@ n 't seen before .
the countries had to declare a state of emergency .
it was a very , very terri@@ fying situation .
we 've known the disease only for 40 years , since it first pop@@ ped up in Central Africa in 1976 .
but despite that , we do know many things : we know that this virus probably survi@@ ves in a type of a bat .
this is a very dangerous , de@@ bil@@ itating , and deadly disease .
there are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola .
but how different are men and women , really ?
in fact , the average man can throw a ball further than about 98 percent of all women .
but let 's have a look at the size of this difference .
it 's tiny ; the lines are so close together , they almost overlap .
it 's more a case of , if anything , Mars and S@@ nic@@ kers : basically the same , but one 's maybe slightly n@@ ut@@ tier than the other .
now , it is@@ n 't true per se that left @@@ -@@ @ handed people are more creative than right @@@ -@@ @ handed people .
there 's no suggestion that listening to Moz@@ art , or indeed Stephen King stories , is going to make you any s@@ mar@@ ter in the long run .
do you see it ? what 's common about these ?
so that 's the value of these things .
now , though this might seem tri@@ vial , it 's actually really important .
so stic@@ ky note systems are not only more fluid , they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings .
and then the group notes produce the most comprehensive models because we synthe@@ size several points of view .
and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes .
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
( flourish ... Be@@ ep ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Som@@ e@@ times I star@@ tle myself : I 'll forget that I have it on , and I 'll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like -- ( B@@ lip ) -- " Oh ! "
and there 'd be that sound in the signal -- it 's like ( Scre@@ ech@@ ing ) -- and he thought , " Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pit@@ ches in it . "
and so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the TH@@ E@@ RE@@ MI@@ N the way it is now .
so books really are alive .
so I think of the book as a body , and I think of the book as a technology .
( la@@ ughter ) And the thing that I 'm single @@@ -@@ @ minded about is racism .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) But for me , single @@@ -@@ @ min@@ de@@ dness is not just caring about something .
it 's not just thinking , it 's doing .
and then I started y@@ elling things .
it did@@ n 't seem particularly revolutionary , but what was different about it was , we also challenged Da@@ vid@@ son to say that if you don 't do this , we will question your commitment to diversity .
and since we spend one @@@ -@@ @ third of our lives at work , what if we did that with people who did@@ n 't look like us ?
because the data is already there .
For@@ bes 's best workplaces for diversity enjoy 24 percent higher revenue growth .
and if your name is Mol@@ ly or Con@@ nor , you 've got a 14 percent better chance of getting a call@@ back on your resume than if your name is Shan@@ ice or De@@ Sha@@ wn .
but there 's a catch .
that 's because the light scat@@ ters .
so we have to do something about the scat@@ ter so we can see the tumor .
it 's amazing .
so we 're going to put a hol@@ o@@ gram in front of this brain and make a stream of light come out of it .
seems impossible but it is@@ n 't .
but we treat this sk@@ ull with great respect at our lab and here at TED .
so we can go through sk@@ ull and bones and flesh with just red light .
Red light is all around us .
and the bare camera die ...
that means that spot focus -- full width half max -- is six to eight mic@@ r@@ ons .
no one has seen this before , we 're doing this for the first time here .
( la@@ ughter ) Just to give an idea -- like , that 's not just 50 mar@@ bles .
I 've spent a lot of time in one .
a system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost , higher resolution and smaller medical imaging .
so that 's what we 've started to do .
and the result is , we 're able to find tum@@ ors in this sample -- 70 mil@@ lime@@ ters deep , the light going in here , half a mil@@ lime@@ ter resolution , and that 's the tumor it found .
so .
there 's this other thing about hol@@ ography I haven 't told you yet , that you need to know .
and that way , spot by spot , we scan out the brain .
we 're doing that electronically with our chips , recording the image and dec@@ o@@ ding the information , in a mil@@ lion@@ th of a second .
our system may be extraordinary at finding blood .
here 's a be@@ aker of blood .
this is really key : blood absor@@ bs light , flesh scat@@ ters light .
this is significant , because every tumor bigger than a cubic mil@@ lime@@ ter or two has five times the amount of blood as normal flesh .
so with our system , you can imagine detecting can@@ cers early , when intervention is easy , or tracking the size of your tumor as it grows or shr@@ inks .
our system could enable this non@@ inv@@ a@@ sively .
compact , portable , inexpensive medical imaging can save countless lives .
and the answer is : the whole body 's in reach .
her name is A@@ IV@@ A , and she 's an artificial intelligence that has learned the art of music composition by reading over 30,000 scores of history 's greatest .
so here 's what one score looks like to the algorithm in a matrix @@@ -@@ @ like representation .
and in a way , this is kind of how we , humans , com@@ pose music , too .
and to do that , we show to the algorithm over 30 different category labels for each score in our database .
and that 's exactly what we did .
every year , millions of people die of diseases such as T.@@ B. , malaria , HIV , around the world and even in the United States .
now we know that there 's a lot of animals out there that can do it too .
and even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller bra@@ ins can use medication too .
the problem with infectious diseases , as we all know , is that path@@ ogens continue to evolve , and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy .
now , I think that we should look at these animals , and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases .
what they do is they produce spo@@ res , millions of spo@@ res on the outside of the bu@@ tter@@ fly that are shown as little spec@@ ks in between the scales of the bu@@ tter@@ fly .
and this is really detrimental to the mon@@ arch .
as part of my job , I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants , and the reason for this is that mon@@ archs are extremely pic@@ ky e@@ aters .
they only eat Mil@@ k@@ weed as lar@@ v@@ ae .
in fact , mon@@ archs can take up the chemicals , put it in their own bodies , and it makes them toxic against their pre@@ dat@@ ors , such as birds .
so then we moved on to adult bu@@ tter@@ flies , and we started asking the question whether it 's the mothers that can medic@@ ate their off@@ spring .
what we find is that the mon@@ archs strongly prefer the medicinal Mil@@ k@@ weed .
but what these experiments tell us is that these mon@@ archs , these mothers , can lay their eggs on medicinal Mil@@ k@@ weed that will make their future off@@ spring less sick .
now , we know that even today , most of our drugs derive from natural products , including plants , and in indigenous cultures , traditional heal@@ ers often look at animals to find new drugs .
the opposite of work is id@@ len@@ ess .
but very few of us know what to do with id@@ len@@ ess .
so we started this about 30 years ago , and we started dealing with this very issue .
can 't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you , some kind of work ?
that 's not how we do the rest of our lives .
so , come have your interviews .
what do they need to know ?
people are the only thing we have .
we 've come from an age of revolution , industrial revolution , an age of information , an age of knowledge , but we 're not any closer to the age of wisdom .
Don 't create a problem for us , for manufacturing , for application , then we have to buy new companies , we have to buy our competitors , we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many wid@@ gets .
the teacher 's role is entirely obsolete .
so there 's a place for music and literature , etc . , but also for grammar .
and then , they have the power , which means , they can and do suspend and expel kids so that we 're not playing school , they really decide .
and follow this all the time and we know how they 're doing and we say , you 're not interested in this now , let 's wait a year .
and so the courses are World Cup S@@ occer , or building a bicycle .
and the first time around , I saw these tom@@ b@@ stones and these wonderful people who 'd done great things and I thought , what do I want to be remembered for ?
one , it freed our five kids from following in our steps , our shadow -- They don 't know what I do .
( la@@ ughter ) Which is good .
( la@@ ughter ) The five kids know nothing , which is good .
but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon .
the second why , it starts getting difficult .
so you 've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system , there 's a dramatic increase in performance .
and I 'm afraid of the other one , which says , this is so good you 've got to do this .
we have variations of this one question , from three onwards .
that 's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture .
and the people that build things -- developers and governments -- they 're naturally afraid of innovation , and they 'd rather just use those forms that they know you 'll respond to .
that 's how we end up with buildings like this .
this is a nice building .
and we push and we push and we push until we completely alien@@ ate all of you .
we take Chi@@ p@@ pend@@ ale ar@@ mo@@ ires and we turned those into sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers , and sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers can be medieval ca@@ stles made out of glass .
( la@@ ughter ) We 're all hanging out in m@@ alls and we 're all moving to the suburbs , and out there , out in the suburbs , we can create our own architectural fan@@ ta@@ sies .
it means that robots are going to build our buildings , because we 're finally ready for the forms that they 're going to produce .
it means that a parking garage in Miami Beach , Florida , can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night .
it do@@ es@@ n 't matter how we build , it matters what we build .
and finally , we 're not on opposite sides anymore .
thank you .
when I was four years old , my grand@@ father and I were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost .
it was one of the sc@@ ari@@ est moments I 've ever experienced in my life , and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grand@@ father had Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's disease .
so once the patient steps onto the floor -- ( R@@ inging ) -- an alert is sent to the caregi@@ ver 's smartphone .
I became concerned about my own grand@@ parents and decided to inv@@ ent a smart bathroom system .
first , I had to create a we@@ arable sensor that was thin and flexible enough to be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient 's foot .
therefore , I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance .
I 've tested the device on my grand@@ father for about a year now , and it 's had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wan@@ dering .
at that time , there was no vaccine available against polio .
I know this because I read about it , because thanks to vaccines , my generation was lucky to not live through an epidemic as terrible as this .
after potable water , they are the interventions that have most reduced mortality , even more than antibiotics .
the spread will probably remain contained and a measles outbreak won 't happen .
this percentage is called the threshold .
we take care of ourselves a lot when affected by an illness , or in situations of imminent danger .
people would line up in pharmac@@ ies to get a vaccine , without even knowing if it was the right vaccine that would protect them against this new virus .
at that time , in addition to doing my fellowship at the Inf@@ ant Foundation , I worked as a home pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian for a pre@@ paid medicine company .
at that time , we set out to understand what was happening .
all health staff were dressed in NASA @@@ -@@ @ like bio @@@ -@@ @ safety suits .
so when mathemati@@ cians are asked what math is for , they tend to fall into two groups : 5@@ 4.@@ 51 percent of mathemati@@ cians will assume an attacking position , and 4@@ 4.@@ 77 percent of mathemati@@ cians will take a defensive position .
( la@@ ughter ) Har@@ dy , for instance , was a model of this type of attack .
he 's one of the defensive ones .
you need proof .
as may happen with the We@@ ai@@ re@@ -   P@@ hel@@ an structure .
but be careful , because this one really stands a chance that in a hundred or so years , or even if it 's in 1700 years , that someone proves it 's the best possible shape for the job .
within 20 years , side@@ walks have been torn apart by wee@@ ds and tree roots .

this style of s@@ ati@@ re was a consequence of the unrestricted democracy of 5th century Athens and is now called " Old Com@@ edy . "
the hero St@@ rep@@ si@@ ades enrol@@ ls in S@@ oc@@ rates 's new philosophical school , where he lear@@ ns how to prove that wrong is right and that a debt is not a debt .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es also became the master of the par@@ ab@@ asis , a com@@ ic technique where actors address the audience directly , often p@@ raising the play@@ w@@ right or making topical comments and jo@@ kes .
this voice does not repeat for six months .
and so , you know , it 's one of those things that you don 't take too seriously .
and I got to work and they took me somewhere down there , nine kilometers away from the town and the temple , and said , " That 's where we have chosen the location . "
the pilgri@@ ms come here by the hundreds of thousands -- they 're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there .
and as you come from the north , it is all mas@@ onry growing out of the sand cli@@ ffs as you come from the Him@@ al@@ ay@@ as and ev@@ oking the tradition of the fortress .
and I came back and , lo and behold , the little model I 'd left behind had been built ten times bigger for public display on site and ... the bridge was built !
and here you see the model : a reception building and some underground parking .
you cross a bridge , you enter this triangular room , 60 feet high , which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north .
and at night , just one line of light cuts through the mountain , which is a sky@@ light on top of that triangle .
and that was a lot of heat to deal with .
and then as you enter it again , looking in all directions towards the city .
and this is where it is ; it 's sort of evolving .

( la@@ ughter ) It is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological health .
we missed each other terri@@ bly , but international phone calls were really expensive then , and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week .

( la@@ ughter ) Our mind is hard to change once we become convinced .
I once worked with this woman who , after 20 years marriage and an extremely ug@@ ly divorce , was finally ready for her first date .
so she was very excited , she bought a new dress , and they met at an up@@ scale New York City bar for a drink .
shoc@@ king , right , that a friend could be so cruel ?
and it 's interesting that we do , because our self @@@ -@@ @ esteem is already hur@@ ting .
why ? because of poor emotional hygiene .
because we don 't prioritize our psychological health .
the problem is , the urge to r@@ umin@@ ate can feel really strong and really important , so it 's a difficult habit to stop .
his cancer was extremely aggressive .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't stop thinking about how much he was suffering , even though he never complained , not once .

but Z@@ en Budd@@ hi@@ sts practicing throughout China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question - why do we need an explanation ?
so to help practice living with these myster@@ ies , the med@@ itating monks used a collection of roughly 1,700 be@@ wil@@ dering and ambiguous philosophical thought experiments called k@@ ō@@ ans .
but unlike real @@@ -@@ @ world court cases , k@@ ō@@ ans were intentionally in@@ comprehensible .
since these are intentionally un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able , it would be mis@@ guided to try and deci@@ ph@@ er these stories ourselves .
ahead they see an attractive travel@@ er , unable to cross the m@@ ud@@ dy path .

but one popular reading suggests that despite never having physically carried the travel@@ er , E@@ kid@@ o broke mon@@ astic law by mentally " cl@@ inging to " the woman .
in addition to exploring ambiguity , k@@ ō@@ ans often ridic@@ ul@@ ed characters claiming total understanding of the world around them .
ok@@ ay . what kind of trauma am I talking about here ?
and then what they did was they correlated these AC@@ E scores against health outcomes .
it turns out this is exactly where the science comes in .
and so your heart starts to pound , Your pupils dil@@ ate , your air@@ ways open up , and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear .
ye@@ ah . that did not happen .
what I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement .
as an Arab female photographer , I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences .
the passion I developed for knowledge , which allowed me to break barriers towards a better life was the motivation for my project I Read I Writ@@ e .
only after explaining to them how their stories might influence other women 's lives , how they would become role models for their own community , did some agree .
seeking a collaborative and re@@ flexi@@ ve approach , I asked them to write their own words and ideas on prints of their own images .
months later , she was jo@@ king that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes , as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages .
I saw how she was l@@ onging to gain control over her simple daily routin@@ es , small details that we take for granted , from counting money at the market to helping her kids in home@@ work .
we did all kinds of research .
busy , busy work .
now , as you can imagine , it 's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people in a small space for a long time .
now , in this project , I 'm using a co@@ creation approach , which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many artists .
we always come up with these fantastic large @@@ -@@ @ scale s@@ cu@@ pl@@ tures that actually we can also in@@ habit .
here you can see aqu@@ ap@@ onic systems that are actually surrounding the astr@@ onau@@ ts , so they 're constantly in contact with part of the food that they 're eating .
by the end of my talk , one more patient will be added to this list .
how is our immune system capable of fighting off so many path@@ ogens but smart enough not to attack ourselves .
with very careful design and hundreds of trials , we successfully took out all the virus , broke the record .
more importantly , our studies showed that we could eliminate the possibility of this dangerous virus being transmitted into humans .
L@@ y : but we are working day and night trying to make this happen for the patients .
the novel chron@@ ic@@ les the fortun@@ es and mis@@ fortun@@ es of the Bu@@ end@@ ía family over seven generations .
the people down there love us because they know if they have an air@@ man who is coming in to rent one of their apartments , they 'll always get their money . "
he said , " So maybe this is what you should do .
if you noticed , in Mountain Home , there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place .
it did@@ n 't have a laundry facility .
so I called my wife , and I said , " We 're going to make this one work . "
when I walked inside , the lady was just finishing up one contract with some fol@@ ks , some other people were coming in behind me .
she said , " You know , I 'm really sorry , I just rented the last one .
the light came back on .
I have a couple that are tren@@ ding .
they 're almost there but not quite . ( la@@ ughter ) I have one who has been in college now for eight years .
( la@@ ughter ) He do@@ es@@ n 't have a degree yet , but he wants to be a com@@ edi@@ an .
so with that being the backdrop , I was sitting in my TV room watching TV , and they were talking about Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and all the h@@ ul@@ lab@@ alo@@ o that was going on .
for some reason , at that moment it just all hit me .
I said , " Yes , I did . "
we do everything we do , but it seems that driving while black , walking while black , talking while black , it 's just dangerous .
when stopped by the police , we place both hands on the steering wheel at the 12 o 'clock position .
he said , " And this is the piece that really bugs me : our white friends , our bud@@ dies , we kind of hang together .
how do I keep them safe ? how do I keep them alive ?
the second thing I do is this : I want to appeal to Americans .
for example , the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain .
the M@@ TA will boast how many miles of subway track there are .
in fact , in some ways there 's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city .
so you go and look at data like this , and instead of just counting the number of cab@@ s , we can start to ask different questions .
it actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request , or a FO@@ IL Request .
and we can do better than that as a city .
here is a map I made with the most dangerous inter@@ sections in New York City based on cycl@@ ist accidents .
so the red areas are more dangerous .
how many of you guys know this logo ?
it 's not the best use of our citizens ' time , and we as a city can do better than that .
our city budget is only readable right now in PDF form .
this is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years .
it 's on the other side .
we can standardize our addresses , and if we do , we can get more maps like this .
but then , a few weeks later , something incredible happened .
it 's not a disease or an ab@@ norm@@ ality , and it is@@ n 't necessarily tied to depression , anxiety , or self @@@ -@@ @ esteem .
I brought this with me , this was given to us by N@@ BC Dat@@ eline to test .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) But in science , we have to keep track of the mis@@ ses , not just the hits .
and it got it 50 percent of the time -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) which is exactly what you 'd expect with a coin @@@ -@@ @ f@@ lip model .
it 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
are UF@@ Os alien spac@@ es@@ hips , or percep@@ tual cognitive mistakes , or even f@@ akes ?
and this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .
and that , in fact , turns out to be true .
tree bar@@ k is particularly good because it 's nice and gra@@ in@@ y , bran@@ chy , black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white s@@ plo@@ t@@ chy and you can get the pattern @@@ -@@ @ seeking -- humans are pattern @@@ -@@ @ seeking animals .
( la@@ ughter ) It has that sort of pu@@ c@@ ke@@ red lips , 19@@ 4@@ 0s @@@ -@@ @ era look .
there was a lot of people there .
and in England , there 's a pop singer .
my name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya .
you sle@@ pt in the bush , but you kept going .
all of a sudden I passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya .
and just walking , I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States .
I got a scholarship to St. Law@@ rence University , Up@@ state New York ; finished that .
then I worked in DC a little bit : I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history .
we 're building dispens@@ aries across that constituency .
I 'm trying to develop hom@@ eg@@ ro@@ wn solutions to our issues because people from outside can come and help us , but if we don 't help ourselves , there 's nothing to do .
thank you very much .
no one else has the perfect answers for your life .
there 's no time to settle down .
yes , it may be hard to find talent .
and they were going up , and they finally made it to the peak .
life is about the journey .
we humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies , but we haven 't always been that good at fig@@ uring out what 's important .
and we 've just over the last few years found out that the micro@@ bes in different parts of the body are amaz@@ ingly different from one another .
what it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body makes more of a difference to your micro@@ b@@ ial ecology than hundreds of miles on Earth .
so how do they do all this stuff ?
is it our cells ?
we showed in a study a few years ago that you can actually match the palm of someone 's hand up to the computer mouse that they use routinely with up to 95 percent accuracy .
so just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the micro@@ bes you share , we can also match you up to your dog .
so babies that come out the regular way , all of their micro@@ bes are basically like the vag@@ inal community , whereas babies that are delivered by C @@@ -@@ @ section , all of their micro@@ bes instead look like skin .
now , for the first time , you 're going to see one of my colleague 's children develop micro@@ bi@@ ally .
so what we are going to look at is we 're going to look at this one baby 's sto@@ ol , the fec@@ al community , which represents the gu@@ t , sampled every week for almost two and a half years .
when we take the micro@@ bes from an ob@@ ese mouse and trans@@ plant them into a genetically normal mouse that 's been raised in a bubble with no micro@@ bes of its own , it becomes fat@@ ter than if it got them from a regular mouse .
this is one of the newest things we 've been able to visu@@ alize with colleagues at the University of Minnesota .
four of those patients are about to get a trans@@ plant from that healthy donor at the bottom , and what you can see is that immediately , you have this radical change in the gu@@ t community .
this is in 2010 in Uganda , working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dis@@ sent .
is their experience changed ?
you need access to the same phones , devices , connectivity , and even where you don 't , where you can find a proxy agent , usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate .
so what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud @@@ -@@ @ based library , what used to be considered such a basic part of education ?
and so there was a big movement to put all this information online , to track all the ownership of these plots of land , put them in the cloud , and give them to the communities .
this needs to change .
for example , this here is a big bird , a r@@ hin@@ oc@@ er@@ os hor@@ n@@ bill .
this is a family of gi@@ b@@ bons .
there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere .
it looks super high tech .
it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut .
I got an email on my phone .
in many ways , the ideas that gave birth to Google , Facebook , Twitter , and so many others , have now really transformed our lives , and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society .
so this year , as the web turns 25 , it 's very important for us to take a moment and think about the implications of this .
you would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper , then you would place it into a sealed envelope , and from there , you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it .
then , you also encry@@ pt the data as it sits on the server itself .
I think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community .
so to do this , we actually need a combination of technology and also design .
so the key challenge is to take Bob 's message and to get it to Al@@ ice in such a way that the server CA@@ N@@ NOT read that message .
it 's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward .
thank you .
Sir , you caught the gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
I have a playing card in my hand .
and my answer is : I think we stop thinking too soon .
not only that , but I will impose myself a time limit of one second , something that would look like this .
Hg : the king of sp@@ ades , indeed .
but what if we decided to search for those amazing things , for those small co@@ incid@@ ences in life that are truly amazing ?
audience member 3 : yes . Hg : yes ! perfect .
so even if nobody comes on@@ stage and switches the bill , I don 't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don 't want to see .
go ahead and take some cards and shu@@ ff@@ le .
and do you mind , can you take some cards and shu@@ ff@@ le ?
and just like that .
I have some cards that maybe , maybe they don 't mean anything .
but maybe that 's because we are not paying close attention .
what is the first number after the letter ?
Hg : seven .
what is the second number ? audience member 4 : nine .
and after the nine ?
they poli@@ tic with one another .
so why not try to ment@@ or these young people while they 're there ?
at the age of 21 , I was in a maximum @@@ -@@ @ security prison called El@@ mir@@ a Correctional Facility .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence that are nearly impossible for them to escape .
it 's my dream to create new toys .
( la@@ ughter ) Rid@@ ic@@ ulous ideas are ok@@ ay . the key is to keep them flowing .
can we make a hat into a to@@ y ?
that 's the one you should choose .
thank you very much .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's a short introductory part .
that reaction is why I did@@ n 't .
he can 't help but look in the mirror and be sub@@ tly impressed How he looks rough around the edges and yet casu@@ ally mess@@ ed .
now 60 was beautiful .
sure enough after two months of m@@ oping around , 61 days later , 61 was who he found , He had lost his keys and his parents were out .
she said , " S@@ ure . "
( la@@ ughter ) At this point 59 had tears in his eyes , W@@ as so glad to have this one @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ kind girl in his life .
because that was@@ n 't real love , that love was just a sample , When it came to real love , they were a prime example .
and what it also means is you can win .
( la@@ ughter ) But I loved it , and I got involved in these s@@ lam@@ s , and I became the U.@@ K. sla@@ m champion and got invited to the Po@@ e@@ try World Cup in Paris , which was un@@ beli@@ evable .
( la@@ ughter ) So ...
there 'd be a little paper me . and a little paper you .

this took place in my childhood , 1957 @@@ -@@ @ 65 .
that is exactly the size of the base of the spac@@ eship .
two days later , the space travel@@ er 's manif@@ es@@ to explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space : ... " trips to satellites of the outer planets .
so , they had a lot of fun doing this .
they got quite serious about the engineering of this .
well , here we have a little problem , the radiation doses at the crew station : 700 ra@@ ds per shot .
( la@@ ughter ) Personnel compartment noise : that 's not too bad ; it 's very low frequencies , it 's basically like these sub @@@ -@@ @ wo@@ of@@ ers .
so this is what NASA did , getting an eight @@@ -@@ @ man version that would go to Mars .
so that 's the end .
so along with three co @@@ -@@ @ conspir@@ ators , I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation .
it can be a product or service .
creative ag@@ ility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit , reflection and adjustment .
when you get a negative outcome , you 're still really learning something that you need to know .
so they selected that one .
but to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the Build it From S@@ cr@@ at@@ ch team , Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next @@@ -@@ @ generation system .
what kind of world do people want to belong in at Pi@@ x@@ ar ?
what do they focus their time on ?
and , finally , let 's best@@ ow credit in a very generous way . "
how did he see his role ?
and , guess what ?
sometimes it 's best to be deliberately fu@@ zz@@ y and vague .
we 've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you 'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens .
we also studied V@@ ine@@ et N@@ ay@@ ar at HC@@ L Technologies , an Indian outsourcing company .
what he did is tell them it was time for them to think about re@@ thinking what they were supposed to do .
and for this service , they were murdered , their families torn apart , and their story largely forgotten .
they live in me somehow , their memories giving me meaning every day .
when in ' 96 I was sent by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus , I knew some of the risks .
when I entered my flat in Vlad@@ ik@@ av@@ ka@@ z with a guard , we were surrounded by armed men .
they took the guard , they put him on the floor , they beat him up in front of me , tied him , dra@@ gged him away .
and no TV , no radio , no newspaper , no one to talk to .
I was trying not to think , I tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot .
there are many questions I could not understand , and there are some questions I did not want to understand .
he was fu@@ rious that the guards may have leak@@ ed some details about his private life .
he did not touch me anymore .
he did not ask any other questions .
what could I possibly reply ?
one CA@@ N@@ NOT assume this .
yet we do this because one life matters .
sometimes that 's the only difference you make -- one individual , one family , a small group of individuals -- and it matters .
every life matters , or every life should matter .
you don 't know how many problems you 've created for us . "
humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in conflict areas or in post @@@ -@@ @ conflict environments , yet our life , our job , is becoming increasingly life @@@ -@@ @ threatening , and the sancti@@ ty of our life is f@@ ading .
do you know that since the millennium , the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tri@@ pled ?
look at this picture .
there was no justice for any of the humanitarian aid workers killed or abducted in Chechnya between ' 95 and ' 99 , and it 's the same all over the world .
this is in@@ exc@@ usable .
we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself .
I know I 'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for .
we should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off .
now , I 'm an architect , and for the past year and a half I 've been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying .
so this conversation about death and architecture was what I wanted to start when I did my first exhibition on it in Venice in June , which was called " Death in Venice . "
and they showed people 's homes and hospitals and ceme@@ teries and mor@@ tuaries , and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death .
Sta@@ wi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers , who have an ownership in the business .
( appl@@ ause ) Tom Ri@@ el@@ ly : so S@@ ang@@ u , of course , this is strong rhetoric .
S@@ ang@@ u Del@@ le : I think there is a role .
in an article in the magazine Red@@ book titled " You : P@@ MS Free , " readers were informed that between 80 to 90 percent of women suffer from P@@ MS .
over 150 different symptoms have been used to diag@@ nose P@@ MS , and here are just a few of those .
overall , the weaknesses in the methods of research on P@@ MS have been considerable .
we know there 's a strong cultural component to the belief in P@@ MS because it 's nearly un@@ heard of outside of Western nations .
the other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide , including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appe@@ tite .
if you 've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause , which P@@ MS is supposed to be , then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women .
this is light waves , electromagnetic radiation that b@@ oun@@ ces off objects and it hits specialized recep@@ tors in the back of our eyes .
but we 're not seeing all the waves out there .
now , across the animal kingdom , different animals pick up on different parts of reality .
your whole world is about sm@@ elling .
you 've got a long sn@@ out that has 200 million s@@ cent recep@@ tors in it , and you have wet no@@ str@@ ils that attract and trap s@@ cent molecules , and your no@@ str@@ ils even have sl@@ its so you can take big nos@@ eful@@ s of air .
well , here 's the big secret : your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this .
and this is a very efficient kind of machine .
so , we 've been testing this with deaf people now , and it turns out that after just a little bit of time , people can start feeling , they can start understanding the language of the vest .
and this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a co@@ ch@@ lear impl@@ ant , which opens up this technology globally , even for the poorest countries .
so we 'll report on that later to see how well this goes .
and that 's just the beginning .
so the question now is , how do you want to go out and experience your universe ?
de : that 's a great question . we actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in .
and when we look around at things like bra@@ ille , for example , people are getting information through bum@@ ps on their fingers .
are you ready for this ? what are you most excited about , the direction it might go ?
it 's actually 2@@ D printing over and over again , and it in fact uses the technologies associated with 2@@ D printing .
and that was our challenge .
think about vibration control or great s@@ ne@@ akers , for example .
and so the opportunity now , if you actually make a part that has the properties to be a final part , and you do it in game @@@ -@@ @ changing speeds , you can actually transform manufacturing .
or digital denti@@ stry , and making these kinds of structures even while you 're in the denti@@ st chair .
you know , the world is really good at n@@ ano @@@ -@@ @ fab@@ rication .

thanks for listening .
yes , I 'm in rap songs .
you know what his unsuccessful pic@@ k@@ up line was ?
in 1998 , I lost my reputation and my dignity .
let me paint a picture for you .
the consequences for some have become dire , very dire .
I was on the phone with my mom in September of 2010 , and we were talking about the news of a young college fresh@@ man from R@@ ut@@ gers University , named T@@ yl@@ er Cle@@ ment@@ i .
T@@ yl@@ er 's tragic , sen@@ sel@@ ess death was a turning point for me .
and there 's nothing virtual about that .
cruelty to others is nothing new .
and there are no per@@ ime@@ ters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stock@@ ade .
there is a very personal price to public humiliation , and the growth of the internet has j@@ acked up that price .
Jenn@@ if@@ er Law@@ rence and several other actors had their i@@ Cl@@ oud accounts h@@ acked , and private , intimate , n@@ ude photos were pl@@ a@@ stered across the internet without their permission .
and what about the Sony Pictures cyber@@ h@@ acking ?
but in this culture of humiliation , there is another kind of price tag attached to public sha@@ ming .
changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs .
so as far as our culture of humiliation goes , what we need is a cultural revolution .
public sha@@ ming as a blood sport has to stop , and it 's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture .
in the online world , we can foster minority influence by becoming up@@ stand@@ ers .
you can read between the lines in those questions , and the answer has nothing to do with politics .
let me show you something .
if you consider a child 's eyes as a pair of biological cameras , they take one picture about every 200 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds , the average time an eye movement is made .
moreover , these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers , also similar to the brain .
so to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences , the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm has to take another step .

go back further , and it 's even more striking : since the 6@@ 0s , the middle class has sh@@ run@@ k by 20 percent , mainly because of the people tum@@ bling out of it .
and also , I can 't believe that we 're eating su@@ shi in front of the fish tank , which , personally , I think is really inappropriate .
there is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood , and while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art and having a good art career , there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio .
what do we do with these abandoned buildings ?
and so we just started imag@@ ining , what else could happen in this building ?
I never thought I 'd have to .
he ruled the country with an iron f@@ ist , and anyone who da@@ red question his authority was arrested , tortured , jail@@ ed or even killed .

did I meet your expectations ?
so , the TED Prize .
they asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity , no more than 50 words .
so I thought about it , I wrote my 50 words , and a few weeks later , Chris called and said , " Go for it . "
how are we going to do that ? with this .
it has a microphone , it can tell you how to do things , and it can send audio files .
those are the key ingredients .
I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died .
I have a couple of young kids at home , and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a tow@@ ering figure in my life would be through that session .
every day , people come up to me and say , " I wish I had interviewed my father or my grand@@ mother or my brother , but I waited too long . "
at this moment , when so much of how we communicate is fle@@ e@@ ting and in@@ consequential , join us in creating this digital archive of conversations that are enduring and important .
I hope you 'll help us make this wish come true .
" what is England and why am I going there ? "
although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees , there was a glass ceiling to our progress .
I recruited professionally qualified women who 'd left the industry on marriage , or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home @@@ -@@ @ working organization .
my interests were scientific , the market was commercial -- things such as payroll , which I found rather b@@ oring .
we used the standards ourselves , we were even paid to update them over the years , and eventually , they were adopted by NATO .
and later , as it became siz@@ able , they accepted , " Yes , it is siz@@ able now , but of no strategic interest . "
our late son , G@@ iles , was an only child , a beautiful , conten@@ ted baby .
they put my freedom first before all else , because that is what love does .
I call it my freedom staff .
but I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable .
now , someone , somewhere , must think that 's remarkable , or I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be up here , but let 's consider this for a moment .
you 'd all make great blind people . ( la@@ ughter ) Let 's have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention .
instead , it looks like this .
we did@@ n 't have a medical team ready to go .
but that was never tried .
you can have a virus where people feel well enough while they 're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market .
the best lessons , I think , on how to get prepared are again , what we do for war .
do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies ?
first , we need strong health systems in poor countries .
that 's where mothers can give birth safely , kids can get all their vaccines .
but , also where we 'll see the outbreak very early on .
we don 't have to ho@@ ard c@@ ans of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti or go down into the basement .

it 's projected that China will become , by whichever measure -- PPP , market exchange rates -- the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead .
and I have 15 minutes to work through war or peace , which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book called " War and Peace . "
see those hands there ? these are not built for farming .
( la@@ ughter ) I 've been called K@@ ev@@ in all my life .

because when I rendered his sentence , " Australia and China are enjoying a relationship of unprecedented clos@@ eness , " in fact , what I said was that Australia and China were now experiencing fantastic org@@ asm .
but in that little story , there 's a wisdom , which is , as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of 5,000 years of continuing history , there 's always something new to learn .
and he made this extraordinary observation about Athens and S@@ part@@ a .
this guy is an American . his name 's Gra@@ ham All@@ ison .
it could never happen again . "
number one : China feels as if it 's been humili@@ ated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history , beginning with the Op@@ ium Wars .
when after that , the Western powers car@@ ved China up into little pieces , so that by the time it got to the ' 20@@ s and ' 30s , signs like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai .
so how does the U.S. respond to all of the above ?
so apart from all of that , it 's just fine and dan@@ dy , the U.@@ S.@@ -@@ China relationship .
I argue simply this : we can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose .
but the question is , are they deliver@@ able alone ?
this is what our head tells us we need to do , but what about our heart ?
I have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who , frankly , haven 't had a whole lot in common in the past .
the important thing -- ( Appl@@ ause ) The important thing that I remember is st@@ aring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this ap@@ ology .
it was extraordinary to see , for example , old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ri@@ pped away from their parents , like this lady here .
on the way back , stopped at a cafe after the ap@@ ology for a mil@@ k@@ shake . "
so where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we 've been asked to address this evening , which is the future of U.@@ S.@@ -@@ China relations ?
the head says there is a policy framework , there 's a common narrative , there 's a mechanism through regular sum@@ mit@@ ry to do these things and to make them better .
[ in Chinese ] That 's my challenge to America . that 's my challenge to China .
K@@ ev@@ in Rud@@ d : well , what we Austr@@ alians do best is organize the drinks , so you get them together in one room , and we suggest this and suggest that , then we go and get the drinks .
but no , look , for all of us who are friends of these two great countries , America and China , you can do something .
I study planetary habit@@ ability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet .
you could say that I look for choice alien real estate .
consider our neighbor , Mars .
or@@ bit@@ ers like the M@@ av@@ en mission sample the Mar@@ tian atmosphere , trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habit@@ ability .
private spac@@ ef@@ light companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tant@@ alizing possibility of living our lives on Mars .
but the goals of inter@@ planetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another .
the extreme environments of our own world are alien vi@@ st@@ as .
they 're just closer to home .
E@@ VE@@ L 's riding the amazing st@@ unt cycle .
Chris Mil@@ k : so this was my joy back then .
it 's a group of rect@@ angles that are played in a sequence .
cm : so , when you 're inside of the head@@ set .
so we 're going to make more of them .
and that 's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
and it can change people 's perception of each other .
and ultimately , we become more human .
( la@@ ughter ) Sim@@ il@@ arly , we can think about physi@@ ology .
but what happened in more important questions ?
so we asked two questions : do people know what kind of level of inequality we have ?
you have it ?
so to look at this , to look at what we really want , we thought about the phil@@ os@@ op@@ her John R@@ aw@@ ls .
it 's a little bit like blind t@@ asting in which you don 't know what the outcome will be when you make a decision , and R@@ aw@@ ls called this the " ve@@ il of ignorance . "
so , we took another group , a large group of Americans , and we asked them the question in the ve@@ il of ignorance .
what are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it , knowing that you could end randomly at any place ?
what did people want to give to the first group , the bottom 20 percent ?
the next group , 14 percent of the wealth , 21 , 22 and 32 .
we even asked different departments of a university .
I know some of you went to Harvard Business School .
but the fact is , it 's because I did@@ n 't draw them on the same scale .
so what about other outcomes of wealth ?
wealth is not just about wealth .
we asked , what about things like health ?
what about availability of prescription medication ?
what about life expectancy ?
what about life expectancy of infants ?
we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency -- basically , young kids and babies , because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation .
we have two gaps : we have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap And the knowledge gap is something that we think about , how do we educate people ?
how do we get people to think differently about what we really want ?
how do we implement that to a higher degree on a more extensive scale ?
how do we take these things and actually do something about it ?
Dan Hol@@ z@@ man : please throw out the be@@ an@@ bag chairs . here we go .

( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) DH : he 's looking at me .
DH : excuse me , could we work on the design of the microphone ?
B@@ F : ye@@ ah . and so we 've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this .
he actually assumes more of the danger in this .
DH : Jesus Christ . Richard , please stand in front of me .
it 's kind of ne@@ at . OK .
DH : please hold my wr@@ ist , will you . B@@ F : ye@@ ah , hold this a minute .
( la@@ ughter ) What happened there ?
B@@ F : I think we were just outside .

B@@ F : you don 't want to hold these , trust me .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) One more try . man , I don 't want to get too close .
( appl@@ ause ) DH : w@@ ow ! boy !
( la@@ ughter ) DH : let 's jump this way , though .
B@@ F : I 'm going to run up behind him .
DH : leap over my shoulder .
B@@ F : up and over his shoulders .
DH : I think so , that 's right .
even the pen@@ cil .
DH : it 's not that difficult , we just don 't like to practice that much .
actually , we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed raz@@ or @@@ -@@ @ sharp .
just trying to play the odds . all right , here we go .
B@@ F : ye@@ ah , it 's all right .
DH : do you feel everything 's OK ? the atmosphere , the ...
B@@ F : ye@@ ah , a little sket@@ chy .
one is a dust tail , which is blown away by the solar wind .
and thus , the Ros@@ e@@ tta mission was approved in 1993 , and originally it was supposed to be launched in 2003 , but a problem arose with an Ari@@ ane rocket .
this particular com@@ et has been in the solar system since 1959 .
I won 't bore you with all the details of all the instruments , but it 's got everything .
so there is one spot , apparently , where there is a lot of stuff coming from , it gets heated in the Sun , and then co@@ ols down on the back side .
b@@ oul@@ ders , rocks -- if anything , it looks more like the Hal@@ f D@@ ome in Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite than anything else .
some people suggest that actually , when we get close to the sun , the com@@ et may split in two , and then we 'll have to choose , which com@@ et do we go for ?
but much the same as Ros@@ e@@ tta , and that is because you want to compare what you find in space with what you find on the com@@ et .
these are called ground truth measurements .
on the top right , you see an image taken at 60 meters by the lander , 60 meters above the surface of the com@@ et .
so this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the com@@ et .
here , you see the whole sequence again , but from a different perspective , and you see three blown @@@ -@@ @ ups from the bottom @@@ -@@ @ left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the com@@ et .
this , for me , is one of the very best images of space science I have ever seen .
my parents also fled to Pakistan , and settled in Que@@ tta , where I was born .
after the September 11 attack on the Twin Tow@@ ers , I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time , with foreign journalists .
when this story was published in the Washington Post , I started receiving death threats , and I was forced to leave Afghanistan , as my parents were .
along with my family , I returned back to Que@@ tta .
when it came time to leave Pakistan , Australia seemed the obvious choice .
it was like a scene from do@@ om@@ s@@ day , or maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies that shows that everything is breaking apart and the world is just ending .
we all lost hope .
our boat crashing onto the rocks , I sli@@ pped into the water and destroyed my camera , whatever I had documented .
but luc@@ k@@ ily , the memory card survived .
the asylum seekers have been demon@@ ized and then presented to the people .

and a wash@@ basin .
now these days , kids need a small dos@@ age of danger .
( la@@ ughter ) My point is don 't control them , don 't protect them too much , and they need to tum@@ ble sometimes .
at the age of 50 , lying on the street , in a pool of blood , along with my own son , made me angry .
our parents , teachers , priests -- everyone taught us how to control and suppress our anger .
but I will come to that later on .
let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself .
but more importantly , he taught us how to treat the most vulnerable sections , the most deprived people , with dignity and respect .
by 8 o 'clock , we kept on waiting , because it 's not very un@@ common that the leaders become late , for an hour or so .
you have done your bit .
you have eaten the food cooked by un@@ tou@@ cha@@ bles , which has never happened in our memory . "
I saw my mother and elderly women were c@@ rying and they were ple@@ ading to these elderly people because they had threatened to out@@ caste my whole family .
does anybody know ?
I also learned how the most un@@ control@@ l@@ able form of energy could be harn@@ essed for good and making society better .
I was so happy .
so the policemen , instead of helping me , they threw me in this small , tiny shell , like an animal .
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 children , and 50 more will join , that 's not done .
( appl@@ ause ) Not only that , but this first @@@ -@@ @ ever consumer 's power , or consumer 's campaign has grown in other countries and other industries , maybe chocolate , maybe ap@@ pa@@ rel , maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond .
and I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or 10 or 20 , but my colleagues and I have been able to physically liber@@ ate 8@@ 3,000 child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers .
( appl@@ ause ) I knew that we needed global policies .
and the concrete result was that the number of child lab@@ ore@@ rs globally has gone down by one third in the last 15 years .
( appl@@ ause ) So , in each case , it began from anger , turned into an idea , and action .
so anger , what next ?
thank you so much .
who or what in@@ spi@@ res you and why ?
thank you .
it 's like we 've ri@@ pped the humanity out of our companies .
now , ho@@ or@@ ay if you 're a shareholder , but if you 're the other side of that , and you 're the average American worker , then you can see it 's not such a good thing .
[ " U.S. Share of Income Go@@ ing to Labor vs. CEO @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ Wor@@ ker Compensation Rati@@ o " ] Now , higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth .
on the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics .
and guess what ?
beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from .
well clearly at the beginning of the solar system , Mars and the Earth were bom@@ bar@@ ded by giant aster@@ oids and com@@ ets , and there were e@@ jec@@ ta from these impacts all over the place .
so ye@@ ah , maybe Gran@@ dd@@ ady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us .
Mars may hold that secret for us .
here 's what happened : at the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth , then everything went south for Mars , literally .
the atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds , Mars lost its mag@@ net@@ osphere , and then cosmic rays and U.@@ V. bom@@ bar@@ ded the surface and water escaped to space and went underground .
so for one moment now I 'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine .
why is that ?
because when you go higher , the atmosphere is getting th@@ inner , it 's getting more unstable , the temperature is getting cool@@ er , and you have a lot more U.@@ V. radiation .
basically , you are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed .
at this altitude , this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions as those on Mars three and a half billion years ago .
in the samples that we took back home , 36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species , and those three species are the ones that have survived so far .
the red color you see here is not due to minerals .
during U.@@ V. storms there , the U.@@ V. Index reaches 43 .
it has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution , but also its habit@@ ability potential .
but in the end , it might be just us , it might be us and Mars , or it can be many trees of life in the solar system .
DNA , or any information carrier , is going to tell you about adaptation , about evolution , about survival , about planetary changes and about the transfer of information .
all together , they are telling us what started as a micro@@ b@@ ial path@@ way , and why what started as a micro@@ b@@ ial path@@ way sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end .
on Earth , there are many intelligent species , but only one has achieved technology .
right here in the journey of our own solar system , there is a very , very powerful message that says here 's how we should look for alien life , small and big .
and it is a really we@@ ir@@ d thing to do .
there 's a point in there where I 'm just , like , you 've got to get some air in there , mate , because he just sounds like he 's breathing out .
so if you ask human beings , " When do you laugh ? "
in our evolution , we have developed two different ways of voc@@ alizing .
I want you to tell me if you think this la@@ ughter is real la@@ ughter , or if you think it 's posed .
when you start laugh@@ ing hard , you start squee@@ zing air out from your lun@@ gs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily .
we took it into the scanner to see how bra@@ ins respond when you hear la@@ ughter .
we just played people real and posed laugh@@ s .
it 's very unambiguous , and it seems to be associated with greater aud@@ itory processing of these novel sounds .
in contrast , when you hear somebody laugh@@ ing in a posed way , what you see are these regions in pink , which are occupying brain areas associated with ment@@ alizing , thinking about what somebody else is thinking .
and I think what that means is , even if you 're having your brain scanned , which is completely b@@ oring and not very interesting , when you hear somebody going , " A ha ha ha ha ha , " you 're trying to work out why they 're laugh@@ ing .
by the time you are older , you get better , but inte@@ res@@ tingly , you do not hit peak performance in this datas@@ et until you are in your late 30s and early 4@@ 0s .
remember me laugh@@ ing with my parents when I had no idea what was going on .
there 's a really lovely set of studies coming out from Robert Le@@ ven@@ son 's lab in California , where he 's doing a longitudinal study with couples .
so you 've got the two of them in there , and he 'll say to the husband , " T@@ ell me something that your wife does that irrit@@ ates you . "
( la@@ ughter ) He 's starting to go now .
and now they 're all off .
we 're not Canadian .
you do it so often , you don 't even notice it .
at the same time , the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed .
we 'll eventually zoom out of the bl@@ az@@ ar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger gal@@ actic context .
I simultaneously compare variations between the gam@@ ma ray light data and the visible light data from day to day and year to year , to better loc@@ alize these gam@@ ma ray bl@@ obs .
this all started as a love story .
again , this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water , it 's useful for bu@@ oy@@ ancy control in the water .
and it is still true today .
thank you .
the things I had to see , and feel and touch were pretty un@@ speak@@ able .
but I just wish that I , and the rest of the world , had been moved earlier .
it 's a cause that probably has involved all of us here .
I don 't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most j@@ ar@@ ring .
she sat down with me for hours , just ushe@@ red me in to the world of poverty .
she described what it was like when the co@@ als on the cooking fire finally just went completely cold .
and then as Peter finally grew cold .
for over 50 years , stories like this have been moving us to compassion .
but first , let me begin with what you probably already know .
thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years ago , when I would have been graduating from high school , they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty .
that number , today , is now down to 17,000 .
way too many , of course , but it does mean that every year , there 's eight million kids who don 't have to die from poverty .
this is massive progress , and this exceeds everybody 's expectations about what is possible .
so why , why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty ?
woman : OK Dis@@ pat@@ cher : um , obviously if he comes inside the residence and assaults you , can you ask him to go away ?
the path forward is really pretty clear .
G@@ H : well , one of the glorious things that 's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious .
so you have to do an approach that pul@@ ls that all together .
the World@@ Wide Tel@@ es@@ cope takes the best images from the world 's greatest teles@@ cop@@ es on Earth and in space , and has wo@@ ven them seam@@ lessly to produce a holistic view of the universe .
Harvard was wrong , big time . ( la@@ ughter ) Of course , we know today that gal@@ ax@@ ies extend far beyond our own gal@@ axy .
we can see across the entire spectrum of light , revealing worlds that had previously been invisible .
we see black holes at the heart of our gal@@ axy , in the Mil@@ ky Way , and elsewhere in the universe , where time itself seems to stand still .
and in telling stories , each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way .
before I introduce the person responsible for the World@@ Wide Tel@@ es@@ cope , I just want to leave you with this brief thought : when I ask people , " How does the night sky make you feel ? "
well , our gaz@@ e fills the universe .
I think the World@@ Wide Tel@@ es@@ cope will convince you that we may be tiny , but we are truly , wonder@@ fully significant .
( appl@@ ause ) I can 't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Cur@@ tis W@@ ong from Microsoft . ( appl@@ ause ) Cur@@ tis W@@ ong : thank you , Ro@@ y .
and actually this tour is one that was created earlier .
and the tours are all totally interactive , so that if I were to go somewhere ...

my childhood was ab@@ ound with questions like this .
and it 's not that they did@@ n 't want me to think critically .
their paren@@ ting always sought to reconcile the tension between having my si@@ bl@@ ings and I understand the realities of the world , while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable .
you can 't pre@@ tend to shoot guns .
you can 't run around in the dark .
we want to help nour@@ ish the growing population without further destroying the environment .
now , genetic modification is not new ; virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner .
some of them are quite creative , like mixing two different species together using a process called gra@@ fting to create this variety that 's half tom@@ ato and half potato .
bre@@ ed@@ ers have also used other types of genetic techniques , such as random mu@@ tag@@ ene@@ sis , which induc@@ es un@@ characterized mu@@ tations into the plants .
Ken@@ ong spent 10 years looking for this gene .
but this approach does not work well in Bangladesh .
the fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds , and even if it was , that there would be unintended consequences .
how do we know that there is@@ n 't a big risk of some unintended consequence ?
often our tin@@ ker@@ ings with nature do lead to big , unintended consequences and chain reactions .
there are no commercial profits in this situation .
Som@@ i .
Som@@ i .
if we look under the hood , this is what we find : basically the same thing .
we know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve .
so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we 've achieved , and everything we care about , depends cru@@ cially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind .
the result is A.@@ I. that is not limited to one domain -- the same system can learn to translate between any pairs of languages , or learn to play any computer game on the A@@ tar@@ i console .
and the median answer was 20@@ 40 or 2050 , depending on precisely which group of experts we asked .
there are also size limitations , like a human brain has to fit inside a cran@@ ium , but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger .
and I think we might then see an intelligence explosion .
so at one end we have the village idi@@ ot , and then far over at the other side we have E@@ d Wit@@ ten , or Albert E@@ in@@ stein , or whoever your favorite g@@ uru is .
to make any head@@ way with this , we must first of all avoid anthro@@ p@@ om@@ orph@@ izing .
it 's extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized .
another example , suppose we give A.@@ I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem .
this is a lesson that 's also taught in many a myth .
but so could a super@@ intelligent agent , and it would be much better at that than we are .
sooner or later , it will out .
making super@@ intelligent A.@@ I. that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that .
thank you .
and while many people are fasc@@ inated by the brain , they can 't really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we don 't teach neuro@@ science in schools .
and one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it 's really only done at major universities and large institutions .
but some of your ne@@ ur@@ ons right here in your motor cor@@ te@@ x are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this .
have you ever heard what your brain sounds like ?
let 's take a look at it as well .
what happens ?
Ah , nothing .
we 're going to bring on the ne@@ uro @@@ -@@ @ revolution .
the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair .
our genetic program continues producing these rhyth@@ mic patterns of fluo@@ rescent proteins as the colony grows outw@@ ards .
we started using pro@@ bio@@ tic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit , and found that when orally delivered to m@@ ice , these pro@@ bio@@ tics would selec@@ tively grow inside of liver tum@@ ors .
altogether , imagine in the future taking a programmed pro@@ bio@@ tic that could detect and treat cancer , or even other diseases .
most of us think of motion as a very visual thing .
so let me show you what I mean .
and these motions carry a lot of significance , but they 're usually too subtle for us to see , so instead , we have to observe them through direct contact , through touch .
and so , if we use their software on the left video , it lets us see the pulse in this wr@@ ist , and if we were to count that pulse , we could even figure out this person 's heart rate .
that 's one ten @@@ -@@ @ thous@@ and@@ th of a centi@@ meter , which sp@@ ans somewhere between a hundre@@ d@@ th and a thous@@ and@@ th of a pix@@ el in this image .
so you can squ@@ int all you want , but motion that small is pretty much percep@@ tually invisible .
well , let 's say that those leaves move by just a single micro@@ meter , and let 's say that that shifts our image by just a thous@@ and@@ th of a pix@@ el .
( la@@ ughter ) But even with the right algorithm , we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle .
but we do want to see the object vibr@@ ate , so to make that happen , we 're just going to ban@@ g a little bit on the surface where it 's resting while we record this video .
but all in all , it 's a pretty good path .
and they 're emerging from their 20@@ s not with degrees in business and English , but with criminal records .
soon , her cous@@ in came home from a juvenile detention center .
he asked the child if he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant .
it was their grand@@ father 's pension that supported the family , not really enough to pay for food and clothes and school supplies for growing boys .
Ch@@ uck and T@@ im had never been outside of the tr@@ i @@@ -@@ @ state , let alone to California .
a neighborhood like the one I got to grow up in .
but do@@ es@@ n 't this high incarceration rate partly account for our really low crime rate ?
it turns out that the crime rate goes up and down irrespective of how many young people we send to prison .
a few years ago , Michel@@ le Alexander wrote " The New J@@ im Cro@@ w , " which got Americans to see incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before .
President Obama and Attorney General Eric Hol@@ der have come out very strongly on sentencing reform , on the need to address racial disparity in incarceration .
Texas has gotten into the game now , also closing prisons , investing in education .
I did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime .

I 'm from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and this is not my home .
and when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago , I just thought , this makes perfect sense .
it turns b@@ ambo@@ o into a viable building material .
this floor is made of gl@@ os@@ sy and durable b@@ ambo@@ o skin .
and when we say " inf@@ idel@@ ity , " what exactly do we mean ?
is it a ho@@ ok@@ up , a love story , paid sex , a chat room , a massage with a happy ending ?
adultery has existed since marriage was invented , and so , too , the tabo@@ o against it .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I mean , many of you probably have said , " I am mon@@ og@@ am@@ ous in all my relationships . "
men relied on women 's f@@ idel@@ ity in order to know whose children these are , and who gets the cows when I die .
and I am it : I 'm chosen , I 'm unique , I 'm indispensable , I 'm ir@@ replaceable , I 'm the one .
inf@@ idel@@ ity shat@@ ters the grand ambition of love .
but if throughout history , inf@@ idel@@ ity has always been painful , today it is often traumatic , because it threatens our sense of self .
inf@@ idel@@ ity -- a violation of trust , a crisis of identity .
they often are people who have actually been faithful for decades , but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross , and at the risk of losing everything .
and her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaz@@ e of another , it is@@ n 't always our partner that we are turning away from , but the person that we have ourselves become .
am I going on for another 25 years like this ?
first of all , the conversation about mon@@ og@@ amy is not the same as the conversation about inf@@ idel@@ ity .
but it can be healed .
and that distinction is important .
he needs to become , for a while , the protec@@ tor of the boundaries .
what were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me ?
what is it about us that you value ?
and the dilem@@ mas of love and desire , they don 't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad , and victim and perpetrator .
your first marriage is over .
that 's the way it is .
what I love about flags is that once you understand the design of flags , what makes a good flag , what makes a bad flag , you can understand the design of almost anything .
RM : all right , got it ? here we go .
Roman Mars : according to the North American V@@ ex@@ ill@@ ological Association .
narr@@ ator : number three , use two to three basic colors .
W@@ M : today , just for example , I went to get a hair@@ cut , and when I sat down in the bar@@ ber 's chair , there was a Chicago flag on the box that the bar@@ ber kept all his tools in , and then in the mirror , there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me .
T@@ K : keeping it simple .
RM : all the best flags tend to stick to these principles .
and like I said before , most country flags are OK .
but sadly , good design principles are rarely invoked in US city flags .
( la@@ ughter ) These flags are everywhere in the US .
Ste@@ ve Kod@@ is : it was adopted in 1955 .
SK : it 's really aw@@ ful .
the most de@@ pressing part of this flag , though , is that there have been two major re@@ design contests .
is there anything we can do ?
I don 't know what he would do if we was completely un@@ fet@@ tered and did@@ n 't follow those guidelines .
this one 's by Ne@@ il Mus@@ set@@ t .
both are so much better .
and when that flag is a beautiful thing , that connection is a beautiful thing .
now , an equality right is the kind of right to which you 're entitled because you resem@@ ble someone else in a relevant way , and there 's the rub , relevant way .
they understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow .

I don 't even know if it 's a real job title , to be honest .
my parents definitely did@@ n 't think so when I told them at 19 I was qu@@ itting my job to pursue this dream career : blue sk@@ ies , warm tropical beaches , and a tan that lasts all year long .
and one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there : hours , days , weeks spent on Google Earth trying to pin@@ point any remote stretch of beach or ree@@ f we could actually get to .
there was this one particularly bum@@ py boat ride up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot , where we ended up watching helpl@@ essly from the water as bears rav@@ aged our camp site .
it had a greater population of sheep than people , so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found .
and I told myself , there 's not a chance you 're getting out of the water .
actually , I was totally f@@ rea@@ king out -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- and I was bor@@ der@@ line hypo@@ ther@@ mic , and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water .
in 2011 , during the final six months of Kim J@@ ong @@@ -@@ @ Il 's life , I lived under@@ cover in North Korea .
we were never allowed to discuss the outside world .
and I could not tell them .
but if all they have ever known were lies , how could we expect them to be otherwise ?
next , I tried to teach them ess@@ ay writing .
they wrote that they were fed up with the sa@@ men@@ ess of everything .
we all ate meals together , played basketball together .
and I came to ad@@ ore them .
but I think they knew how sad I was for them .
I called you my gent@@ lemen , but I don 't know if being gentle in Kim J@@ ong @@@ -@@ @ U@@ n 's mer@@ cil@@ ess North Korea is a good thing .
both my mom and I required physical therapy , a process of doing a suite of repeti@@ tive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury .
I 'm so pleased this version is now in use in over 10 clinics across Europe and the U.S. , and we 're working on the home version .
TR : and then the hope is to get it so it 's a home version and I can do my exercise remotely , and the therap@@ ist at the clinic can see how I 'm doing and stuff like that .
cm : exactly .
Mr : right . that was myself as a male , the way I was brought up .
ca : you were brought up Martin Ro@@ th@@ blat@@ t .
Mr : it was love at the first sight .
I was a single male parent . she was a single female parent .
( appl@@ ause ) M@@ R : thank you for your monthly subscriptions .
what was your thesis in this book ?
Mr : correct . I would say in some ways I change my gender about as often as I change my hair@@ style .
ca : and yet , a year or two later , you were there with a medicine that worked for J@@ ene@@ sis .
ca : so just so as you know , from my point of view , this is@@ n 't only one of the most aston@@ ishing lives I have heard , it 's one of the most aston@@ ishing love stories I 've ever heard .
we 've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC D@@ over .
so the trip up is beautiful . it 's kind of like Google Earth in reverse .
this is what it looks like .
right now , I 'm about at the speed of sound .
A@@ E : so now I 'm down low right now and you can basically see the par@@ ach@@ ute come out right there .
at this point , I 'm very happy that there 's a par@@ ach@@ ute out .
A@@ E : hi there !
but there 's one other group I wanted to thank , and that 's my family .
the second question that we often think about is : are we alone ?
this is a photograph of a real gal@@ axy , we think our Mil@@ ky Way looks like this gal@@ axy .
well , the bi@@ ologists get fu@@ rious with me for saying that , because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet .
and the highlighted stars are those with known ex@@ o@@ planets .
this is where the Ke@@ pl@@ er Space Tel@@ es@@ cope focused for many years .
we know their size , and their orbit and things like that .
this planet is more massive than Earth and has a higher surface gravity .
and I have a couple of other favorite ex@@ o@@ planets to tell you about .
we have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases on other planets .
and you can see all these dark , vertical lines .
that 's a lot of oxygen .
and our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmos@@ p@@ heres , gases that don 't belong , that we might be able to attribute to life .
so , please don 't email me one of your crazy theories .
it 's about tens of meters in diameter .
and it has to be a very special shape , because of the physics of def@@ r@@ action .
now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
here is Earth as a p@@ ale blue do@@ t .
and that red light is just scattered light in the camera op@@ tics .
but there 's more .
( appl@@ ause ) June Co@@ hen : and I give you , for a question , Ros@@ e@@ tta Mission Manager F@@ red J@@ ans@@ en .
F@@ red J@@ ans@@ en : you mentioned half@@ way through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an ex@@ o@@ planet like Earth is not there yet .
JC : I 'm going to ask you one follow @@@ -@@ @ up question , too , Sar@@ a , as the gener@@ alist .
and something needed to be done about that .
and I was doing fun@@ erals , but not of the v@@ ener@@ ated matri@@ archs and patri@@ archs who 'd lived a long life and there 's a lot to say .
I started to preach dec@@ rying the violence in the community .
RAP music ?
they met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dor@@ chester , and they were killed .
if he would have gotten to the church , it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have made a difference , because the lights were out ; nobody was home .
I mean , is@@ n 't this a law enforcement issue ?
but it starts with just a few , or maybe just one .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) All right , come on , you 're cutting into my time now , ok@@ ay ? ( la@@ ughter ) But it was amazing .
and as we were talking with them , a number of my@@ ths were dis@@ p@@ elled about them with us .
and I know some of them call it survival , but I call them over@@ com@@ ers , because when you 're in the conditions that they 're in , to be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming .
we had law enforcement partners .
I helped to start an organization 20 years ago , a faith @@@ -@@ @ based organization , to deal with this issue .
it 's all connected .
but I need your help .
it can 't just come from fol@@ ks who are burning themselves out in the community .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , ultimately , that surprise and the behavi@@ ors associated with it are the product of something called un@@ conscious bias , or implicit prejudice .
and that results in the ridic@@ ulously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce , particularly in areas of influence .
I 'm not acc@@ using anyone , bias is not an accusation .
the fact is , we all have bi@@ ases against what 's different , what 's different to our social norms .
what does that tell us ?
" the boy is my son . "
ladies and gent@@ lemen , the surgeon is his mother .
but , he@@ y .
and the cool thing about it is that it 's pretty enter@@ taining .
( la@@ ughter ) And I was like , " Than@@ ks , guys . "
now , in 2010 , The Australian National University did an experiment where they sent out 4,000 identical applications to entry level jobs , essentially .
and the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they 've acknowledged it , but I 'm not really sure what they 're doing about it .
and inte@@ res@@ tingly , the author of the lab resume experiment offered some sort of a solution .
she said the one thing that brought the successful women together , the one thing that they had in common , was the fact that they had good ment@@ ors .
I challenge each and every one of you to ment@@ or someone different .
or a lady here in B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e , an Afghan lady who 's a refugee , who could barely speak English when she came to Australia , her ment@@ ors helped her become a doctor and she took our Young Que@@ ens@@ lander of the Year Award in 2008 .
I know you 've been given a lot of challenges today , but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently , because diversity is magic .
now , prophets object to every bit of this .
they don 't drive to work , they take their renewable @@@ -@@ @ powered train .
those neighborhood @@@ -@@ @ run solar facilities , they sound great , but they depend on a technology that do@@ es@@ n 't exist yet .
I mean , you think the proto@@ z@@ oa see the edge of the pe@@ tr@@ i dish approaching and say , " He@@ y guys , time to change society " ?
I mean , the basic counter@@ argument bo@@ ils down to : " we 're special . "
how l@@ ame is that ?
( la@@ ughter ) I mean , we can accumulate and share knowledge and use it to guide our future .
this problem has been getting worse for decades , and remarkably little has been done about it .
F@@ BI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck .
that 's right , the F@@ BI is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to sp@@ y on communities in the United States , but mostly Muslim American communities .
both are mentally ill .
in 2012 , the F@@ BI arrested these two men for consp@@ iring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle with weapons provided , of course , by the F@@ BI .
the F@@ BI 's inform@@ ant was Robert Chil@@ ds , a convicted rap@@ ist and child mol@@ ester who was paid 9@@ 0,000 dollars for his work on the case .
the lead defendant was James Cro@@ miti@@ e , a broke Wal@@ mart employee with a history of mental problems .
today , The Inter@@ cept published my new story about a counter@@ terrorism sting in T@@ amp@@ a involving Sami Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac , a young man who was living near T@@ amp@@ a , Florida .
behind closed doors , F@@ BI agents admitted that what they were doing was far@@ c@@ ical .
he sealed the trans@@ cripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this .
but that did@@ n 't stop the F@@ BI .
he 's one of more than 175 so @@@ -@@ @ called terrorists , for whom the F@@ BI has created Hollywood end@@ ings .
U.S. government officials call this the War on Ter@@ ror .
it 's really just theater , a national security theater , with mentally ill men like Sami Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac un@@ wit@@ ting actors in a carefully chore@@ ograph@@ ed production brought to you by the F@@ BI .
( appl@@ ause ) Tom Ri@@ el@@ ly : so , those are some pretty strong accusations , pretty strong charges .
so my story in The Inter@@ cept , which was just published today , tells the story of how Sami Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac was set up in this F@@ BI sting and goes into much greater detail .
in this talk , I could only highlight the things that they said , such as calling him a " ret@@ arded fo@@ ol . "
so initially it was al Qaeda plots , and now the Islamic State is the current flavor .
I 'm in southern Ethiopia . I 'm with the Da@@ as@@ an@@ ach .
does anybody know 4@@ x@@ 5 and 10@@ x@@ 8 sheets of film , and you 're setting it up , putting it on the tri@@ po@@ d .
so the light 's setting on my left @@@ -@@ @ hand side , and there 's a balance in the communication with the Da@@ as@@ an@@ ach , the family of 30 , all ages .
where have they all gone ? I had no idea .
what 's your story ? who are you ? "
I mean , I have teenage kids . I should know .
I need something for the eye to look at . I need a white go@@ at in the middle . "
but anyway , the effort that goes into that picture and the story that I 've just related to you , as you can imagine , there are hundreds of other b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re , ec@@ centric stories of hundreds of other people around the world .
where did you find them ? are they real ? you f@@ aked it .
I really did@@ n 't have the answers , and I could sort of understand , ok@@ ay , they 're beautiful , that was my intention , but the questions that I was being fired at , I could not answer them .
and , " No , no , the TED group . you must know about it . "
and I said , " I 've been in a te@@ e@@ pe@@ e and in a y@@ urt for the last five years .
( la@@ ughter ) And I thought , three lessons , well , I 'm going to think about it .
and I thought long and hard about it , and I thought , well , the only thing I can communicate is very , very basic .
I traveled enorm@@ ously as a child .
I was very nomadic . it was actually very exciting .
so I hope there are@@ n 't too many psychologists in this audience .
this is the real thing .
am I perceived as beautiful ?
do I have to go around the world photograph@@ ing , excuse me , women between the age of 25 and 30 ? is that what beauty is going to be ?
Ch@@ uk@@ ot@@ ka probably is , technically , as far as one can go and still be on the living planet .
it 's 13 hours ' flight from Moscow .
they said , " You CA@@ N@@ NOT photograph us . you have to wait .
they had zero judgment .
if you could look at somebody left to the right of you , and I want you to observe them , and I want you to give them a compli@@ ment . this is very important .
you have to be quick , because I 'm running out of time .
and you have to remember it .
well , there 's an image I 'd like to show you , quite a special image , and it was@@ n 't essentially the image I wanted to choose .
so if you can briefly reflect on what I was discussing about beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots , and I need you all to stand for me , please .
but you were given a compli@@ ment a few minutes ago .
I 'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks .
I 'm not going to ask you to carry a go@@ at , and I know you don 't have any cam@@ els .
from a few bones , we inf@@ er the existence of din@@ o@@ su@@ ars .
from spectr@@ al lines , the composition of ne@@ bul@@ ae .
gener@@ alizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science .
they see a few rubber duc@@ ks and learn that they float , or a few balls and learn that they b@@ ounce .
it do@@ es@@ n 't get better than that .
now , those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end , so babies could do other things with them if they wanted to .
all right , it 's nice that babies will gener@@ alize properties of blue balls to yellow balls , and it 's impressive that babies can learn from im@@ itating us , but we 've known those things about babies for a very long time .
this time , we 're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls , and guess what ?
you [ probably won 't ] randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls .
maybe there 's something special about the blue balls .
and it starts with a problem of conf@@ ounded evidence that all of us have , which is that we are part of the world .
and this might not seem like a problem to you , but like most problems , it 's only a problem when things go wrong .
( video ) H@@ G : two , three . go ! ( music ) LS : one , two , three , go !
Arthur , I 'm going to try again . one , two , three , go !
H@@ mm , let me try again .
one , two , three , go ! ( music ) H@@ G : I 'm going to put this one over here , and I 'm going to give this one to you .
they learn new causal relationships from just a few examples .
I think these are all important stories , and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human , but I want you to note that today I told you a very different story .
human minds generate research and discovery , and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater , and human minds take care of other humans : our old , our young , our sick .
in the years to come , we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even en@@ vision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approxim@@ ating the compu@@ tational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : La@@ ura , thank you . I do actually have a question for you .
LS : you know , they look really impressive in our experiments , but think about what they look like in real life , right ?
it starts out as a baby .
it has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you .
ca : La@@ ura Sch@@ ul@@ z , wonderful food for thought . thank you so much .
" what is life ? " is something that I think many bi@@ ologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we 've been digi@@ tizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequ@@ enced the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , " Can we regener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
we 're able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
and if we do , can we boot up a chro@@ mos@@ ome ?
but it turns out synthe@@ sizing DNA is very difficult .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a DNA molec@@ ule of about 5,000 letters .
( la@@ ughter ) They laugh@@ ed more than you guys are . ( la@@ ughter ) And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 am@@ ino acids , such that there 's a single letter designation for each of the am@@ ino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
we 're trying to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball play@@ off .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqu@@ eous environment .
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular pho@@ tom@@ icro@@ graph .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
this is over 58@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it 's the largest molec@@ ule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chro@@ mos@@ ome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
we 're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : I was born in 1946 .
then of course , there 's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
so I go through the symptoms of that diagnosis , and it 's clear to me that she 's not clin@@ ically depressed , and I tell her that .
here 's the pull part .
it 's released around childbirth and also during skin @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ skin touch , so it rises even if you did@@ n 't give birth to the baby .
they bought a sou@@ ped @@@ -@@ @ up j@@ it@@ ney , was a cher@@ ry red ' 53 .
Oh , into each dark , star@@ ry night , oh , what a mystery that 's sealed so tight .
the key to both is to focus on protecting civilians , both in our own countries and in those where we are present in the name of security .
we live in a dangerous world .
that started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mat@@ tered most for success .
maybe that 's the most important thing ?
of course , people proved that wrong .
but the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system .
Go@@ To@@ .com , which we announced actually at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for cost @@@ -@@ @ effective ways to get traffic .
as John sits on Dan 's bed , a train goes rush@@ ing by , r@@ att@@ ling everything in the room .
we all know what he 's talking about .
see this little stic@@ ker ?
so it could be easier for us to check out at the gro@@ cery counter .
well that 's great , we can get in and out of the store quickly .
except now , we have to look for this little stic@@ ker .
( appl@@ ause ) It 's not fun , not at all .
but something interesting happened .
your hands cl@@ en@@ ched at 10 and 2 on the wheel , looking at every single object out there -- the cars , the lights , the pedestrians .
so much so , that I cou@@ ld@@ n 't even talk to anyone else in the car and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't even listen to music .
it would be exhaus@@ ting , and we 'd have no time to learn about new things .
Jer@@ ry Se@@ inf@@ eld 's entire career was built on notic@@ ing those little details , those idi@@ otic things we do every day that we don 't even remember .
see this , this person , this is Mary An@@ derson .
in 19@@ 02 in New York City , she was visiting .
as she was going to her destination , she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely .
now probably , most of those passengers just thought , " It 's a fact of life , he 's got to open the window to clean it .
that 's just how it is . "
Mary thought , " What if the di@@ ver could actually clean the wind@@ shield from the inside so that he could stay safe and drive and the passengers could actually stay warm ? "
now some people think you 're born with this ability or you 're not , as if Mary An@@ derson was hard@@ wired at birth to see the world more clearly .
that was@@ n 't the case for me .
it was crazy .
when it had batteries in it , you had to charge it before you used it .
today , almost every product that you get that 's battery powered comes out of the box fully charged , even if it do@@ es@@ n 't have a hard drive .
well , it 's seeing the invisible problem , not just the obvious problem , that 's important , not just for product design , but for everything we do .
take thermo@@ stat@@ s , for instance .
they made better U.@@ I.@@ s , they made better documentation .
if you take a step back and look at all the boxes , maybe there 's a way to remove one or combine them so that you can make that process much simpler .
there are many different scre@@ ws : wood scre@@ ws , metal scre@@ ws , anch@@ ors , concrete scre@@ ws , the list went on and on .
and we designed a special screw , a custom screw , much to the ch@@ agr@@ in of our investors .
and we said , " We will sell more if we get this right . "
every day , I 'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids .
he looked at me , pu@@ zz@@ led , and said , " Why do@@ es@@ n 't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail ? " ( la@@ ughter ) I was like , " That 's a pretty good question . "
so my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team , or people with young minds .
and if we do , maybe , just maybe , we can get rid of these dum@@ b little stic@@ kers .
I think this profound dis@@ connect actually symbol@@ izes most of our understanding about human trafficking .
ten percent is in state@@ - imposed forced labor .
it 's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan .
it 's found in Thailand 's fishing industry .
that country has become the largest exporter of shri@@ mp in the world .
traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks , or to sing in tour@@ ing boys ' cho@@ irs .
the scheme in that case was incredible .
the traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo , and they told these families that " your daughters are going to get a fine education in the United States . "
we 'll get you a plane ticket . we 'll pay your fees .
all you have to do is take this young girl with you , say that she 's your sister or your spouse .
this is a huge problem .
but keep in mind , most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized .
they 're migrants , people of color .
I 've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets gre@@ ed .
trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections , and denied the right to organize .
but once they were brought over , their passports were confiscated .
it is merely what we find legally toler@@ able .
and all of this had been hidden to me , before I had tried to understand it .
this is@@ n 't a matter of buying a fair @@@ -@@ @ trade pe@@ ach and calling it a day , buying a guilt @@@ -@@ @ free zone with your money .
that 's not how it works .
these survivors don 't need saving .
the n@@ ann@@ ies and house@@ keepers who mar@@ ched with their families and their employers ' families -- their activis@@ m got us an international treaty on domestic workers ' rights .
these Indian ship@@ yard workers were trafficked to do post @@@ -@@ @ Hur@@ ric@@ ane Kat@@ r@@ ina reconstruction .
the story as I 've told it to you is mess@@ y and unfinished .
a confession : I am an archae@@ ologist and a museum cur@@ ator , but a paradox@@ ical one .
communities around the world don 't want to see their culture in distant institutions which they have no control over .
it helped introduce a little @@@ -@@ @ known art form for the world to appreciate .
no one can own or sell a War God .
starting in the 18@@ 6@@ 0s , Native American sk@@ elet@@ ons became a tool for science , collected in the thousands to prove new theories of social and racial hierarch@@ ies .
he said , " We give all of the objects to the world . "
and this do@@ es@@ n 't even require us to fully understand others ' beliefs , only that we respect them .
shortly after I walked into my new school , a huge fight broke out among the girls .
I started listing as force@@ fully as I could my expectations for their behavior and my expectations for what they would learn in school .
miss ! "
shortly as I approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter , and found the door locked with chains , I could hear Ash@@ ley 's voice in my ears going , " M@@ iss ! miss !
and then , there were the teachers , who were incredibly afraid for their own safety , so they had low expectations for the students and themselves , and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school 's culture .
stra@@ w@@ berry Man@@ sion was removed from the Persi@@ stently Dangerous List our first year after being -- ( Appl@@ ause ) -- after being on the Persi@@ stently Dangerous List for five consecutive years .
leaders make the impossible possible .
some of them are parents themselves , and some are completely alone .
if someone asked me my real secret for how I truly keep Stra@@ w@@ berry Man@@ sion moving forward , I would have to say that I love my students and I believe in their possibilities unconditionally .
but because of my amazing mother , I got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me .
every moment is a te@@ ac@@ hable moment .
I remind them -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I remind them of those core values of focus , tradition , excellence , integrity and perseverance , and I remind them every day how education can truly change their lives .
the mystery is this : what is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences , such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of vel@@ vet ?
now , Hu@@ x@@ ley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated , but he did@@ n 't know why .
why ? why have we made so little progress ?
now , there is a part of vision that 's like a camera : the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are 130 million photo@@ recep@@ tors , so the eye is like a 130 @@@ -@@ @ meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ el camera .
well , neuro@@ scientists tell us that they are creating , in real time , all the shapes , objects , colors , and motions that we see .
now , the screen of course is flat , so the three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional cu@@ be that you 're experiencing must be your construction .
so , when I have an experience that I describe as a red tom@@ ato , that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tom@@ ato that would exist even if I we@@ ren 't looking .
we are the off@@ spring of those who saw more accurately , and so we can be confident that , in the normal case , our perceptions are accurate .
a key notion in those equations is fitness .
so the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that h@@ ides reality and guides adaptive behavior .
space and time , as you perceive them right now , are your desktop .
well , not exactly .
but remember this example .
the same is true of the train .
I call this conscious realism . it 's actually a very different approach .
right . class , let 's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin .
I should have brought a sh@@ mat@@ a .
I think I have can@@ dies in my pur@@ se older than 18 years old .
just for inspiration , you understand .
you search for certain key words and you look -- Oh w@@ ow is right , young man .
you can 't imagine what I saw .
well , first of all , I was just trying to find , you know , couples , normal couples making love , but this , so many people together at one time .
like you would say , with the extreme sports .
they will later be able to re@@ constitute these as , like , my own actual memory , like actual experiences , so other people can , like , actually feel what I 'm feeling right now .
Oh , I 'm sorry , but you got to get into the spirit of it if you 're going to interview me .
but you see the sign ? you get it ? P @@@ -@@ @ I @@@ -@@ @ E @@@ -@@ @ C @@@ -@@ @ E. No justice , no piece of us .
right . so that , that is the unique part of it for me , right , is that I ended up in both , first in the con@@ vent , and then in the prostitution after . that 's right .
do@@ es@@ n 't it .
ye@@ ah , he 'd leave me notes tuc@@ ked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop so we could meet .
well , surprise , surprise , I fell in love with another f@@ ella much older than me , and I always say I was just so happy because he did@@ n 't drink , I married the ba@@ st@@ ard .
so there was a luc@@ r@@ ative market in that society in convincing all people they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life , right ?
though it was not all bad news either .
fro@@ wn . yes , perfect .
this is just a s@@ lim@@ med @@@ -@@ @ down demo .
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h , wr@@ ink@@ le your nose . awesome .
so val@@ ence is how positive or negative an experience is , and engagement is how expres@@ sive she is as well .
so what have we learned to date ?
what if , when I was in Cambridge , I had access to my real @@@ -@@ @ time emo@@ tion stream , and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way , just like I would 've if we were all in the same room together ?
and this makes many things fun , but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves .
it 's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what 's there . "
I 'll talk about that a little bit .
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more . we like more .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
but how simple ?
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular bi@@ ologist , I did@@ n 't like that at all .
so a k@@ id who 's 14 in high school gets this version of the Py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theore@@ m , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it 's not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
so they 're cutting out the little pieces of card@@ board here and p@@ asting them up .
now , what if we want to look at this more closely ?
( la@@ ughter ) One more .
ye@@ ah , there we go . ye@@ ah , OK ?
grand@@ ma Ru@@ by 's step@@ father Gra@@ m@@ ps was one of few black men to retire from Car@@ ne@@ gie 's mill with his pension .
it was met with no@@ stal@@ gic a@@ un@@ ts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts , who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home , that I exist for heter@@ os@@ exual marriage and child @@@ -@@ @ bearing .
naturally , I did not come out of the clos@@ et .
the kids at my school opened it without my permission .
called me by a name I did not recognize , said " lesbian , " but I was more boy than girl , more K@@ en than Barbie .
like God did@@ n 't save all this breath and mercy , like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus ' feet .
you had to have your camera ri@@ g tight in and your arm out , because the surge kept throwing you into the rocks while you 're scanning up for that beautiful photograph .
I don 't remember doing it .
well , phy@@ sic@@ ist brain then shows up and very cal@@ mly explains , " No , no , no , we 're at 50 feet , red wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths are atten@@ uated .
" let 's let that big old cloud of blood dissip@@ ate a bit before we have to surface through all of these shar@@ ks . "
so when I did surface , my warm @@@ -@@ @ blo@@ o@@ ded @@@ -@@ @ mam@@ mal brain was in an absolute gi@@ b@@ bering panic : " they don 't feed when they 're schooling . they don 't feed when they 're schooling .
now , it worked -- the hand itself did not work so well for several weeks after that , but eventually , fine motor skills returned .
so the orth@@ ope@@ dis@@ t says , " You know , we should get this out .
nothing too urgent , not an emergency . "
and got caught in a land@@ slide .
( la@@ ughter ) I know -- like , really ?
we have a wonderful 14 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter , who did all my illustrations .
it 's a love story .
so yes , my pel@@ vis is now part sea ur@@ chin .
you don 't need to worry , though : that I am not fully human is one of the things that my family loves the most about me .
( la@@ ughter ) And my three @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old ni@@ ece Sam@@ an@@ tha was in the thick of it .
( la@@ ughter ) According to my ni@@ ece and the 200 @@@ -@@ @ plus kids in the parking lot that day , this was the Anna and El@@ sa from " Fro@@ zen . "
it is a bl@@ az@@ ing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio .
( la@@ ughter ) There were card@@ board cut @@@ -@@ @ out snow@@ fla@@ kes covering the floor , gl@@ it@@ ter on every flat surface , and ic@@ ic@@ les all over the walls .
( la@@ ughter ) I mean , the Scandin@@ avian dec@@ ad@@ ence was mes@@ mer@@ izing .
it 's all or none , you 're with us or against us .
the problem with pol@@ arity and absolu@@ tes is that it eliminates the individu@@ ality of our human experience and that makes it contradictory to our human nature .
Don 't think it 's possible ?
those are the people I know , those are my friends and family , that is the majority of our society , that is you , that is me .
but the question is : can we own our du@@ ality ?
I work at a restaurant in town , I became really good friends with the Bus@@ ser .
her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico .
( la@@ ughter ) That line actually went the other way .
her English was limited , but significantly better than my Spanish .
she was from Mexico , she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home .
those were the things that brought us together .
( la@@ ughter ) And he said to her , [ in Spanish ] " Does As@@ h have a boy@@ friend ? "
and his smu@@ g smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect , gra@@ bbed his plate , walked off , went back to work .
she never made eye contact with me .
and a little bit later , they were jo@@ king around in the kitchen in Spanish , that had nothing to do with me , and that is du@@ ality .
she did@@ n 't have to choose some P.@@ C. stance on g@@ ay@@ ness over her heritage .
so overly sexual , so ' 7@@ 0s gay por@@ n .
if you don 't see my g@@ ay@@ ness , then you don 't see me .
they were all pl@@ ump and fully fea@@ thered and egg production had increased dramatically .
they 'd pec@@ ked the rest to death .
well , that 's the question a team at MI@@ T took to research .
this is measured by something called the Re@@ ading the M@@ ind in the E@@ yes Test .
it 's broadly considered a test for em@@ pa@@ thy , and the groups that scored highly on this did better .
and thirdly , the more successful groups had more women in them .
( appl@@ ause ) Now , was this because women typically score more highly on the Re@@ ading the M@@ ind in the E@@ yes Test , so you 're getting a doubling down on the em@@ pa@@ thy quo@@ ti@@ ent ?
so how does this play out in the real world ?
now , help@@ fulness sounds really an@@ em@@ ic , but it 's absolutely core to successful teams , and it routinely out@@ performs individual intelligence .
at SAP , they reck@@ on that you can answer any question in 17 minutes .
but there is@@ n 't a single high @@@ -@@ @ tech company I 've worked with that imag@@ ines for a moment that this is a technology issue , because what drives help@@ fulness is people getting to know each other .
now that sounds so obvious , and we think it 'll just happen normally , but it do@@ es@@ n 't .
when I was running my first software company , I realized that we were getting stuck .
they call it fi@@ ka , which means more than a coffee break .
at I@@ de@@ x@@ x , a company up in Main@@ e , they 've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business can work together and get to know the whole business that way .
have they all gone mad ?
companies don 't have ideas ; only people do .
and what moti@@ vates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other .
what matters is the mortar , not just the bric@@ ks .
conflict is frequent because cand@@ or is safe .
we 're used to talking about stars .
they were looking for what happened between the students , because that 's where the drama is .
it 's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers , because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves . "
now , rival@@ ry has to be replaced by social capital .
now we need everybody , because it is only when we accept that everybody has value that we will liber@@ ate the energy and imagination and momentum we need to create the best beyond measure .
I 'm a femin@@ ist , but I 'm a rather bad one .
Oh , so I call myself a B@@ ad F@@ emin@@ ist .
or at least , I wrote an ess@@ ay , and then I wrote a book called " B@@ ad F@@ emin@@ ist , " and then in interviews , people started calling me The B@@ ad F@@ emin@@ ist .
the femin@@ ist label was an accusation , it was an " F " word , and not a nice one .
we have the right to easy , affordable access to birth control , and reproductive services .
without this kind of inclusion , our femin@@ ism is nothing .
I think of them , and suddenly , the better choice becomes far easier to make .
and there , I wrote myself back together .
I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself .
but when our story begins , he was better known as John@@ ny " Bul@@ l " Wal@@ ker .
when the lion finally did relax its ja@@ ws , the lion tam@@ er just sl@@ um@@ ped to the ground , mo@@ tion@@ less .
now , the strong@@ man had@@ n 't told anyone , but he was actually a third @@@ -@@ @ year medical student .
he tou@@ red with the cir@@ cus during sum@@ mers to pay tuition , but kept it a secret to protect his person@@ a .
one night , The Ter@@ ri@@ ble Tur@@ k 's big to@@ e scrat@@ ched a scar like Cap@@ one 's down the side of his face .
there were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever , and yet , still the patient hurt .
it took too long , so he started organizing group meetings over lunch .
Bon@@ ica was shocked -- I 'm qu@@ oting him , he said , " What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there ?
the most important thing from the patient 's perspective , they don 't talk about . "
so over the next eight years , Bon@@ ica would talk about it .
he rec@@ ast the very purpose of medicine .
one recalled that he probably had more nerve @@@ -@@ @ block injec@@ tions than anyone else on the planet .
the strong@@ man and the human cann@@ on@@ balls re@@ united , showing off old scars , and new ones .
maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history , which is that his time in the cir@@ cus and wrestling deeply mol@@ ded his life .
when I was a k@@ id , they cut my hair , wi@@ ped my nose , tied my shoes .
I think most of you do , but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for au@@ tism .
five years ago , I decided to try to un@@ cover the answers to these questions .
that 's actually not surprising , because K@@ anner 's criteria for diagnos@@ ing au@@ tism were incredibly selective .
K@@ anner knew about this competing paper , but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work .
there is no other ty@@ po@@ graphic information or visual information on the front , and the name of the book is " Only What 's Nec@@ ess@@ ary . "
and it got my attention .
and so that 's a picture from Pe@@ arl Harb@@ or just gra@@ f@@ ted onto Los Angeles .
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't even have to complete the sentence . all right .
and we see this all the time .
so this is mystery we do not need .
this is using all the same elements .
call me crazy ! ( la@@ ughter ) [ " U@@ se@@ ful mystery " ] All right .
and this group was no different .
this story begins with Special Operations leaders , some of the most tested men in the United States military , saying , " We need women to help us wage this war . "
" needed more knowledge and more understanding . "
join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan . "
her death threw this program built for the shad@@ ows into a very public spot@@ light .
briefly , it works like this .
today , that infection , known as KPC , has spread to every state but three , and to South America , Europe and the Middle East .
next , we 'd probably lose surgery .
in just 70 years , we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster .
but then I was immediately cap@@ ti@@ vated by the magnific@@ ence of the energy around me .
then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me , " He@@ y ! we 've got a problem !
so I go into my business room , I pull out a three @@@ -@@ @ inch stack of business cards .
( la@@ ughter ) And so I say to him -- clear in my mind , I say to him : " this is J@@ ill ! I need help ! "
because I could not identify the position of my body in space , I felt enormous and expan@@ sive , like a gen@@ ie just liberated from her bottle .
these are the " we " inside of me .
and it 's a big problem : 1.2 million people are killed on the world 's roads every year .
it 's un@@ beli@@ evable .
but unlike a real self @@@ -@@ @ driving car , this one had a big aster@@ isk with it : they had to pay attention , because this was an experimental vehicle .
but at the end of it , he said , " Not only should I have it , everyone else should have it , because people are terrible drivers . "
the better the technology gets , the less reliable the driver is going to get .
so by just making the cars incre@@ mentally s@@ mar@@ ter , we 're probably not going to see the wins we really need .
so we 're looking at this graph , and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shou@@ ld@@ n 't .
we just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two .
they 'll happen , but very low frequency .
but let 's look at it from a different direction for a moment .
so let 's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing .
that 's like comparing how fast I run to the speed of light .
it do@@ es@@ n 't matter how hard I train , I 'm never actually going to get there .
and then once you have that problem solved , the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction .
so what we 're looking at is the scene with the cycl@@ ist again , and you might notice in the bottom , we can 't actually see the cycl@@ ist yet , but the car can : it 's that little blue box up there , and that comes from the laser data .
CU : right . no , that 's exactly right , and it 's not to say that the driver assistance systems are@@ n 't going to be incredibly valuable .
but in a play , a novel or a film , the writer makes all the decisions in advance for the characters , and as the audience , we can only watch , passi@@ vely , the consequences of his decisions .
today , I would like to introduce you to this new way of telling stories , a way that has inter@@ activity at its heart .
and your role -- you , the audience -- will be to make the choices .
there is a fish on the ground .
David C@@ age : save it ? save the fish ?
( video ) C : has it experienced an emotional shock recently ?
Cap@@ t A : I haven 't got a clu@@ e . does it matter ?
C : I need information to determine the best approach .
DC : OK , we are not going to learn anything from this guy .
g : you 're my b@@ esti@@ e , we 'll always be together !
DC : that was just one way of playing the scenes , but there are many other ways of playing it .
so that gives you an idea of what my work is about as an interactive writer .
where a linear writer needs to deal with time and space , as an interactive writer , I need to deal with time , space and possibilities .
I need to think about all the possibilities in a given scene and try to imagine everything that can happen .
I need to deal with thousands and thousands of variables , conditions and possibilities .
I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast .
I made my mind up there and then that one day , somehow , I was going to sa@@ il around the world .
finally , I bought a tiny din@@ gh@@ y .
just like in my dreams , there were amazing parts and tough parts .
just to give that boat some scale , I could climb inside her m@@ ast all the way to the top .
she was a multi@@ hull .
take that 50 , 60 , 70 , accelerate through to 80 , 90 , 100 miles an hour .
now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wi@@ pers , the windscreen , the head@@ lights and the brakes .
you 're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in , and you have to make every single decision on board .
the main@@ sa@@ il weighed three times my body weight , and after each change , I would collapse on the floor so@@ aked with swe@@ at with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat .
but out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contra@@ sted with the highest of the high@@ s .
against all odds , we 'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression .
the sky cleared , the rain stopped , and our heart@@ beat , the mon@@ strous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moon@@ lit mountains .
it 's entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity .
these figures cou@@ ld@@ n 't be exact , but we knew those materials were finite .
I had to make sense of it .
what lies before us is to expand them and scale them up .
they can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system , and it 's there for the taking right now , and the faster we do this , the better .
and they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily re@@ leg@@ ated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God .
in the United States of America , for instance , we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people , mostly black people and minorities , by putting them in prison .
when I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most , and I 'll be fairly brief , because I have a limited amount of time , as you know .
this is not a rare thing , although it 's against the law in most countries .
for every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
basically things only professionals know .
if I asked a coach to describe something like a pick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ roll , they would give me a description , and if I en@@ coded that as an algorithm , it would be terrible .
it really depends on the exact timing , the distances , the locations , and that 's what makes it hard .
so , luc@@ k@@ ily , with machine learning , we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know .
so we go to the machine and say , " Good morning , machine .
please find a way to tell the difference . "
the guy guarding the ball can either go over or under .
and it 's very exciting , it 's much more than the pick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ roll .
and it turns out the answer is yes .
if I 'm standing far away surrounded by defenders , that 's generally a bad shot .
but we never knew how good " good " was , or how bad " bad " was quanti@@ tatively .
until now .
what are their angles ?
so why is this important ?
( la@@ ughter ) Those are N@@ BA players .
the size is the size of the player and the color is the position .
machine understanding do@@ es@@ n 't just change how we look at players , it changes how we look at the game .
Miami was down by three , there was 20 seconds left .
( appl@@ ause ) R@@ ough@@ ly .

( la@@ ughter ) Way to go , D@@ aria .
you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement .
and so , whilst focusing on my breath , I had a strong sense of cal@@ m@@ ness , but I was certain that I was going to die .
like , my hair color or my shoe size is way more interesting .
and for a minute , I was angry .
and on this journey , I started to learn who they are , and they began to learn who I am .
and the anchor said to me , " But don 't you think it 's our job as journalists to sens@@ ation@@ alize a story ? "
and I was kind of having fun .
and when I had the minute of anger and hatred towards those press and journalists , I had to identify my inner big@@ o@@ try towards them .
so be@@ ware of your inner big@@ ot , and make friends from your enemies .
she entitled her po@@ em " I 'll Mar@@ ry When I W@@ ant . "
I 'll marry when I want . "
growing up in that country , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't make my own choices in life .
sometimes , they would share clothes , and even shoes .
the other girl is my little sister .
for my little sister , she ended up being pregnant .
you do not respect the traditions of our society , of our community . "
when I compared the two stories between me and my sister , I said , " Why can 't I do something ?
it was a great time I had with them .
nor did I just learn a little about them , but they were able to tell me their personal stories , what they were facing every day as young mothers .
we did not stop there .
and furthermore , I know that together , we can transform the legal , the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights .
I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation .
we can see trees being used to map morality , with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices , as you can see here , with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe .
I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees .
these are some remarkable trees of knowledge , or trees of science , by Spanish schol@@ ar Ram@@ on L@@ l@@ ull .
and L@@ l@@ ull was actually the precursor , the very first one who created the met@@ aph@@ or of science as a tree , a met@@ aph@@ or we use every single day , when we say , " Bi@@ ology is a branch of science , " when we say , " Gene@@ tics is a branch of science . "
and it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree .
but knowledge is much more intr@@ icate than this .
this is the typical organization chart .
Per@@ l is a famous programming language , and here , you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files , and working together on a given project .
so even though there 's no leader per se , these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization , the ones that know more about the past , and the future plans and goals of this particular cell .
and these are actually 15 different ty@@ polog@@ ies I 've been collecting over time , and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new met@@ aph@@ or .
as designers , researchers , and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems , they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields , like painting and sculpture , and influencing many different artists .
and we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways .
this is just one of many examples , where you can see this influence from science into art .
and on your right side , you have " Field 4 , " by Em@@ ma Mc@@ N@@ ally , using only graph@@ ite on paper .
and I just find this particular project to be immen@@ sely powerful .
and here 's yet another example of net@@ work@@ ism taken to a whole different level .
this was created by Japanese artist Chi@@ har@@ u Shi@@ ota in a piece called " In Sil@@ ence . "
but networks are also not just a new trend , and it 's too easy for us to dismiss it as such .
it was the middle of summer and well past closing time in the downtown Berk@@ ele@@ y bar where my friend Pol@@ ly and I worked together as bar@@ tenders .
not sure what I 'm going to do yet , " I told Pol@@ ly .
without hes@@ itation , she replied , " I 've had an abortion . "
I 'd graduated from college just a few months earlier and I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant .
and then I did .
between what happens in politics and what happens in real life , and in that gap , a battlefield mentality .
we needed a new framework that could hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk @@@ -@@ @ line .
" what do you hope for , now ? "
" God . "
when looking at materials that are currently being tested for their abilities to help reg@@ row muscle , our team noticed that after treating an injured muscle with these materials , there was a large number of immune cells in that material and the surrounding muscle .
and why , if we are equal in the eyes of God , are we not equal in the eyes of men ?
the decision maker , the person who gets to control the message , is sitting at the table , and unfortunately , in every single world faith , they are not women .
in 2011 , the Libyan revolution broke out , and my family was on the front lines .
so really , the United Nations just copied us .
imagine you did that , right ?
he said , what if addiction is@@ n 't about your chemical ho@@ oks ?
you 've got healthy relationships .
the most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs .
now , there 's a place that decided to do the exact opposite , and I went there to see how it worked .
I first met them at a retirement home in Los Angeles , where I had been photograph@@ ing for three years .
( la@@ ughter ) I was intri@@ gu@@ ed .
( la@@ ughter ) The tri@@ o set out on a daily adventure to coffee and dou@@ gh@@ nut shops , bus stops and street corners .
there was a sense that they were each year@@ ning for their tribe , but that comfort comes with compromise , because Will CA@@ N@@ NOT commit to one woman .
I did@@ n 't do it as well , but we managed to get Y@@ ous@@ so@@ u N '@@ D@@ our , S@@ ting , T@@ racy Cha@@ p@@ man , and Bru@@ ce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en to go ' round the world for Amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
( music ) Woman : life in the camp is never simple . even today life is difficult .
they kept telling us , " T@@ ell the truth ! " as they beat us .
no , not at all , no problem , take your time .
you can say a person is lying .
you can say you don 't trust newspapers .
all the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WIT@@ NE@@ SS .
and that is a slide taken from a TV set and it was pre @@@ -@@ @ processed to be very sympa@@ thetic to the TV medium , and it absolutely looks beautiful .
well , you have to remember that TV was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diag@@ onal .
I 'm very interested in touch @@@ -@@ @ sensitive displays .
OK . so there is the pressure @@@ -@@ @ sensitive display in operation .
and the particular display was built about six years ago , and when we moved from one room to another room , a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed .
and you then say , " There 's an opportunity for making convers@@ ational movies . " well , what does that mean ?
and it sort of ni@@ b@@ bles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium .
so , book writing is the same thing .
one is that this book knows about itself .
each frame of the movie has information about itself .
just a picture of the transmission , and as you rub your finger across the transmission it highlights the various parts .
narr@@ ator : this is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red .
N@@ N : I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language .
and yet you 've got to go to school to learn how to read , and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you .
hence , it must be harder . " well , it 's not harder .
on the other hand , you give a k@@ id -- a three @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old k@@ id -- a computer and they type a little command and -- Po@@ of ! -- something happens .
and the plastic heads , sometimes you want to project them .
( la@@ ughter ) Matthew is attracted to women with mus@@ cular cal@@ ves .
George said something that really stuck with me .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'm not alone .
scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work .
and that 's important because the males use their sperm to compete .
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay , they would not be able to do that very often .
Ari@@ sto@@ tle tried to get involved as well .
he then concluded that maybe be@@ es had the organs of both sexes in the same individual , which is not that far @@@ -@@ @ fet@@ ched , some animals do that , but he never really did get it fig@@ ured out .
and when I tell them that the fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ous army @@@ -@@ @ ant soldiers with their giant ja@@ ws , used to defend the colony , are all always female , they seem to not quite believe me .
well , what difference does this make ?
what difference does it make if they talk like Jer@@ ry Se@@ inf@@ eld ?
and females as a kind of variant -- something special that you only study after you get the basics down .
but when we do that , we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like .
they spec@@ ulate about the super@@ natural , maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us .
thank you .
we were going to do things better .
I don 't think the foundation did this because they were mon@@ strous .
and , " Jon@@ ah Le@@ h@@ rer is just a fri@@ gging soci@@ op@@ ath . "

we were getting Jon@@ ah because he was perceived to have mis@@ used his privilege , but Jon@@ ah was on the floor then , and we were still kic@@ king , and congratulating ourselves for pun@@ ching up .
and it began to feel we@@ ir@@ d and empty when there was@@ n 't a powerful person who had mis@@ used their privilege that we could get .
it did mine , and I thought what everybody thought that night , which was , " W@@ ow , somebody 's scre@@ wed !

J@@ us@@ tine was really uniting a lot of dispar@@ ate groups that night , from philanthro@@ pi@@ sts to " rape the bit@@ ch . "
when a woman gets sha@@ med , it 's , " I 'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uter@@ us . "
J@@ us@@ tine was asleep on a plane and unable to explain herself , and her inability was a huge part of the hil@@ arity .
on Twitter that night , we were like to@@ dd@@ lers cra@@ w@@ ling towards a gun .

everything is out of context , and that means context allows for everything : self Parking , Events Center , Shar@@ k Re@@ ef .
but , you might ask , why was the H@@ ig@@ gs bos@@ on included in the standard model , alongside well @@@ -@@ @ known particles like electr@@ ons and pho@@ tons and quar@@ ks , if it had@@ n 't been discovered back then in the 1970s ?
and you find this whether it 's world history , or mathematics , or science , or whatever it is .
these questions address fundamental issues about life , but maybe they seem a little es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic .
and in fact , it 's their differences that make them great drugs to treat different diseases .
for example , many proteins just are@@ n 't stable when you in@@ ject them into people .
these are just a couple of the types of stories that we 're going to see if life with an expanded vocabulary can tell .
and Rum@@ s@@ fel@@ d 's answer is , " Well , we don 't do body counts on other people . "
I wanted my monument to live in the world , and to circulate .
I remember when I was a boy in school , my teacher assigned us this classic ci@@ vic@@ s assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government .
and last summer , I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Mem@@ o author , Alber@@ to Gonz@@ ales .
Alber@@ to Gonz@@ al@@ ez : this is a special legal pad ?
MK : yes . you won 't believe me , but it 's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art ; I 'm an artist .
the paper you 're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion .
nevertheless , even though we don 't know each other , we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas .
and as long as everybody believes in the same fiction , everybody obe@@ ys and follows the same rules , the same norms , the same values .
so now give me this ban@@ ana . "
no ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee will ever believe such a story .
only humans believe such stories , which is why we control the world , whereas the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es are locked up in zo@@ os and research laboratories .
millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a c@@ rus@@ ade or a ji@@ had , because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell .
take a human being , cut him open , look inside , you will find the heart , the kid@@ neys , ne@@ ur@@ ons , hormones , DNA , but you won 't find any rights .
a mountain is an objective reality .
I can take this worth@@ less piece of paper , go to the supermarket , give it to a complete stranger whom I 've never met before , and get , in exchange , real ban@@ anas which I can actually eat .
that can work .
not everybody believes in God , not everybody believes in human rights , not everybody believes in nationalism , but everybody believes in money , and in the dollar bill .
their reality consists of objective entities , like rivers and trees and lions and ele@@ ph@@ ants .
in our world , too , there are rivers and trees and lions and ele@@ ph@@ ants .
after S@@ ap@@ iens , you wrote another one , and it 's out in Hebrew , but not yet translated into ...

can you elaborate for us ?
and then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be , " What do we need humans for ? , " or at least , " What do we need so many humans for ? "
some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses .
one venture capitalist , for example , invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members .
I also went fishing .
my poker mates may have been bl@@ u@@ ffing about the hands that they drew , but they we@@ ren 't bl@@ u@@ ffing about their social beliefs .
immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ia .
I gol@@ fed with retired LA@@ PD c@@ ops .
in 1993 , around 11,000 families and c@@ ops fled Los Angeles after the L.@@ A. racial unrest , for North I@@ da@@ ho , and they 've built an expatri@@ ated community .
in fact , it is said , North I@@ da@@ ho has more gun dealers than gas stations .
and in that note@@ pad I counted more Con@@ feder@@ ate flags than black people .
we don 't think we 're better than you , we just want to be away from you . "
rather , they emig@@ rate there for friend@@ liness , comfort , security , safety -- reasons that they implicitly associate to wh@@ it@@ eness in itself .
I was active in the youth ministry .
many Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ians feel pulled by merit , freedom , the all@@ ure of priv@@ atism -- privatized places , privatized people , privatized things .
many of my smu@@ g urban liberal friends cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe I would go on such a venture .
inter@@ personal race relations -- how we treat each other as human beings -- are va@@ stly better than in my parents ' generation .
( la@@ ughter ) And yet , some things haven 't changed .
one of the big contexts anim@@ ating my Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ian journey was the year 20@@ 42 .
as such , will there be more Wh@@ it@@ opi@@ as ?
in looking at this , the danger of Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ia is that the more segregation we have , the less we can look at and confront conscious and un@@ conscious bias .
( la@@ ughter ) I did@@ n 't expect to learn so much about myself .
I don 't expect I 'll be living in a Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ia -- or a Black@@ top@@ ia , for that matter .
I do plan to continue gol@@ fing every chance I get .
as an information designer , I 've worked with all sorts of data over the past 25 years .
I have a few insights to share , but first : a little history .
Or@@ acy , literacy and numer@@ acy were great developments in communication .
they allow us to en@@ code ideas into words and quantities into numbers .
Ale@@ c Gall@@ up , the former chairman of the Gall@@ up Organization , once handed me a very thick book .
our visual cor@@ te@@ x was built to dec@@ ode complex information and is a master at pattern recognition .
and businesses can do it in three simple ways .
ear@@ marking may seem like smart business or smart philanthro@@ py on paper , but it do@@ es@@ n 't make any sense when you 're looking the person in the eye .
you see , I 'd associated an eye test with wearing glasses and looking different , not with seeing differently .
when eventually I was persuaded to go , the op@@ tom@@ etr@@ ist fitted me with the trial lenses and was shocked at just how poor my sight was .
it was breath@@ taking .
but I soon realized that this opportunity was not universal .
people wanted to fund specific projects or particular diseases or sub@@ sets of the population .
simply put , it 's called financing .
and as we 've shown , it do@@ es@@ n 't make just a health and social difference , it creates huge economic benefit .
for example , of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011 , 196 of them were between a state and a non @@@ -@@ @ state actor .
but since its creation in the early 1980s , Hezbollah has also set up a political party , a social @@@ -@@ @ service network , and a military apparatus .
similarly , the Palestinian Hamas , known for its suicide attacks against Israel , also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007 .
they build schools , they run hospitals , they set up vocational @@@ -@@ @ training programs or micro @@@ -@@ @ loan programs .
and the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated , the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state .
I 'm going to go right into the slides .
and my ideas are -- in my head , anyway -- they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on and problem solving for clients .
let me go right into the slides .
I don 't want you to see what I 'm doing up here .
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings I liked or not .
and it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture , that R@@ ick@@ y and I worked on furniture by the sl@@ ice .
( la@@ ughter ) And I made some sket@@ ches on n@@ ap@@ kins -- little boxes and Mor@@ andi @@@ -@@ @ like things that I used to do .
and the client said , " Why no fish ? "
but he was right -- I cou@@ ld@@ n 't do the tail .
and I made the object on the left for my show at the Wal@@ ker .
and the next night , we had ge@@ fil@@ te fish .
( la@@ ughter ) I play with funny people like [ Cla@@ es ] Ol@@ den@@ burg .
dressed up like the AT & amp ; T building by Cla@@ es -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) with a fish hat .
and so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link , which nobody will forgive me for .
and he pushed that .
I had the bin@@ ocul@@ ars from Cla@@ es , and I put them there , and I could never get rid of them after that .
I just tell the stories .
and so Stan@@ ley did the little d@@ ome thing .
the reality , with the lake -- the work@@ manship is pretty bad .
and it reminded me why I play def@@ en@@ sively in things like my house .
he was too busy .
this is the city hall over here somewhere , and the cour@@ thouse .
so , the c@@ enter@@ line of this thing -- we 'd preserve it , and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by P@@ elli and Ko@@ hn Pe@@ derson Fox , etc . , that are underway .
I don 't know how to do it from here .
focus the one on the right .
this is the bedroom .
and the bed is back in this space , with windows looking out onto the lake .
Palais des Sports , the G@@ are de Ly@@ on over here .
and the French have this extraordinary way of scre@@ wing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off .
I showed you the other model , the one -- this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing -- so I understood the problem .
so it would all be built in stone , in French lime@@ stone , except for this metal piece .
and it faces into a park .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
we 've had a lot of fun working together .
the light grid will have a light , be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling .
these are offices , which , really , in the competition , we did@@ n 't have to design .
but everybody liked these forms and liked the space , and so that 's one of the problems of a competition .
you have to then try and get that back in some way .
everybody liked the sur@@ round .
when you get into a box , it 's harder to do it -- and here we are , struggling with how to put the hotel in .
and this is a te@@ ap@@ ot I designed for Al@@ ess@@ i .
and of course it 's not going to look like that , but it is the crazy way I tend to work .
Lar@@ ry Hal@@ pr@@ in is doing the stairs .
time goes on .
I think in pictures , not words .
( appl@@ ause ) A few years ago , when I started doing presentations , I went to get head shots done for the first time .
and so I tried , really .
I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now , though .
and I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment , but within days of them prescri@@ bing a new medication , my life turned into an episode of the Wal@@ king De@@ ad .
but there 's a gap between where that stands , and how I communicate it with the rest of the world .
I spent a lot of time thinking if there 's a better way , and I think there is : au@@ tism @@@ -@@ @ assi@@ s@@ tive technology .
but the problem that 's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can 't be shared if there are communication road@@ blocks .
( la@@ ughter ) But the goal of au@@ tism @@@ -@@ @ assi@@ s@@ tive technology is bigger than that , and more important .
in addition , we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world , in real time .
already , a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete He@@ For@@ She commitments .
( appl@@ ause ) The government of Sweden , under its current femin@@ ist government , has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term .
once a memory has been en@@ coded , it can be remembered , or retrieved , later .
in the first two stages , moderate stress can actually help experiences enter your memory .
and the weeks , months , or even years of sustained cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids that result from chronic stress can damage the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus and decrease your ability to form new memories .
the reason for this in@@ hibition is so the fight / flight / freeze response can over@@ rule slower , more reasoned thought in a dangerous situation .
and then the act of trying to remember can itself be a stres@@ sor , leading to a vicious cycle of more cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid release and an even smaller chance of rememb@@ ering .
so what can you do to turn stress to your advantage and stay calm and collected when it matters the most ?
growing up , stories of next @@@ -@@ @ door neighbors having to set up fake energy accounts or having to steal energy seemed normal to me .
as a result , those with high energy burdens have a greater likelihood of conditions like heart disease and asth@@ ma .
the technology is here .
however , even as we approach cost parity , the majority of those who own solar earn much more than the average American .
so we start by working directly with the communities that have the highest energy burdens .
we 're even working directly with elected officials , advocating for more equitable pricing , because to see this vision of energy equity and resilience succeed , we have to work together sustainably .
now , the US spends over three billion a year on energy bill payment assistance .
and these programs do help millions of people , but they 're only able to help a fraction of those in need .
but by building energy equity and resilience into our communities , we can assure fair and impartial access to energy that is clean , reliable and affordable .
this is life @@@ -@@ @ changing .
thank you .
you sw@@ allow an aspir@@ in .
one day , I sat and thought , " Can we deliver anti @@@ -@@ @ HIV directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? "
well , we shine a very powerful but super @@@ -@@ @ tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV @@@ -@@ @ infected cells while these cells are immer@@ sed in liquid containing the drug .
but one day , if successful , this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body .
I want that to sink in for a second : our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first .
and increasingly , over the last couple years , Sil@@ icon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult .
and in fact , that 's what 's happening .
in short , the tech companies have democrati@@ zed encryption .
what that means is that if the drug dealers ' telephone calls or the terrorists ' telephone calls can be intercep@@ ted , then so can the rest of ours , too .
you have no way of controlling whether it 'll be used by your side or the other side , by good guys , or by bad guys .
yes , this means that in the future , encryption is going to make wi@@ ret@@ apping more difficult .
I want you to use these tools .
I want you to tell your loved ones , I want you to tell your colleagues : use these encrypted communications tools .
they did@@ n 't find it .
but what I 'm most excited about , and several other lab@@ s as well , is that this may even apply to the brain .
we had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings 20 to 89 years of age , and we measured over 100 of these communication factors , these hormone @@@ -@@ @ like proteins that transport information between tissues .
and what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group , about half the factors changed significantly .
and to do this , we used a test . it 's called a Bar@@ nes ma@@ ze .
what we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment .
but maybe we discovered that the Foun@@ tain of Youth is actually within us , and it has just dried out .
now , quantum biology is@@ n 't new ; it 's been around since the early 19@@ 30s .
this is the domain of quantum mechanics , and physi@@ ci@@ sts and chem@@ ists have had a long time to try and get used to it .
I don 't blame the bi@@ ologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics .
Er@@ win Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger , of Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger 's C@@ at f@@ ame , was an Austrian phy@@ sic@@ ist .
but as I mentioned at the start , in the last 10 years , there have been experiments emerging , showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics .
enzy@@ mes , those work@@ horses of life , the cataly@@ sts of chemical reactions -- enzy@@ mes are biom@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells , by many , many orders of magnitude .
well , it was discovered that one of the tric@@ ks that enzy@@ mes have evolved to make use of , is by transferring sub@@ atomic particles , like electr@@ ons and indeed pro@@ tons , from one part of a molec@@ ule to another via quantum tun@@ n@@ eling .
again , this is not a new idea ; it goes all the way back to the early 6@@ 0s .
it 's speculative , but it 's one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mu@@ tations , surely this must have big implications , to understand certain types of mu@@ tations , possibly even those that lead to turning a cell can@@ cer@@ ous .
my third and final example is the most beautiful , wonderful idea .
two quantum @@@ -@@ @ ent@@ ang@@ led electr@@ ons within a single molec@@ ule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth 's magnetic field .
but I believe it 's built on solid science .
but what is it , exactly ?
well , it 's hard to acquire Ebola , but if you do , the risk of a horri@@ ble death is high .
and so , that 's the clu@@ e .
we may have it some@@ day .
we fear the certain inev@@ itability that comes with Ebola .
we 've known about Ebola since 1976 .
we 've known what it 's capable of .
this goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases .
as for Ebola , there is absolutely no market at all , so the only reason we have two vaccines in late @@@ -@@ @ stage clinical trials now , is actually because of a somewhat mis@@ guided fear .
well , partially , because it was really difficult -- or thought to be difficult -- to weap@@ on@@ ize the virus , but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it .
vaccine development is expensive and complicated .
it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well @@@ -@@ @ known anti@@ gen and turn it into a viable vaccine .
fortunately for diseases like Ebola , there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers .
and yet , we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily certain as epidemic infectious diseases .
you know , my friends , I look at this photograph and I have to ask myself , you know , I think I 've seen this somewhere before .
and identifying as an African @@@ -@@ @ American woman , I know things have gotten better .
but even as I learned about public safety , I wondered if what I was doing on the street was hur@@ ting or har@@ ming the community .
but there is one thing that I knew .
there is a lot of history with us .
the relationship between the African American community and the police is a painful one .
and it really did@@ n 't allow the officers the opportunity to get to know the community in which they serve .
you bring people into the space that come with separate expertise , and you also come with new ideas and lived experience , and you produce a new knowledge .
so this is how it works .
the important part of this is you 've got to go to the meeting .
so the new way of delivering it is through what we call neighborhood coordinating officers , or N@@ CO@@ s .
so , for example , in Washington Heights .
the co@@ production of public safety also means that officers need to understand the history and the power of their uniforms .
they 're stereotypes that often influence our decision making .
this is critical .
and they have to recognize their own trauma .
we also have to recognize that the community may not be willing or ready to come to the table to have the conversation .
by acknowledging it , it also means that we care for the community 's health and for their resili@@ ency as well .
that 's another key component .
but we CA@@ N@@ NOT walk away .
and we know this because the NY@@ PD 's neighborhood policing philosophy is grounded in the co@@ production of public safety .
and in order to do that , there are three fundamental ideologies that we must all agree to .
Oh , I 'm sorry , one more time -- are you ready ?
audience : yes !
Trac@@ ie Ke@@ es@@ ee : now , that 's better , al@@ right .
we know why .
we must move forward together . there 's no more us versus them .
and number three : we must also make sure that truth and telling facts is painful .
but we also know that no action is no longer acceptable .
and agree ?
T@@ K : so we do know there is a better way .
over a million people are killed each year in disasters .
if you can reduce the initial response by one day , you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days , or three years .
these are the UA@@ Vs .
and they 're used extensively since 2005 -- Hur@@ ric@@ ane Kat@@ r@@ ina .
let me show you how this hum@@ ming@@ bird , this ro@@ tor@@ craft , works .
fantastic for structural engineers .
you 've got things like this fixed @@@ -@@ @ wing , this ha@@ w@@ k .
that 's where you 're pulling imagery together and getting 3D reconstruction .
the search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing .
in seven hours , going from Ar@@ l@@ ington , driving from the In@@ cid@@ ent Command Post to the site , flying the UA@@ Vs , processing the data , driving back to Ar@@ l@@ ington command post -- seven hours .
it 's a game chan@@ ger .
and don 't just think about the UA@@ Vs .
well , why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very , very important ?

we 're all really made up of the same stuff , in the same box .
because , basically , I work as a theoretical phy@@ sic@@ ist .
but the kids were the best part .
and they we@@ ren 't used to that .
another one is that I met a min@@ er . he was home on his three @@@ -@@ @ month leave from the mines .
and you know what it was ? Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are . " and he rec@@ ited some to me .
we live in one of these worlds , and I can only show it as a sheet , but it 's really three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional .

furthermore , there 's an experimental way to tell this theory , apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before .
then there 's HIV / AIDS . and then there are deaths from war .
it just do@@ es@@ n 't exist scientifically .
well , as a Cambridge professor , I had many contacts .
it 's a beautiful building . we decided we would refurb@@ ish it and then put out the word : we 're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel .
the students don 't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.
we had some of the students fil@@ med at home before they came to A@@ IMS .
my understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot .
you know , from physics to medicine , in particular , epidem@@ i@@ ology and also mathematical modeling .
and he 's shown here with his favorite high school teacher .
Stephen H@@ aw@@ king : that is nice .
she 's a phy@@ sic@@ ist , and somehow stays smil@@ ing , in spite of everything going on back home .
well , I said we also have a plan . and our plan is quite simple .
we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers , as it does at A@@ IMS .
we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .
and our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this .
easy to remember the basic rules we need .
it 's called the Gi@@ ant Mag@@ ell@@ an Tel@@ es@@ cope , or GMT .
that 's almost 27 feet .
it 's comparable to the size of the Stat@@ ue of Liberty .
we 've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion .
so we 're looking now at the deepest image of the cos@@ mos that 's ever been taken .
there are 500 of those that are multiple @@@ -@@ @ planet systems .
it 's an international project .
it also involves Chile .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's one five @@@ -@@ @ thous@@ and@@ ths of the width of one of my ha@@ irs , over this entire 27 feet .
so , what does that precision buy us ?
my guess that even in the front row , you can 't see that .
and if we were -- ( Appl@@ ause ) If an astr@@ on@@ aut went up to the Moon , a quarter of a million miles away , and lit a cand@@ le -- a single cand@@ le -- then we would be able to detect it , using the GMT .
this is what this cluster would look like .
extraordinary precision .
so , where are we ?
we have now level@@ ed the top of the mountain@@ top in Chile .
W@@ end@@ y Fre@@ ed@@ man : in terms of the science , they 're very complementary .
productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society .
so we have a problem .
eight teams in the final .
let 's watch the race .
those who carry the bat@@ on are slower , but their bat@@ on is faster .
miracle of cooperation : it multipl@@ ies energy , intelligence in human efforts .
it is the essence of human efforts : how we work together , how each effort contributes to the efforts of others .
in the legs of the next run@@ ner .
this is what is killing productivity , what makes people suffer at work .
when we blame personalities instead of the clarity , the accountability , the measurement , we add injustice to in@@ effectiveness .
did you throw it , or did you pass it effectively ?
am I putting my energy in what can get measured -- my legs , my speed -- or in passing the bat@@ on ?
it then became open source , and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location .
it 's the user reviews .
some of the un@@ scrup@@ ulous dealers were running away with peoples ' bit@@ coin before they 'd ma@@ iled the drugs out .
the more time we spend online , the more we worry about them , and those surveys show our worries are growing .
the dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hi@@ de@@ out for whi@@ stle @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ ow@@ ers .
it 's not one side or the other that 's going to win out , but both .
Chris An@@ derson : you were something of a mathematical phen@@ om .
he called Taylor ; that took 10 minutes .
I was fired five minutes after that .

but so often it comes back to save the day .
this is a tor@@ us , or the surface of a dou@@ gh@@ nut : 16 ver@@ tices covered by these rect@@ angles , 32 edges , 16 faces .
you design an algorithm , you test it out on a computer .

how on earth could you trade looking at that , and see something that was@@ n 't just random ?
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't make a business out of that .
so , is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anom@@ alies , and see when they align ?
but these things f@@ ade after a while ; anom@@ alies can get washed out .
JS : we charged the highest fees in the world at one time .
ca : but should we worry about the he@@ dge fund industry attracting too much of the world 's great mathematical and other talent to work on that , as opposed to the many other problems in the world ?
JS : well , it 's not just mathematical .
this is your wife , Mar@@ il@@ yn .
she kept the books , and so on .
there 's a great morale among them .
next year , it 'll be 1,000 and that 'll be 10 percent of the math and science teachers in New York [ City ] public schools .
origins of life is a fascinating question .
the first question is a tor@@ tu@@ ous path from geology up to R@@ NA or something like that -- how did that all work ?
so what 's pic@@ tured there is a star in formation .
and it takes them about a million years to settle out .
so , in steady state , there are about two million stars in formation at any time .
but on the other hand , given all this organic dust that 's floating around , we could have lots of friends out there .
today I 'm going to talk about work .
I 'm not talking about the technology of things , profound though that is .
because if people believe that they 're true , they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with these very false ideas .
and that 's how the industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day 's work , except for the pay at the end of the day .
and so you people -- pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe -- you people should be asking yourself a question , as you go back home to run your organizations .
to get past Imperial customs , all packages must follow a strict protocol : if a box is marked with an even number on the bottom , it must be sealed with a red top .
two are facing down : one marked with a four , and one with a seven .
but in fact , only two of them matter .
the protocol says that if a box has an even number , then it should have a red top .
so we don 't need to check the box with the red li@@ d .
but in this case , they 're based on familiar real @@@ -@@ @ world needs , and we easily understand that while vege@@ tari@@ ans only eat vegetables , they 're not the only ones who do so .
so I guess we 're all patients .
now , let me introduce you to Frank .
many did , but he went for it , while he still could .
frank 's decision , while maybe dramatic , is exactly the kind so many of us would make , if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time .
cleaning crew sw@@ o@@ ops in , the body 's whis@@ ked away , and it all feels as though that person had never really existed .

" play " may sound like a funny word here .
but I also knew that global ther@@ mon@@ uclear war was something to be concerned with .
we launched two wars .
we spent tril@@ lions of dollars .
everybody has the same world@@ view , and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat .
that 's a danger .
and so what are those trends ?
we may enter a period of constant warfare , and we know this because we 've been in it for several years .
we don 't know .
it 's a gesture -- it 's not a deterrent .
the relations between great powers -- we thought we were past the bi@@ polar era .
you 've got countries saying no , if the Internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders .

the one thing I wanted was data -- facts .
B@@ J@@ K : no , well , if we want to talk -- OK , I 've been doing my little mini @@@ -@@ @ survey .
and I 'm pretty excited , like it 's good , and they get this face -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) " Oh , you mean the ' Me ' generation ? "

what do men have to do with gender equality ?
now , I was@@ n 't always a middle class white man .
we said , OK , let 's have a study group .
we 'll read a text , we 'll talk about it , we 'll have a pot@@ luck dinner .
( la@@ ughter ) So every week , 11 women and me got together .
one of the women was white , and one was black .

( la@@ ughter ) So I hope you all can see , this is what objectivity looks like .
it was a quote from one of the men , and the quote was , " A Black Woman St@@ ole My Job . "
it 's reverse discrimination against us . "
it is called " the history of the world . "
( la@@ ughter ) E@@ ven within Europe , those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness .
research by Cat@@ aly@@ st and others has shown conclu@@ sively that the more gender @@@ -@@ @ equal companies are , the better it is for workers , the hap@@ pier their labor force is .
they have an easier time recruiting .
this rid@@ dle went something like this .

these data were collected over a really long period of time .

the goal was to have a one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one ratio with every one of these students .

they 're all working next to each other . it 's all a creative endeav@@ or .
so every day , there 's a field trip where they together create a book -- you can see it being typed up above .
so then they said , " Why don 't you come into the schools ?

hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . so , visit the site .
some of these kids just don 't plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
so here are a couple of sample questions .
number 12 : if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability , what would it be ?
within a month , the article would receive over 8 million views , and I was , to say the least , under@@ prepared for this sort of attention .
and I promptly turned bright red .
my own relationship was only a few months old , and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place .
Dr. Arthur Ar@@ on first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997 , and here , the researcher 's goal was not to produce romantic love .
" I think she just wants to be friends . "
maybe it 's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together .
( la@@ ughter ) But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone , and the hope that he will choose to love me back , and it is terri@@ fying , but that 's the deal with love .
a question I 'm often asked is , where did I get my passion for human rights and justice ?
I led trade delegations here to the United States , to Japan , to India , to encourage investment , to help to create jobs , to build up our economy , to build up our health system , our education -- our development .
but , in recent years , at the time of this conversation , they had nothing but long periods of drought , and then flash flooding , and then more drought .
all the countries have developed with fossil fuels , and then may be moving to renewable energy .
in Hawa@@ ii , they 're passing legislation to have 100 percent renewable energy by 20@@ 45 .
in Costa Rica , they have committed to being carbon @@@ -@@ @ neutral by 2021 .
they had the capacity , they had a sense of being driven by never again must the world have this kind of problem .
2015 is a year that is similar in its importance to 1945 , with similar challenges and similar potential .
it 's an issue for the trade union movement .
and we have to build on that .
that 's what this year is about .
we have to reach a new level of consciousness , a higher moral ground .
I 'm gu@@ essing this room is different , but that 's the average that Del@@ o@@ it@@ te has done with their studies .
and I realized that so many people around us are climbing their way up this lad@@ der that someone tells them to climb , and it ends up being lean@@ ed up against the wrong wall , or no wall at all .
and if we don 't spend time paying attention to that and assimil@@ ating that learning and applying it to the rest of our lives , it 's all for nothing .
and Live Your Leg@@ end and the movement we 've built w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't exist if I did@@ n 't have this comp@@ ass to identify , " W@@ ow , this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with . "
either way , we start to believe it .
the things is , everything was impossible until somebody did it .
I 'm terri@@ fied of deep , dark , blue water .

and he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster .
and the thing is , it 's starting to happen on a widespread level .
and as we finish up , I have just one question to ask you guys , and I think it 's the only question that matters .
" I 'm not a national , " I proclaimed on@@ stage .
I have no relationship with the United States , all 50 of them , not really .
my experience is where I 'm from .
in snow@@ y North America , ours were rit@@ uals of the global South .
my mother in Accra , my twin sister in Boston , my best friends in New York : these relationships are home for me .
" R " number two , relationships .
we 're local where we carry out our rit@@ uals and relationships , but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions .
we 're using a kind of shor@@ th@@ and .
that 's why Ol@@ u says , " I 'm German , but my parents come from Nigeria . "
then we have the schol@@ ar William De@@ resi@@ e@@ wic@@ z 's writing of elite American colleges .
perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them .
we 're visual creatures , so we use what we see to teach us what we know .
in the E@@ ver@@ gl@@ ades , they are the very architects of the E@@ ver@@ gl@@ ades , because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season , they start excav@@ ating these holes called G@@ ator holes .
and now this is@@ n 't just affecting them , other animals also depend on this relationship , so they become a key@@ stone species as well .
and we 're down to less than 70 n@@ esting pairs in Florida Bay today , because we 've disrupted the system so much .
so all these different organizations are shou@@ ting , they 're scre@@ aming , " The E@@ ver@@ gl@@ ades is fragile ! it 's fragile ! "
and sadly , the E@@ ver@@ gl@@ ades is very commonly left out of that conversation .
but the E@@ ver@@ gl@@ ades is not just a test .
we don 't do things like that .
but that 's the ir@@ ony .
they were hun@@ g and then dec@@ ap@@ itated .
perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a be@@ heading and remain un@@ moved and even be disappointed was the introduction in France in 17@@ 92 of the guil@@ lo@@ tine , that famous dec@@ ap@@ itation machine .
to them , watching the guil@@ lo@@ tine in action , it was so quick , there was nothing to see .
the end of tor@@ tu@@ rous public judicial executions in Europe and America was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal , but it was also partly because the crowd ob@@ stin@@ ately refused to behave in the way that they should .
it 's nothing to do with me .
people used to say , " Oh , the sh@@ run@@ ken head museum , the sh@@ run@@ ken head museum ! "
well , five years ago , I was diagnosed with Par@@ kin@@ son 's disease .
I do not feel diminished by Par@@ kin@@ son 's ; I feel dis@@ til@@ led by it , and I actually very much like the woman I 'm dis@@ til@@ ling into .
everyone here was you once .
you 've sw@@ allowed hard the contents of the " Dr@@ ink Me " bottle , and felt yourself shr@@ ink .
it demands col@@ os@@ sal patience , all this growing small : your diminished sleep at night , your hand@@ writing , your voice , your height .
it is a place of mer@@ cil@@ ess poetry , a gift of presence previously ignored , dro@@ wned in the daily clu@@ tter .
nothing is automatic .

we need bio@@ fluo@@ res@@ cence to show our true colors .

finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his compound , the word spread all over .
we were training women 's rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law .
we were giving all kinds of training .
and of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very sc@@ ary , but I was really sha@@ king up .
and you know , Kor@@ an says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . "
( la@@ ughter ) And I tell you one thing : that 's the way you work with those people , and you know -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) So by that time , they started speaking P@@ ash@@ to .
but also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban -- of course during the Taliban there is another story .
and one day , with four trainers and one body@@ guard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
they said , " No@@ thing . " they called my name .
but still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
we know where you are going .
every day you go up north here and there .
I was sha@@ ken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , " What am I going to do ? "
how am I going to solve this problem ?
at that time , she said , " OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
and I want to tell you the other side .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you .
surrounded by people , yet utterly alone .
for 13 long years , that was my reality .
for the first 12 years of my life , I was a normal , happy , healthy little boy .
the stark reality hit me that I was going to spend the rest of my life locked inside myself , totally alone .
no one would ever love me .
I had no dreams , no hope , nothing to look forward to .
I don 't know if it 's truly possible to express in words what it 's like not to be able to communicate .
whether I was laid on my side or stra@@ pped into my wheelchair .
I think because Bar@@ ney is so happy and j@@ ol@@ ly , and I absolutely was@@ n 't , it made it so much worse .
I was a silent , invisible observer of how people beha@@ ved when they thought no one was watching .
despite what they thought , I did feel .
hurt , sad@@ ness and anger floo@@ ded through me .
but neither of my parents knew this was happening .
perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped .
seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day .
an arom@@ a@@ therap@@ ist began coming to the care home about once a week .
I had so many words in my mind , that I cou@@ ld@@ n 't wait to be able to share them .
I started to feel whole again , a man worthy of love .
I used the power of words and will to challenge the pre@@ conceptions of those around me and those I had of myself .
all this is how the world knows who we are .
once , I was perceived to be an in@@ anim@@ ate object , a min@@ dless ph@@ an@@ tom of a boy in a wheelchair .
we are told that actions speak lou@@ der than words .
but I wonder , do they ?
so this is a graph of the CO2 emissions at the left @@@ -@@ @ hand side from fossil fuel and industry , and time from before the Industrial Revolution out towards the present day .
the second thing is that we as human beings don 't experience global average temperatures .
some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century , maybe much longer .
and that tells us something about these trajec@@ tories .
but if we don 't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term , then we will have to do that even sooner .
so because it 's the area under the curve that matters , we need to focus on energy efficiency , but also on energy conservation -- in other words , using less energy .
you behave in a committed way , and then you begin to understand the tru@@ ths of religion .
now , pride of place in this practice is given to compassion .
we formed you , says the Qur@@ an , into tribes and nations so that you may know one another .
here in the United States , I think you see it in this election campaign : a l@@ onging for change .
this comes from " The I@@ li@@ ad . " but it tells you what this spirituality should be .
but we 've done relatively little to address it .
we understand less about the science of Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's than other diseases because we 've invested less time and money into research@@ ing it .
today we know they 're made from protein molecules .
that 's what we see in the bra@@ ins of Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's patients .
cutting others might make the bomb explore .
and together , we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease .
let 's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in wor@@ ms .
we need you to raise awareness that Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's is a disease and that if we try , we can beat it .
but Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves .
Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's is@@ n 't , for the most part , a genetic disease .
you can just hold up fingers .
but then I would discover something new and totally different , and I would di@@ ve into that .
this pattern caused me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons .
I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing , deny all of my other pas@@ sions , and just resign myself to being bo@@ red .
I worried that there was something wrong with this , and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything .
I 'll tell you where you learned it : you learned it from the culture .
when we 're about five years old .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's considered an inno@@ cu@@ ous question , posed to little kids to el@@ icit cu@@ te replies , like , " I want to be an astr@@ on@@ aut , " or " I want to be a ball@@ er@@ ina , " or " I want to be a pir@@ ate . "
you have to choose . "
but it 's more than that .
well , there is no room for someone like you in this framework .
you might feel like you don 't have a purpose .
actually , during the Renaissance period , it was considered the ideal to be well @@@ -@@ @ ver@@ sed in multiple disciplines .
I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community , we CA@@ N@@ NOT agree on a single identity .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's easy to see your multi@@ potenti@@ ality as a limitation or an afflic@@ tion that you need to overcome .
one : idea synthesis .
that is , combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection .
the second multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super@@ power is rapid learning .
when multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites become interested in something , we go hard .
nor@@ a Dun@@ n is a full @@@ -@@ @ time travel@@ er and freel@@ ance writer .
the third multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super@@ power is adap@@ tability ; that is , the ability to mor@@ ph into whatever you need to be in a given situation .
he 's even more valuable because he can take on various roles , depending on his clients ' needs .
as a society , we have a vested interest in encouraging multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites to be themselves .
you came out of the wom@@ b knowing you wanted to be a pedi@@ atric neuro@@ surgeon .
so with that said , if there is one thing you take away from this talk , I hope that it is this : embrace your inner wiring , whatever that may be .
but to the multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites in the room , including those of you who may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) to you I say : embrace your many pas@@ sions .
and then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said , " But Sand@@ rine , these are adult patients -- adults do not grow new nerve cells . "
and what we 've known already for very long , is that this is important for learning , memory , mood and emo@@ tion .
you might think this is not much , compared to the billions of ne@@ ur@@ ons we have .
and more interesting to my colleague Robert is the research we have been doing on neuro@@ gene@@ sis and depression .
increasing ?
learning will increase the production of these new ne@@ ur@@ ons .
yes , stress will decrease the production of new ne@@ ur@@ ons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus .
( la@@ ughter ) Yes , you are right , it will increase the production of new ne@@ ur@@ ons .
we also need to find a way to protect the neuro@@ gene@@ sis of Robert 's patients .
and on your side -- I leave you in charge of your neuro@@ gene@@ sis .
thank you .
or is it really just about aerob@@ ic exercise , getting oxygen to the brain ?
ST : so for the moment , we can 't really say if it 's just the running itself , but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production -- or moving the blood flow to the brain , should be beneficial .
M@@ H : so I don 't have to get a running wheel in my office ?
Sand@@ rine Th@@ u@@ ret , thank you so much .

I was a first @@@ -@@ @ time founder .
it was not designed to s@@ prin@@ kle capital across many companies that have the potential to succeed but for less , like my own .

it was the first week of the program .
we should do an IC@@ O that combines the value of all of our companies and raise money as a group . "
the currency acts similar to shares in a company , like on the public stock market , increasing in value as it 's traded online .
and we decided to cooperate , rather than compete .
mathematical string theories suggest descriptions of this unification , in addition to a fundamental structure for sub @@@ -@@ @ atomic quar@@ ks and electr@@ ons .
if I was to take an M@@ RI of every person in this audience , 60 percent of you would show signs of bone de@@ generation and car@@ til@@ age de@@ generation like this .
these cells are dying to form car@@ til@@ age .
these stem cells have come in and repaired , in yellow , the bone , in white , the car@@ til@@ age , almost completely .
and then the next question was , are there organs ?
can you build this as an organ outside the body ?
could you patent an environment ?
could we imagine that for our future ?
I 've talked a lot about models . I began this talk with models .
that 's what we do as scientists .
but when a scientist is building a model , he or she is trying to show you the world in met@@ aph@@ or .
there 's a lot of talk in techn@@ olog@@ yland about the person@@ alization of medicine , that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically , your gen@@ ome , your current context .
Sid@@ d@@ har@@ tha Muk@@ her@@ je@@ e : it 's a very interesting question .
one is imposed on the environment , the other creates it .
they grow .
and in our smallest units of life , our cells , we carry all the information that 's required for every other cell to function and to replicate .
it 's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elas@@ ticity .
together with my long @@@ -@@ @ term 3D printing collabor@@ ator Str@@ at@@ as@@ ys , we 3D @@@ -@@ @ printed this cape and sk@@ irt with no se@@ ams between the cells , and I 'll show more objects like it .
this hel@@ met combines sti@@ ff and soft materials in 20 @@@ -@@ @ mic@@ ron resolution .
Professor Car@@ ter , my collabor@@ ator , and I turned to nature for inspiration , and by designing this irregular surface pattern , it becomes sound @@@ -@@ @ absor@@ bent .
but is nature ideal ?
as she re@@ counts : " on the third day of Creation , God commands the Earth to grow a fruit @@@ -@@ @ bearing fruit tree . "
the whole tree was a fruit .
the land created a world made of parts .
the second @@@ -@@ @ most abundant bi@@ opol@@ y@@ mer on the planet is called ch@@ iti@@ n , and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shri@@ m@@ ps , cra@@ bs , scor@@ pi@@ ons and bu@@ tter@@ flies .
by varying chemical concentrations , we were able to achieve a wide array of properties -- from dark , sti@@ ff and opa@@ que , to light , soft and transparent .
in order to print the structures in large scale , we built a robo@@ tically controlled ex@@ tru@@ sion system with multiple no@@ zzles .
and here 's the best part : for objects designed to bio@@ de@@ grade , put them in the sea , and they will nour@@ ish marine life ; place them in soil , and they will help grow a tree .
the first is cy@@ an@@ ob@@ acter@@ ia .
in fact , they never met each other .
they 've been here , engineered for the first time , to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing .
where we wanted more pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thesis , we would design more transparent channels .
this is half the length of a football field , and 10 times as long as our small intestin@@ es .
and here it is for the first time unve@@ iled at TED -- our first pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thetic we@@ arable , liquid channels g@@ lowing with life inside a we@@ arable clothing .
I call this material ecology .
it does so by combining not two materials , but two proteins in different concentrations .
and this happens across scales .
the sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m first attaches itself to the environment -- it creates a tensile structure -- and it then starts sp@@ inning a compres@@ sive co@@ co@@ on .
we placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this 3 @@@ -@@ @ dimensional point cloud and visu@@ alize the complex architecture of the sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m co@@ co@@ on .
we then created holes , or aper@@ tures , that would lock in the rays of light and heat , distributing those sil@@ k@@ wor@@ ms on the structure .
in my lab , we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here .
what I want to show you next is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory , where this robot was able to go for longer distances .
and these robots consume about 100 wat@@ ts per pound .
the main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster and then travel in these very un@@ structured environments .
in another experiment , I want to show you how the robot adap@@ ts its flight to control its suspended pay@@ load , whose length is actually larger than the width of the window .
( la@@ ughter ) And I want to show you an example .
this is probably the first planned mid @@@ -@@ @ air collision , at one @@@ -@@ @ twentieth normal speed .
so , similarly , in our lab , we try to create artificial robot s@@ war@@ ms .
so from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms .
so why work with s@@ war@@ ms ?
let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in .
in the next video , you 'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot .
on the left @@@ -@@ @ center is an infrared camera .
and the flagship target there was to hal@@ ve the proportion of people living in poverty by 2015 .
the target was to take from a baseline of 1990 , when 36 percent of the world 's population lived in poverty , to get to 18 percent poverty this year .
can economic growth get us to the Global Goals ?
the highest performing country , Norway , scores 88 .
in concrete terms , that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today .
so there 's our target , 75 out of 100 .
let me show you on this chart .
so here we are today , $ 14,000 per capita GDP .
now this seems a bit strange .
economic growth seems to have really helped in the fight against poverty , but it do@@ es@@ n 't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the Global Goals .
the first is that in a way , we 're the victims of our own success .
and also , we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits .
what that tells us , quite simply , is that GDP is not destiny .
from poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand , we see that it 's possible to get lots of social progress , even if your GDP is not so great .
and that 's really important , because it tells us two things .
how much ? enough to get us to the Global Goals ?
so let 's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently under@@ performing on social progress -- the Russia , China , Indi@@ as -- just up to the average .
well then , we get to nearly 73 , very close to the Global Goals .
certainly not with business as usual .
we have to prioritize social progress , and really scale solutions around the world .
the People 's Report Card brings together all this data into a simple framework that we 'll all be familiar with from our school days , to hold them to account .
let 's choose the world that we want .
Michael Green : this is a really important point ; it 's a big shift in priorities -- it 's no longer about poor countries and just poverty .

Cha@@ uc@@ er uses the qu@@ ir@@ ks of the characters " language - the ri@@ bal@@ d hum@@ or of the Cook , the solemn pro@@ se of the Par@@ son , and the lofty notions of the Squ@@ ire - to s@@ ati@@ ri@@ ze their world@@ views .
some have been around for centuries , like the world 's largest , W@@ adi al @@@ -@@ @ Salaam , where more than five million people are buried .
our ancient ancestors had many other ways of par@@ ting with the dead loved ones .
however , the reality is that that h@@ as@@ n 't always been the case for everyone .
it 's this term we now refer to as " bi@@ kin@@ i medicine . "
if we look at the an@@ atom@@ y , the blood vessels that sur@@ round the heart are smaller in women compared to men , and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different in women compared to men .
and these two may not always match up , as we can see with our trans@@ gendered population .
Martin Lu@@ ther King , J@@ r@@ . has said , " Change does not roll in on the wheels of inev@@ itability , but comes through continuous struggle . "
and from now on , I want you to ask your doctors whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender .
but the conversation has begun , and together we can all learn .
it also has to be sufficiently detailed .
I 'm going to start today with nature , but before we do that , let 's quickly listen to this sn@@ ip@@ pet of an opera singer warming up .
Saint Y@@ ared was a real , historical figure , and the natural world can be our musical teacher .
you can almost see the shape as it springs from someone 's mouth .
he was saying that on its own , the environment is mu@@ sically gener@@ ative , that it is generous , that it is fertile , that we are already immer@@ sed .
the first was the arrest , trying and conviction and subsequent incarceration of De@@ tro@@ it 's very popular mayor .
he told me that he had just visited what he thought was an abandoned warehouse where the De@@ tro@@ it police department was storing evidence .
I also am the mother of three girls , a 21 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old and nine @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old tw@@ ins .
I 'm going to tell you her story , but I 'm going to call her Nat@@ asha .
this man was familiar with her neighborhood and was familiar with the comings and go@@ ings of her family , but Nat@@ asha did not know him .
Pam@@ ela , 19 years old -- I 'll call her Pam@@ ela , that 's not her real name -- nine@@ teen years old , was walking down the street after she had come from visiting her boy@@ friend .
so many elect to go through this hours @@@ -@@ @ long rape kit process that requires every inch and or@@ if@@ ice of a victim 's body to be comb@@ ed , sw@@ ab@@ bed and photograph@@ ed .
and hopefully come up with a genetic profile that will help identify their perpetrator .
once forensic scientists come up with this genetic profile , they enter it into CO@@ DIS , hopefully have a match .
but not only that .
the answer was simple .
ups had the technology , U@@ PS knew how to use that technology to solve our problem , and we did@@ n 't .
and during that period of time -- remember , we 're not dealing with the ones we found , because they 'd already been stored -- we 're dealing with any new kit that came in as of January 28 , 2015 .
in one city , in one state .
also , the CO@@ DIS results that we have have ten@@ tac@@ les to crime scenes , have linkages in 40 states in the United States .
in the interim , Bernard Peter@@ son raped 10 more women .
Mc@@ G@@ ow@@ an was convicted of participating in two ar@@ sons in the name of defending the environment as part of the Earth Liberation Front .
now , keep in mind there are about 400 prisoners in US prisons who are classified as terrorists , and only a handful of them are in the CM@@ Us .
prisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day .
their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls .
it 's right at the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most tip of Norway .
and on January 2 this year , an elderly guy who lives in the village , he went out to see what was cast ash@@ ore during a recent storm .
and on a patch of grass right next to the water 's edge , he found a we@@ t@@ suit .
out of each leg of the we@@ t@@ suit there were stic@@ king two white bones .
so they ran a DNA profile , and they started searching internationally through Interpol .
it was an invisible life heading for a nam@@ eless grave .
but the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the we@@ t@@ suit by an R@@ FID chip that was se@@ wn in the suit .
it 's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain , and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are trying desper@@ ately to cross over to Britain .
your friends or family would report you missing , the police would come search for you , the media would know , and there would be pictures of you on lam@@ p@@ posts .
and this is what happened to Sh@@ adi Omar Kat@@ af and Mou@@ az Al Balk@@ hi from Syria .
so this is where we started our search .
and they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry , or the Euro@@ tunnel , or they s@@ ne@@ ak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains .
a lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers .
if you go to Cal@@ ais and talk to refugees , you 'll meet lawyers , politicians , engineers , graphic designers , farmers , soldiers .
this is 22 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Mou@@ az Al Balk@@ hi from Syria .
and it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mou@@ az was October 7 , 2014 .
so we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him , and later on got additional DNA samples from Mou@@ az 's closest relative who now lives in Jordan .
Mou@@ az studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus .
the last night we know he was alive , he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dun@@ k@@ ir@@ k .
reality was not that easy .
the last time , the camp has grown , maybe four or five thousand people .
Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CR@@ IS@@ PR technology to change genes in human embry@@ os .
( la@@ ughter ) A big mou@@ thful -- you can see why we use the acrony@@ m CR@@ IS@@ PR .
this allows the cells to keep a record of infection , and as my colleague , B@@ lake Wi@@ ed@@ en@@ he@@ ft , likes to say , the CR@@ IS@@ PR loc@@ us is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells .
the reason we envisioned using the CR@@ IS@@ PR system for gen@@ ome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it .
and when we sequence the DNA from these animals , we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it , using the CR@@ IS@@ PR technology .
I think that it 's likely that we will see clinical trials and possibly even approved therap@@ ies within that time , which is a very exciting thing to think about .
so , gen@@ ome @@@ -@@ @ engineered humans are not with us yet , but this is no longer science fiction .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) Brun@@ o Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : Jenn@@ if@@ er , this is a technology with huge consequences , as you pointed out .
JD : thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) OK , so , comfortable ?
now I 'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions .
so let 's start there -- with the idea that good design should feel natural .
fortunately , the big tech companies seem to agree .
reality is richer than screens .
we need screens , of course .
and this was an inspiration to me .
it 's like a digital emo@@ ji stick .
and then you might revisit those moments later , and add context to them online .
it 's about 10 cents .
T@@ ree@@ h@@ ug@@ ger is a project that we 're working on with Gr@@ um@@ py S@@ ail@@ or and Fin@@ ch , here in Sydney .
these principles should underpin how we design for the future , not just for the Internet .
interpreter : piano , " p , " is my favorite musical symbol .
yet , I realize now that that was@@ n 't the case at all .
as a De@@ af person living in a world of sound , it 's as if I was living in a foreign country , blin@@ dly following its rules , customs , behavi@@ ors and norms without ever questioning them .
" Don 't make too much noise when you 're eating from the potato @@@ -@@ @ chip bag ! "
hence , this drawing .
in the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist residency there .
in the back of my mind , I 've always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person 's thing .
for example , a musical note CA@@ N@@ NOT be fully captured and expressed on paper .
( la@@ ughter ) " Common time " is a musical term with a specific time signature of four be@@ ats per measure .
( la@@ ughter ) Now the third -- please follow along again .
and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
her d@@ ad was constantly thinking of his thri@@ ving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb .
and the war that drove them there was still ra@@ ging in its fourth year .
and the community that once welcomed them there had become we@@ ary of them .
once an asp@@ iring student thinking only of her future , now she was sca@@ red all the time .
one man approached them with a small baby per@@ ched on his shoulder , nine months old -- Mal@@ ek .
millions of refugees are living in exile , in lim@@ bo .
they feel that the richer world has done too little to support them .
and then she went away and dro@@ wned .
the sun was bl@@ az@@ ing during the day .
when Do@@ aa took the little boy and the mother dro@@ wned , she said to the so@@ b@@ bing child , " She just went away to find you water and food . "
and she wa@@ ved her arms , hoping they would see her , but the planes were soon gone .
but Do@@ aa looked down and asked , " What of Mal@@ ek ? "
and they told her the little baby did not survive -- she drew her last breath in the boat 's clinic .
and Do@@ aa ? well , word went around about her survival , too .
why cou@@ ld@@ n 't Bas@@ se@@ m have found work ?
until these issues are resolved , people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and asylum .
because there is something fundamental here that I think over@@ ri@@ des the rest , and it is about our common humanity .
so on behalf of little M@@ asa and on behalf of Do@@ aa and of Bas@@ se@@ m and of those 500 people who dro@@ wned with them , can we make sure that they did not die in vain ?
well , they 're terrible advice .
thank you .
and this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also Con@@ an Do@@ y@@ le 's " The L@@ ost World " novel in 1912 .
and they are , really , a lost world .
but nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame .
so it 's really an incredible place .
that means , in the P@@ em@@ ón indigenous language , " The House of the G@@ ods . "
you have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there .
however , there were leg@@ ends about the existence of a cave in the mountain .
and you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave .
and , really , everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the min@@ er@@ alog@@ ical world .
what seems only a dark , empty environment could be in reality a chest of wonders full of useful information .
there are still very unknown mountains , like Mar@@ a@@ hu@@ aca , which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level , or Ar@@ ac@@ à , which is in the upper region of Rio Neg@@ ro in Brazil .
thank you .
Franc@@ es@@ co , you said we don 't need to go to Mars to find alien life , and indeed , last time we spoke , you were in S@@ ard@@ inia and you were training European astr@@ onau@@ ts .
audience : ye@@ ah !
but when I look at these pictures , I wonder : there is zero light down there , and yet they look incredibly well @@@ -@@ @ exposed .
people have wanted to look inside the human mind , the human brain , for thousands of years .
it was terri@@ bly dangerous . ( la@@ ughter ) You could be attacked by white blood cells in the ar@@ teries .
we 're going to do it non @@@ -@@ @ inv@@ a@@ sively using M@@ RI .
we will be able to fly into the an@@ atom@@ y of Peter 's brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more importantly , we can look into his mind .
we 've collapsed that through technology to mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner .
if he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therap@@ ist 's cou@@ ch , pills and the knife .
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing .
this may shock you , but we 're literally reading this person 's brain in real time .
they 're learning to fle@@ x this system that releases their own end@@ ogenous opiates .
as they do it , in the upper left is a display that 's yo@@ ked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
these are some of the areas we 're working on today that I don 't have time to go into in detail .
but I want to leave with you the big question .
we are the first generation that 's going to be able to enter into , using this technology , the human mind and brain .
and as I stood on the front por@@ ch fum@@ bling in my pockets , I found I did@@ n 't have my keys .
in fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
I thought about calling a lock@@ sm@@ ith -- at least I had my cell@@ phone , but at midnight , it could take a while for a lock@@ sm@@ ith to show up , and it was cold .
some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
they we@@ ren 't using smell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , this exquis@@ itely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
what about travel ?
if these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .
remember , when you 're under stress , the brain releases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
we haven 't fig@@ ured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack , stroke or other adverse event is prevented .
but wait a minute .
and the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
I 'm the CEO of Do@@ Som@@ eth@@ ing@@ .org.
and we 're not hom@@ opho@@ bic .
we cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe this was happening .
so we launched Crisis Text Line , very quietly , in Chicago and El Pas@@ o -- just a few thousand people in each market .
no one hears you talking .
I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me . "
and so the crisis counsel@@ or says , " How about you put those pills in the draw@@ er while we text ? "
and the next message that comes in says -- it 's the mom -- " I had no idea , and I was in the house , we 're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital . "
as a mom that one just -- The next message comes a month later .
I was diagnosed as bi@@ polar , and I think I 'm going to be OK . "
the beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line is that these are str@@ angers counseling other str@@ angers on the most intimate issues , and getting them from hot moments to cold moments .
we can do things like predic@@ tive work .
and we know that if you text in " sex , " " oral " and " Mor@@ mon , " you 're questioning if you 're gay .
we had a spi@@ ke in volume also .
think about it : those 6.5 million messages , auto @@@ -@@ @ tag@@ ging through natural language processes , all of these data points -- I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders : Monday .
because I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders , so that they can plan meals and guidance counsel@@ ors to be there on Mon@@ days .
and I want families to see that substance abuse questions spi@@ ke at 5@@ am .
( appl@@ ause ) Data , evidence makes policy , research , journalism , policing , school boards -- everything better .
I want to use it to help that girl , who tex@@ ted in about being raped by her father .
because the truth is we never heard from her again .
so freedom came with responsibility .
but my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places , where everything was possible .
but that takes forever , it 's very expensive , and so it 's quite risky to take those big boats out .
so with my students , ages six to 15 , we 've been dre@@ aming of inven@@ ting a better way .
and so we started building this small work@@ bench , with different heights , so even really short kids can participate .
and so , back to plastic .
and my job is to try to collect the best of each k@@ id 's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work .
and the next thing we do -- we do what we call " rapid proto@@ typing . "
so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inven@@ tors called instruc@@ tables , in the hope that somebody would make it even better .
[ I can investigate my local problem ] But my students in Hong Kong are hyper@@ connected kids .
so we built a rough prototype of a spec@@ tro@@ meter , and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectr@@ ums , so that can help you identify what 's in the water .
so we packed this prototype of a sensor , and we shipped it to Bangladesh .
so what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem , or looking at a local problem , my students used their em@@ pa@@ thy and their sense of being creative to help , remotely , other kids .
so I 'm half Japanese and half French , and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan .
it was so violent that it triggered several giant waves -- they are called tsunami -- and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan .
more than 14,000 people died in an instant .
also , it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , the nuclear power plant just by the water .
and today , I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are lea@@ king from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean .
and today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of ce@@ sium @@@ -@@ @ 137 .
but if you look at the map , it can look like most of the radio@@ activity has been washed away from the Japanese coast , and most of it is now -- it looks like it 's safe , it 's blue .
well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
so I 've been going to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima every year since the accident , and I measure independently and with other scientists , on land , in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids .
and so what we did with them is that we 'd discuss the data we collected that day , and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy , itinerary , etc ...
and so we built the elev@@ ation map , we s@@ prin@@ k@@ led pig@@ ments to represent real @@@ -@@ @ time data for radio@@ activity , and we spra@@ yed water to simulate the rainfall .
C@@ es@@ ar Har@@ ada : we 're asking questions such as , can we inv@@ ent the future of mobility with renewable energy ?
you know , sometimes it seems like all these problems of poverty , inequality , ill health , unemployment , violence , addiction -- they 're right there in one person 's life .
and the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers , youth workers , a health officer , a housing officer , a home tu@@ tor and the local policemen .
so in a really brave step , the leaders of the city where El@@ la lives agreed that we could start by reversing R@@ yan 's ratio .
they showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin , even though they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be soft with them .
they went to Mc@@ Donald 's and they sat down and they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time .
so I 'm telling you about El@@ la because I think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of these in@@ tractable problems .
so what do I mean by relationships ?
it 's lon@@ eliness .
lon@@ eliness is like a collective rel@@ ational challenge , and it can 't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response .
in my work at the front line , I 've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource is spent keeping people out .
no one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats .
although the government district is governed by a strict police order , there are no specific laws relating to digital communication .
" this is the N@@ SA . in God we trust . all others we track ! ! ! ! ! "
# expect us . we will # shut@@ down " " This is the N@@ SA 's A@@ chil@@ les he@@ el . open Networks . "
we invited the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network , too , and to our surprise , they did .
the tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies , and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication .
they are a symbol .
in the world of globalization , the continents are dri@@ fting closer to each other .
but asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia are deported or taken to prison .
these procedures are declared to be secret military operations .
after dramatic escap@@ es from crisis zones and war zones , men , women and children are detained by Australia without trial , sometimes for years .
emotions ran deep . many we@@ pt .
it was a powerful experience .
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants .
for example , they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room , so many families literally sleep in the streets .
Christop@@ h , thank you for coming to TED .
I come from Egypt , which is also called U@@ mm al @@@ -@@ @ Dun@@ ya , the Mother of the World .

they 're massive . they 're powerful .
adults can weigh up to 300 kil@@ os .
but what is it that a conserv@@ ation@@ ist does ?
we need field research .
and then we can gather information about how they use space , how they move through the landscape , what are their priority habitats , and so much more .
and it 's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tap@@ ir is .
our first tap@@ ir program took place in the Atlantic Forest in the eastern part of Brazil , one of the most threatened biom@@ es in the world .
this forest was almost completely cleared for timber , agriculture , cattle ran@@ ching and the construction of cities , and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest is still left standing .
so thanks to these amazing devices , we have been able to gather precious information about tap@@ ir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you 're trying to develop those conservation strategies .
and somehow , tap@@ irs are still there , which gives me a lot of hope .
I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver .
in my view , such an extension of the Internet can only work if it 's almost energy @@@ -@@ @ neutral .
a solar cell absor@@ bs light and conver@@ ts it into electrical energy .
now what I would like to do first is switch on the light , and I 'll simply , only switch on the light , for a moment , and what you 'll notice is that the instrument jum@@ ps to the right .
thank you .
what are the building blocks of a water molec@@ ule ?
but if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like , " Why is there an Israeli @@@ -@@ @ Palestine conflict ? "
it works really well , as you can see .
does it say " Michel@@ le Obama " under the picture ?
pretty good indication it 's actually her on there .
so , you 've got those two and you get a search result like this -- almost .
and that picture was published all over .
you get why -- to manipulate the search result .
me neither .
but then , a couple of years go by , and the world 's most @@@ -@@ @ Go@@ og@@ led An@@ ders , An@@ ders Be@@ h@@ ring Bre@@ i@@ vik , did what he did .
it 's not true .
he 's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media , on his blog and Facebook .
and how ?
he told all of his readers the following , " Go out there on the Internet , find pictures of dog po@@ op on side@@ walks -- find pictures of dog po@@ op on side@@ walks -- publish them in your feeds , on your websites , on your blogs .
if you picture @@@ -@@ @ Go@@ og@@ led for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden , you 'd see that picture of dog po@@ op high up in the search results , as a little protest .
str@@ ang@@ ely enough , Google did@@ n 't intervene this time .

on December 21 , 2007 , the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same @@@ -@@ @ sex marriage .

( la@@ ughter ) That 's an " I love D@@ ad " T @@@ -@@ @ shirt .

you have to be 18 to play the stock market .
someone is making the rules .
in the case of s@@ ne@@ akers , that someone is Ni@@ ke .
that means that Ni@@ ke 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competi@@ tor .
but we certainly don 't want them to , nor is it in their best interest .
it 's marketing .
there are very few -- if any -- legal , unregulated markets of this size .
in fact , there is no central exchange .
but what if that 's not how we need to buy s@@ ne@@ akers either ?
and not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner , but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market .
maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things .
we are torn apart by immigration , education , guns and health care .
health care is ug@@ ly and it is loud , so loud that it threatens to dro@@ wn out everything else .
what if the things that we don 't ask about are the things that we most agree upon ?
now , it seemed that it shou@@ ld@@ n 't be so complicated to design a doctor 's visit around what people actually need to be healthy .
so they choose to spend the majority of their dollars outside of hospitals and clinics .
it turns out that when you have the right language and you ask the right questions , the answers become remarkably clear and unanimous .
we have our common sense and our common experience .
countless other planets in our gal@@ axy should have formed earlier and given life a chance to get underway billions or certainly many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth .
maybe a single , super@@ intelligent civilization has indeed taken over the gal@@ axy , and has imposed strict radio silence because it 's par@@ ano@@ id of any potential competitors .
and it 's the crazy possibilities , the unanswered questions , that pull us forward .
in another , not so much .
religion is more than belief .
and that influence affects all of us , every day , regardless of your own belief .
despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today , we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society .
and yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today .
I 'm the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education .
I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church , including myself .
and I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets , disciplinary councils , in decision @@@ -@@ @ making capacities , and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it .
until I stopped , and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men .
these seem like simple things , but to us , the organizers , they were enorm@@ ously costly .
we were attacked in social media and national press .
most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council , and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better , because we believed that they could be .
my parents and I have been walking on this tigh@@ tro@@ pe for the last decade .
I CA@@ N@@ NOT tell you the hundreds of people who have said , " If you don 't like religion , just leave . "
why would you try to change it ?
it leaks into education , military , fiscal decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
religions can 't be dismissed or ignored .
right now , women 's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time .
if we were a multinational corporation or a government , and that had happened , there would be outra@@ ge , but we 're just a religion .
I 'm working on my people . what are you doing for yours ?
assume that one had a piece of paper that was very fine , like the kind they typically use to print the Bible .
in reality , it seems like a piece of sil@@ k .
before you move on , I encourage you to actually think about a possible answer to this question .
with every fold we make , the paper dou@@ bles in thickness .
now , if you think that the distance between the Earth and the Moon is less than 250,000 miles , then starting with a piece of Bible paper and folding it 45 times , we get to the Moon .
for this species , it is simply a matter of where a lar@@ va happens to randomly fall on the sea floor .
so for some species , the question of boy or girl is answered by gene@@ tics .
Ham@@ let : " then I would you were so honest a man . "
later on in the scene , Ty@@ balt , from the House of the Cap@@ ul@@ ets , lays a good one on Ben@@ vol@@ io from the House of the Mont@@ agues .

both families hate each other , and this is just adding fuel to the fire .
well , they all are of course , and that 's what my elementary teachers were trying to tell me .
two plus two equals four , and one is just one .
is 100 one thing , 10 things or 100 things ?
but why is the question always do they love us ?
there are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind .
well , it turns out that if you give a cra@@ y@@ fish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its bur@@ row , it will develop anxiety .
a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them .
well , we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behavi@@ ors .
so there 's basic em@@ pa@@ thy : you feel sad , it makes me sad .
I see you happy , it makes me happy .
far from being the thing that makes us human , human em@@ pa@@ thy is far from perfect .
but we see other animals and we say , " Oh look , kill@@ er wh@@ ales , wol@@ ves , ele@@ ph@@ ants : that 's not how they see it . "
they know exactly who they are .
they know who their rivals are .
this is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction , a fellow being , the most magnificent creature on land .
we killed every single wol@@ f south of the Canadian border , actually .
a pack is a family .
it has some breeding adults and the young of several generations .
the mystery is , why don 't they hurt us more than they do ?
this wh@@ ale is T@@ 20 .
the seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat .
why is it that kill@@ er wh@@ ales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog par@@ ted and the researchers ' home was right there on the sho@@ reline ?
Dol@@ ly came over and looked at him , went back to her mother , nur@@ sed for a minute or two , came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that envelop@@ ed her head like smoke .
( la@@ ughter ) The things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human .
we are not the only ones who care about our mates .
passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being .
this is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world .
this will make it more difficult to safely navigate the hall@@ ways and will cause more colli@@ sions than in larger hall@@ ways .
say you 're at the beach , and you get sand in your eyes .
if you can 't feel pain , you could get hurt , or even hurt yourself and never know it .
each one must be less than or equal to one .
and finally , L -- the longevity factor .
unless L is large , N will be small .
or will we destroy our world and its inhabitants after only a brief appearance on the cosmic stage ?
in this phase , roughly 50 percent of those who reach the surf will perish .
two survive to breeding age with human interference .
we cou@@ ld@@ n 't see a thing , but we knew what was happening .
all I saw was a white , pe@@ arly , sh@@ in@@ y spot that blin@@ ded me , and I did@@ n 't understand what was going on .
so , this trauma -- what is it ?
they suddenly don 't want to sleep , because when they do , they have the same night@@ mare every night .
what type of image ?
for example , a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him .
you CA@@ N@@ NOT work anymore , you CA@@ N@@ NOT love anymore .
you go home and don 't recognize anyone .
you don 't even recognize yourself .
plus , there is no more pain .
the first time I returned from an assignment , They said , " Oh ! he 's back . "
there was a fancy dinner -- white tabl@@ ec@@ lo@@ th , cand@@ les , guests .

another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease and spent six months with der@@ mat@@ ologists , going from doctor to doctor .
and then one day , they sent him to a psychi@@ atr@@ ist .
if it 's a one , I 'll make mine a two ; otherwise I 'll make mine a one .
it do@@ es@@ n 't contain my decimal number .
Can@@ tor also showed that , for any infinite set , forming a new set made of all the sub@@ sets of the original set represents a bigger in@@ fin@@ ity than that original set .
this means that , once you have one in@@ fin@@ ity , you can always make a bigger one by making the set of all sub@@ sets of that first set .
and then an even bigger one by making the set of all the sub@@ sets of that one .
some of the greatest mathemati@@ cians of Can@@ tor 's day were very upset with this stuff .
they tried to make these different in@@ fin@@ ities irrelevant , to make mathematics work without them somehow .
but eventually , his ideas won out .
we just pointed out that the set of decimal numbers -- that is , the real numbers -- is a bigger in@@ fin@@ ity than the set of whole numbers .
in the 19@@ 20@@ s , Kur@@ t Gö@@ del showed that you can never prove that the continuum hypothesis is false .
taken together , these results mean that there are un@@ answ@@ erable questions in mathematics .
a very stunning conclusion .
and we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create .
and you can see at the very tip of this 75 @@@ -@@ @ meter can@@ ti@@ lever , those three little circles .

I 've worked in print . I 've worked in documentary .
and I wanted to do a piece about hunger .
and then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible .
( video ) Voice : there 's too many people ! there 's too many people !
voice : we need an ambulance .
he 's very cautious not to step on this guy who is@@ n 't really there , right ?
and I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying , " Oh my God , I was so frustrated . I cou@@ ld@@ n 't help the guy , " and take that back into their lives .
there was no press about it , so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights .
they were confronted by our virtual reality cameras .
but it turns out we can feel like we 're in two places at once .
and " Hung@@ er in LA , " well , it 's helped start a new form of doing journalism that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future .

my lun@@ gs reach residual volume , below which they 're not supposed to be compressed , in theory .

the cap@@ ill@@ aries in the lun@@ gs become eng@@ or@@ ged with blood -- which is caused by the suction -- so the lun@@ gs can har@@ den and protect the whole chest cav@@ ity from being crushed .

today , in the 21st century , we 're under so much pressure .
our minds are over@@ worked , we think at a million miles an hour , we 're always stressed .
let 's say you 're a voter in California , a state with 55 electoral votes .

we 'll come back to them later .
in the year 400 C.@@ E.
for several centuries , these tribes lived in Britain , and their Ger@@ man@@ ic language , Angl@@ o Sax@@ on , became the common language , what we call Old English .
so the centuries passed with Brit@@ ains happ@@ ily speaking Old English , but in the 700 's , a series of Vi@@ king inv@@ a@@ sions began , which continued until a treaty split the island in half .
on one side were the Sax@@ ons .
the Nor@@ mans were Vi@@ kings who settled in France .

( la@@ ughter ) I 'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , New York .
would you hire this guy ?
so back to my original question .
one of the most striking properties about life is that it has color .
that is , how many of them go by in one second .
people would give me the glass of water to drink , they 'd give me the rose .
somebody took the raz@@ or blade and cut my neck and d@@ rank the blood , and I still have the scar .
and the men did@@ n 't rape me because it was just a normal opening , and it was all public , and they were with their wives .
they carried me around and put me on the table , and put the knife between my legs .
and another person took the pist@@ ol and they started a fight .
it 's all about being there in the real time , and you can 't re@@ hear@@ se performance , because you can 't do many of these types of things twice -- ever .
I want to show you the one who really changed my life , and this was the performance in Mo@@ MA , which I just recently made .
they are observed by the other people , they 're photograph@@ ed , they 're fil@@ med by the camera , they 're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves .
and I understood that I have a very strong mission , that I have to communicate this experience to everybody .
that 's my subjective way .
it 's something so old @@@ -@@ @ fashi@@ oned , but if you don 't respect your own word of honor and you leave before -- that 's not my problem .
it 's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experi@@ men@@ ter .
we are losing the time we have for ourselves .
in the long duration chairs , you 're transported to the big place where you 're going to see the work .
counting rice will be another thing .
you know , you go through this whole range of being bo@@ red , being angry , being completely frustrated , not finishing the amount of rice you 're counting .
and then this un@@ beli@@ evable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished -- or counting sand in the desert .
and this is why you 're not changing .
but my method is to do things I 'm afraid of , the things I fear , the things I don 't know , to go to territory that nobody 's ever been .
( chat@@ ter ) I 'm asking two minutes of your time , that 's so little .

the ancient Greeks were the first to think more or less scientifically about what light is and how vision works .
it took over a thousand years before the Arab scientist , Al@@ Haz@@ en , fig@@ ured out that the old , Greek theory of light cou@@ ld@@ n 't be right .
Al@@ Haz@@ en 's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek 's cou@@ ld@@ n 't easily explain : why it gets dark sometimes .
scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years fig@@ uring out the answer to this question .
for example , ref@@ r@@ action , which is how a beam of light appears to bend as it passes from air into water .
but , that do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
not so fast !
but , we can 't just forget about properties like interference , either .
so these qu@@ anta of light are@@ n 't at all like the tiny , hard spheres New@@ ton imagined .
there are three types of ir@@ ony out there .
this is a great story @@@ -@@ @ telling device that creates tremendous emo@@ tion within that text .
that tension is dramatic ir@@ ony : you know something more than the characters in the film .
there will probably be some type of " misunderstanding . "
from there , confusion and misunderstanding occur , and the tension builds .
it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their book@@ shelves .
and so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel , short story collection or mem@@ o@@ ir from every country in the world .
only around 4.5 percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations , and the figures are similar for much of the English @@@ -@@ @ speaking world .
the up@@ shot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in English .
having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books , I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world .
but Raf@@ id@@ ah 's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year .
time and again , people went out of their way to help me .
that can be an uncomfortable experience , particularly if you 're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own .
but it can also be really enligh@@ tening .
it was as though the world 's stories and the people who 'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me .
these days , when I look at my book@@ shelves or consider the works on my e @@@ -@@ @ reader , they tell a rather different story .
I hope it 's a story I 'm reading for many years to come .
now , no one will argue that we don 't have robots .
we have manufacturing robots that are helping to build our cars that we drive today .
and then we have to come up with tools .
and so , I have an exercise physi@@ ologist showing the robot how to do some exercises .
and then , the other thing is learning .
I mean , if you look at the apps that at out there and the tablets , and the iP@@ ads , and the i@@ Ph@@ ones , and the Andro@@ ids -- 20 years ago they did@@ n 't exist .
it was our imagination . it was our creativity .
so , you have a robot , you want it to be your play@@ mate , your teacher , your instructor , you want it to interact .
and is@@ n 't it so cu@@ te ?
so , I 'm all for robots and smart robots .
I mean , that 's what I do , I 'd be out of a job if I did@@ n 't believe in that .
how far do we push it ?
why does this lesson even exist ?
a computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paper@@ weight .
the first thing we needed to match people up was data , something for the algorithm to work with .
we had to ask people to specify not only their own answer , but the answer they wanted from someone else .
the algorithm c@@ run@@ ches the numbers and gives us a result .
he answered " very organized " for himself , but " average " is OK with him as an answer from someone else , and the question is only a little important to him .
let 's look at the second question , from our previous example : " do you like to be the center of attention ? "
the answers are " yes " and " no . "
you 've answered " no , " you want someone else to answer " no , " and the question is only a little important to you .
so , let 's try to compu@@ te all of this .
we at Ok@@ C@@ up@@ id decided on the following scale : " irrelevant " is worth 0 .
" very important " is 50 .
of those 11 , that 's 1 plus 10 , you earned 10 -- you guys satisfied each other on the second question .
you 've got wide ranges and you 've got tons of different data points , like I said , about movies , politics , religion -- everything .
I hope this will help you do that .
actually , I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage .
this is me rock climbing for the first time .
but there is one limitation : somebody needs to help me .
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident .
the hardest thing for me was losing my independence .
things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone .
back then , there were no personal computers , no Internet , no smartphones .
it was a revolutionary moment for the blind .
the cyber world became accessible , and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses , way beyond what I imagined .
OK , now let me show you the latest technologies .
E@@ V : N@@ ick is approaching . looks so happy .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : where are you going ? you look so happy .
it understands our surrounding world and whis@@ pers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers .
it will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me .
the frontier is the real world .
sorry , let 's get back on track .
but wait , there 's more !
it 's not like adding them , though , where you do it entry by entry .
see how there 's two numbers in each ?
let 's put that number in the top @@@ -@@ @ left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it .
-@@ 4 plus 0 is -@@ 4 .
not all that bad , is it ?
3 times wait a minute , there are no more rows in the second matrix .
we ran out of room .
for example , let 's say you want to encry@@ pt a secret message .
though , why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me .
if you ever get a chance to study L@@ ine@@ ar Al@@ ge@@ bra , do it , it 's pretty awesome .
you 'll notice a theme in these photos . we 'll look at a lot of them .
they are totally real , some of them are very raw , and not one of them looks anything like this .
emo@@ tionally , I was a wrec@@ k .
I don 't really know what 's going on in this picture , because I find it we@@ ir@@ d and slightly cre@@ ep@@ y .
this working mother , all working mothers and all of their babies , are fine .
I want to break this choice thing down into two parts .
so , that 's not true .
on a national level , our paid work is not optional .
" we adopted our son .
these corporate stock photos hide another reality , another layer .
of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave , most women can 't afford to take much of it at all .
a nurse told me , " I did@@ n 't qualify for short @@@ -@@ @ term disability because my pregnancy was considered a pre@@ existing condition .
23 percent of new working mothers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth .
I had to return to work before my baby was a month old , working 60 hours a week .
I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment .
so those are the mothers .
care to guess who they are ?
all of this is to America 's shame .
not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work , their needed work and their needed paren@@ thood , is their problem alone .
I am done , done having babies , and you might be pre @@@ -@@ @ baby , you might be post @@@ -@@ @ baby , you might be no baby .
but in psychology , learning means something else .
to psychologists , learning is a long @@@ -@@ @ term change in behavior that 's based on experience .
eventually , just ringing the bell made the dogs sali@@ vate .
you see , under normal conditions , the sight and smell of food causes a dog to sali@@ vate .
these days , scientists know a lot more about gene@@ tics and he@@ red@@ ity .
here is how it happened .
in 1959 , as relations deteriorated between the North and the South , a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltr@@ ate soldiers , weapons , and supplies into South Vietnam .
fear , bo@@ re@@ dom , and home@@ sickness were the dominant emotions .
Vietnamese forces even used dec@@ eption to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountain@@ sides in order to make gra@@ vel for use in building and maintaining roads .
as usual in these things , these two lines are , in fact , parallel , but you perceive them to bow outw@@ ards at their centers .
at the center where those radi@@ al lines are , it 's wider in your visual field than the parts above and below .
and what your brain is going to think this is , is not some lines on a page .
whenever you move , whenever you move forward , in particular .
they put these bl@@ ur lines in their carto@@ ons and it means to your brain : motion .
the point is that it 's the stimulus at the back of your eye that has these optic bl@@ urs in them , and that 's what tells your brain that you 're moving .
what you would like is that when light hits your eye , then -- ping ! -- immediately you have a perception of what the world is like .
but it do@@ es@@ n 't work that way .
if you 're moving just at one meter per second , which is fairly slow , then in a tenth of second , you 've moved 10 centi@@ meters .
when you 're very far away from it , the sides are perfectly parallel .
so in the next moment , you have a shape that 's more like this next picture .
if I can , I 'll quickly show two .
here are the cu@@ es of motion , the kinds of cu@@ es that you get on your re@@ tina when things are moving .
where I live and work , in Cu@@ ra@@ ç@@ ao , a tropical storm went by a few years ago .
it 's hardly even a met@@ aph@@ or because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and s@@ lim@@ e .
if they don 't understand what a coral is or where it comes from , or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is , why would we expect them to care about saving them ?
and they use those talents to search the bottom of the ree@@ f for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives .
one coral poly@@ p will divide itself again and again and again , leaving a lime@@ stone sk@@ elet@@ on under@@ ne@@ ath itself and growing up toward the sun .
but , indeed , much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this .
scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world 's coral reefs , and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes .
we can choose to use the materials and colors and tex@@ tures that might bias the system back toward those cor@@ als .
and I tried those one by one by one , looking for the bacteria that would convince cor@@ als to settle and attach .
and we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause cor@@ als to go through that settlement and attachment process .
this is one of my favorite cor@@ als , and always has been : d@@ end@@ ro@@ gy@@ ra cylin@@ dr@@ us , the pillar coral .
think back to the most difficult job you ever did .
and watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amaz@@ ement to the core of my soul .
we don 't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don 't know if it was just this coral on this ree@@ f , always suffering from low fertility .
they 're providing us with art and food and medicine .
the main difference depends on the cur@@ v@@ ature of the surface upon which the lines are constructed .
it all depends on the context of what you 're looking at .
flat surfaces behave one way , while positively and negatively cur@@ ved surfaces display very different characteristics .
Albert E@@ in@@ stein used non @@@ -@@ @ Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an geometry as well to describe how space @@@ -@@ @ time becomes war@@ ped in the presence of matter , as part of his general theory of rel@@ ativity .
this is known as cos@@ m@@ ology .
it was Ed@@ win Hu@@ b@@ ble who first noticed that our universe is expanding , by noting that gal@@ ax@@ ies seem to be flying further and further apart .
we know that after the Big Ban@@ g , the universe cooled down to form the stars and gal@@ ax@@ ies that we see today .
but we can also probe the origins of the universe by recre@@ ating the hot , dense conditions that existed at the beginning of time in the laboratory .
this is done by particle physi@@ ci@@ sts .
instead , the universe consisted of a sw@@ ir@@ ling sea of sub@@ atomic matter .
a few seconds after the Big Ban@@ g , it was hot@@ ter still , hot enough to over@@ power the forces that usually hold pro@@ tons and neutr@@ ons together in atomic nuc@@ lei .
further back still , and the energy was too great even for the quar@@ ks to stick together .
physi@@ ci@@ sts hope that by going to even greater energies , they can see back to a time when all the forces were one and the same , which would make understanding the origins of the universe a lot easier .
because , after all , when it comes to our universe , we 're all in this one together .
in fact , he is only one piece of the power puzzle and for very good reason .
the executive branch is described in Article 2 of the Constitution .
as mathemati@@ cians have since realized , it is possible to add up in@@ finitely many finite @@@ -@@ @ sized terms and still get a finite answer .
not only does the infinite series sum to a finite answer , but that finite answer is the same one that common sense tells us is true .
this thrust my mother , my sister and I out of the relative comfort of middle @@@ -@@ @ class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet .
thus , I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals .
thank@@ fully , Nor@@ folk State University provided me with full funding , and I was able to achieve my b@@ achelor 's in physics .
it was a poster that saved my dream , and some really incredible people and programs .
I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal copy of the poster , which to this day still han@@ gs in my office .
stem itself is an inter@@ sec@@ tional term , such that its true ric@@ hness CA@@ N@@ NOT be appreciated without considering the lim@@ inal space between disciplines .
stem is utterly incomplete without each individual piece .
thus , we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience .
this is not a request born out of a desire to fit in .
at the same time , the fea@@ thers spread across the bodies of din@@ osa@@ urs , turning from spar@@ se patches of fu@@ z@@ z into dense plum@@ age , which even extended down to their legs .
a few f@@ ossi@@ ls even preserved some of the molecules that give fea@@ thers color .
some din@@ osa@@ urs had high cre@@ sts on their heads , and others had long , dramatic tail fea@@ thers .
a wood@@ coc@@ k uses fea@@ thers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop .
fea@@ thers could have served these functions for din@@ osa@@ urs too .
exactly how fea@@ thered din@@ osa@@ urs took flight is still a bit of a mystery .
big data is an elusive concept .
OK , so it was@@ n 't your usual computer , this was a main@@ frame computer that filled an entire building .
well , as the old met@@ aph@@ or explains , the whole is greater than the sum of its parts , and this is no longer just science that is exploiting this .
these two apparently solid objects would completely disappear into a big flash of energy , equivalent to an atomic bomb .
in the past few months , I 've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suit@@ case of clothes .
the next morning , I just took all the pieces , assembled them together in my hotel room , and this is actually the sk@@ irt that I 'm wearing right now .
I loved going to old factories and we@@ ir@@ d stores in search of lef@@ to@@ vers of strange pow@@ ders and we@@ ir@@ d materials , and then bring them home to experiment on .
as you can probably imagine , my ro@@ om@@ mates did@@ n 't like that at all .
I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies , like k@@ nit@@ ting machines and laser cutting and sil@@ k printing .
so I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24 @@@ -@@ @ 7 .
so you guys , you want to see what it looks like ?
( appl@@ ause ) Dan@@ it P@@ ele@@ g : Re@@ bec@@ ca is wearing one of my five out@@ fits .
fashion is also a very physical thing .
the best evidence for dark matter today comes from measurements of something called the cosmic microwave background , the after@@ g@@ low of the Big Ban@@ g , but that 's another story .
the idea is that all the particles we know today are just different harmon@@ ics on the string .
unfortunately , string theories today are , as yet , un@@ te@@ stable .
some do go in for the latest f@@ ad of the AD 7@@ 0s : n@@ ude bathing with men present .
they also have a cha@@ per@@ one with them and will be meeting an a@@ unt at the Por@@ tic@@ us of Li@@ via .
it was built by Li@@ via , the wife of the first em@@ peror Au@@ gu@@ st@@ us , on the site of the house of V@@ edi@@ us Pol@@ li@@ o .
from there , she will have a good view of the 50,000 spectators but will see little by way of blood and g@@ ore .
if she really wanted a decent view , she could become a vest@@ al vir@@ gin and would sit right down the front .
home time .
d@@ ad is going to go mad .
" I could watch this forever , " you think .
once there , the tobacco plant followed the instructions sli@@ pped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree .
for each pair of people in room , set n = n + 2 .
ordinary people , the way they looked at seafood was like this .
we did it before , 10,000 years ago , when we came out of our ca@@ ves .
it 's true of birds , too .
but teles@@ cope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry , and you 'll see four : tur@@ keys , duc@@ ks , chicken and ge@@ ese .
in a recent study that was produced out of Dal@@ hou@@ si@@ e University , it was found that dra@@ gging for shri@@ mp is one of the most carbon @@@ -@@ @ intensive ways of fishing that you can find .
we 've lost millions of acres of coastal man@@ gro@@ ves over the last 30 or 40 years .
the industry has , to its credit , greatly improved .
unfortunately though , the sand@@ wich came in at 30 cents .
they are tremend@@ ously fuel efficient to bring to market , a fraction of the fuel cost of say , shri@@ mp , and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale .
great .
so I guess what I 'm saying is this is what we 've been going with .
one is length .
for saturated f@@ ats , the story pretty much ends there but not for un@@ saturated f@@ ats .
the second way is like this .
they don 't go ran@@ ci@@ d , they 're more stable during deep f@@ rying , and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other f@@ ats just can 't .
so , how do you know if a food has trans fat in it ?
that would be pretty bad .
gig@@ antic solar fla@@ res can m@@ ess with our satellites and electrical equipment , but the chances of it killing you are pretty s@@ lim .
but the spin can speed up .
she sp@@ ins faster .
it really goes in a straight line .
before it started to collapse , this cloud had a very gentle spin .
the differences in temperature make differences in air pressure , and the differences in air pressure make air move .
in the direct method , the artist paints directly on the fish , and then gently presses the mo@@ ist fabric or paper into the fish .
I look at the chemistry of the ocean today .
you 're probably seeing new species .
you can see beautiful bub@@ bl@@ eg@@ um cor@@ als .
and this animal you 're going to see coming up was a big surprise .
I 've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised .
this is a black coral called Le@@ iop@@ ath@@ es , an image taken by my colleague , B@@ ren@@ dan Ro@@ ark , about 500 meters below Hawa@@ ii .
this is a spectacular coral garden .
d 's are green : De@@ bra , Dar@@ by , Dor@@ oth@@ y , Den@@ ise .
in this way , syn@@ esthe@@ sia provides a path to understanding subjective differences , how two people can see the same thing differently .
and that sounds like a sweet deal to me !
that 's pretty good .
and when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world , sometimes , things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic .
so I thought : clearly , this is a pretty serious problem .
I did@@ n 't have the money to go out and buy a plane , so I decided to build a computer instead .
and then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces , essentially m@@ esh@@ ing it so that the computer can better understand it .
and then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin , throw in a bun@@ ch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calcul@@ ates the simulation .
so what we get , actually , with the conventional cabin is this : you 'll notice the middle person s@@ nee@@ zing , and we go " Spl@@ at ! " -- it goes right into people 's faces .
it 's pretty dis@@ g@@ usting .
the first thing I thought was , " This is no good . "
thanks .
after all , Ari@@ sto@@ tle 's ideas made sense with what they could see , and they were pretty flat@@ tering to humans .
and then , New@@ ton proposed the theory of universal gra@@ v@@ itation , demonstrating that all objects are pulling on each other .
in time , we realized there were far more stars than Ari@@ sto@@ tle ever dre@@ amed .
in the 19@@ 20@@ s , astronom@@ ers studying the ne@@ bul@@ i wanted to figure out how they were moving .
everything was moving away from us , fast .
according to this theory , all matter in the universe was once a sing@@ ular , in@@ finitely dense particle .
in a sense , our piece of the universe was once at the center .
the Big Ban@@ g was@@ n 't just an explosion in space ; it was an explosion of space .
what would happen if you set a table like this ?
it do@@ es@@ n 't look good , and you have to clean up the m@@ ess before you can even start .
let 's try another way .
this is more about looks than e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette , but it 's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you 're eating at a pic@@ nic table .
here 's a helpful tip : you always eat outside @@@ -@@ @ in , so to set for sal@@ ad , we 'll put the sal@@ ad for@@ k to the outside of the dinner for@@ k and the sal@@ ad knife to the outside of the dinner knife .
notice , too , that the knife blades are both pointed toward the plate .
here 's another tip : only set the table with what you 'll need .
this way , when it 's time to eat , you just slide it down and it 's in the right spot .
next we 'll anchor our setting with the plate .
you can also serve from the kitchen then bring them to the table .
Galileo 's Square Cu@@ be Law says his weight will be 27 - 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27 - times his regular weight since he has to expand in all three dimensions .
so , when our super@@ hero trans@@ forms into a giant , we are dealing with two possibilities .
nobody can get in the same elevator with him without the alarm going off .
and what defines each element is the number of pro@@ tons in the nucle@@ us .
ok@@ ay , so you 'll wear a mask to avoid destroying your face .
it takes us approximately one @@@ -@@ @ fifth of a second to react to what we see .
so , our hero sw@@ o@@ ops in at super speed , gra@@ bs her , and carries her to safety .
and , when she stops suddenly , velocity decreases rapidly back to zero miles per hour , her brain would crash into the other side of her sk@@ ull , turning her brain into mus@@ h .
Oh , and possibly face jail time .
I wonder how much super@@ hero insurance policy would cost .
so , you hold out your arms , hoping to catch her .
what happened ?
the pressure that will be exerted on her body can be calculated by force divided by the area on the top of your arms that comes in contact with her .
it do@@ es@@ n 't matter if your arms are strong enough to catch her body without breaking your bones .
the only thing that could save her is flying .
then , break out the chocolate and gra@@ ham crac@@ kers and you 've got s '@@ mo@@ res .
if we live until we 're 82 , that 's about 30,000 days .
do you remember what you did last year or when you were five ?
if you have trouble rememb@@ ering what you did when you were five , how will you remember what happened if you were alive a thousand years ago ?
we don 't remember every single detail of our past because our bra@@ ins have a limited capacity and we replace useless memories , like middle school loc@@ ker combinations , with relevant information .
another tr@@ ick@@ y thing about im@@ mortality : human beings have not always looked the same .
if you 're the only person who is im@@ mortal , while everyone else keeps evolving , generation after generation , you will eventually look quite different than the people who sur@@ round you .
so , are you sure you want to live forever ?
( Be@@ at@@ boxing ) Na@@ w , I 'm kid@@ ding . but you know what ?
( che@@ ers and appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you ! make some noise !
as of 2012 , the world record for fastest short @@@ -@@ @ distance s@@ print speed is roughly 27 miles per hour .
to move around un@@ detected by other people , you would have to be totally naked .
well , the answer is nothing .
no .
and what if everyone is permanently invisible ?
what is that something ?
is it gre@@ m@@ lin@@ s ?
in this case , the I / O sub@@ system decides that your mouse click is pretty important so it generates an interrupt to the CPU .
you could float out in outer space , look down at the Earth and everything .
whatever it takes , right ?
he had this idea , a little mental experiment : you take a can@@ non , you put it on top of a hill .
well , you can imagine if you shot it really , really , hard , it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom ! -- and hit you in the back@@ side or something .
let 's zoom way back and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up .
the Earth is going to pull you up , but you 're moving side@@ ways still .
in this way , astr@@ onau@@ ts orbit the Earth .
they feel like they 're falling , so you just have to get over it .
so , I do not recommend this .
this makes it sound like evolution always fav@@ ors the biggest , strongest , or fastest creatures , which is not really the case .
secondly , survival is not how evolution occurs , reproduction is .
a gene do@@ es@@ n 't want anything , and there 's no outside mechanism that selec@@ ts which genes are best to preserve .
comm@@ as are tr@@ ick@@ y things , especially when sub@@ ordinates and con@@ junc@@ tions are involved .
if you can remember a few basic rules , a simple law of physics , and some common scenarios , you will be able to use comm@@ as correctly .
they are words that connect two unequal things , dependent and independent clauses .
Bar@@ th@@ el@@ eme loves engaging in political debate even though he usually loses .
so , when the comm@@ a asks if it can help , the subordinate is app@@ alled at the idea of needing assistance .
even though Bar@@ th@@ el@@ eme loves to sing , he never s@@ ings in front of others .
the comm@@ a asks the sub@@ ordinates if they need help .
fan@@ boys are@@ n 't as militant as sub@@ ordinates .
now , this is a real proposition , and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment , but my interest in it is quite different .
so in the summer , I did my first exhibition on death and architecture in Venice , and it was called " Death in Venice . "
so one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death .
so about half a million people die in the UK each year , and of those , around a quarter will want to be buried .
so they 'll look at what it looks like .
but what if I 've got a piece of land and I just want to bury a few people , like five or six ?
well , then -- actually , I don 't need permission from anyone !
so actually , if you want to go and make your own mini @@@ -@@ @ cemetery , then you can .
( la@@ ughter ) They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is .
nowadays , we test the speed of computers by having them calculate pi , and quantum computers have been able to calculate it up to two quad@@ r@@ il@@ lion digits .
Leon@@ ardo was@@ n 't just thinking about Vit@@ ru@@ vi@@ us , though .
this belief holds that the universe has a hierarchy resem@@ bling a chain , and that chain starts at the top with God , then travels down through the angels , planets , stars , and all life@@ forms before ending with dem@@ ons and de@@ vil@@ s .
looking back at the sketch , we can see that by changing the position of the man , he can fill the ir@@ reconc@@ il@@ able areas of a circle and a square .
those with dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ia experience that labor@@ ious pace every time they read .
for example , if you heard the word cat and then someone asked you , " Remove the ' c ' , " what word would you have left ?
one person might have mild dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ia while the next person has a profound case of it .
dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ia also runs in families .
the continuum and distribution of dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ia suggests a broader principle to bear in mind as we look at how the bra@@ ins of those with dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ia process language .
because of this neuro@@ biological gl@@ itch , they read with more difficulty .
in a very basic sense , it tells a perform@@ er what to play and when to play it .
but there are obviously many , many more pit@@ ches than the nine that these lines and spaces gives us .
a grand piano , for example , can play 88 separate notes .
" great , " you say , " what does that mean ? "
but like I said before , if we just stick to the beat , it gets kind of b@@ oring , so we 'll replace some quarter notes with different rhyth@@ ms .
so , what does our musical creation sound like ?
now it 's s@@ ounding like music .
there are a lot of ways this marvel@@ ous language of ours , English , do@@ es@@ n 't make sense .
for example , most of the time when we talk about more than one of something , we put an S on the end .
but then , there 's that handful of words where things work differently .
or if you have two feet , then why don 't you read two be@@ ek instead of books .
you think it 's odd that more than one go@@ ose is ge@@ ese ?
one sheep , two sheep .
so , why did@@ n 't things stay the way they were ?
so let 's start with -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) J@@ F : we 're in big trouble .
I mean it 's , " I have my friends , therefore I am . "
L@@ t : ( la@@ ughter ) J@@ F : no , it 's true .
and most of them are a good deal younger than me , too .
you know ? I mean , it 's nice -- L@@ T : thank you .
because they only -- for years , decades -- they only research@@ ed men when they were trying to understand stress , only very recently have they research@@ ed what happens to women when we 're stressed , and it turns out that when we 're stressed -- women , our bodies get floo@@ ded by oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in .
( la@@ ughter ) If you know what I mean .
L@@ t : I think we all know what you mean .
J@@ F : there 's a lot of difference , and I think we have to have a lot of em@@ pa@@ thy for men -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) that they don 't have what we have .
" did I really screw up there ? "
but our " we " is our saving grace , it 's what makes us strong .
and we 've got to make something different happen .
we are the ones that need to get off the grid .
that we will be -- there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well @@@ -@@ @ being , and it 's women that are going to lead the way .
the US Constitution needs women .
thank you both .
imagine this : you 're fast asleep when all of a sudden you 're aw@@ ok@@ en !
it sounds like a Stephen King movie , but it 's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis , and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life .
could he but manage to sti@@ r , the spell would van@@ ish instantly . "
it may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what 's actually happening in your brain is much harder to explain .
so this explains the hall@@ uc@@ inations , but what about the feelings of panic , str@@ an@@ gling , cho@@ king , chest pressure that so many people describe ?
you take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small block@@ age of your air@@ way .
that makes you gas@@ p for air , but you can 't because RE@@ M at@@ onia has removed control of your breath .
it transformed .
so why exhibit my work in the ocean ?
it 's a bit of a clic@@ h@@ é , but nothing man @@@ -@@ @ made can ever match the imagination of nature .
the site was actually listed as a " Won@@ der of the World " by National Geographic .
I think most people actually look past to the horizon .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik was actually not the first piece of human technology to enter space .
that super@@ l@@ ative goes to the V @@@ -@@ @ 2 rocket used by Germany in missile attacks against Al@@ lied cities as a last @@@ -@@ @ d@@ itch effort in the final years of World War II .
it was@@ n 't very effective , but , at the end of the war , both the U.S. and U.@@ S.@@ S.@@ R. had captured the technology and the scientists that had developed it and began using them for their own projects .
so , the sc@@ ary thing about S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik was not the or@@ biting ball itself , but the fact that the same technology could be used to launch a nuclear war@@ head at any city .
he 's loud , he sp@@ ills his drink on you , and he makes fun of your team .
if so , you might choose to avoid him the next time you see him .
on one hand , learning very negative , highly immoral information about someone typically has a stronger impact than learning very positive , highly moral information .
certain types of learning don 't seem to lead to this sort of neg@@ ativity bias .
when learning about another person 's abilities and competencies , for instance , this bias f@@ lips .
let 's talk about the Arctic first .
the area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Cir@@ cle and the North Pole .
if you were to stand at the North Pole , everywhere you looked , in all directions , would be south .
if you were to fall into the water at the North Pole , you 'd fall into water that 's 13,@@ 9@@ 80 feet deep .
life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice , zo@@ o@@ plan@@ k@@ ton and phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , fish and marine mammals , birds , land animals , plants , and human societies .
even the most extreme animals fight for survival , and only cold @@@ -@@ @ adapted organisms survive there , including many types of algae , animals , bacteria , fun@@ gi , plants , and pro@@ ti@@ sta .
well , first , much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level , and temperature decreases with elev@@ ation .
but despite being in@@ hosp@@ itable , the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is .
since the establishment of the United Nations , wars of aggression have been out@@ lawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war .
this device directs the pac@@ em@@ aker to malfunction , ultimately resulting in the foreign leader 's death .
as a defensive measure , the enemy country responds by unle@@ ashing a defensive cyber@@ attack that results in the allied nations ' power grids going down .
and would their retaliation be considered an act of war ?
who is to be held responsible ?
the computer programmers who wrote the code ?
the commander who hit the button , setting off the event ?
the hardware engineer who created the computers , knowing that they were intended to enable an attack ?
a hundred years ago this month , a 36 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Albert E@@ in@@ stein stood up in front of the Pr@@ us@@ sian Academy of Sciences in Berlin to present a radical new theory of space , time and gravity : the general theory of rel@@ ativity .
1915 must have been an exciting year to be a phy@@ sic@@ ist .
a hundred years on , we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics , but what 's at stake now is rather different .
this is the essential problem : the universe is far , far too interesting .
the question is , ultimately , why does all this interesting stuff exist ?
these are properties of the universe that we can measure , and they 're extremely dangerous because if they were different , even by a tiny bit , then the universe as we know it would not exist .
if you 've ever held a mag@@ net close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap , then you 've felt the effect of a field .
we can 't see it or touch it , but if it was@@ n 't there , we would not exist .
the H@@ ig@@ gs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we 're made from .
rel@@ ativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings , a bit like a light switch .
so this is the first of our dangerous numbers , the strength of the H@@ ig@@ gs field .
they have sex@@ y @@@ -@@ @ s@@ ounding names like " super@@ sym@@ metry " or " large extra dimensions . "
but in 1998 , astronom@@ ers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up .
that 's one with 120 zer@@ oes after it .
we often use the word " astronomical " when we 're talking about big numbers .
this number is bigger than any number in astronomy .
it turns out that string theory is@@ n 't one theory at all , but a whole collection of theories .
you can 't dis@@ prove the theory .
suddenly we can understand the we@@ ir@@ dly fine @@@ -@@ @ tun@@ ed values of these two dangerous numbers .
this summer , the L@@ HC began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run .
if so , then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert E@@ in@@ stein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature .
but I mean , seriously , it 's great news .
B@@ G : Harry , thank you . HC : thank you very much .
it 's that shad@@ ow@@ y feeling you get when a situation seems familiar .
it has no physical manifestations and in studies , it 's described by the subject as a sensation or feeling .
let 's walk through three of today 's more prevalent theories , using the same restaurant setting for each .
however , this theory asserts that dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u occurs when there 's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways .
are you paying attention ?
when our attention returns , we feel as if we 've been here before .
for example , just now you focused on the for@@ k and did@@ n 't observe the tabl@@ ec@@ lo@@ th or the falling wa@@ iter .
while all three of these theories share the common features of dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u , none of them propose to be the conclusive source of the phenomenon .
is your brain just acting slow ?
this must be some kind of optical illusion .
the question is , which one ?
another possibility is the famous Pon@@ zo Il@@ lu@@ sion .
but in fact , pilots and sail@@ ors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion .
now your brain thinks the moon is much closer than it really is , so you naturally conclude the moon 's not as big as you thought it was .
the long @@@ -@@ @ term ones , in relation to Syrians , is that hope is less and less clear for people .
and that , in my opinion , was the trigger .
you talk about one million people .
AG : my country is supposed to receive four thousand .
the rest of Europe is looking without doing much .
and there is such a thing as international law , so there is no way you can say , " I take 10,000 and that 's finished . "
and it 's not only about refugees ; there are many other areas .
and so their idea was , " They are coming to my village . "
but , unfortunately , we have a lot of people sca@@ red , just because Europe was not able to do the job properly .
the truth is that for Afghans , the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for , at the time , six million Afghans that came .
for instance , Lebanon and Jordan are middle @@@ -@@ @ income countries .
so it do@@ es@@ n 't make sense that these countries are not a first priority in development cooperation policies .
you are talking about things that require a long @@@ -@@ @ term perspective , a development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective .
I quote : " I am calling for a total and complete shut@@ down of Muslims entering the US , until our country 's representatives can figure out what 's going on . "
B@@ G : have the recent attacks in Paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult ?
and I must say , I am convinced that the passport that appeared , I believe , was put by the person who has blown -- B@@ G : -- himself up , ye@@ ah .
to try to avoid it is , in my opinion , impossible .
now , we see a multi@@ plication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died : Afghanistan , Somalia , Democratic Republic of Congo .
so that , I will not do .
thank you for coming to TED .

there 's no shortage of answers .
taking a step back , or taking a cold shower , whatever , love is potentially the most inten@@ sely thought about thing in all of human history .
perhaps these rewards are addic@@ tive .
perhaps to create new lives , to prolif@@ erate their species ?
it means we 're all still making it .
one way they are doing this is by research@@ ing stem cells .
stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body .
stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease .
tissue @@@ -@@ @ specific stem cells replace the existing cells in your organs as they wear out and die .
embry@@ onic stem cells are created from lef@@ to@@ ver embry@@ os that are willingly donated by patients from fertility clinics .
a third kind of stem cells is called induced pl@@ uri@@ potent stem cells .
how have we reached such a high degree of urbanization , and what does it mean for our future ?
and the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend against attacks .
so , what is the future of cities ?
so , how will cities need to change to accommodate this growth ?
second , growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human population .
what if you could only see one color ?
there are big waves and small waves , waves that crash on the shore one right after the other , and waves that only roll in every so often .
when we see , it 's because the energy of light stimulates a recep@@ tor in our eye called the re@@ tina .
the only thing that makes one kind of light different from another is its wa@@ vel@@ ength .
when you think of the night sky , you probably think of being able to see the stars sh@@ ining with your own eyes , but that 's just visible light , which you now know is only a tiny part of the full spectrum .
if we had to draw the universe and could only use visible light , it would be like having only one cra@@ yon -- pretty sad .
and the cool@@ est thing of all , no matter the wa@@ vel@@ ength or energy , the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth .
so , since we know the physics of how x @@@ -@@ @ ray , ultra@@ violet light , or micro@@ waves work here , we can study the light of a distant star or gal@@ axy and know what kinds of things are happening there too .
in 1977 , the phy@@ sic@@ ist Edward Pur@@ cell calculated that if you push a bacteria and then let go , it will stop in about a mil@@ lion@@ th of a second .
the same holds true for a sperm and many other micro@@ bes .

this phenomenon is known as contag@@ ious y@@ aw@@ ning .
let 's take a look at a few of the most prevalent ones , beginning with two physiological hypo@@ theses before moving to a psychological one .
our first physiological hypothesis states that contag@@ ious y@@ aw@@ ning is triggered by a specific stimulus , an initial ya@@ wn .
our psychological hypothesis also involves the work of these mirror ne@@ ur@@ ons .
this study was set up to show that dogs would enact a ya@@ wn ref@@ lex at the mere sound of a human ya@@ wn .

and fourth , it became really hard to change our opinions .
fifth -- and in my point of view , this is the most critical -- today , our social media experiences are designed in a way that fav@@ ors broadcasting over engagements , posts over discussions , shallow comments over deep conversations .
cou@@ ld@@ n 't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations , rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time ?
or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with ?

we can predict how the universe will change with time if we measure the amounts or energy den@@ si@@ ties of the various components in the universe today .
so , what is the universe made of ?
we have yet to discover a dark matter particle , but scientists all over the world are searching for this elusive particle or particles and the effects of dark matter on the universe .
the remaining 68 % of the energy density of the universe is made up of dark energy , which is even more mysterious than dark matter .
the leading idea for dark energy is that it is a cos@@ m@@ ological constant .
while it might sound de@@ pressing living in a universe that will end its lifetime cold and devoid of life , the end fate of our universe actually has a beautiful sym@@ metry to its hot , fi@@ ery beginning .

the ol@@ factory epi@@ th@@ el@@ ium has a layer of ol@@ factory recep@@ tor cells , special ne@@ ur@@ ons that sense sm@@ ells , like the taste bud@@ s of your nose .

all of these different combinations let you detect a st@@ agg@@ er@@ ingly broad array of sm@@ ells .
ol@@ factory ne@@ ur@@ ons are always fresh and ready for action .
and this is@@ n 't the only case of sm@@ ells differing from nose to nose .

what rules are in place here ?
what kind of government does this world have ?
what do people believe in here ?
and what does this society value most ?
where do the inhabitants live and work and go to school ?
what do they eat and how do they play ?
what kind of technology exists ?

there 's so much to think about !
once you know your world as well as you hope your reader will , set your characters free in it and see what happens .
some astronom@@ ers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars .
we don 't know what the atmos@@ p@@ heres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and di@@ m compared to their stars and so far away from us .

when you travel in a car , your body gets two different messages .

how fast are you moving right now ?
when Mission Control tells astr@@ onau@@ ts how fast they 're going , there 's always an assumed standard of rest .
such a s@@ assy reply may get subordinate Star@@ fleet officers in trouble , but it is the only good answer to the question , " How fast are you moving ? "
this is basic relatively talking .
Galileo seems to have been the first person to realize that there is no such thing as an absolute speed .
Earth 's speed is 19 miles / second relative to the Sun .
you can move between two points in space , say between Earth and Mars , but you can 't move through space .
to do this , the brain has to be an energy ho@@ g .
this is the energy limit we have to live with in order to be conscious at all .

so in other words , he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here .
now , Ro@@ y Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve , because I think you would have to have some serious bra@@ in@@ power to under@@ cut " T@@ od@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . "
( audience : " alpha House . " ) Yes , " Alpha House , " but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it did@@ n 't turn out that great .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " House of Cards " gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be .
you have 200 years of statistics to rely on .
so it 's the same principle as Amazon and Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad , you 're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad .
and it worked beautifully , and it made a big spl@@ ash in the news , including the pin@@ n@@ acle of scientific success : a publication in the journal " Nature . "
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces .
if there 's one thing a brain is good at , it 's taking bits and pieces back together again , even when you have incomplete information , and coming to a good conclusion , especially if it 's the brain of an expert .
they used data all the way to drive their decision @@@ -@@ @ making , first when they held their competition of TV ideas , then when they selected " Alpha House " to make as a show .
for every object , we can locate the average position of all of its mass by taking into account how the mass is spread around the object .
it can even move outside of your body .

there were no stars and no planets .
at some point , the core of such a ball gets hot enough that nuclear fusion occurs .
hydrogen at@@ oms sm@@ ash together to form hel@@ ium , accompanied by a great release of energy , strong enough to counteract the shrinking force of the gravity .
when the energy pushing out from the fusion reactions matches the gravity pulling all the gas in@@ wards , an equilibrium occurs .
that causes an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably powerful explosion we call a super@@ no@@ va .
as before , new stars result .
our sun was born this way about 5 billion years ago .

well , in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for , it 's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water .
one of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew , we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asph@@ alt .
this figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stor@@ m@@ water that fell within the city limits .
and so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting is to capture the water , clean the water and get it underground .
and in the process of passing through the we@@ tland and per@@ col@@ ating through the ground , the water encounters micro@@ bes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil , and that puri@@ fies the water .
the second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes out of our sewage treatment plants .
you 've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the sh@@ rub@@ bery and the highway median and the local golf course is being wat@@ ered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant .
so there 's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in A@@ stro@@ tur@@ f and buying c@@ ac@@ t@@ uses .

random@@ ized clinical trials are incredible tools , and , in fact , the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed .

so place your hand above your own and feel its r@@ hy@@ mic beat .
some people can just send their mind wan@@ dering to distr@@ act themselves from pain .
what exactly creates these perceptions of pain ?
this is your Gre@@ y matter .
and brain super@@ highways carry information as electrical impul@@ ses from one area to another .
the super@@ highway that carries pain information from the spinal cord to the brain is our sensing path@@ way that ends in the cor@@ te@@ x , a part of the brain that decides what to do with the pain signal .
another system of interconnected brain cells called the sali@@ ence network decides what to pay attention to .
the brain also responds to the pain and has to cope with these pain signals .
but mod@@ ulation networks are also activated that deliver endor@@ ph@@ ins and en@@ ke@@ ph@@ al@@ ins , chemicals released when you 're in pain or during extreme exercise , creating the run@@ ner 's high .
all these networks and pathways work together to create your pain experience , to prevent further tissue damage , and help you to cope with pain .
this is why some people have greater pain than others and why some develop chronic pain that does not respond to treatment , while others respond well .
variability in pain sensi@@ ti@@ vities is not so different than all kinds of variability in responses to other stimul@@ i .
like how some people love roller co@@ asters , but other people suffer from terrible motion sickness .
at the same time , the more cha@@ otic the story , the less you should try to follow it in real time .

welcome to the ant colony .
ants have some of the most complex social organization in the animal kingdom , living in structured colonies containing different types of members who perform specific roles .
the s@@ cent dissip@@ ates and ants are no longer attracted to that path .
tat@@ to@@ os have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and devi@@ ant or tren@@ dy youth f@@ ads .
but have you ever wondered how tat@@ to@@ oing really works ?
and it is this very process that makes tat@@ to@@ os permanent .
with no way to dispose of the pig@@ ment , the dy@@ es inside them remain visible through the skin .
der@@ mal cells , however , remain in place until they die .
when they do , they are taken up , ink and all , by younger cells nearby , so the ink stays where it is .
but with time , tat@@ to@@ os do f@@ ade naturally as the body re@@ acts to the alien pig@@ ment particles , slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system 's macro@@ ph@@ ages .
technically , yes .
the laser beam breaks the ink glob@@ ules into smaller particles that can then be cleared away by the macro@@ ph@@ ages .
for this reason , removing a tat@@ too is still more difficult than getting one , but not impossible .

you 've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth , but how does it work ?
is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blan@@ ket ?
this is where we enter the quantum realm .
every atom and molec@@ ule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electr@@ ons .
if a pho@@ ton carries too much or too little energy , the molec@@ ule has no choice but to let it fly past .
this is why glass is transparent .
carbon dioxide do@@ es@@ n 't absorb light directly from the Sun .
one that do@@ es@@ n 't appear to be emitting light at all : Earth .
the hot@@ ter an object gets , the higher frequency the light it em@@ its .
95 % of the light they em@@ it is invisible to our eyes .
and I believe that this is fundamentally a problem , because it do@@ es@@ n 't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity that we have in our bodies .
or you can visu@@ alize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways .
and so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth @@@ -@@ @ sensing camera like a Microsoft Kin@@ ec@@ t .
so with that , I will leave you .

you might mistake a person far away for someone else , or you 're sure you 're about to catch a fl@@ y@@ ball , and it hits the ground in front of you .

if we repeat the Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger 's cat experiment with this pair of cats , the outcome of the experiment can be one of four possibilities .
in other words , there can be a two cat system , such that the outcome will always be one cat alive and the other cat dead .
one of them is written by a human , and the other one 's written by a computer .
so in 2013 , my friend Benjamin L@@ air@@ d and I , we created a T@@ uring test for poetry online .
it 's called bot or not , and you can go and play it for yourselves .
so you 'd be surprised to find that Po@@ em 1 was written by the very human poet Ger@@ tr@@ ude Ste@@ in .
so R@@ K@@ CP is an algorithm designed by R@@ ay Kur@@ z@@ we@@ il , who 's a director of engineering at Google and a firm belie@@ ver in artificial intelligence .
so Ger@@ tr@@ ude Ste@@ in , who 's a human , is able to write a po@@ em that fo@@ ols a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer .
do we take that William B@@ lake is somehow more of a human than Ger@@ tr@@ ude Ste@@ in ?
but what I do have are a bun@@ ch of insights about our relationship with technology .
so , what I 've fig@@ ured out , we 've seen this when earlier today , we say that William B@@ lake is more of a human than Ger@@ tr@@ ude Ste@@ in .
this has led me to understand that the human is not a cold , hard fact .
as a boy , Henry had crac@@ ked his sk@@ ull in an accident and soon began having seizures , bl@@ acking out and losing control of bodily functions .
H.@@ M. ' s seizures virtually disappeared , with no change in personality , and his I@@ Q even improved .
but there was one problem : his memory was shot .
what she discovered through a series of tests and interviews did@@ n 't just contribute greatly to the study of memory .
Mil@@ ner 's results were not only the first clu@@ e for the now familiar distinction between short @@@ -@@ @ term and long @@@ -@@ @ term memory , but show that each uses different brain regions .
H.@@ M. ' s mind could form the initial impressions , but without a hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus to perform this memory consolidation , they eroded , like messages sc@@ ra@@ w@@ led in sand .
this distinction between " knowing that " and " knowing how " has underpinned all memory research since .
how many times does the ch@@ orus repeat in your favorite song ?
and , take a moment to think , how many times have you listened to it ?
chances are you 've heard that ch@@ orus repeated dozens , if not hundreds , of times , and it 's not just popular songs in the West that repeat a lot .
so , why does music rely so heavily on repetition ?
in short , people tend to prefer things they 've been exposed to before .
it also works for everything from shapes to Super B@@ ow@@ l ads .
to investigate , psychologists asked people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition .
in this way , repetition can open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing .
it says that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a met@@ aph@@ or in everything from literary criticism to sports commentary .
the real origin is much deeper and more amazing .
the Un@@ certainty Principle exists because everything in the universe beha@@ ves like both a particle and a wave at the same time .
waves , on the other hand , are disturbances spread out in space , like ri@@ p@@ ples covering the surface of a pond .
it has a good probability of being in lots of different places .
wa@@ vel@@ ength is essential for quantum physics because an object 's wa@@ vel@@ ength is related to its momentum , mass times velocity .
a heavy object has lots of momentum even if it 's not moving very fast , which again means a very short wa@@ vel@@ ength .
this is why we don 't notice the wave nature of everyday objects .
so , if we have a pure wave , we can measure its wa@@ vel@@ ength , and thus its momentum , but it has no position .
to get a particle with both position and momentum , we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves , but only in a small area .
if we add a third wave , the regions where the waves cancel out get bigger , a fourth and they get bigger still , with the wa@@ vi@@ er regions becoming nar@@ rower .
that 's a quantum object with both wave and particle nature , but to accomplish this , we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum .
the positions is@@ n 't restricted to a single point .
both position and momentum are now uncertain , and the uncertainties are connected .
if you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave pac@@ ket , you need to add more waves , which means a bigger momentum uncertainty .
now , why would I suggest that producing drought @@@ -@@ @ tolerant crops will go towards providing food security ?
and it 's estimated that by 2050 , we 'll be between 9 and 10 billion people , with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa .
that percentage of 70 percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change .
and preferably among them , some drought @@@ -@@ @ tolerant crops .
now , making drought @@@ -@@ @ tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world .
water is essential to life on this planet .
all life reactions happen in water .
you and I are 65 percent water -- we lose one percent of that , we die .

it 's also called the up@@ side @@@ -@@ @ down tree , simply because the proportion of roots to sho@@ ots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted up@@ side down .
ann@@ uals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies .
seeds are energy @@@ -@@ @ rich so there 's a lot of food cal@@ ories , you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine , but there 's a down@@ side .
they just don 't need them .
they grow in the rainy season and they 've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year .
ma@@ ize crop in Africa , two weeks without rain and it 's dead .
there is a solution : resurrection plants .
and at the bottom , there 's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens .

have they ret@@ asked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants ?
and I 'm going to illustrate this very cr@@ ud@@ ely for ma@@ ize , where the chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desi@@ c@@ cation tolerance .
they only switch them on in seed tissues .
in its simplest terms , sad@@ ness is often thought of as the natural reaction to a difficult situation .
when a friend says , " I 'm sad , " you often respond by asking , " What happened ? "
Mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ ia comes from mel@@ ain@@ a K@@ ole , the word for black bile , the hum@@ or believed to cause sad@@ ness .
in his master@@ piece " The An@@ atom@@ y of Mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y , " Bur@@ ton wrote , " He that increas@@ eth wisdom increas@@ eth sorrow . "
perhaps sad@@ ness helped generate the unity we needed to survive , but many have wondered whether the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering we experience ourselves .
am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer ?
now , of course Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy excluded too many .

then all income stems from capital , from profits , and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete .

if it we@@ ren 't possible for quantum objects to be in two states at once , the computer you 're using to watch this cou@@ ld@@ n 't exist .

the impact it would leave affected not only these slaves and their descendants , but the economies and hi@@ stories of large parts of the world .
and so to meet the massive demand for labor , the Europeans looked to Africa .
African slavery had existed for centuries in various forms .
some slaves were in@@ den@@ tured servants , with a limited term and the chance to buy one 's freedom .
but when white cap@@ tains came offering manufactured goods , weapons , and r@@ um for slaves , African kings and merchants had little reason to hesitate .
they viewed the people they sold not as fellow Africans but criminals , debtors , or prisoners of war from rival tribes .
slavery replaced other criminal sentences , and capturing slaves became a motivation for war , rather than its result .
those who survived were comple@@ t@@ ley de@@ human@@ ized , treated as mere cargo .
but what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade had on Africa 's future .
thus , slavery in Europe and the Americas acquired a racial basis , making it impossible for slaves and their future descendants to attain equal status in society .
in all of these ways , the Atlantic slave trade was an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued long after its abolition .
this structure of the pin@@ hole camera with a lens served as the basis for what would eventually evolve into the human eye .

and I said , " That 's a really good idea , what else could it do ? "
final story , we also built a computer .

people who are depressed are 40 % more likely to develop memory problems .
a study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that older people with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline over a six @@@ -@@ @ year period .

my name is Matthew Williams , and I am a champion .
people use the r @@@ -@@ @ word in front of me , and they think it do@@ es@@ n 't matter .
what do you think of when you see someone like me ?
for those of you who are@@ n 't familiar , Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities .
for a while , I did not play any sports , did@@ n 't have many friends and felt left out and sad .
no one thought they could participate in sports , let alone be a valued member of society .
lots of people doub@@ ted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities .
far from being hidden away , we were che@@ ered and celebrated .
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves .
you will not be able to look behind you or step out of line .
when I say to begin , each of you must guess the color of your hat starting with the person in the back and moving up the line .
prisoner three sees an even number of black h@@ ats , so he knows that his must be one of the black h@@ ats the first two prisoners saw .
but she only sees one , so she deduc@@ es that her hat is also black .
you 'll find that this strategy works for any possible arrangement of the h@@ ats .
this is confidence .
there are several factors that impact confidence .
one : what you 're born with , such as your genes , which will impact things like the balance of neuro@@ chemicals in your brain .
picture your success when you 're beginning a difficult task , something as simple as listening to music with deep bass ; it can promote feelings of power .

so I check " black , " but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so un@@ scientifically .
well , I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice .
it shapes physicians ' diagnos@@ es , measurements , treatments , prescriptions , even the very definition of diseases .
soci@@ ologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction .
when we identify people as black , white , Asian , Native American , L@@ atin@@ a , we 're referring to social groupings with made up demar@@ c@@ ations that have changed over time and vary around the world .
doctors are supposed to practice evidence @@@ -@@ @ based medicine , and they 're increasingly called to join the gen@@ om@@ ic revolution .
but think about the dangerous message it sent , that black people 's bodies are so sub@@ standard , a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients .
you see , race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference .
it 's much easier and more luc@@ r@@ ative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them .
race medicine is bad medicine , it 's poor science and it 's a false interpretation of humanity .
can you resist tackling a brain te@@ aser written by one of the s@@ mar@@ test people in history ?

I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident .

so instead of throwing away these pieces of sw@@ ol@@ len brain , we decided with Jean @@@ -@@ @ Franç@@ ois Brun@@ et , who is a colleague of mine , a bi@@ ologist , to study them .
so that 's exactly what we had to do with these cells .
they divide slowly , and after a few weeks of culture , they even died .
so to prove it , we decided to design an experimental paradigm .
so for that , we trained mon@@ keys to perform a manual de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity task .
they were very good at it .
so when we were sure that the mon@@ key had reached his plat@@ eau of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
so on the left side , you see the mon@@ key that has spontaneously recovered .
he 's not so accurate , not so quick .
but in fiber , the bonds between mon@@ os@@ ac@@ ch@@ ari@@ de molecules are beta bonds , which your body can 't break down .

the two sides of your brain look similar , but function differently .
this synchronized rotation push@@ es fluid from the right side of the embry@@ o to the left .
on the node 's left @@@ -@@ @ hand rim , other c@@ ilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes on the embry@@ o 's left side .
these genes direct the cells to make certain proteins , and in just a few hours , the right and left sides of the embry@@ o are chem@@ ically different .
it begins as a straight tube along the center of the embry@@ o , but when the embry@@ o is around three weeks old , the tube starts to bend into a c @@@ -@@ @ shape and rotate towards the right side of the body .
if we zoom in even more , we see that many of cells ' basic building blocks , like nucle@@ ic acids , proteins , and sug@@ ars , are inherently asym@@ metric .
proteins have complex asym@@ metric shapes , and those proteins control which way cells migrate and which way embry@@ onic c@@ ilia tw@@ ir@@ l .

modern society is shaped by sending and detecting electromagnetic radiation .
nuclear radiation comes from natural sources , like rad@@ on , a gas which se@@ eps up from the ground .
we also refine naturally occurring radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants .
so if we live in a world of radiation , how can we escape its dangerous effects ?
the biggest health risk occurs when lots of ion@@ izing radiation hits us in a short time period , also known as an acute exposure .
this can trigger can@@ cers , cellular dysfunction , and potentially even death .

so let me tell you a data science story .
and it begins with my student N@@ ick .
I said , " You know , N@@ ick , we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately , and we don 't have a great understanding .
let 's see if we can understand gl@@ uc@@ ose response .
it 's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change gl@@ uc@@ ose , because it 's core to our practice .
and I said , " Oh ! you 're cle@@ ver . good idea . show me the list . "
but what caught my eye was , on the list there were two drugs : par@@ ox@@ e@@ tine , or P@@ ax@@ il , an anti@@ de@@ pres@@ sant ; and pra@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , or pra@@ vac@@ hol , a ch@@ ole@@ ster@@ ol medication .
but we needed special patients .
so a 20 b@@ ump -- pretty significant .
when we looked at the gl@@ uc@@ ose of di@@ abe@@ tics , it was going up 60 mill@@ igra@@ ms per dec@@ il@@ iter , not just 20 .
we took m@@ ice and we gave them one P , par@@ ox@@ e@@ tine .
so we had 50 phrases that we called the " diabetes words . "
and we did first a baseline .
however , there 's a couple of things .
but we can 't have a system that closes that data off , because it is too rich of a source of inspiration , innovation and discovery for new things in medicine .
first of all , it 's well accepted that exercise is good for our bodies and minds , and that 's definitely true .
sustained abundance of good food enabled a healthier population to boom economically .
for example , if someone weigh@@ s 65 kil@@ gor@@ ams and is 1.5 meters tall , they have a B@@ MI of about 29 .
while B@@ MI can be a helpful estimate of healthy weight , actual body fat percentage can only really be determined by also considering information like wa@@ ist circum@@ ference and muscle mass .
so how does a person become ob@@ ese ?
in most cases , this imbalance comes from a combination of circumstances and choices .
but globally , one in four adults and eight out of ten adolescents are@@ n 't active enough .

a second strategy would be to start by sorting just the first two books .
then , take the third book and compare it with the book in the second spot .
if it belongs before the second book , swap them , then compare it with the book in the first spot , and swap again if needed .
now you 've sorted the first three books .
in that case , the total number of comparisons would be 40@@ 9,@@ 280 , taking almost five days .
you 're still doing way too many comparisons .
call it the partition and compare it to every other book .
you can keep creating sub @@@ -@@ @ partitions like this until you have a bun@@ ch of small sub @@@ -@@ @ lines , each of which you 'd sort quickly using another strategy , like In@@ sertion S@@ ort .
each round of parti@@ tioning requires about 1,@@ 280 comparisons .

essentially the same way our own bra@@ ins interpret emotions , by learning how to spot them .

there 's just one problem : the plane can only hold 180 kil@@ ol@@ iters of fuel , only enough for exactly half the journey .

the key is to maximize the support each assistant provides , not w@@ asting a single kil@@ ol@@ iter of fuel .

what do you think when you look at me ?
that 's just how the media has been portra@@ ying people who look like me .
one study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative .
let me tell you who I am .
I 'm an intro@@ vert .
I 'm a w@@ ann@@ a@@ be fitness fan@@ atic .
but not like Lady G@@ aga says , because baby , I was@@ n 't born this way .
no , not as a gay person like some of my friends , but as a Muslim , and decided to start wearing the hij@@ ab , my head covering .
I read and reflected and questioned and doub@@ ted and , ultimately , believed .
it was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Qur@@ an .
I see myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
and so later , I got married , and like all good Egyptians , started my career as an engineer .
I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning .
there was smoke , air@@ planes flying into buildings , people jumping out of buildings .
not only had my country been attacked , but in a flash , somebody else 's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect .
that same day , we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school .
and I was watching the news , wall @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ wall coverage .
emotions were so raw , understand@@ ably , and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims , or people who were perceived to be Muslim , being pulled out and beaten in the street .
and yet , something did@@ n 't feel right .
so , some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques .
( appl@@ ause ) Muslims are inven@@ tors and teachers , first respon@@ ders and Olympic athletes .
( appl@@ ause ) Bo@@ th groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book .
recently , a prominent im@@ am told me a story that really took me ab@@ ack .
he said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS .
he did@@ n 't shame her for her rage -- instead , he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world .
we become more accepting of author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , conformity and prejudice .
we might be the first to feel it , but the toxic air of fear is har@@ ming us all .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Cha@@ pel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .

did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home ?
so we decided to go to the mosque .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don 't let this stage distr@@ act you , I 'm completely ordinary .
it turns out that this is actually a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination inside your brain .
if the ne@@ ur@@ onal ensem@@ bles for the dol@@ ph@@ in and p@@ ine@@ apple are activated at the same time , we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image .
if the ne@@ ur@@ onal ensem@@ bles are turned on at the same time , you experience the composite image just as if you 'd actually seen it .
you can 't change the length of the connections , but your brain , especially as it develops in childhood , does have a way to change the conduc@@ tion velocity .
ne@@ ural fi@@ bers are wrapped in a fat@@ ty substance called my@@ el@@ in .
and fi@@ bers with thick@@ er layers of my@@ el@@ in can conduct signals 100 times faster or more than those with th@@ inner ones .
some scientists now think that this difference in my@@ el@@ ination could be the key to uniform conduc@@ tion time in the brain , and consequently , to our mental synthesis ability .
not self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars .
well , he was cru@@ ising around downtown Los Angeles , my home@@ town , and he saw trol@@ leys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go .
he said , well , why don 't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a j@@ it@@ ney -- that was s@@ lan@@ g for a nickel .
and so people jumped on board , and not just in Los Angeles but across the country .
they were clearly not happy about the j@@ it@@ ney ju@@ ggernaut .
and so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the j@@ it@@ ney .
but the j@@ it@@ ney , by 1919 , was regulated completely out of existence .
we even have sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers built for cars .
that 's the world we live in today .
it 's called mass transit .
well , it 's because mass transit h@@ as@@ n 't yet fig@@ ured out how to get to everybody 's door@@ step .
and once we introduced u@@ ber@@ PO@@ OL , well , you see there 's not as many bright colors .
and so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago .
and since then , we 've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads and we 've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air .
now , in China everything is super@@ sized , and so we 're doing 15 million u@@ ber@@ PO@@ OL trips per month , that 's 500,000 per day .
and when I talk to my team , we don 't talk about , " He@@ y , well , 100,000 people car@@ pooling every week and we 're done . "
how do we get that to a million ?
you get up in the morning , get ready for work , get your coffee , go to your car and you light up the U@@ ber app , and all of a sudden , you become an U@@ ber driver .
you can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment 's notice , for 54 cents a mile or less .
but what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people car@@ pooling in Los Angeles ?
how would our cities be different today ?
well , we lost that chance .
now , I 'm as excited as anybody else about self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars but do we have to really wait five , 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality ?
so first of all , last week I think it was , I switched on my phone and tried to book an U@@ ber and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't find the app .
did you notice other people not finding the app that day ?
and so what we did was almost what I would call an im@@ mature version of a luxury brand that looked like a bad@@ ge on a luxury car .
now , when you first roll out something like that , I mean , your hands are swe@@ ating , you 've got -- you know , you 're a little worried .
ca : OK , that 's cool .
and make sure that people are constantly checking to say , " Are we good people doing good work ? "
do you want that ?
U@@ ber@@ X , when we first started , was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product .
and so what that means is more trips per hour , more minutes of the hour where they 're productive and actually , earnings come up .
so that addresses that first part .
ca : at the time when self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars are coming -- T@@ K : sure , sure , sure . sorry , I missed that .
this is a world that 's going to exist , and for good reason .
so I think there 's a lot of good .
now imagine that one day , Mary 's black and white screen malfunctions and an apple appears in color .
the knowledge argument contradicts the theory of phy@@ sic@@ alism , which says that everything , including mental states , has a physical explanation .
these ine@@ ff@@ able experiences have properties called qu@@ alia , subjective qualities that you can 't accurately describe or measure .
but there still is@@ n 't a definitive answer to the question of whether Mary would learn anything new when she sees the apple .
and would this mean there are certain aspects of the universe that lie permanently beyond our comprehen@@ sion ?

we do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices .
in New York City , premature mortality -- that 's death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones .
a recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country .
you 've probably felt something every time I 've said it .
we don 't have to have all the answers to call for change .
we just need courage .

without water , a human can only survive for about 100 hours .
beyond dry@@ ness , tar@@ di@@ grades can also tolerate other extreme stresses : being frozen , heated up past the boiling point of water , high levels of radiation , and even the vacuum of outer space .
in fact , this ear@@ thly evolution has given rise to over 1100 known species of tar@@ di@@ grades and there are probably many others yet to be discovered .
in the process , tar@@ di@@ grades could even help us answer a critical question : could life survive on planets much less hosp@@ itable than our own ?
diet , too , is emerging as one of the leading influences on the health of our gu@@ ts .
in a recent study , scientists exchanged the regular high @@@ -@@ @ fiber di@@ ets of a group of rural South Africans with the high @@@ -@@ @ fat , meat @@@ -@@ @ heavy di@@ ets of a group of African @@@ -@@ @ Americans .
so what goes wrong with our gu@@ t bacteria when we eat low @@@ -@@ @ fiber processed foods ?
lower fiber means less fuel for the gu@@ t bacteria , essentially star@@ ving them until they die off .
this results in less diversity and hungry bacteria .
minim@@ ally processed , fresh foods generally have more fiber and provide better fuel .
so lightly ste@@ amed , s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed , or raw vegetables are typically more beneficial than fri@@ ed dishes .
y@@ og@@ urt is another fer@@ mented food that can introduce helpful bacteria into our gu@@ ts .
that do@@ es@@ n 't necessarily mean that all y@@ og@@ urt is good for us , though .

the lab is a four by four compound of 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner and an exit at the southeast .
each room is connected to the adjacent ones by an air@@ lock , and the virus has been released in every room except the entrance .
to destroy it , you must enter each contaminated room and pull its emergency self @@@ -@@ @ de@@ struc@@ t switch .
so how can you destroy the virus in every contaminated room and survive to tell the story ?
pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself .
although any proposed solution can be easily verified , we have no reliable formula or short@@ cut for finding one , or determining that one exists .
in any grid with that configuration , a Hamil@@ ton@@ ian path that starts and ends in opposite corners is impossible .
but there 's one room that was@@ n 't contaminated - the entrance .
that return trip gives you four options for a successful route , and a similar set of options if you destroyed this room first .
compare that with the tor@@ to@@ ise , which can age to more than 100 years .
but as we age , this process slow@@ s down .

it 's the day after graduating from design school and I 'm having a yard sale .
and this guy pul@@ ls up in this red Maz@@ da and he starts looking through my stuff .
and the voice in my head goes , " Wa@@ it , what ? "
there 's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room .
in art school , you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it 's the whole experience .
OK , I need you to take out your phones .
now that you have your phone out , I 'd like you to unlock your phone .
what if your neighbor had introduced themselves first , with their name , where they 're from , the name of their kids or their dog ?
( la@@ ughter ) Now how would you feel about handing your phone over ?
now , that 's a natural social bias .
but what 's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix , in this case , with reviews .
we bet our whole company on the hope that , with the right design , people would be willing to overcome the stranger @@@ -@@ @ danger bias .
people share a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
today , homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation .
what would that look like ?
clearly , it 's not as crazy as we were taught .
although the bird 's outward appearance may not strike you as especially odd , it uses this strange , intr@@ icate , cor@@ k @@@ -@@ @ screw shaped contra@@ ption to reproduce .
after all , the function of gen@@ it@@ alia seems simple .
a penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vag@@ ina receives it and delivers it to the egg .
males using their pen@@ ises for cour@@ t@@ ship and females controlling their own sperm management are two reasons why gen@@ it@@ alia evolve into such complex shapes .
so we see cycles of adaptation in an evolutionary arms race to retain control .

we have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility , and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined .
it was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today .
in theory , refugees are a shared global responsibility .
it 's that we 're not applying them adequately to a changing world , and that 's what we need to reconsider .

I was standing in ar@@ ra@@ ign@@ ments that day when Christop@@ her 's case came across my desk .
I was 29 years old , a brand @@@ -@@ @ new prosecutor , and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christop@@ her 's life .
Christop@@ her 's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such , but I did@@ n 't think bran@@ ding him a fel@@ on for the rest of his life was the right answer .
we stick to an outdated method , counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want , and that 's safer communities .
yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have ar@@ ra@@ igned Christop@@ her .
they have little appreciation for what we can do .
ar@@ ra@@ ig@@ ning Christop@@ her would give him a criminal record , making it harder for him to get a job , setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today .
with a criminal record and without a job , Christop@@ her would be unable to find employment , education or stable housing .
as I stood there stu@@ ffing free finger sand@@ w@@ ich@@ es into my mouth , as you do as public servant -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I noticed across the room , a young man w@@ aving and smil@@ ing at me and approaching me .
" you cared about me , and you changed my life . "
Christop@@ her did community service .
along the way , with the help and guidance of my district attorney , my supervisor and judges , I learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ru@@ ining them .
we helped a woman who was arrested for ste@@ aling gro@@ cer@@ ies to feed her kids get a job .
instead of putting an abused teen@@ ager in adult jail for pun@@ ching another teen@@ ager , we secured mental health treatment and community supervision .
number two : it 's the right thing to do .
demand more ; vote for the prosecutor who 's helping people stay out of jail , not putting them in .
demand better .
thank you .
which means that there are a lot of family events .
so as a child , my parents used to drag me to these family events .
this man was extremely successful : he was confident and powerful .
well , the first thing I targeted was trem@@ ors , right ?
and then , when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table , it struck me , this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land , how does he climb a stair@@ case ?
let 's take a look at what I saw .
and then ...
he told me that I made him feel like his old self again .
when psychologists D@@ unning and K@@ ru@@ ger first described the effect in 1999 , they argued that people lacking knowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse .
that may be why people with a moderate amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence in their abilities .
( audio ) Natalia Ry@@ bc@@ z@@ yn@@ ski : ye@@ ah , I had someone call me " Dr. De@@ ad Th@@ ings . "
L@@ N : and at some point , she noticed something .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Audio ) N@@ R : ( laugh@@ s ) U@@ m , no . no , we got this .
but it cou@@ ld@@ n 't have been either of those .
( audio ) N@@ R : ye@@ ah , you want to track it . it 's kind of important .
it turns out that the 3.5 million @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old bone that Natalia had du@@ g out of the High Arctic belonged to ...
so this ca@@ mel would have been about nine feet tall , weighed around a ton .
for nearly 40 of the 45 million years that cam@@ els have been around , you could only find them in North America , around 20 different species , maybe more .
( audio ) N@@ R : I know , w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that be great ?
you could learn some tiny thing that forces you to re@@ frame everything you thought you knew .
( appl@@ ause ) This is Az@@ uri .
( la@@ ughter ) So Az@@ uri is on a break from her regular gi@@ g at the Radio City Music Hall .
it requires our willingness to read@@ just , to re@@ imagine .
rather than dealing with things as they come up - Oh , the mouse was moved ?
more of that file downloaded ? - the system groups these interrup@@ tions together based on how long they can afford to wait .
that means relying on many different types of le@@ uk@@ ocy@@ tes to tackle threats in different ways .
despite this diversity , we classify le@@ uk@@ ocy@@ tes in two main cellular groups , which coordinate a two @@@ -@@ @ pronged attack .
as these circulate , they destroy any foreign cells they encounter , simply by consuming them .
b @@@ -@@ @ cells can produce millions of these , which then cycle through the body and attack the inv@@ aders until the worst of the threat is neutr@@ alized .
it do@@ es@@ n 't always work so well .
and in point of fact , I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind .
they supported me all the way through it .
it was@@ n 't their dream .
( la@@ ughter ) And -- There was , however , one aw@@ k@@ ward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about .
something was wrong .
and so I said , " M@@ om , what 's on your mind ? "
that 's not even close .
I want the next two billion , so I 've got to know why .
they have lifted billions out of poverty . "
a majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate .
he does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ .
there 's no other way .
we need innovative thinking .
a lot of it 's on this stage .
so how are we going to do it ? how are we going to do it together ?
where does this start ? it starts here .
she cou@@ ld@@ n 't wait to get out of her parents ' house , to prove to them that she 's an adult , and to prove to her new friends that she belongs .
this means there 's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States .
so this , to me , is a tragic but a sol@@ vable problem .
we started by talking to college survivors .
we created a website that actually does this and we launched it [ ... ] in August , on two college cam@@ p@@ uses .
we don 't have to live in a world where 99 percent of ra@@ pi@@ sts get away with it .
those first few months ?
I write the blog Wa@@ it But Why .
and to test this , I found an M@@ RI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non @@@ -@@ @ proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ator , so I could compare them .
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
( la@@ ughter ) There is a difference .
( si@@ gh ) Now , what is going on here ?
now , in the animal world , that works fine .
( la@@ ughter ) And to the Mon@@ key , humans are just another animal species .
but , if you haven 't noticed , now we 're not in tribal times .
but other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant , for the sake of the big picture .
it 's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
( la@@ ughter ) So the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system 's in may@@ hem .
this is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
these are people who were nurses , bankers , pa@@ inters , engineers and lots and lots of PhD students .
these people were writing with intense frustration about what proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this Mon@@ key had done to them .
but there 's a second kind of proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ation that happens in situations when there is no deadline .
I call this a Life Calendar .
that 's a job for all of us .
but we 'll take just one common case - a sin@@ us infection - as an example .
when our sin@@ uses are infected , our immune response he@@ ats up the area , ro@@ asting the bacteria and infl@@ aming the ca@@ vities well past their usual size .
mig@@ ra@@ ines and cluster head@@ aches are more complicated , and we haven 't yet discovered reliable treatments that work for everyone .
but of course his eyes were gla@@ zed over , and the moment was dead .
and I think computers today are doing quite the opposite .
whether you 're sending an email to your wife or you 're com@@ posing a sym@@ phony or just consol@@ ing a friend , you 're doing it in pretty much the same way .
this was all shot through a Go@@ Pro through our very glasses .
we 're inherently these social pri@@ mates .
so , with the MI@@ T Media La@@ b , for quite a while now , we 've been engaged in a field called active music .
we tou@@ red that for a long time . it is now permanently in Vienna , where we built a museum around it .
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on .
everybody can experience music in a profound way , we just have to make different tools .
so this guy wants to live forever , he downloads himself into his environment .
and here 's the great bar@@ it@@ one James M@@ add@@ al@@ ena as he enters The System .
this pre@@ m@@ ie@@ res in Monaco -- it 's in September 2009 . if by any chance you can 't make it , another idea with this project -- here 's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
and I 'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage , so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like .
this is by far the far@@ thest he 's stra@@ yed from Te@@ w@@ k@@ s@@ bury Hospital , I can tell you that , because he 's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music .
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software .
and , you know , I think this is a perspective shift . it 's not that our technologies -- they provide access , they allow us to create pieces of creative work .
but what about expression ? what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ? you know , do our technologies allow us to express ?
and so that 's what we 'll do today .
so he can use his infrared trac@@ ker to go directly into Hy@@ pers@@ core .
( la@@ ughter ) TM : he 's really modest , too .
so he can go in Hy@@ pers@@ core . you start out by making mel@@ o@@ dies and rhyth@@ ms .
it 's going to be looked at by this camera , analyze his movements , it 's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to .
and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen .
so , in hearing this piece , as I mentioned before , the most important thing is the music 's great , and it 'll show you who Dan is .
so , are we ready Adam ?
the e@@ pon@@ y@@ mous moon@@ shot .
we use the word " moon@@ shots " to remind us to keep our visions big -- to keep dre@@ aming .
and then number three : there has to be some reason to believe that the technology for such a radical solution could actually be built .
the moon@@ shot factory is a mess@@ y place .
but rather than avoid the m@@ ess , pre@@ tend it 's not there , we 've tried to make that our strength .
run at all the hardest parts of the problem first .
vertical farming uses 10 times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming .
and because you can grow the food close to where it 's consumed , you don 't have to transport it large distances .
economic development of landlocked countries is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure .
the radical solution ?
this has the potential to lower , at least overall , the cost , time and carbon footprint of shipping without needing run@@ ways .
if there 's an A@@ chil@@ les ' he@@ el in one our projects , we want to know it now , up front , not way down the road .
so we killed this project , too .
discovering a major f@@ law in a project do@@ es@@ n 't always mean that it ends the project .
sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path .
but that was@@ n 't actually our goal when we started .
and it 's shaped everything we 've done since then .
this could bring online as many as four billion more people , who today have little or no internet connection .
so since 2012 , the Lo@@ on team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely to kill their project .
could we get the ballo@@ ons to talk to each other through the sky so that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas ?
we made giant pil@@ low @@@ -@@ @ shaped ballo@@ ons .
this particular ballo@@ on , our latest ballo@@ on , can navigate a two @@@ -@@ @ mile vertical stretch of sky and can sa@@ il itself to within 500 meters of where it wants to go from 20,000 kilometers away .
( appl@@ ause ) Our ballo@@ ons today are doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do .
will I be fired ? "
I started with our secret .
I 'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen .
we work hard at X to make it safe to fail .
they get appl@@ ause from their peers .
they get promoted for it .
but enthusiastic skep@@ ticism is not the enemy of bound@@ less optimism .
half the students completed both problem types with nothing at stake , while the others completed them when calm and under pressure .
gol@@ fers usually perform this action sub@@ consciously , so those who suddenly tun@@ ed in to the precise details of their own moves also became worse at making accurate shots .
so , perhaps we can modify that age @@@ -@@ @ old saying : practice , under pressure , with focus , and with that glorious end goal in sight , makes perfect .
we have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people , products that enable natural interactions , voice controls or bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics .
why ?
that 's displacement of space .
you 'd probably try to classify things as a human , an environment or an object .
the world was mes@@ mer@@ ized .
humans are natural explo@@ rers .
when we dial this real world to the virtual , we can do magical things .
we 're taking the first steps .
AK : thank you J@@ ef@@ f , this was amazing .
thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today .
come this way .
AK : and there 's hol@@ ographic J@@ ef@@ f Nor@@ ris .
J@@ n : yes ?
AK : I 'll take a step back .
( la@@ ughter ) Alex , really , that was amazing . thank you so much .
on paper , these countries seem very different .
so this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet , one , you had to t@@ we@@ et in English .
and suddenly , your whole world opened up .
and that 's when I realized what this was .
Africa has six of the world 's largest refugee centers .
one in a to@@ asted @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ anu@@ t skin and the other , also adopted , more on the be@@ ig@@ e side , like a pan@@ cake .
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bun@@ ch of contradictory feelings .
in some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
years later I married a Span@@ i@@ ard .
what will be the color of your children ?
I portra@@ y the subjects in a white background .
the project had a great welcome -- invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
we all together build Human@@ ae .
so your work has a very special place in my heart and it 's very important for me . "
a woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , " All my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereo@@ type , a box .
and I have to say , the most interesting part in this picture , that people mostly react to , is the walking desk .
and I sit there alone in the quiet .
really -- I work alone in my house , often in my bath@@ ro@@ be .
I was 21 at the time , so I was young , but I had already programmed for half my life , basically .
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't really love other people -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) But I love computers , I love inter@@ acting with other people on email , because it kind of gives you that buffer .
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
there 's a lot of people who make small , small changes .
L@@ t : ye@@ ah , I think I was the proto@@ typical ner@@ d .
I was not a people person back then .
that 's about , like , just starting something and not saying , " OK , I 'm done , let 's do something else -- Lo@@ ok : sh@@ in@@ y ! "
and I worked for the same company , in Sil@@ icon Valley , for the whole time .
that is un@@ heard of .
talk about that a bit .
going back to the " I 'm not a people person , " -- sometimes I 'm also ...
shall we say , " my@@ op@@ ic " when it comes to other people 's feelings , and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people .
and then when I try to explain to them that maybe you 're nice , maybe you should be more aggressive , they see that as me being not nice .
I 'm not a people person ; it 's not something I 'm particularly proud of , but it 's part of me .
and one of the things I really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together .
and coming back to the point where I said earlier that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work , it turned out , and very quickly turned out , that those commercial people were lovely , lovely people .
I care about the technology .
there are people who care about the U@@ I .
( la@@ ughter ) So there 's different kinds of people , and I 'm not making exc@@ uses , I 'm trying to explain .
what is the difference between these two ?
L@@ t : so I guarantee you , everybody who raised their hand , they have done what 's called a s@@ ingly @@@ -@@ @ linked list .
and it 's taught -- This , the first not very good taste approach , is basically how it 's taught to be done when you start out coding .
this is CS 101 .
to me , the sign of people I really want to work with is that they have good taste , which is how ...
good taste is much bigger than this .
good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinc@@ tively knowing what 's the right way to do things .
I mean , you 've changed the future .
and I am not a vi@@ sionary .
but I 'm looking at the ground , and I want to fix the po@@ th@@ ole that 's right in front of me before I fall in .
and people love T@@ es@@ la .
I mean , there are people who name their companies after him .
but I think I 'm more of an E@@ dis@@ on than a T@@ es@@ la .
L@@ t : so , I 'm of two minds there .
I think one reason open source works so well in code is that at the end of the day , code tends to be somewhat black and white .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's up to you guys to make them , right ?
they can 't get what they need when they need it .
and for these Americans , government is more than just a presidential election every four years .
we were a cutting @@@ -@@ @ edge start @@@ -@@ @ up that changed the game of politics forever .
let me paint the picture for you .
now , this is a very exi@@ st@@ entially painful moment for any organization , because it means as government continues to operate as it 's programmed to do , failure is nearly inevitable .
and when the status quo is the ris@@ ki@@ est option , that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption .
how do we fix this ?
now , the good news is : it 's starting to work .
this , my friends , is your typical immigration application .
six years and 1.2 billion dollars later , no working product was delivered -- 1.2 billion with a " B. "
now , for immigrant visa holders , a replacement green card is a big deal .
it 's the classic J@@ F@@ K quote .
this is on us , all of us , together , because government is not an abstract institution or a concept .
the question is , " Will we ? "
pro@@ ud@@ ly , I said : " an artist . "
just two years later , I started working at the place that made those films , Pi@@ x@@ ar Anim@@ ation Stu@@ dios .
to create our movies , we create a three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional world inside the computer .
so it might look like this at first , but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work , in rough form it might look like this , and in final form , like this .
there 's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it .
we use science and the world we know as a backbone , to ground ourselves in something rel@@ atable and recogn@@ izable .
here we have the fog beams .
but here , we can take Sydney Harb@@ or and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what 's happening .
we use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder .
he do@@ es@@ n 't have a face or even traditional dialogue , for that matter .
we turn it down , it 's still not working .
now we recognize WA@@ LL @@@ -@@ @ E as having an eye .
in the next scene , WA@@ LL @@@ -@@ @ E comes back to life .
I came in one morning and checked the previous night 's work .
soon , I was showing to the director in a dark room full of 50 people .
in director review , you hope you might get some nice words , then you get some notes and fixes , generally .
and the director was silent for an un@@ comfortably long amount of time .
engineering at the molecular level , working at the smallest of scales , can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer .
the key is a set of molecules known as si@@ R@@ NA .
for many years since its discovery , scientists have been very excited about how we can apply these gene bloc@@ kers in medicine .
but if it gets exposed to the enzy@@ mes that reside in our blood@@ stream or our tissues , it degra@@ des within seconds .
so , here 's our strategy .
first , we 'll dose the cancer cell with si@@ R@@ NA , the gene block@@ er , and silence those survival genes , and then we 'll wh@@ op it with a chem@@ o drug .
it has to be tiny enough to get through the blood@@ stream , it 's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue , and it 's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell .
first , let 's start with the nan@@ op@@ article core .
around this core , we 'll wrap a very thin , nan@@ ometers @@@ -@@ @ thin blan@@ ket of si@@ R@@ NA .
because si@@ R@@ NA is strongly negatively charged , we can protect it with a nice , protective layer of positively charged poly@@ mer .
the two op@@ pos@@ itely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction , and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the si@@ R@@ NA from degrading in the blood@@ stream .
in fact , it may be the biggest obstacle of all .
how do we deploy this super@@ weapon ?
we have now disabled those genetic super@@ powers .
the tum@@ ors were actually regres@@ sing .
and we can put different drugs into the nan@@ op@@ article core .
after the first round of chem@@ otherapy , this cancer comes back for 75 percent of patients .
but I recently met a mother who is an o@@ varian cancer survi@@ vor , M@@ im@@ i , and her daughter , Pa@@ ig@@ e .
the white line is light just from the star , what astronom@@ ers call a light curve .
now , when a planet trans@@ its a star , it blocks out a little bit of this light , and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself .
they were also saying that it looks asym@@ metric , meaning that instead of the clean , U @@@ -@@ @ shaped di@@ p that we saw with J@@ up@@ iter , it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side .
this is truly remarkable .
and so we went ahead and published our findings .
and so we decided to give it a cat@@ chy title , and we called it : " where 's The Flu@@ x ? "
a couple months later , news of this proposal got leak@@ ed to the press and now there are thousands of articles , over 10,000 articles , on this star alone .
well , they have a host star just like we have a sun , and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star , then that would solve their energy needs .
so they would go and build huge structures .
it 's really hard to provide perspective on the v@@ ast@@ ness of these things , but you can think of it this way .
but it could be something as simple as they 're just re@@ radi@@ ating it away in another direction , just not at Earth .
another idea that 's one of my personal favor@@ ites is that we had just witnessed an inter@@ planetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet .
now , I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don 't observe .
and what 's more exciting is that there 's more data to come .
I 'm so mad right now . "
so you do the du@@ ti@@ ful thing as a friend , and you ask for details , and they tell you a story about what happened to them at the gym or at work or on their date last night .
( la@@ ughter ) As you can imagine , when people hear I 'm an anger researcher , they want to talk to me about their anger and share with me their anger stories .
we 've been feeling it since the first few months of life , when we did@@ n 't get what we wanted and our cri@@ es of protests , things like , " What do you mean , you won 't pick up the r@@ attle , d@@ ad ?
it 's good that you feel it . you need to feel it .
a lot of this goes back to the work of an anger researcher named Dr. Jer@@ ry De@@ ff@@ en@@ b@@ ach@@ er , who wrote about this back in 1996 in a book chapter on how to deal with problematic anger .
( la@@ ughter ) Whether it 's minor or major , whether it 's general or specific , we can look at these examples , and we can te@@ ase out some common themes .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's true . you are , by definition , on your way somewhere , so everything that happens - traffic , other drivers , road construction - it feels like it 's blocking your goals .
there are all these written and un@@ written rules of the road , and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you , usually without consequence .
( la@@ ughter ) So you 're driving somewhere , thus te@@ ed up to be angry , and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit .
all of a sudden , you are not going to get your dream job , the one that was going to give you pil@@ es and pil@@ es of money - right ?
( la@@ ughter ) Now , that thought process , it 's called catastro@@ ph@@ izing , the one where we make the worst of things .
there is un@@ fairness in the world .
you can 't and you shou@@ ld@@ n 't swing a club every time you 're provoked .
you don 't have to fight back with aggression or hostility or violence .
you can protest ; you can write letters to the editor ; you can don@@ ate to and volunteer for causes .
you can create a community that ca@@ res for one another and does not allow those atrocities to happen .
these are people who have taken career breaks for elder care , for childcare reasons , pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
and that is , that people 's view of you is frozen in time .
I believe re@@ launchers are a ge@@ m of the workforce , and here 's why .
think about our life stage : for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
we have great work experience .
I don 't know if anyone can even remember back that far , but I had to rele@@ ar@@ n it on Excel .
I tell re@@ launchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software .
this testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring re@@ launchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hi@@ res .
they 've paid for her to get her M@@ BA at night .
and that 's what I want to talk about today , and how that relates to the emergence of social production .
what 's the effect of this ? so , the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software .
this is market share of Ap@@ ache Web server -- one of the critical applications in Web @@@ -@@ @ based communications .
but it 's not the only one .
if you leave a $ 50 check after dinner with friends , you don 't increase the probability of being invited back .
it 's creating , and it 's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .
peer @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ peer networks assa@@ ul@@ ting the recording industry ; free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft ; Skype potentially threatening traditional telec@@ oms ; Wikipedia competing with online enc@@ ycl@@ op@@ edi@@ as .
that 'll give me something I can use , and I 'm going to contract with someone .
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .
let 's call them On@@ co@@ Search .
exploration is about coming up with what 's new .
we all know that exploration is risky .
we don 't know the answers , we don 't know if we 're going to find them , and we know that the risks are high .
exploitation is about making our trains run on time .
I think it 's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are .
so instead of staying with it , we create something new .
but the same goes for that , then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated .
we really don 't give them the chance .
another trap is the success trap .
and they apply to our companies .
third : invite talent .
I think it 's a team sport .
riding into Rome on the carriage , they always had a companion whis@@ pering in their ear , " Rem@@ ember , you 're only human . "
let us take a tre@@ k to your local national forest for a quick reality check .
that 's a decent amount .
so how do we steel ourselves for voy@@ ages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation ?
build space elev@@ ators , or impossible miles of transport belts that te@@ ther your planet of choice to our home planet ?
but I 'm getting ahead of myself .
in short , our cosmic voy@@ ages will be fra@@ ught with dangers both known and unknown .
it requires fairly little to maintain , offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube .
the field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the micro@@ be is known as synthetic biology .
well , it turns out we 've already done things like this .
every day , the human body evol@@ ves by accidental mu@@ tations that equally accid@@ entally allow certain humans to per@@ severe in dis@@ mal situations .
using synthetic biology to change the genetic make@@ up of any living organisms , especially our own , is not without its moral and ethical qu@@ and@@ aries .
surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and mar@@ vel at it .
and that comes down to finding common ground , where what I want overl@@ aps with what you want .
in fact , that 's why more and more people are choosing to own guns .
and a lot of those people are children .
enough .
we 've seen President Obama 's historic executive actions .
and ultimately it da@@ wned on me : what tremendous inspiration to those of us who have this dream to end gun violence .
rare earth elements can often be found , but in many areas , it 's not economically feasible to extract them due to low concentrations .
so , we 're not really close to the vaccine , but we 're getting there .
SA : tell me about S@@ MA@@ RT , tell me what does it stand for and why is it important to you ?
tell me , I know you mentioned this a little bit , but how would things actually change if there were a malaria vaccine ?
two hundred million cases .
it 's estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion US dollars a year .
thank you so much .
( la@@ ughter ) So as you 're thinking of that , let 's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate do@@ es@@ n 't become a T@@ up@@ per@@ ware sal@@ es@@ man .
this humble mu@@ st@@ ard weed has been modified so that if you change it in one way , you get bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens .
but in today 's world , sex plus pill equals no baby .
we can do things like create new life @@@ -@@ @ forms .
and you 're doing that through un@@ natural selection .
so , principle number one : we have to take responsibility for this stuff .
principle number two : we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff .
some people will choose to alter themselves .
principle number four : we should take about a quarter of the Earth and only let Dar@@ win run the show there .
( la@@ ughter ) They sell glasses online .
( la@@ ughter ) So this started early : when I was a k@@ id , I took N@@ inten@@ do games very seriously .
so I challenged her to get some data .
now , Min@@ es@@ we@@ eper is awesome , but it 's not the driver of the effect , because if you play the game first before you learn about the task , there 's no creativity boost .
but when I came back to it , I had all sorts of new ideas .
they missed the first @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ ver advantage .
it 's much easier to improve on somebody else 's idea than it is to create something new from scratch .
well , there 's a clu@@ e , it turns out , in the Internet browser that you use .
a lot of people think they will .
so when you see those things , don 't make the same mistake I did .
thank you .
there 's a saying with which all students of history are familiar : " geography is destiny . "
our global system is evolving from the vertically integrated emp@@ ires of the 19th century , through the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century , into a global network civilization in the 21st century .
not surprisingly , Asia is in the lead .
by 2030 , more than two thirds of the world 's population will live in cities .
the spra@@ wl of Los Angeles now passes San Di@@ ego across the Mexican border to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
but Asia is where we really see the meg@@ ac@@ ities coming together .
it is the world 's largest meg@@ acity .
when I travel through meg@@ ac@@ ities from end to end -- it takes hours and days -- I experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography .
( appl@@ ause ) But the real promise of connectivity is in the post@@ colonial world .
but now a new group of leaders has come into power and is bur@@ ying the hat@@ ch@@ et .
now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies .
they , too , are evolving into a Pa@@ x Afric@@ ana .
one region we know could especially use this kind of thinking is the Middle East .
as societies , as cities , they are either water rich or water poor , energy rich or energy poor .
and the only way to correct these mis@@ matches is not through more wars and more borders , but through more connectivity of pipelines and water can@@ als .
sadly , this is not yet the map of the Middle East .
but it should be , a connected Pa@@ x Arabia , internally integrated and produc@@ tively connected to its neighbors : Europe , Asia and Africa .
China and Japan have an even longer history of rival@@ ry and have been deploying their air forces and navi@@ es to show their strength in island disputes .
you gu@@ essed it : China .
we are the cells and vessels pul@@ sing through these global connectivity networks .
we don 't just build connectivity , we embody it .
thank you .
strap yourselves in , we 're going to Mars .
but first , a few fascinating facts about where we 're going .
it was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans , and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon .
so getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ...
maybe they can .
we 're going to land on Mars in 20@@ 27 .
you 've got to ask yourself , can this guy really do this by 2025 or 20@@ 27 ?
where was this 10 years ago ?
now , you need to know this : Governments and robots no longer control this game .
can we actually live there ?
but it turns out that it 's not .
and a number of or@@ bit@@ ers that we still have flying around Mars have shown us -- and by the way , that 's a real photograph -- that lots of cr@@ aters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them .
in the second picture , which is four days later than the first picture , you can see that some of it is evapor@@ ating .
and he 's developed this machine , Mo@@ x@@ ie .
it 's a reverse fuel cell , essentially , that suc@@ ks in the Mar@@ tian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen .
but the secret to this -- and that 's just for testing -- the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get @@@ -@@ @ go to be scal@@ able by a factor of 100 .
in the meantime , most of our food will arrive from Earth , and it will be dried .
and then we need some shelter .
at first we can use infl@@ atable , pressuri@@ zed buildings as well as the landers themselves .
so we really have to go underground .
that sounds like a lot of hu@@ bris , but the truth is that the technology to do everything I 'm about to tell you already exists .
if we heat it up , it su@@ bl@@ im@@ es directly into the atmosphere and thick@@ ens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth .
when that happened , people looked at each other and said , " If we can do this , we can do anything . "
far from it .
and so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more .
see , there was a change in government , and six years later , all that new money disappeared .
we needed a sustainable movement , not one that is susceptible to the fluctu@@ ating mo@@ ods of a politician or the h@@ int of an economic downturn .
we needed to somehow turn that short @@@ -@@ @ term excitement of people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign into long @@@ -@@ @ term passion .
and here 's Dr. Ra@@ j Sha@@ h , the head of USAID , making that announcement .
here 's the Bank 's president J@@ im Kim announcing 15 billion dollars on@@ stage at Global Citiz@@ en , and Prime Minister Mo@@ di of India affirmed his commitment to put a toilet in every household and school across India by 2019 .
the world has changed , and those of us who look beyond our borders are on the right side of history .
so where are we ?
that sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to ri@@ p off schoolchildren .
" are there really two comm@@ as in ' Martin Lu@@ ther King , J@@ r . , Bou@@ lev@@ ard ' ? "
the editor never sells out the writer , never goes public about bad jo@@ kes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long .
somehow , I 've gotten a reputation for ster@@ n@@ ness .
and he 's one of my favor@@ ites , even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause .
and in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man 's impact on global warming .
what was that story ? the death of Anna Nic@@ ole Smith .
the real question : is this distorted world@@ view what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
who re@@ members Copenhagen ?
for many different reasons , but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global North and the global South .
no one believed that a global agreement could ever be possible .
in fact , neither did I.
on my first press conference , a journalist asked , " U@@ m , Ms. Fig@@ ue@@ res , do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible ? "
now , I was@@ n 't horri@@ fied at me , because I 'm kind of used to myself .
but relent@@ less optimism into the system .
well , once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding , then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement .
( appl@@ ause ) So , as I look back over the past six years , first I remember the day the Paris agreement was adopted .
thanks .

an illness in the family and later an injury to me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed .
it was all a bit dis@@ hear@@ tening .
I think you all must be aware of it , but I 'll still list it for the few who don 't .
can you imagine what this does to the self @@@ -@@ @ esteem and self @@@ -@@ @ confidence of a young girl ?
he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon men@@ stru@@ ating girls and women by their own families and their society .
where do the girls go ?
two decades ago and now -- nothing has changed .
during my research , I was collecting a lot of stories .
these were stories of experiences of girls during their periods .
and third , layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed .
so you have to find rocks of the right age , depending on what your interests are .
it 's not .
so find those three things : rocks of the right age , that are sedi@@ mentary rocks , in a desert , and get yourself on the ground , and you literally walk until you see a bone stic@@ king out of the rock .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's not that I don 't like other pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ologists .
that bone is 2.2 meters across .
and I 've always thought it a shame that these giant , plant @@@ -@@ @ eating din@@ osa@@ urs are too often portra@@ yed as passive , lum@@ bering plat@@ ters of meat on the landscape .
nothing .
epo@@ ch after epo@@ ch of sa@@ men@@ ess , non@@ events without number .
the din@@ osa@@ urs would reign for another 12 million years before their hegem@@ ony was s@@ nu@@ ffed out in a fi@@ ery ap@@ oc@@ aly@@ pse .
and then , in East Africa , an un@@ promising species of ap@@ e evolved the odd trick of senti@@ ent thought .
these bra@@ in@@ y pri@@ mates were not particularly fast or strong .
with seven billion peri@@ pat@@ e@@ tic Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens on the planet , it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventually tro@@ d on the grave of the magnificent tit@@ an buried beneath the bad@@ lands of Southern Pat@@ ag@@ onia .
and standing there , alone in the desert , it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is van@@ ish@@ ingly small .
but the Earth is very , very old .
that 's the magic of the geological record .
thus , multi@@ t@@ ud@@ inous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of f@@ ossi@@ ls , each one a small miracle , but collectively , inevitable .
but over geological time , impro@@ b@@ able , nearly impossible events do occur .
they did@@ n 't see it coming , and they did@@ n 't have a choice .
right now , our species is propag@@ ating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe , it can rightly be called the sixth extinction .
thank you .
that 's not how to think of a TED Talk .
here 's Hal@@ ey .
ideas come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic .
Sir K@@ en Robinson -- creativity is key to our kids ' future .
( video ) Sir K@@ en Robinson : my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
they 're carefully linked together .
and it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
now , different people 's world@@ views can be dramatically different .
ideas are complex things ; you need to sl@@ ash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you 're most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
so pick one idea , and make it the through @@@ -@@ @ line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
two , give your listen@@ ers a reason to care .
she would thank them , and ask them about their families and their health .
we would give credit to someone we know or that we live next to .
but ...
they don 't have a score because there are no formal public records on them -- no bank accounts , no credit hi@@ stories and no social security numbers .
and because they don 't have a score , they don 't have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their lives .
they are not trusted .
they 're tex@@ ting their friends , they 're looking up directions , they 're browsing the Internet and they 're even making financial transactions .
if J@@ eni@@ ph@@ er wants credit , her options are limited .
she could get a micro@@ loan , but she 'd have to form a group that could help vou@@ ch for her credibility .
J@@ eni@@ ph@@ er answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device .
well , it turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts .
in J@@ eni@@ ph@@ er 's case , she communicated with 89 different individuals , which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment .
by looking beyond income , we can see that people in emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing and have the capacity to repay .
our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya in just the past year .
she 's lived her whole life believing that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her .
I did not realize she was an inspiration , because she got her music degree through a mail @@@ -@@ @ order course , the US School of Music .
( cell@@ o music ) ( Music ends ) You know , when you normally hear a cell@@ o , you think of this .
but there is one thing I know how to do : I know how to program a computer .
these things are systems that are designed to un@@ fold over time , to make us feel .
and what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema .
we 've got a rain@@ bow out the window . we 've got a sword .
and this is important stuff -- really important stuff .
some are a little bit more heart@@ breaking .
fol@@ ks in the American capital will say they 're interesting .
( la@@ ughter ) Or , " Now I 'm a professor of engineering at NY@@ U , but actually I 'm an artist . "
and the idea was , what if we made red @@@ -@@ @ state and blue @@@ -@@ @ state maps based on what we want to do on a Friday night ?
those are my cigarettes .
it 's listening to the 9@@ 11 feed of the New Orleans Police Department , so that anytime there 's a shooting reported in New Orleans , ( gun@@ shot sound ) the gun fires .
there 's about five sho@@ o@@ tings a day in New Orleans , so over the four months this piece was installed , the case filled up with bullets .
when you do it right , it 's illuminating .
that 's 17,000 a day , and I have them all .
and it 's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture .
so I leave you with this : we 're more than numbers .
( appl@@ ause ) My ambition always was to be a pilot , to fly a plane , to feel free to fly the sky , to touch the sky .
all borders are closed on every side .
on some days , we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours .
my job in Gaza is to arrange everything for journalists who come to my homeland to tell the stories about what 's going on in Gaza .
these communities who don 't want their stories to be told , I never looked to them as stories or numbers .
but like me , they are human beings .
that problem started when the Gaza tunnel was being built .
so , no male journalists get the story .
he 's at home now with my two kids , and I have another one that 's growing in here .
so , why do I do what I do ?
and Gaza is the only place in the Arab world where Muslims and Christians live in strong brotherhood .
( appl@@ ause ) During the time of war , the hardest part for me is leaving the house early in the morning , leaving my children .
I hope that one day I can help other women in my country to be fix@@ ers like me .
but today , I fear it 's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harsh@@ ly because of its impact on the climate -- more harsh@@ ly than my grand@@ father 's industry , even .
and secondly , if a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today , it 's going to be way more costly to change later on .
when the financial crisis hit in 2008 , the central banks of the US and UK began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as " quantitative easing . "
depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature , this is money printing by another name .
the Bank of Japan repeated those words -- that exact same commitment -- to do " whatever it takes " to re@@ fl@@ ate their economy .
but here -- here 's the intri@@ gu@@ ing part .
as a first step , why don 't we start spending those unused , those extra SD@@ Rs that were printed in 2009 , to combat climate change ?
it 's been one of the most successful funds of its type , raising almost 10 billion dollars .
the first is it 's really easy to argue that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone .
that problem of competing claims is mitigated .
you 're having a heart attack . what are you going to do ?
you can 't rightly -- it 's not their responsibility , it is my responsibility . I have to take care of my own problems .
I 'm here to talk to you about solutions .
we get the generators from the companies .
we manufacture them in @@@ -@@ @ house , ourselves . that keeps the costs down .
this is the way our centers are set up .
and we have now decided to go into Africa .
this model can be adapted to every disease process .
we make sure that the tel@@ eme@@ dic@@ ine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world , just by a click of the button .
he do@@ es@@ n 't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise .
we recommend exercise as the most effective , simple , easy thing to do .
that way we 're not going to deal with obsol@@ escence and all those kinds of issues .
what amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human ?
now , you can run some numbers and that happens to be quite an aston@@ ishing number .
this is the biggest amount of information that exists .
it was an amazing fe@@ at .
and they apparently make sense .
for the rest , we are all absolutely identical .
this is another subject that comes in place , and this is a prediction .
but since we are on@@ stage , Chris challenged me .
and the subject is a male .
the prediction will get better , the model will get more precise .
that 's a fr@@ actional precision of 0.@@ 0000@@ 0000@@ 4 .
that object was about 19 meters across , or about as big as a convenience store .
objects of this size hit the Earth every 50 years or so .
that means that instead of seeing the sunlight that aster@@ oids reflect , NE@@ O@@ W@@ IS@@ E sees the heat that they em@@ it .
babies with this diagnosis typically die in uter@@ o or within a few minutes , hours or days of being born .
but they said that he would be a good candidate to don@@ ate for research .
but I did find myself won@@ dering , what 's happening now ?
I wrote a letter that started out , " De@@ ar Res@@ ear@@ cher . "
so I said , " No@@ thing against your study , but we did@@ n 't actually pick it .
we met Ar@@ up@@ a and her staff , and Ar@@ up@@ a said that when I told her not to feel guilty , that it was a relief , and that she had@@ n 't seen it from our perspective .
she also explained that Thomas had a secret code name .
and they also offered him an internship .
patients often have to travel long distances to get to their nearest hospital , and access to hospital care is becoming more and more an issue in rural areas , in the US , but also in spar@@ sely populated countries like Sweden .
and I believe it 's time now , we have the opportunity , to revolu@@ tion@@ ize the system altogether and forget about our current hospital system .
so my sisters and I , we help her out .
( la@@ ughter ) But it 's not only about convenience .
it 's just ridic@@ ulous .
a nurse joins him and actually administers the drug at the patient 's home .
and it goes further .
and he did the same for d@@ agg@@ ers , axes , spe@@ ars , shi@@ elds and every other form of weaponry .
it was formalized and profession@@ alized , but it was restricted to specific roles and generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals rather than being used intu@@ i@@ tively , as Florence N@@ igh@@ ting@@ ale , Black@@ be@@ ard and Y@@ ing Z@@ hen@@ g had done .
and we 're living at a remarkable moment in design , because this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together .
it can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote , rural areas .
but he failed to persuade any conventional sources to give him investment to get the project off the ground .
in a year , that number could be almost zero .
in a few generations , there 'll be no females left , no more car@@ p .
in theory , this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the br@@ ink .
OK , that 's the good news , this is the bad news .
things like mosqu@@ it@@ os and fruit flies , there 's literally no way to contain them .
so for one thing , they work only in sexually re@@ producing species .
also , even with CR@@ IS@@ PR , it 's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating tra@@ it .
what if Kenya wants to use a drive but Tanzania do@@ es@@ n 't ?
so when you hear about gene drives in the coming months , and trust me , you will be hearing about them , remember that .
and we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner .
in my lab in Prin@@ ce@@ ton , we bring people to the f@@ M@@ RI scanner and we scan their bra@@ ins while they are either telling or listening to real @@@ -@@ @ life stories .
now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listen@@ ers in the same brain area .
so here you can see five listen@@ ers .
so , we 'll look and see five metr@@ onom@@ es .
first , we took the story and played it back@@ wards .
and that preserved many of the original aud@@ itory features , but removed the meaning .
and as you can see , this incoming sound induced en@@ train@@ ment or alignment in all of the bra@@ ins in aud@@ itory cor@@ tices that process the sounds , but it did@@ n 't spread deeper into the brain .
so if we take J@@ im O '@@ Gra@@ dy and sc@@ ram@@ ble the words , we 'll get a list of words .
and we believe that these responses in higher @@@ -@@ @ order areas are induced or become similar across listen@@ ers because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker , and not by words or sound .
and we also found the stronger the simil@@ arity between the listen@@ er 's brain and the speaker 's brain , the better the communication .
in fact , we see that pattern emerging now in your bra@@ ins .
but these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground .
in Buddhism , the lo@@ tus is a symbol for trans@@ cend@@ ence and for purity of mind and spirit .
it destro@@ ys our own inner capacity for peace . "
worldwide , over two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today .
if we want to use a really sensitive , fancy instrument called a mass spec@@ tro@@ meter , then we make a molec@@ ule with a unique mass .
but I think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward , even -- and maybe especially -- cancer researchers .
I imagine that this could even happen without the need for steady electricity , or a medical professional in the room .
but we only had three days to make it , and the only fabric we had was an old du@@ vet cover that another resident left behind .
the average human lifes@@ pan is now 432 years , and my work has been to extend the human lifes@@ pan indefinitely .
but the opposite keeps happening : the longer we live , the longer we want to live , the less we want to die .
that 's where Navi@@ d and I met .
I 'd say , " I don 't know ! "
that 's one rule .
I 've always thought that what gives a life meaning is adventure .
and not only that -- it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions .
and I think that this is an extra@@ ordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing .
there is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours , but also to sustain this new emergence of on @@@ -@@ @ demand publishers , like Q@@ O@@ OP , who produced these two books .
OK , so what are the enabl@@ ers ?
we came up with this six @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box .
it 's no wonder that everybody 's getting into it , right ?
that 's why people write , not necessarily making buc@@ ks .
we 're at the long tail end here .
so that could be a problem .
and you can think of TED as a potential lens .
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis : you know , who am I , why am I this particular person , why am I not black like everybody else ?
and I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me .
everything except random@@ ness . she did not believe in random@@ ness .
and this , then , led to my big questions .
and they 're the same ones that I have today .
there is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics , as I understand it . ( la@@ ughter ) And this happens constantly in the writing .
( la@@ ughter ) And they all operate at the same time .
and you don 't know what is operating , but something is operating there .
it was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . and she said , " Save a man from dro@@ w@@ ning , you are responsible to him for life . "
and that means because we went into Iraq , we should stay there until things were solved . you know , maybe even 100 years .
OK . I think if somebody really was dro@@ w@@ ning , she 'd save them .
maybe things go wrong . and so , after that , what are our responsibilities ?
and what I need , in effect , is a focus .
and all these things that seem to be flo@@ t@@ sa@@ m and J@@ et@@ sa@@ m in life actually go through that question , and what happens is those particular things become relevant .
and it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up , and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father , who was a Baptist minister .
what is the nature of accidents ?
the man 's sons were ban@@ ished to live three kilometers away , in a co@@ w@@ shed .
the book comes and it goes . when it arrives , it is no longer my book .
but I go back to this question of , how do I create something out of nothing ?
so , there are never complete answers .
today , I am going to show you how this tablet and this virtual @@@ -@@ @ reality head@@ set that I 'm wearing are going to completely revolu@@ tion@@ ize science education .
( la@@ ughter ) And yes , this is really the reality out there in way too many universities around the world : students that are bo@@ red , dis@@ engaged and sometimes not even sure why they 're learning about a topic in the first place .
but we did@@ n 't stop there , because we had seen just how important meaning is for the students ' engagement in the class .
I will explain briefly what this is .
Michael Bo@@ de@@ ka@@ er : great ! awesome .
I have my E @@@ -@@ @ G@@ gel , my P@@ CR and -- oh , look there , I have my next @@@ -@@ @ generation sequ@@ encing machine , and there I even have my electr@@ on micro@@ scope .
I mean , who 's carrying around an electr@@ on micro@@ scope in their pocket ?
and here , I have my learning tablet .
this is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read about relevant theory .
I 'm now going to start this experiment .
and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential .
and when Jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough , he also explains that one thing almost prevented him from making this breakthrough .
if you did , could you please raise your hand ?
he got a phone call one day .
one , children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school .
we have been playing gu@@ essing games with children all over the world .
because the desire to win the game is so strong , more than 90 percent of children will pe@@ ek as soon as we leave the room .
at three years of age , 50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth .
at four years of age , more than 80 percent lie .
as it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
are you ready ?
now how about social workers and child @@@ -@@ @ protection lawyers , who work with children on a daily basis ?
what about , can parents detect their own children 's lies ?
so in the last five years , we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions .
so for example , if your date is smil@@ ing at you , this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you .
she 's a musical instrument maker , and she does a lot of wood car@@ ving for a living .
and then we founded a mission @@@ -@@ @ driven company , and we 're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a sol@@ dering iron to make these things at home .
this image reminds me of two things : our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our ner@@ ves and spinal cord .
( la@@ ughter ) Right now , we 've got really promising pilot data .
so , the next time any of you are looking at some old , broken @@@ -@@ @ down , mal@@ functioning , piece @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ cra@@ p technology , I want you to think of me .
so ...
it is one thing , actually , that you don 't need to wait for anyone to do , so do it .
none , none of us .
you will never get there .
we are finalizing the pre @@@ -@@ @ clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval for clinical trials .
currently , the majority of patients will die from pan@@ cre@@ atic cancer .
then one day I went down into the subway , and for the first time in my life , I knew real fear .
it 's not very pleasant , but it 's better than getting eaten .
I studied anthro@@ pology in college .
and if you come back to an alien@@ ating , modern society , you might remain traum@@ atized your entire life .
they were tr@@ usting each other with their lives .
for a while , that was the kind of country that American soldiers came back to -- a unified country .
and as I was working on this piece and reading about the case , I became outra@@ ged .
I of all people know the valuable contributions that whi@@ stle @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ ow@@ ers make .
when given the opportunity , would I actually speak up ?
so Mary decided to develop a blog .
well , I posted it and something really fantastic happened .
again , they 're not seeking f@@ ame , but they are seeking fairness .
with that , I want to leave you with one additional name : Peter Bu@@ x@@ tu@@ n .
we 're all connected to Peter , actually .
if you know anybody that 's in a clinical trial , the reason why we have informed consent today is because of Peter 's courageous act .
while older people changed less than younger people on the whole , they underestimated their capacity for change just as much .
but it was@@ n 't going to happen anytime soon , and my rent needed paying .
I 've thought about gender inequality and the sexual and reproductive labor of women .
maybe you 've thought about them , too .
so that 's seller , buyer and third parties .
but if you 're forced to choose between obe@@ ying the law and feeding yourself or your family , you 're going to do the work anyway , and take the risk .
in many places you may be coer@@ ced into paying a bri@@ be or even into having sex with a police officer to avoid arrest .
he was right .
how do you pay that fine without going back to the streets ?
despite growing support for what 's often described as the " end demand " approach , there 's no evidence that it works .
can you afford to take the risk ?
it creates a two @@@ -@@ @ ti@@ ered system : legal and illegal work .
and even if it 's possible in principle , getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money .
it 's not going to be an option for someone who 's desperate and needs money tonight .
so .
it 's looking like all attempts to control or prevent sex work from happening makes things more dangerous for people selling sex .
when France temporarily brought in the Swedish model two years ago , ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start carrying out vigil@@ ante attacks against people working on the street .
if prohibition is this harmful , you might ask , why it so popular ?
I don 't think this is an accident .
forced labor does occur in many industries , especially those where the workers are migrants or otherwise vulnerable , and this needs to be addressed .
the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections , allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest .
many do this with the full knowledge that they 'll be selling sex when they reach their destination .
that 's true of prostitution , but it 's also true of agricultural work , hospitality work and domestic work .
if people were allowed to migrate legally they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have to place their lives into the hands of people smu@@ ggl@@ ers .
but it makes a huge difference as to whether or not they 're safe when they do them .
why else might people support prohibition ?
in a better , more equal world , maybe there would be far fewer people selling sex to survive , but you can 't simply legisl@@ ate a better world into existence .
it 's the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some fem@@ ini@@ sts uncomfortable .
and I can understand why the sex industry provo@@ kes strong feelings .
why is@@ n 't she safer ?
it 's crucial to remember that decrimin@@ alization and legalization are not the same thing .
a sex worker can refuse to see a client at any time , for any reason , and 96 percent of street workers report that they feel the law protects their rights .
when it came to making sex work safer , they were ready to hear it straight from sex workers themselves .
here in the UK , I 'm part of sex worker @@@ -@@ @ led groups like the Sex Wor@@ ker Open University and the English Collective of Pro@@ stitu@@ tes .
we 're supported in our demands by global bodies like UNAIDS , the World Health Organization and Amnesty International .
no doubt many of you work for a living .
I 'm just one sex worker on the stage today , but I 'm bringing a message from all over the world .
thank you .
so we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government 's expanded ability to sp@@ y on everyone .
after all , these tools we@@ ren 't just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes , but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution .
I mean , it 's a person who sort of missed fitting in .
I was thinking about all the ways I 'd already scre@@ wed my life up .
I 'll tell you .
you got set up at the Gra@@ mercy Park Hotel , where you got to drink Scot@@ ch late in the night with cool , smart , sw@@ ank people .
and you got to pre@@ tend you were cool and smart and sw@@ ank , too .
audience : how fancy ?
Far@@ ra@@ r , Stra@@ us and Gi@@ rou@@ x was like my mega @@@ -@@ @ dream press .
you get it ?
has this ever happened to you ?
they said , " Som@@ e@@ times telling the story is the thing that saves your life . "
and I 'm a writer .
it 's called the mis@@ fit 's myth .
that 's your beauty .
the modules can self @@@ -@@ @ assemble into a large 3@@ x@@ 3@@ x@@ 3 cu@@ be , with each individual module placed anywhere in the cu@@ be , and at any orientation .
pause here if you want to figure it out yourself .
you 've painted a total of 54 faces red at this point , so you 'll need the same number of faces for the green and purple cu@@ bes , too .
so , I 'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions .
it really works . it describes the data .
and that is what got Kal@@ u@@ za thinking .
he , in fact -- there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a tre@@ ati@@ se on swimming -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- then do@@ ve into the ocean .
it took so long to get these ants to do this .
that is where conventional ideas stop .
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it do@@ es@@ n 't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
it do@@ es@@ n 't work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six .
but if there 's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won 't see them either . that is true .
( la@@ ughter ) But it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
in the remaining time , I 'd like to tell you two features of them .
not yet .
but is this question even amen@@ able to science ?
so J@@ ay@@ nes 's theory is that consciousness , at least in the way we perceive it today , where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development .
and just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
the algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy .
so for instance , you can see that the scientific terms break down into two sub@@ categories of the astronom@@ ic and the physics terms .
and with this , we could analyze the history of intro@@ spec@@ tion in the ancient Greek tradition , for which we have the best available written record .
actually , some believe him to be the father of modern psychology .
and in doing so , we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health , based on objective , quantitative and automated analysis of the words we write , of the words we say .
foods like ca@@ ffe@@ ine and pep@@ per@@ min@@ t contain ingredients that may have a relaxing affect on the LES , which makes it incapable of doing its job .
but we can often stop heart@@ burn before it reaches that point .
I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation .
drawing is a form of meditation for me .
when I was in Greenland , I scattered my mother 's ashes amid@@ st the melting ice .
among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive , rather than the negative .
there was some talk about women and what it was like to be a black man in America .
so it 's no wonder that some men don 't want to be bo@@ thered and ski@@ p going to the doctor altogether , especially if they feel fine .
the very first research project that I worked on as a medical student was to help design healthcare interventions that would appeal to black men .
the bar@@ bers were not only willing to do it but they were dam@@ n good at it .
you can 't smoke in the field because you don 't want to give away your position .
and I felt myself becoming less aggressive as I was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing what a valuable tool that was .
J@@ esse Pe@@ rez and Mat@@ t Johnson .

and I 'm back in bed before he even walks in through the front door .
and he puts the glass back in the sink .
and he lifts it for I can see his face , for I could see his eyes .
and I lean over , and I open my window just a crack .
if you look up high enough , you could see me .

they can fle@@ x their ph@@ an@@ tom fingers and sometimes even feel the cha@@ fe of a watch@@ band or the thro@@ b of an ing@@ ro@@ wn to@@ en@@ ail .
but one thing sets the ph@@ ant@@ oms that appear after ampu@@ tation apart from their flesh and blood predecessors : the vast majority of them are painful .
to fully understand ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs and ph@@ an@@ tom pain , we have to consider the entire path@@ way from lim@@ b to brain .
ne@@ ural pathways carry this sen@@ sory input through the spinal cord and up to the brain .
but the loss of a lim@@ b al@@ ters the way signals travel at every step of the path@@ way .
at the site of an ampu@@ tation , se@@ vered nerve end@@ ings can thick@@ en and become more sensitive , transmitting distress signals even in response to mild pressure .
there , the som@@ at@@ os@@ en@@ sory cor@@ te@@ x processes them .
this increased representation can lead to ph@@ an@@ tom pain .
but ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b sens@@ ations don 't necessarily disappear on their own .
the patient places the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b into a box behind a mirror and the intact lim@@ b in front of the mirror .
and ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs may in turn help patients conceptu@@ alize pros@@ the@@ tics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intu@@ i@@ tively .
I loved growing up in a big family .
but by the time child number seven came along , we had nearly run out of middle names .
they 're afraid their baby will die .
so our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents is to answer the question : why are babies dying ?
I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better .
and so the side effects that you 're all very familiar with -- hair loss , being sick to your stomach , having a suppressed immune system , so infection was a constant threat -- were always surrounding us .
so ...
we know who to target , what to target , where to target and how to target .
we can do that because then we 'll know .
but you will also notice something else about this map .
what if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world ?
but here 's what we should really take away from this .
this is where we need to make our voices heard .
and on at least a couple of occasions , war has very nearly killed me as well .
you had no training as a writer , formally , but you hu@@ st@@ led your way in .
that 's when I heard , maybe not for the first time , " Sti@@ f@@ le yourself , Je@@ an@@ ette , I 'm going . "
and in the middle of all of that , some strange horse 's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said , " Well , you 're the man of the house now . "
and then I was c@@ rying , and then he said , " And men of the house don 't cry . "
( la@@ ughter ) So ...
the truth was my grand@@ father took me to par@@ ades , we had lots of those .
the truth is a tear came down his eye .
the truth is he would write an occasional letter , and I did pick up those little envelop@@ es .
so you 're in good company .
he was talking about a simple thing that made a big -- E@@ H : impact on him ?
NL : an impact on him -- I was hes@@ itating over the word , " change . "
it 's hard for me to imagine , you know , changing somebody 's life , but that 's the way he put it .
( la@@ ughter ) NL : well ...
this planet is one of a billion , they tell us , in a universe of which there are billions -- billions of univers@@ es , billions of planets ...
but ...
how old do you feel ?
NL : I am the peer of whoever I 'm talking to .
eh : well , I feel 93 years old , but I hope to one day feel as young as the person I 'm sitting across from .
each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes .
I capture the fle@@ e@@ ting moments of humanity and light as time passes .
the fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs .
I 'm com@@ pressing the day and night as I saw it , creating a unique harmony between these two very disc@@ ord@@ ant worlds .
he inspired a recent series that I did on the National Par@@ ks .
this is Bi@@ er@@ stad@@ t 's Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite Valley .
so this is the photograph I created of Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite .
this is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic .
the best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night .
and if you look closely in this picture , you can actually see time changing in those large television sets .
you can see Michel@@ le waiting with the children , the president now gre@@ ets the crowd , he takes his oath , and now he 's speaking to the people .
there 's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this .
so for every picture you see , and there were about 1,800 in this picture , we both had to tape our feet into position every time I clic@@ ked the shut@@ ter .
( appl@@ ause ) I 've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work .
time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around .
they embody a new met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sical visual reality .
and this is photograph@@ ed in the middle of the Ser@@ on@@ era , this is not a reserve .
we spent three days studying it , and nothing could have prepared me for what I witnessed during our shoot day .
but let me suggest a fourth one : mathematics .
and more streets with mathemati@@ cians ' names , too .
after all , it seems to be d@@ ull and abstract , just numbers and compu@@ tations and rules to apply .
it is about reasoning and proving our core activity .
and open your eyes now to the statistics of the vel@@ o@@ cities of these particles .
it 's one of the most important curves ever .
it keeps on occurring again and again , from many theories and many experiments , as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathemati@@ cians .
or should I say , one of the most striking nights .
at that time , I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Prin@@ ce@@ ton -- for many years , the home of Albert E@@ in@@ stein and argu@@ ably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world .
and together with my former student and main collabor@@ ator Cl@@ é@@ ment Mou@@ hot , in Paris at the time , we had been working for months and months on such a proof .
in spite of more than 100 pages of complicated , mathematical arguments , and a bun@@ ch discoveries , and huge calculation , it was not working .
" take the second term to the other side , F@@ ou@@ rier transform and in@@ vert in L@@ 2 . "
you see , I thought I had taken some rest , but really my brain had continued to work on it .
in those moments , you don 't think of your career or your colleagues , it 's just a complete battle between the problem and you .
what if we zo@@ omed out and actually tried to experience our own cultural big ban@@ g ?
so you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself .
you can spend a lot of time , trust me , looking at different objects and understanding where they come from .
it 's a crazy Mat@@ rix experience .
( la@@ ughter ) Just moving on , let 's take the world @@@ -@@ @ famous Vincent Van Go@@ gh , who is very well @@@ -@@ @ represented on this platform .
let 's say that on your next vacation , you want to go see every single one of them .
that is your itinerary , you will probably travel 5@@ 3,000 kilometers , visit around , I think , 46 institutions , and just F@@ Y@@ I , you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions .
but one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly is this amazing cluster of portra@@ its that we found from museums around the world .
so we created something called the portrait mat@@ cher .
( appl@@ ause ) And I don 't know about you , but I 've shown it to my ne@@ phe@@ w and sister , and the reaction is just phenomen@@ al .
coming back to gold very quickly , I wanted to search for gold and see how the machine tag@@ ged all the gold .
some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blue@@ berries , alcohol in moderation , stress management and cann@@ abin@@ oids found in m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana .
even your sexual organs get more blood flow , so you increase sexual poten@@ cy .
it 's a 12 @@@ -@@ @ year cycle lab@@ eled with animals , starting with a R@@ at and ending with a Pi@@ g , and has no association with con@@ stell@@ ations .
so parents choose specific years to give birth to babies , because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families .
we even refer to the z@@ odi@@ ac when entering into romantic relations .
( la@@ ughter ) We believe some animals are luc@@ ki@@ er than the others , such as the Dragon .
with a traditional preference to baby boys , the boy @@@ -@@ @ girl ratio that year was 120 to 100 .
it 's got breath@@ taking nature , wa@@ ff@@ le houses and diabetes as far as the eye can see .
but the point is , we have to reck@@ on with the hat@@ ers .
but if big@@ o@@ try is@@ n 't your thing , social justice com@@ edy is useful for all sorts of issues .
not to bra@@ g , but at the end of every month , I have something like 5 @@@ -@@ @ 15 dollars in disposable income .
so we walked into these banks in the Cayman Islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and 27 cents .
most of my work is meant to be fun .
but yes , sometimes I get run off the grounds by security .
I mean , we 've tried a lot of approaches to social justice , like war and competitive ice dancing .
thank you .
what is extreme poverty ?
they were wonderful people .
they invited me into their home . we san@@ g songs together and ate a simple dinner .
and then at lun@@ ch@@ time , I watched with an increasingly sick feeling as the el@@ dest girl in the family cooked por@@ ri@@ dge as a substitute for lunch .
and I CA@@ N@@ NOT tell you how ashamed I felt when they handed one of those cups to me , and I knew I had to accept their hospitality .
so for the next 10 minutes , let 's not be sad about the state of the world .
if this picture represents the world 's poor , then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income .
and it gets better .
the product of farming is , of course , food .
so overall , this is amazing news .
in this century , the reason that people remain poor is because maybe they live in remote places .
they lack access to these things .
and then we sur@@ round all that with training .
she has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hard@@ working person on the planet .
and no matter how logis@@ tically possible it is to end poverty , we need a lot more resources .
private businesses often struggle to prof@@ itably serve the extreme poor , so philanthro@@ py still has a major role to play .
anybody can give , but we need more leadership .
if you 're interested in these ideas , check out this website .
we need more leaders .
humanity has put people on the moon .
we 've invented super@@ computers that fit into our pockets and connect us with anybody on the planet .
we are an exceptional people .
but we 've left more than one billion of our members behind .
logis@@ tically speaking , it 's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty .
we just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody .
today 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy .
they do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt that is secured on their person .
in America , even a bank@@ rupt gam@@ bl@@ er gets a second chance .
once upon a time in America , going to college did not mean graduating with debt .
30 years ago , higher education tuition was affordable , reasonable , and what debts you accumulated , you paid off by graduation date .
but so what ?
the U.S. News & amp ; World Report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines .
teachers are called " service providers , " students are called " consumers . "
soci@@ ology and Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are and soccer and science , all of these are " content . "
your debt f@@ atten@@ s the profit of the student loan industry .
the two 800 @@@ -@@ @ pound gor@@ illas of which -- Sal@@ lie Ma@@ e and Navi@@ ent -- posted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars .
and just like home mortgages , student loans can be bun@@ dled and packaged and s@@ lic@@ ed and dic@@ ed , and sold on Wall Street .
many years ago my teacher wrote , " When students are treated as consumers , they 're made prisoners of addiction and en@@ vy . "
College is the new high school , we already say that .
higher education is also marketed as a status object .
buy a degree , much like you do a L@@ exus of a Louis V@@ u@@ it@@ ton bag , to distinguish yourself from others .
so you can be the object of en@@ vy of others .
now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it .
and it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt .
and it is they , curi@@ ously and sadly , who are marketed most lou@@ dly about this college premium thing .
so what do we do ?
when you buy a higher educational product , you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose , make informed choices .
but the philosophy student , as a consequence , is subsidi@@ zing the engineering student .
who then , by the way , goes on and ear@@ ns more money .
we know about statistics , right ?
because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change , on their own , they don 't actually create change -- at least change that is fundamental .
they can disrupt the economy through strikes and boy@@ cot@@ ts .
yet this is how most of the world 's non@@ violent movements operate .
but what most people don 't know is that people have stood up to ISIS using non@@ violent action .
they told journalists they would rather hom@@ es@@ cho@@ ol their children than to have them bra@@ in@@ washed .
thank you .
we live in a medication nation .
let 's start with the fact that many drugs don 't work for those who are prescribed them .
many of us who need to take our medications are@@ n 't taking them or are taking them incorrectly .
you know , 40 percent of adults in the US over 65 are on five or more prescription medications .
so , that 's great .
what if your lab@@ s can go from the central lab to your home , to your phone , to even inside our bodies to measure drug levels or other varieties ?
and of course , we 're in the age of gen@@ om@@ ics .
and I can start to understand my pharmac@@ ogen@@ om@@ ics -- how my genes impact whether I need high dose , low dose , or maybe a different medication altogether .
I think one of the solutions is to make better use of the poly@@ pill .
but these poly@@ pills we@@ ren 't personalized , they we@@ ren 't optimized to the individual .
so instead of taking six medications , for example , I could integrate them into one .
so it would be easier to take , improve adherence and potentially , it could even integrate in supplements , like vitamin D or Co@@ Q@@ 10 .
and when we hit print , you print your combination of medications that might be needed by you on any individual day .
how long is it until , say , that nursing @@@ -@@ @ home patient that you mentioned is able to print their pills in their home ?
Daniel Kra@@ ft : well , again , this is just a prototype .
the more interrup@@ tions we get externally , it 's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves .
design can fix this problem .
and John re@@ members , " I need to send N@@ ancy that document . "
and it 's that we 're changing the question we 're answering .
do we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are ?
and it was the most amazing meeting .
he jo@@ ked in our conversation that what if , instead of a spell check , you had a compassion check , meaning , you might highlight a word that might be accid@@ entally abra@@ sive -- perceived as abra@@ sive by someone else .
so what 's the deeper , human goal ?
why should we value that as success ?
whatever that was for them , by the way .
and users , for all of us -- we can demand technology that works this way .
so she said to us , " Lo@@ ok , I 've been heading this department for the last two years .
I 've tried a number of things , and nothing seems to work .
we knew that we had to craft our own journey .
on most days , most teachers were actually inside schools .
and addressing these non @@@ -@@ @ obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
much easier said than done .
I 'll give you an example .
children shou@@ ld@@ n 't memor@@ ize things from books , they should do activities , and that 's a more effective way to learn .
how do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers ?
I like to call it " The Chain of Hope . "
they would hope that in each of these district offices , an officer would get the letter , would open it , read it and then forward it to the next level , which was the block offices .
it was a little bit ridic@@ ulous .
so what now happens in Har@@ yana is , all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of Wh@@ at@@ s@@ App groups and anytime something needs to be communicated , it 's just posted across all Wh@@ at@@ s@@ App groups .
and I said , " Why are you smil@@ ing , what 's going on ? "
it was music .
that 's me , listening to the Be@@ at@@ les ' " White Al@@ bum . "
( la@@ ughter ) These experiments grew , and in time , started to look more like this .
similar to this early stage of this medium , in V@@ R , we also have to move past the spectac@@ le and into the stor@@ yt@@ elling .
in V@@ R today , we 're more learning grammar than writing language .
done wrong , it can actually make you sick .
composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you .
so I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see .
what if instead of verb@@ ally telling you about a dream , I could let you live inside that dream ?
( music ) ( Video ) ( Children 's voices ) Child 's voice : there are more kids in Za@@ at@@ ari than adults right now .
but a funny thing happened that Sunday morning .
and we started seeing this all over In@@ st@@ agra@@ m .
music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the un@@ attainable for a very long time .
now , millions of kids just had the same form@@ ative experience in their childhood that I had in mine .
only I think this one sur@@ passes it .
you see , as a youn@@ g@@ ster , I was always curious about a few things .
now you don 't need a PhD to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity .
so that be@@ gs the question : who is the Human Gen@@ ome Project actually for ?
so how do we ensure the populations of people that need gen@@ ome sequ@@ encing the most are not the last to benefit ?
my vision is to make genetic research more native , to indi@@ gen@@ ize gen@@ ome sequ@@ encing technology .
traditionally , gen@@ om@@ es are sequ@@ enced in laboratories .
there 's this obvious physical limitation .
but what if you could sequence gen@@ om@@ es on the fly ?
Indi@@ Gen@@ om@@ ics is about science for the people by the people .
we 'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource , focused on educating indigenous communities on the potential use and misuse of genetic information .
Ma@@ hal@@ o .
I 'll never forget the sound of my mother 's voice right before I fell asleep .
and I 'll never forget the comfor@@ ting sound of water tr@@ ick@@ ling down a stream .
imagine my fear , pure fear , when , at the age of 10 , I was told I was going to lose my hearing .
as the leader of the NGO there , I spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities .
so I decided , why not try and solve it ?
well , particle physi@@ ci@@ sts are nothing if not ambitious .
absolutely everything .
well , we found that as you look back in time , the universe gets hot@@ ter and hot@@ ter , den@@ ser and den@@ ser , and simpler and simpler .
now , there 's no real reason I 'm aware of for that , but that seems to be the case .
and these guys , here , they 're the weak nuclear force , probably the least familiar .
one of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we 've discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
( la@@ ughter ) But what he meant was that what we 've done , really , is stamp collect there .
it 's the New@@ ton 's laws , if you want , of particle physics .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
but there 's a problem .
so all the exquis@@ itely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be possible without an extra bit .
and we came up with this analogy , and it seemed to work .
they 're inter@@ acting with the H@@ ig@@ gs field .
actually , I thought about making it more culturally relevant , but -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) anyway .
but in the last few minutes , I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cos@@ m@@ ology .
this is a creation story , I think , equally as wonderful .
it was big enough to be transparent to light , and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smo@@ ot described as looking at the face of God .
they then re @@@ -@@ @ collapsed into another generation of stars and planets .
and on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could f@@ use with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
so that 's the L@@ HC .
( la@@ ughter ) And I thought you might like to know who you are .
and " N " -- " neuro@@ tic individuals , " in contrast to those who are more stable .
( la@@ ughter ) D@@ id you know that ?
they all gather together .
and I 've seen you .
it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation .
sometimes it 's an internal stimul@@ ant , from your body .
so I ask you : how many times per minute -- oh , I 'm sorry , that was a rat study -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) How many times per month do intro@@ ver@@ ted men engage in the act ?
ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts prefer black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white , concrete , simple language .
( la@@ ughter ) I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cu@@ bic@@ le , trying to avoid over@@ stimulation .
( la@@ ughter ) And then I heard this gra@@ vel@@ ly voice saying , " He@@ y , is that Dr. Little ? "
Don 't follow me .
there 's a big open green space .
it won 't surprise you guys that Brasi@@ lia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city .
he now has a chain of restaurants .
it reminds me that the world 's in flux , and we have to respond to those changes .
the patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right .
why was it that the best architects , the greatest architecture -- all beautiful and vi@@ sionary and innovative -- is also so rare , and seems to serve so very few ?

but this basic idea that visual cor@@ te@@ x works like a series of compu@@ tational elements that pass information one to the next in a casc@@ ade , is essentially correct .
the behavior of this network is characterized by the strengths of all of those syn@@ ap@@ ses .
now I 'm going to represent those three things -- the input pixels and the syn@@ ap@@ ses in the ne@@ ural network , and bird , the output -- by three variables : x , w and y .
and there 's a very small number of y 's , of outputs that that network has .
that 's one equation .

when the World Val@@ ues Survey asked more than 89@@ ,000 people across 60 countries how proud they felt about their country , 8@@ 8.5 percent said " very proud " or " quite proud " -- 8@@ 8.5 percent .

and today , this bird still occupies an important , though much less hon@@ orable position - on our dinner plates .
J@@ ung@@ le@@ fo@@ w@@ ls " ability to lay eggs daily may have evolved to take advantage of these rare fea@@ sts , increasing their population when food was abundant .
that freed up hen@@ s to continue laying daily , and what had been a royal delic@@ acy or religious offering became a common meal .
around the same time as Egyptians were incub@@ ating eggs , Pho@@ en@@ ician merchants introduced chick@@ ens to Europe , where they quickly became an essential part of European livestock .

in that way , it starts rotating very fast and it increases , power@@ fully , its magnetic field .
so along with my collaborators , we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound .

suddenly , I felt very guilty for being that shop@@ per , somebody who contributes to this .
and as I thought about what to do , I kept thinking : why does the item have to be returned to the retail@@ er in the first place ?
consumers could use an app to take pictures of the item and verify the condition while returning it .
now you will ask , " W@@ ould people really go through all this trouble ? "
no : do I really want this item ? -- before making a purchase .

the sc@@ out 's job is not to attack or defend .

now , Hom@@ er mentions very few colors in his writing .
and the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color .
let me give you an example .
one library that keeps track of characters in the children 's book collection every year , found that in 2014 , only about 11 percent of the books had a character of color .
and just the year before , that number was about eight percent , even though half of American children today come from a minority background .
but I guess that 's in keeping , so now we 'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
this is a brand new song .
Hello . who 's there , please ?
in Indonesia , an amount of vir@@ gin rain@@ forest was cleared totaling the size of approximately Ireland , between 2000 and 2012 .
and they 're rich in nutrients , such as oils and proteins , minerals and car@@ bo@@ hyd@@ rates .
and we can get to a type of vertical agriculture .
if we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recycl@@ ers , then we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have to remove any more rain@@ forests to make the food and the goods that we consume .
ten thousand times over a period of a year .
I was born and raised in Homs , a city in the central western part of Syria , and I 've always lived here .
my husband and I used to run an architecture studio in the old town main square .
since the ceasefire in late 2015 , large parts of Homs have been more or less quiet .
when I look at my destroyed city , of course , I ask myself : what has led to this sen@@ sel@@ ess war ?
everybody was bl@@ aming everybody else .
but those ideas are ones that sign@@ ify fear and alien@@ ation .
but for a significant majority of the Le@@ ave voters the concern was di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment with the political establishment .
that do@@ es@@ n 't de@@ tract from the fact that it 's positive , but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them .
our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point .
there 's very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization .
I am still a global citizen .
the houses we build do not survive severe earthquakes .
it 's actually a N@@ ano@@ fiber called nan@@ oc@@ ry@@ stall@@ ine cell@@ ul@@ ose .
you won 't find it .
the reason : there is a lot of it .
for example , we have shown that by adding only a small percent of nan@@ oc@@ ell@@ ul@@ ose into cotton fi@@ bers , the same as my shirt is made of , it increases its strength dramatically .
so this can be used for making amazing things , like super @@@ -@@ @ fabrics for industrial and medical applications .
so the question is : how do cat fle@@ as do it ?
but here 's the problem : to catch cat fle@@ as is difficult .
and the result is amazing .
the reason is that in nature , there is no one there that actually takes my head and scre@@ ws it onto my neck , or takes my skin and gl@@ ues it onto my body .
so we at the Hebrew University , about 10 years ago , decided to focus on probably the most important biom@@ ater@@ ial for humans , which is coll@@ agen .
because coll@@ agen accounts for about 25 percent of our dry weight .
so I always like to say , anyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings would like to have coll@@ agen .
this is my father , Z@@ vi , in our w@@ inery in Israel .
but it 's not going to be the same .
this is amazing .
the farmers receive small plan@@ t@@ lets of tobacco .
there , the process of ex@@ tracting the coll@@ agen starts .
now , if you ever made a pes@@ to -- essentially , the same thing .
( la@@ ughter ) You c@@ rush the leaves , you get the juice that contains the coll@@ agen .
by doing that , we 've been able to make a super@@ fiber which is about 380 percent tough@@ er , and 300 percent more elastic .
and I 'm going to say that the book was written .
thank you .
on the other side , all life needs food or nour@@ ishment .
so that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole , the thing that 's hardest to achieve .
but if you have too little atmosphere and it 's too thin and too cold , you end up like Mars , too cold .
they vary . they evolve .
there are two ways , if we 're going to reduce things a little bit .
Earth has one ; Ven@@ us and Mars do not .
if you have a comp@@ ass , you know which way north is .
the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
it 's an idea that has to be tested , but the effect and how it works seems apparent .
we know the energy is getting in .
we 're trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way .
it 's designed to measure atmospheric escape .
once we have all our measurements , we can combine all these together , and we can understand how all three planets interact with their space environment , with the surroundings .
in the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
this is the only planet that we know of that 's habit@@ able , although very soon we may come to know of more .
I 'm really glad we 're here .
I have a forest in the back@@ yard of my own house .
a forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together .
this was before human intervention .
our habitat stopped being our natural habitat .
in my previous job at Toy@@ ota , I learned how to convert natural resources into products .
we separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state .
that 's industrial production .
all the natural products become a natural resource again .
we mix some local biomass available around , which can help soil become more por@@ ous .
and as their number grows , the soil starts breathing again .
how do we decide what 's native or not ?
and this means the soil below has a healthy fun@@ gal network .
yes , we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index , but what is it that I said or presented that was not factual ? "
so instead of replying , I gave back one of my largest s@@ miles as I saw , in flashing light , the following sign in my mind 's eye .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since Ali@@ a was six months old .
we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia .
last year , we issued an even more difficult challenge .
an oph@@ thal@@ m@@ ologist might see 50,000 eyes .
Per@@ cy Sp@@ enc@@ er was a phy@@ sic@@ ist working on radar during World War II , when he noticed the magne@@ tr@@ on was melting his chocolate bar .
how would that go ?
the components don 't really matter .
I can see I 'm losing you , Bob , but stay with me , because here is the really kill@@ er feature .
tra@@ g@@ ically , after 40 generations of very careful stewardship by the K@@ ong@@ ō family , K@@ ong@@ ō G@@ umi succ@@ um@@ bed to a spectacular lap@@ se in the ability to apply a principle of prudence .
he meant , of course , that they were able to create more options than the rivals .
and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome .
so , we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .
when you look at elementary @@@ -@@ @ school children , we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremend@@ ously from being able to be connected to the Internet .
and when we embarked in this initiative , from the very beginning we said it very clearly : this is not a charity .
it reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa .
we 're talking about something very similar here .
in other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
it 's a country of 45 million people . it 's an economy that 's emerging .
they have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa .
we also have to have organic material -- things that make us up , but also things that we need to consume .
well , I have to tell you that early in my career , when we looked at those three elements , I did@@ n 't believe that they were beyond Earth in any length of time and for any real quantity .
Ven@@ us is way too hot -- it 's got no water .
so when we look out into the solar system , where are the possibilities ?
so what about Mars ?
these cr@@ aters are we@@ eping during the summer .
so what are we going to do now -- now that we see the water ?
Hu@@ b@@ ble , just a couple years ago , observing Europa , saw plum@@ es of water spraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere , just exactly like En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
now , it 's still just a proposed epo@@ ch , but I think it 's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet .
it 's creating soil . it 's seque@@ stering carbon .
and what I really wanted to do was just , like , throw a lad@@ der over the side and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool mead@@ ow .
it began with ice cream .
I was trying to figure out what I could do with this exotic material -- metal ring , top and bottom .
( la@@ ughter ) This is a master@@ piece , and one of my all @@@ -@@ @ time favorite films .
so I put together a No @@@ -@@ @ F@@ ace cost@@ ume , and I wore it on the floor at Com@@ ic @@@ -@@ @ Con@@ .
it represented the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen .
we next invited reporters to have a look at the documents .
I like to refer to Johan@@ nes K@@ rist@@ j@@ ans@@ son , the Icelandic repor@@ ter we invited to join the project , as the lon@@ eli@@ est man in the world .
and he soon ran out of exc@@ uses to explain his many absen@@ ces , as he worked red @@@ -@@ @ e@@ yed , night after night , month after month .
shortly after we published , I got a three @@@ -@@ @ word text from Johan@@ nes : " Win@@ tr@@ is has arrived . "
now , we did@@ n 't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we 're working with .
the point I want to make with these two examples is that there 's nothing inherently valuable about a dollar or a stone or a coin .
the only reason these things have any value is because we 've all decided they should .
money is@@ n 't anything objective .
that 's friction .
and these companies have the right to say " no . "
these institutions are standing in the way of innovation .
and most of these services don 't work together .
a lot of these services don 't inter @@@ -@@ @ operate , and as a result , this blocks what we can do with payment .
in a digital world , money can reach much far@@ ther and is much faster , but we 're at the mercy of these g@@ ate@@ keeper institutions .
in a program@@ mable world , we remove humans and institutions from the loop .
cryp@@ to@@ currencies are the first step of this evolution .
in March , there was a transaction that moved around 100,000 bit@@ coins .
and when they do , we say that they 've solved the puzzle .
now , the Bit@@ coin network and all of this special hardware , there are estimates that the amount of energy it uses is equivalent to that of a small country .
cryp@@ to@@ currencies are the first step to a world with a global program@@ mable money .
if it cost a fraction of a cent to send an email , would we still have spam ?

so we have to start a foundation with a one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one model .
so when I decided to create an art piece in Man@@ shi@@ yat N@@ aser , the neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt , I never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that I would ever live .
so my initial idea was to create an an@@ am@@ orph@@ ic piece , a piece that you can only see from one v@@ ant@@ age point .
it was about switching perception and opening a dialogue on the connection that we have with communities that we don 't know .
they were the best people .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt .
the calligraphy , actually -- I used a white g@@ low @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ dark paint for the calligraphy so at the end of the project , we rented some black light projec@@ tors and lit up the whole neighborhood , surprising everybody around .
( la@@ ughter ) It was about the experience , about the story , about the moment .
I brought with me today a baby di@@ aper .

this is an actual bi@@ op@@ sy from a human breast cancer patient .

thank you very much .
sitting around a cam@@ p@@ fire , you can feel its heat , smell the wo@@ ody smoke , and hear it crac@@ kle .
but what exactly are you looking at ?
by contrast , fuels like wood and paper burn at a few hundred degrees - far below the threshold of what 's usually considered a plasma .
in a way , fire is like the leaves changing color in fall , the smell of fruit as it ri@@ pen@@ s , or a Fi@@ ref@@ ly 's bl@@ inking light .
at the same time , any trapped water in the logs v@@ apor@@ izes , expands , rup@@ tures the wood around it , and escap@@ es with a satisfying crac@@ kle .
substances like copper , calcium chloride , and potassium chloride can add their own characteristic hu@@ es to the mix .
Micro@@ aggres@@ sions -- everyday sl@@ ights , insul@@ ts , negative verbal and non@@ verbal communication , whether intentional or not , that impede your ability to do your work well .
and that 's where all@@ y@@ ship comes in .
and first , just knowing what they 're going through .
all of us .
so , what can you do as an ally ?
if I have a great idea , echo my idea and then attribute it to me , and we thrive together .
an executive told me recently that after doing all@@ y@@ ship on his team , the whole team started to norm@@ alize calling themselves out and each other out for interrup@@ ting .
" He@@ y , she 's got a great idea , let 's listen . "
invite underrepresented people to speak .
if you 're a person with privilege , it 's easier for you to advocate for allies .
and make real commitments to creating change here .
and it do@@ es@@ n 't take much for us to be there for each other .
it might remind you of a sort of intelligence .
they were gi@@ ants .
you see , scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vit@@ ro that one pine se@@ ed@@ ling root could transmit carbon to another pine se@@ ed@@ ling root .
but I per@@ se@@ vered , and I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest , 25 years ago .
it was in its own other world .
and I gathered my apparatus , and I had no money , so I had to do it on the cheap .
and then I got some really dangerous stuff : sy@@ ring@@ es full of radioactive carbon @@@ -@@ @ 14 carbon dioxide gas and some high pressure bottles of the stable isot@@ ope carbon @@@ -@@ @ 13 carbon dioxide gas .
Oh well .
K@@ kh@@ h !
then the moment of truth .
it turns out at that time of the year , in the summer , that bir@@ ch was sending more carbon to f@@ ir than f@@ ir was sending back to bir@@ ch , especially when the f@@ ir was sh@@ aded .
well , as forest scientists , we have to do our research in the forests , and that 's really tough , as I 've shown you .
so we set about an experiment , and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger 's se@@ ed@@ lings .
that 's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks .
you see , you can take out one or two hub trees , but there comes a ti@@ pping point , because hub trees are not unlike ri@@ vets in an air@@ plane .
( audience ) Yes .
well , I want to take a check on that 30 years later here in western Canada .
and we can 't k@@ id ourselves that these are too complicated to act on .
and we need to remember that forests are@@ n 't just a bun@@ ch of trees competing with each other , they 're super@@ cooper@@ ators .
I imagine it might .
or I can use scientific words like " excre@@ ment " and " fec@@ es . " hum@@ ph .
this approach is called Integrated Water Management , or holistic or closed @@@ -@@ @ loop .
but a lot of times , whole categories of innovation -- ones that can help us live more beautifully -- turn out to be illegal .
but innovation is@@ n 't always incremental .
the second reason is : we think the problem is solved here in the US .
here in the US we still get sick from drinking sh@@ it in our sewage water .
( la@@ ughter ) The other bum@@ mer going on here is that we 're quickly moving all the drugs we take into our waterways .
let 's design to make it beautiful " -- as advanced po@@ tty training .
each one of us is po@@ oping and pe@@ eing something that could fertil@@ ize half or maybe all of our food , depending on our diet .
imagine how much energy we could save .
remember that carbon in the po@@ op ?
I want to show you some brave souls who 've had the courage to embrace this advanced po@@ tty training approach .
that was Rec@@ ode 's -- my organization 's -- first code @@@ -@@ @ change campaign .
well , their wash water is getting re@@ used to fl@@ ush toilets , cool mechanical systems , water the landscape .
I keep showing examples where everyone 's re@@ using everything on @@@ -@@ @ site .
why ?
but why were all these projects so innovative ?
if you don 't know , find out .
who do you want to be ?
and who you choose to be means everything .
so it really depends .
and she had a theory that small , un@@ civil actions can lead to much bigger problems like aggression and violence .
with Am@@ ir E@@ rez , I compared those that experienced inci@@ vil@@ ity to those that did@@ n 't experience inci@@ vil@@ ity .
and what we found is that those that experience inci@@ vil@@ ity do actually function much worse .
and this is@@ n 't confined to the workplace .
but we were very s@@ ne@@ ak@@ y .
right after the interaction , the team gave the wrong dos@@ age of medication to their patient .
I was curious , so we surveyed people about this , too .
sooner or later , though , most un@@ civil people sabotage their success .
yes , it does .
so yes , civil@@ ity pays .
in other words , being civil is@@ n 't just about moti@@ vating others .
it 's a country with mountainous and hil@@ ly terrain , a little bit like here , so it 's very difficult to deliver services to people .
in an uncertain global environment , commodity prices have fallen .
so private creditors , multilater@@ als and bil@@ ater@@ als came together and decided to do the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and give debt relief .
the telec@@ oms revolution came , and African countries jumped on it .
and this has enabled us to go , move forward with some mobile technology where Africa is actually leading .
you know , people who can now pay for solar the same way they pay for cards for their telephone .
250 million children were immun@@ ized in the last one and a half decades .
the other thing was that conflicts decreased .
new types of conflicts have emerged , and I 'll refer to those later .
the first was that even though we grew , we did@@ n 't create enough jobs .
we did@@ n 't create jobs for our youth .
50 bil@@ lion@@ aires worth 96 billion dollars own more wealth than the bottom 75 million people on the continent .
poverty , the proportion of people in poverty -- that 's the fourth thing -- did decrease , but the absolute numbers did not because of population growth .
now , where do we go from there ?
very often , when people succeed or countries succeed , they forget what made them succeed .
and then governance and corruption : we have to fight .
but that 's had consequences .
and the answer that I had with the teams I worked with is we have to fight on .
it 's hard to microwave your emotional intelligence .
there have been a number of European studies that have shown that age @@@ -@@ @ diverse teams are more effective and successful .
( la@@ ughter ) Tru@@ th@@ fully , power is moving 10 years younger .
I looked but did@@ n 't see .
and I worry for us both if we continue down this road , me not listening , you feeling un@@ heard , you shou@@ ting to get me to listen .
this will take more .
we create our " others . "
that year , the country was coming out of civil war .
and I 'm grateful .
and it do@@ es@@ n 't mean we are perfect , and it do@@ es@@ n 't mean we don 't have contradictions .
we know that , and we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts of climate change .
because why would we continue importing oil for transportation if we can use electricity instead ?
and transportation , let me tell you , has become an exi@@ st@@ ential issue for us Costa Ric@@ ans , because the model we have is not working for us .
two hours in the morning , two hours in the evening .
it 's offensive to have to waste our time like this every single day .
so a lot is at stake .
we 're talking about electric mobility that is happening today .
and these really cool creatures are saving money , and they reduce pollution .
that 's what they tell you .
how do we get people to own this ?
we should not let anybody take that away from us .
and you know what ?
these people disagree on almost everything except on renewable energy and clean transportation and clean air .
this is our National Museum today .

those individuals who had more tests , more bel@@ ls , more whi@@ stles , more chem@@ otherapy , more surgery , more whatever -- the more that we do to someone , it decreases the quality of their life .
not because they cou@@ ld@@ n 't .
they got more of what they wanted based on their values , lived better and are living longer , for two @@@ -@@ @ thirds less money .
( la@@ ughter ) " Al@@ right !
and I listened and tried to hear -- big difference .
I said , " Al@@ right , let 's take it one day at a time , " like we do in every other chapter of our life .
meet my friend Jonathan .
and don 't take my word for it .
all the evidence that is related to pal@@ li@@ ative care these days demonstrates with absolute certainty people live better and live longer .
they needed fewer hospit@@ al@@ izations .
again , because we go@@ o@@ fy , long white @@@ -@@ @ coat physicians are trained and of the man@@ tra of dealing with this , not with this .

so many sites in Peru are threatened , but the great part is that all of this data is going to be shared with archae@@ ologists on the front lines of protecting these sites .
we 'll be collaborating closely with them .
and this data will be incorporated into the platform , and also he 'll be helping to image some of the new sites you help find .
so it helps to teach them to create beautiful handic@@ rafts which are then sold on to tourists .
if the Tunisian people can figure out how to deal with their terrorism problem without ending up in this place , they will be a model not only for their region , but for all of us .
anti @@@ -@@ @ terror measures quickly turn into state repression without strong protection for minority communities and for peaceful debate ; this needs to be supported by a robust , independent local media .
this is all adding up to a decrease in freedom across the world .
from the city of Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a in Syria , people like Ru@@ q@@ ia Hassan and Na@@ ji Jer@@ f have been assass@@ inated for their reporting out of ISIS @@@ -@@ @ controlled territory .

I built up my comfort over time and slowly took on bigger and more challenging walls .
but when I came back by myself two days later , I decided that I did@@ n 't want to go that way .
I started to panic .
I wanted to be anywhere but on that sla@@ b .
I was am@@ ped , but nobody bat@@ ted an eye .
I actually took the next year or so off from free sol@@ oing , because I knew that I shou@@ ld@@ n 't make a habit of relying on luck .
it was always in the back of my mind as the obvious crown je@@ wel of sol@@ os .
I needed everything to feel automatic .
my foot shot across to the wall on the left without hes@@ itation , and I knew that I had done it .
it was the climb that I wanted , and it felt like ma@@ stery .
thank you .
and to this day , he says that I was the coach who left the most important mark on his career .
( la@@ ughter ) The truth is , when I started working at the institute for the blind , I was surprised by a lot of things .
they had a dirt field , ru@@ sty go@@ al@@ posts and broken nets .
we started to train harder , and the results were great ; they asked for more .
the Argentine Football Association had opened their doors to us .
he came to invite us to church .
I did@@ n 't know what to say .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Juan left , laugh@@ ing in resignation , and we continued with our p@@ reg@@ ame talk .
that night when I went to sleep , I began to dream about the next day 's game , imag@@ ining what could happen , how we would play .
in the corridor leading from the loc@@ ker room to the game field , I was walking with Sil@@ vi@@ o , who was holding onto my shoulder , so I could guide him .
when that happened , I saw how his face changed , how moved he was .
we could not fail ; it was the final .
and what for ? "
it 's a large can@@ i@@ ster filled with bom@@ bl@@ ets .
he would even wake up sometimes at night wanting to scratch his lost feet .
Lebanon holds some 400,000 Palestinian refugees , and they suffer from discriminatory laws .
in countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields , they simply do it and risk it .
every one of us can actually test DNA ourselves .
but the lines that carry meaningful information are usually very short -- a few dozen to several thousand letters long .
I learned from Paul that the stakes for a tru@@ ff@@ le farmer can be really high .
results could take up to a week to come back -- that 's way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering .
and under these conditions , our bodies can do fun@@ ky things .
the Dani@@ els family , for example , set up a DNA lab in the basement of their sub@@ urban Chicago home .
for the Dani@@ els family , the personal DNA machine is like the chemistry set for the 21st century .

how many of you here made it through an@@ atom@@ y ?
I , like you , spent countless hours memor@@ izing hundreds of structures .
but before I get into showing you how artists are re@@ claiming an@@ atom@@ y today , it 's important to understand how art influenced an@@ atom@@ y in the past .
they relied on artists to help advertise their discoveries to their peers in the public .
and this drive to not only teach but also to enter@@ tain resulted in some of the str@@ ang@@ est an@@ atom@@ ical illustrations .

fear of an@@ atom@@ y and gu@@ ts is a learned reaction .

I just got a call from some strange man who told me to go to this website , and now I 'm looking at all of these photos of you naked .
the media calls it " revenge por@@ n . "
and you know what I found ?
how would you feel if your naked body was exposed for the world to see , and you waited helpl@@ essly for the content to be removed ?
so get this : people who take and share n@@ ude photos own the rights to those sel@@ fies , so they should be able to issue a DM@@ CA to have the content removed .
he 's now facing charges under their malicious communications act , and if found guilty , could face thousands of dollars in fines and up to 10 years in prison .
and to get started , I asked myself this one simple question : who do I need to become now ?
I now own my story , I speak my truth , and I 'm nar@@ rating a new chapter in my life .
but it definitely requires bra@@ very , confidence and conviction .
the technology likely to have the greatest impact on the next few decades has arrived .
this has been called the " double @@@ -@@ @ spend " problem by cryp@@ to@@ graph@@ ers for a long time .
so today , we rely entirely on big intermediaries -- mid@@ d@@ lemen like banks , government , big social media companies , credit card companies and so on -- to establish trust in our economy .
and where every kind of asset , from money to music , could be stored , moved , trans@@ acted , exchanged and managed , all without powerful intermediaries ?
they have massive computing power at their fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps -- 10 to 100 times bigger than all of Google worldwide .
and every 10 minutes , kind of like the heart@@ beat of a network , a block gets created that has all the transactions from the previous 10 minutes .
one of them is that you can build smart contracts .
well , it kind of reminds me of the financial services industry , honestly .
so Wall Street and all around the world , the financial industry is in a big upheav@@ al about this , won@@ dering , can we be replaced , or how do we embrace this technology for success ?
my view is that ...

and data is really a new asset class , maybe bigger than previous asset classes , like land under the agrarian economy , or an industrial plant , or even money .
and all of you -- we -- create this data .
and this black box moves around with you as you travel throughout the world , and it 's very , very stin@@ gy .
she calls it " my@@ cel@@ ia . "
you want to put the song in your movie , that 's different , and the IP rights are all specified .
there are all kinds of people who don 't get fair compensation , and with block@@ chains , they 're going to be able to make it rain on the block@@ chain .
they have no sem@@ antic meaning .
they have social meaning .
about seven years ago , I started documenting my experiences to try to figure out why .
this is almost poe@@ tic .
they were unexpected plea@@ sures .
they were genuine emotional connections .
they were liber@@ ating moments .
I might have turned around , and zo@@ op , you 're gone . "
we see male , female , young , old , black , brown , white , stranger , friend , and we use the information in that box .
and it means we 're not thinking about people as individuals .
so , it 's a brief experience that has emotional reson@@ ance and meaning .
see what happens .
but not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives .
what I dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them , namely that we 're all scre@@ wed because the problems are un@@ sol@@ vable and our governments are useless .
it 's not like I 'm particularly optimistic by nature .
I 'm going to show you what I mean by telling you about how three of the countries I visited -- Canada , Indonesia and Mexico -- over@@ came three supposedly impossible problems .
and that 's all true .
its per capita immigration rate is four times higher than France 's , and its percentage of foreign @@@ -@@ @ born residents is double that of Sweden .
they called it " White Canada , " and as you can see , they were not just talking about the snow .
the real explanation involves the man who became Canada 's leader in 1968 , Pierre Tru@@ de@@ au , who is also the father of the current prime minister .
try to think of one other Muslim @@@ -@@ @ majority country that can say all those same things .
see , Indonesia 's religious parties , like similar parties elsewhere , had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption .
now , of our three stories , this one probably surprised me the most , since as you all know , the country is still struggling with so many problems .
not long ago , I met with Pe@@ ña and asked how he managed it all .
of course , I pushed him for details , and the long answer that came out was essentially " compromise , compromise and more compromise . "
I realize , of course , that all countries are unique .
that 's nothing special .
again , it had no choice .
as I mentioned earlier , Indonesia 's democ@@ rats were cle@@ ver enough to steal many of the Islam@@ ists ' best campaign promises for themselves .
it takes showing restraint , too , just when that 's the last thing you want to do .
it 's something much simpler .
thank you .
with just less than five minutes remaining , where should you place the 2 vacuum no@@ zzles to suc@@ k up all the rob@@ o @@@ -@@ @ ants ?
the top right intersection has to be one of them .
to see that this works , imagine an ant anywhere else in the habitat .

( la@@ ughter ) And I remember , that was a game I used to play with myself to enter@@ tain myself whenever I was bo@@ red or frustrated .
and here 's the problem : the internet gave us access to everything ; but it also gave everything access to us .

and if your reaction is the reaction you typically have in education , or that a lot of fol@@ ks have , you might say , maybe we had a bad contractor , or maybe we needed better inspection or more frequent inspection .
now , a lot of skep@@ tics might say , well , he@@ y , this is all great , phil@@ os@@ op@@ hic@@ ally , this whole idea of ma@@ stery @@@ -@@ @ based learning and its connection to mind@@ set , students taking agency over their learning .
to actually do it , every student would be on their own track .
they can go into simul@@ ations , S@@ oc@@ ratic dialogue .
we 're exi@@ ting what you could call the industrial age and we 're going into this information revolution .
in the industrial age , society was a pyramid .
in the middle of the pyramid , you had an information processing , a bureaucracy class , and at the top of the pyramid , you had your owners of capital and your entrepreneurs and your creative class .
this holds up to 30,000 times its mass .
they 're the grand molecular dis@@ assembl@@ ers of nature -- the soil mag@@ icians .

some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
we found one sample to be able to get into culture .
we have three different strains of Ag@@ ari@@ k@@ on mushrooms that were highly active against po@@ x@@ viruses .
there 's a ve@@ tted press release that you can read -- it 's ve@@ tted by DO@@ D -- if you Google " Sta@@ mets " and " small@@ po@@ x . "
so , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
then we tried extracts , and lo and behold , we can steer insects to different directions .
I add my@@ cel@@ ium to it , and then I in@@ oc@@ ulate the cor@@ n@@ co@@ bs .
the mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the my@@ cel@@ ium has converted the cell@@ ul@@ ose into fun@@ gal sug@@ ars .
generating ethanol from cell@@ ul@@ ose using my@@ cel@@ ium as an intermediary -- and you gain all the benefits that I 've described to you already .

either they say , " Why do@@ es@@ n 't everyone live like this ? "
I played 10 years of football , was struck in the head thousands of times .
or , " Should I let my child play soccer ? "
and so the brain as a whole probably moves very little inside the sk@@ ull .
the other problem with this video is that the brain is shown as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around , and that 's not true either .
your brain is one of the sof@@ test substances in your body , and you can think of it kind of like j@@ ello .
it 's a mou@@ th@@ guard .
it has sensors in it that are essentially the same that are in your cell phone : acceler@@ ometers , gy@@ ro@@ sc@@ opes , and when someone is struck in the head , it can tell you how their head moved at a thousand samples per second .
the hit delivered by -- David Cam@@ ar@@ illo : sorry , three times is probably a little excessive there .
and the main thing I want to draw your attention to is this red spot .
it 's called the fal@@ x , and it runs from the front of your head all the way to the back of your head , and it 's quite sti@@ ff .
now , what 's there at the bottom of this f@@ is@@ sure ?
that 's a reality .
and that 's an important thing to do .
it can save your life , but it 's not sufficient , I would say .
it 's just that there 's a certain style of paren@@ ting these days that is kind of m@@ essing up kids , impeding their chances to develop into the@@ ir@@ selves .
but not just the grades , the scores , and not just the grades and scores , but the acc@@ ol@@ ades and the awards and the sports , the activities , the leadership .
you know , despite what people think , it 's hard to figure out how to make nuclear power much safer .
so you go look at the accident data -- Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Chernobyl -- the World Health Organization finds the same thing : the vast majority of harm is caused by people pan@@ ic@@ king , and they 're pan@@ ic@@ king because they 're afraid .
and what about the waste ?
well , the interesting thing about the waste is how little of it there is .
and people say it 's poisoning people or doing something -- it 's not , it 's just sitting there , it 's just being monitored .
by contrast , the waste that we don 't control from energy production -- we call it " pollution , " and it kills seven million people a year , and it 's threatening very serious levels of global warming .
and the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel , there 's always going to be some fuel left over .
what we find is the only way we know how to get rid large numbers of nuclear weapons is by using the plutonium in the warheads as fuel in our nuclear power plants .
I mean , we can c@@ rank out these machines on assembly lines , we do know how to make things cheap , but there 's just not enough people that want them . "
but I just think the most important thing , if we 're going to overcome the climate crisis , is to keep in mind that the cause of the clean energy crisis is@@ n 't from within our machines , it 's from within ourselves .
this man ran across four lanes of free@@ way traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident that could have killed me .
in other words , what are the causes of his or anybody else 's capacity for al@@ tru@@ ism ?
so it 's a sel@@ fl@@ ess act intended to benefit only the other .
sometimes they don 't react at all , which may be why they have trouble detecting these cu@@ es .
finally , psych@@ opa@@ ths ' am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ as are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent .
so the real question is , could extraordinary al@@ tru@@ ism , which is the opposite of psych@@ opa@@ thy in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people , emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psych@@ opa@@ thy ?
so these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kid@@ neys can be removed and trans@@ planted into a very ill stranger that they 've never met and may never meet .
and the answer may be that the bra@@ ins of these extraordinary al@@ tru@@ ists have certain special characteristics .
and I think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary al@@ tru@@ ists from the average person .
but admit it -- you kind of want to know .
most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary .
but what if secrecy is actually the reason for all that strife ?
when people don 't know how their pay compares to their peers ' , they 're more likely to feel under@@ paid and maybe even discriminated against .
this is a situation where , in a negotiation , one party has loads more information than the other .
in a 2011 report from the Institute for Women 's Policy Research , the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent .
if we really want to close the gender wage gap , maybe we should start by opening up the payroll .
and for those of you that don 't have that authority : it 's time to stand up for your right to .
V@@ idal embodies the story of so many of our under@@ privileged children who are struggling to survive , which is why we must make education a priority .
that means everyone in here , and those who are watching the screen .
the game of public policy today is rig@@ ged in many ways .
and I 'll tell you , any citizen who wants to be seen and heard not as a pro@@ p , not as a talking point , but as a participant , as a creator .
he was@@ n 't even registered .
I have passion in my heart .
because remember , all citizenship is local .
when politics becomes just a presidential election , we y@@ ell and we scream at our screens , and then we collapse , exhausted .
there 's one way to answer this question .
voting matters because it is a self @@@ -@@ @ fulfilling act of belief .
both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual .
not voting is for suc@@ kers .
there is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything .
they showed up , and in the course of showing up , they changed American politics .

I had a very front @@@ -@@ @ row seat to that struggle .
so one reason is obviously economic or structural .
they 're bes@@ et by these terrible economic trends , built around industries like coal and steel that make it harder for fol@@ ks to get ahead .
one , you can say , " I 'm not going to work hard , because no matter how hard I work , it 's not going to matter . "
it 's a very significant problem .
so my grand@@ parents , the very first time that they had kids , they expected that they were going to raise them in a way that was uniquely good .
they were middle class , they were able to earn a good wage in a steel mill .
so what happened ?
but she was also this incredibly percep@@ tive woman , despite not even having a middle school education .
and so that 's what I did .
they just want somebody to show it to them .
the present always contains the past .

we are sh@@ ed@@ ding 10,000 years of our farming tradition and moving forward towards eg@@ al@@ itarian relationships between the sexes -- something I regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit .
I 'm not a Pol@@ ly@@ anna ; there 's a great deal to cry about .

thank you .
( appl@@ ause ) So Es@@ ther , when you were watching Hel@@ en 's talk , was there any part of it that reson@@ ated with you through the lens of your own work that you 'd like to comment on ?
Es@@ ther Pe@@ rel : it 's interesting , because on the one hand , the need for love is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous and universal .
but the way we love -- the meaning we make out of it -- the rules that govern our relationships , I think , are changing fundamentally .
so we 've created what I call this thing of " stable ambiguity . "
that 's not what people used to say -- HF : that 's exactly right .
( la@@ ughter ) We did it in the larger culture , and we 're doing it in marriage .
you see all of these nu@@ ances .
and in terms of the parad@@ ox of choice , there 's no question about it that this is a pic@@ kle .
and so I think we 're seeing another play @@@ -@@ @ out of that now .
when we first saw these images in the 1960s , the world was changing at an incredible rate .
we now know that .
if an area do@@ es@@ n 't have people , we 've sh@@ run@@ k it away to make it disappear .

suddenly these characters that you 've fallen in love with become hus@@ ks of themselves , they 're shad@@ ows of themselves .
so that 's one reason .
so for example , Arabic : " Kat@@ aba , " he wrote , " y@@ ak@@ tu@@ b@@ u , " he writes , she writes .
so for example , " The C@@ at in the H@@ at Com@@ es Back , " a book that I 'm sure we all often return to , like " Mo@@ by D@@ ick . "
he was tub inside gor@@ ging cake , No mistake gor@@ ging che@@ wing ! "
that just feels good .
imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time .
you can do it any time , therefore you can do it more and better .
I was born in India , the world 's largest democracy , and when I was four , my family moved to Belize , the world 's smallest democracy perhaps .
and once the application was submitted , there were finger@@ prints to be taken , a test to study for , endless hours of waiting in line .
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize .
and here are two things I learned when I became Commissioner .
and most of us , when we see someone in uniform going through our neighbor@@ hoods feel curi@@ osity , if not concern .
so if you 're an undocumented parent , every day when you say good@@ b@@ ye to your child , send them off to school and go to work , you don 't know what the chances are that you 're going to see them at the end of the day .
because a raid at your workplace , a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever .
people in my family were experiencing it .
well , let 's talk first about votes .
three newly elected L@@ atin@@ as joined the Yak@@ ima City Council in 2016 .
we never know what putting a new factor into an equation will do .
as I turned the corner onto my street , my house in sight up ahead , I heard foot@@ steps behind me that seemed to have approached out of nowhere and were picking up pace .
we will continue to come together , like an army , when any member of our community is threatened .
and this is a fight you will not win . "
one of the first contributions we had was from a woman called Nik@@ ki , who described growing up , being mol@@ e@@ sted my her own father .
I 'm sure I will . "
but something struck me about the media attention that this letter was attracting .
sexual assault , along with other kinds of injustices , is reported in the media all the time .
the voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story -- not the voices of journalists or commentators on social media .
and that 's why the story was news .
it might make ourselves feel better , like we 've contributed to a group mour@@ ning or outra@@ ge , but it do@@ es@@ n 't actually change anything .
and what 's more , it can sometimes dro@@ wn out the voices of those directly affected by the injustice , whose needs must be heard .
in the courtroom , he went up to the South African R@@ ug@@ by Union 's lawyers , sho@@ ok them by the hand and conver@@ sed with them , each in their own language .
but I 've thought about this line a lot ever since .
and just like we got back on our tubes , we can 't let our platforms for inter@@ connectivity and community be the places that we settle for defeat .
but I don 't want to discourage a social media response , because I owe the development of the # No@@ t@@ Guil@@ ty campaign almost entirely to social media .
you can not build further walls by fighting injustice with more prejudice , more hatred .
because we might be angry , upset and energ@@ ized by injustice , but let 's consider our responses .
because if you look up the word " justice " in the dictionary , before punishment , before administration of law or judicial authority , you get : " the maintenance of what is right . "
so I clam@@ bered into his tr@@ is@@ ha@@ w , and he began ped@@ aling us slowly between pal@@ aces and pag@@ od@@ as .
I really lost the sense of where I was , and I realized that anything could happen to me now .
and something in me fro@@ ze .
and finally he extracted a box .
at home , it 's danger@@ ously easy to assume we 're on top of things .
out in the world , you are reminded every moment that you 're not , and you can 't get to the bottom of things , either .
but at some point , knowledge gives out .
" when are we ever going to get world peace ? "
and they learned , a little too late , perhaps , that there are certainly some things that we need to know , but there are many , many more that are better left un@@ explored .
and then three months later , again we get bad news .
and then , as predicted , E@@ hu@@ d dies .
now , why is that ? anyone knows , by the way ?
again , I will argue that the primary reason why this is the case , why we have not done that remarkably well , is really we 're fighting blin@@ dly here .
you see , those small little hot spots there .
now , if that seemed to you like a very large number , it is a very large number .
then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor piece by piece by piece .
and so we 've tested that , and boy , this works well .
so I 'm going to show you an example now .
the nice thing is that these gold particles actually made it all the way to the tumor , and then they shine out and tell us , " He@@ y , we 're here . here 's the tumor . "
and so the doctor took them away , and lo and behold , the cancer is now completely gone .
and so in my lab at Stan@@ ford , my students and I are asking , what should we be working on now ?
( la@@ ughter ) If I controlled the Internet , you could auction your broken heart on e@@ Bay .
if I owned the Internet , N@@ ap@@ ster , Mon@@ ster and Friend@@ ster@@ .com would be one big website .
now follow me , OK ?
that links with hot@@ di@@ gg@@ ity@@ do@@ g@@ .com.
I guess it 's just like life .
you send one blessed email to wh@@ om@@ ever you 're thinking of at dah @@@ -@@ @ da @@@ -@@ @ la @@@ -@@ @ d@@ at @@@ -@@ @ da @@@ -@@ @ dah @@@ -@@ @ da @@@ -@@ @ la @@@ -@@ @ dat@@ .com.
and as a gol@@ fer and as a k@@ id , one of the things that really sort of se@@ ep@@ ed into my po@@ res , that I sort of lived my whole life , is process .
and that was the my@@ th@@ ology of skill .
but I 'm going to explore skill , and ju@@ ggling , and basically visual music , I guess .
( music ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ ks . thank you . now , ju@@ ggling can be a lot of fun ; play with skill and play with space , play with rhythm .
so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm , with the obvious reference to the feet , but it 's also time -- where the feet were , where the balls were .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ ks . so , visual music : rhythm and complexity .
( la@@ ughter ) And ju@@ ggling -- the balls cross and all that .
OK ? change the rhythm , so it 's even .
so , you 've got to go after the space down there .
you may not be able to affect it , it almost dri@@ fts on you . it goes .
make it faster and smaller .
OK , so since you all don 't understand what the five @@@ -@@ @ ball pattern is , I 'm going to give you a little clu@@ e .
white .
now , let 's actually learn something .
( la@@ ughter ) OK ? so what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it .
so that 's exactly what I 'm going to ask you to do , but in a slightly different way . you 're going to combine it .
does it really have anything to do with anything in my life ?
what I 've done for you here , I developed a lot of those tric@@ ks and I put the chore@@ ography together , but they 're not original techniques .
( r@@ att@@ ling ) So , a moment .
( la@@ ughter ) HU@@ P . now , it 's dependent on rhythm , and keeping a center of balance . when it falls , going under@@ ne@@ ath .
( la@@ ughter ) You can go with the " S@@ tic@@ ks One " music .
I 'm actually leading up to something , the newest thing that I 'm working on . this is not it .
this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape .
sometimes these pieces are mathematical , in that way that I look at a shape and say , what about if I use this and this and this .
( music ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Tal@@ king about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run " S @@@ -@@ @ Cur@@ ve music ? "
they 're not ideas , they 're instinc@@ ts .
and what it involves , and I don 't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not , but I 'll do a little bit of it .
it initially started off with me stac@@ king these things , bun@@ ches of them , and then playing with the sense of space , of filling in the space . and then it started changing , and become folding on themselves .
and it 's going to change as I go through it .
I make large @@@ -@@ @ scale fig@@ ur@@ ative paintings , which means I paint people like this .
it 's something we all go through , and my hope is that my experience may be helpful to somebody .
I have six older brothers and a sister .
she took me to every available art class from when I was eight to 16 , because that 's all I wanted to do .
so I was very happy .
it had to be specific and beli@@ evable .
I made about 200 of these paintings , some of them six to eight feet , like this one .
she had this huge mu@@ g she made she loved to drink her coffee out of , and she loved Irish so@@ da bread for breakfast .
when I shared this idea with my wife Nic@@ ola , she said , " Al@@ ways @@@ -@@ @ on transformation ?
and that may be exactly what you 're thinking -- and you would be right .
these are important and they can be energ@@ izing to leaders , but they tend not to be very moti@@ vating to most people in the organization .
it 's not about developing new products , but about enabling more children to experience the joy of learning through play .
the second imperative for putting people first is to go all in .
but doing so does not have to be exhaus@@ ting .
this is@@ n 't the present .
but know that this is history .
J@@ F : well , the core principle of partner dancing is that one person leads , the other one follows .
together .
ever .
even within the white @@@ -@@ @ Stra@@ ight@@ - couple @@@ -@@ @ only paradigm -- she can 't be t@@ all@@ er , he can 't be shorter .
even avi@@ d followers of the same @@@ -@@ @ sex ball@@ room circuit can att@@ est that while same @@@ -@@ @ sex partner dancing can be dynamic and strong and exciting , it just do@@ es@@ n 't quite seem to fit .
( la@@ ughter ) See , the standard image that the leader must be larger and mas@@ cul@@ ine and the follow@@ er smaller and femin@@ ine -- this is a stum@@ bling point .
( la@@ ughter ) And here 's the action one more time , nice and slow .
now , this is only one example of how this applies , but once the blin@@ kers come off , anything can happen .
this means that for the lead , you spend half of the dance traveling back@@ wards , completely blind .
the secret lies in what made Lis@@ a see our initial demonstration as " political . "
be a mas@@ cul@@ ine follow or a femin@@ ine lead .
conscious but d@@ az@@ ed by the bl@@ asts , you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened .
every time he paints these disturbing images , he sees them less or not at all .
you zone out into the drawing , and for me , it just released the block , so I was able to do it .
it 's just amazing .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I 'll do it with you .
trust is an elusive concept , and yet we depend on it for our lives to function .
human beings are remarkable at taking trust le@@ aps .
well , it turns out that trust has only evolved in three significant chapters throughout the course of human history : local , institutional and what we 're now entering , distributed .
it 's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands has been steadily declining and continues to do so .
and the thing that really surprises me is why do leaders find it so hard to apolog@@ ize , I mean sincerely apolog@@ ize , when our trust is broken ?
trust is no longer top @@@ -@@ @ down .
I mean , cryp@@ to@@ graphic algorithms and h@@ ash functions , and people called miners , who verify transactions -- all that was created by this mysterious person or persons called Sat@@ os@@ hi Nak@@ am@@ oto .
it could be a stock trade .
it could be a creative asset , such as the rights to a song .
now , we will see cases of abuse of distributed trust .
now , the taxi associations , they legitim@@ ized the first layer of the trust stack .
every day , five million people will take a trust leap and ride with U@@ ber .
today , many of us are comfortable getting into cars driven by str@@ angers .
we share our homes with people we do not know .
so as we began to build these types of systems , we began to test them on ourselves in our research group .
in addition , our flexible electronic patches are there .
I had become a computer program@@ mer because I was one of those kids crazy about math and science .
I later realized what was happening .
another problem is this : these systems are often trained on data generated by our actions , human im@@ prints .
instead , that week , Facebook 's algorithm highlighted this , which is the AL@@ S Ice Buc@@ ket Challenge .
( appl@@ ause ) Arti@@ ficial intelligence does not give us a " Get out of ethics free " card .
and I thought that was ji@@ had : my sacred duty , which would be rewarded by God .
I was proud and grateful to be British -- I still am .
how did his death serve any purpose ?
they simply wanted to go to school -- that was their dream .
and it still carries on today .
through considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted , to the inviolable tru@@ ths , in@@ conte@@ stable tru@@ ths , I developed a more nu@@ an@@ ced understanding .
refuse do@@ g@@ matic authority ; let go of anger , hatred and violence ; learn to right wron@@ gs without even attempting to justify cruel , unjust and futile behavior .
in 2015 , we saw two fantastic , hopeful break@@ through@@ s for humanity .
if we continue doing that by exploiting natural resources and burning fossil fuels , it will be impossible to reach Goal 13 .
nobody has ever tried to really analy@@ tically combine the Sustainable Development Goals with planetary boundaries .
now , how do we do this ?
now , it actually is presented along two axes .
on the x @@@ -@@ @ axis are the Sustainable Development Goals ; the further to the right , the more of the SD@@ Gs we fulfill .
but what if we really go harder ?
we just have to really , really get on with it .
it was this to@@ y called a Ple@@ o that I had ordered , and I was really excited about it because I 've always loved robots .
and one of the things it had was a til@@ t sensor , so it knew what direction it was facing .
why did I comfort this robot ?
well , of course , we 're pri@@ med by science fiction and pop culture to really want to person@@ ify these things , but it goes a little bit deeper than that .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's just a disc that ro@@ ams around your floor to clean it , but just the fact it 's moving around on its own will cause people to name the Ro@@ om@@ ba and feel bad for the Ro@@ om@@ ba when it gets stuck under the cou@@ ch .
( la@@ ughter ) And we can design robots specifically to ev@@ oke this response , using eyes and faces or movements that people automatically , sub@@ consciously associate with states of mind .
so for example , researchers at Stan@@ ford University found out that it makes people really uncomfortable when you ask them to touch a robot 's private parts .
and I can tell you , from working with robo@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts , that we 're pretty far away from developing robots that can feel anything .
and we had them name them and play with them and interact with them for about an hour .
and then we unve@@ iled a ham@@ mer and a hat@@ ch@@ et and we told them to torture and kill the robots .
and regardless of whether we end up changing our rules , robots might be able to help us come to a new understanding of ourselves .
( la@@ ughter ) But I 'd like to show you that in some way they were actually both right .
( rhythm gets gradually faster ) ( High pitch ) ( L@@ ow@@ ering pitch ) ( S@@ low R@@ hyth@@ m ) So once a rhythm starts happening more than about 20 times per second , your brain f@@ lips .
it stops hearing it as a rhythm and starts hearing it as a pitch .
so what does this have to do with astronomy ?
but one thing about the Tra@@ pp@@ ist system is that it is tiny .
I have to expand this by 25 times for you to see the orb@@ its of the Tra@@ pp@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ 1 planets .
so let 's hear Tra@@ pp@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ 1 .
but what does our solar system sound like ?
they were actually tun@@ ed into a tuning structure proposed by Py@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as himself , over 2,000 years before .
but the system 's actually named after Ke@@ pl@@ er , discovered by the Ke@@ pl@@ er space teles@@ cope .
as long as these pre@@ dat@@ or @@@ -@@ @ free circumstances last , the birds thrive , but they are vulnerable to changes in their environment .
for instance , human settlers bring dogs , cats , and st@@ ow@@ away rod@@ ents to islands .
these animals often prey on fl@@ ight@@ less birds and can drive them to extinction .
in New Zealand , sto@@ ats introduced by European settlers have threatened many native species of fl@@ ight@@ less bird .
now , I imagine most of you out there understand what I 'm saying , but unless you have Tou@@ ret@@ te 's , you probably think you can 't relate .
ninety @@@ -@@ @ one people die every day in this country from over@@ dose .
so the stri@@ at@@ um detec@@ ts emotional and sen@@ sory motor conditions and it knows to trigger whatever behavior you have done most often in the past under those same conditions .
so , my experiments were exploring how mis@@ wiring in the stri@@ at@@ um relates to compul@@ sive behavi@@ ors .
meaning , behavi@@ ors that are coer@@ ced by uncomfortable urges you can 't consciously resist .
so I was really excited when my m@@ ice developed this compul@@ sive behavior , where they were rub@@ bing their faces and they cou@@ ld@@ n 't seem to stop , even when they were wounding themselves .
there are naturally occurring opi@@ oids in your brain that are deeply linked to social processes .
and that 's pretty much when I want you to keep the bow@@ l of H@@ allo@@ ween chocolate entirely across the room for me , because I will eat it all .
social isolation -- excuse me -- contributes to rel@@ ap@@ se .
so -- if we don 't have the ability to auth@@ en@@ tically connect , our society increasingly lacks this ability to auth@@ en@@ tically connect and experience things that are trans@@ cend@@ ent and beyond ourselves .
we used to get this trans@@ cend@@ ence from a feeling of belonging to our families and our communities .
and for too many people , to drugs like heroin and f@@ ent@@ any@@ l .
social media do@@ es@@ n 't so much encourage us to share , as it does to compare .
we heal ourselves from the compul@@ sive self @@@ -@@ @ destruction that was our response to the pain of dis@@ connection .
I work in the field of electoral assistance , so that 's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections .
well , the United Nations does not impose anything on anybody .
southern Sudan was a very different story .
and that 's what we did .
and we defined these terms , and we worked with the Arab colleagues and came to an agreement about what would be the appropriate word to use in Arabic .
and it 's gone a long way . we published 10,000 copies .
but the people of the Middle East have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education .
there 's all sorts of tools that can be used now to communicate these ideas to people for the first time in their own language .
what we 're not hearing is what are the people , the everyday people , thinking ?
our city 's v@@ ascular system is getting cl@@ og@@ ged , it 's getting sick , and we should pay attention .
she was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our v@@ ascular system .
it really is the world 's most sophisticated transportation laboratory .
tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi are talking about testing these fu@@ tur@@ istic networks of suspended magnetic po@@ ds .
no , they 're shared .
you 're comfortably sitting in a fast and smooth urban train , along with 1,200 passengers .
what if in this train you did@@ n 't have to stop ?
they 're trying to learn traffic rules , which is relatively simple , and coping with human un@@ predictability , which is more challenging .
but what would happen when whole cities become dri@@ ver@@ less ?
they never stop at red lights .
it will be liquid like our blood .
and by a strange parad@@ ox , the more robo@@ tized our traffic grid will be , the more organic and alive its movement will feel .
so yes , biology has all the attributes of a transportation gen@@ ius today .
and he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things , kill them , because they 're making a m@@ ess .
so I did .
but the story of the ven@@ ding machine is a little more interesting if you know more about cro@@ ws .
there 's all kinds of an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes for the different kinds of intelligence they have .
for example , in Sweden , cro@@ ws will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice .
it 's pretty anno@@ ying for the fishermen .
( la@@ ughter ) So we know these cro@@ ws are really smart , but the more I du@@ g into this , the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation .
parents seem to be teaching their young .
it 's pretty simple .
when they get really happy about this , we sty@@ mi@@ e them .
that cro@@ w enjoys a temporary monopoly on pe@@ anu@@ ts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
everything , apart from the dialogue , is fake .
( water spl@@ ashes ) And pit@@ ched it down another oc@@ ta@@ ve .
but once you 've created your sounds and you 've syn@@ ced them to the image , you want those sounds to live in the world of the story .
well , it depends how it 's used in each film .
but even if you were to enter a room with zero rever@@ ber@@ ation and zero external sounds , you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood .
Richard W@@ ag@@ ner fam@@ ously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience .
this has been seen in cinema over and over , with H@@ itch@@ coc@@ k , and Rid@@ ley Scot@@ t in " Ali@@ en . "
because a confident fat woman is almost un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
people were skep@@ tical .
these incredible images of our cast were seen worldwide .
I have received violent death threats and abuse for d@@ aring to make work that centers fat people 's bodies and lives and treats us as worthwhile human beings with valuable stories to tell .
that means that criminals , h@@ ackers and yes , even governments are all locked out .
Apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors .
iOS is made by Apple . Android is made by Google .
Apple encry@@ pts all data stored on i@@ Ph@@ ones by default , and text messages sent from one Apple customer to another Apple customer are encrypted by default without the user having to take any actions .
Android phones , or at least most of the Android phones that have been sold to consumers , do not encry@@ pt data stored on the device by default , and the built @@@ -@@ @ in text messaging app in Android does not use encryption .
it 's a civil rights problem .
now , it 's quite possible that a future Martin Lu@@ ther King or a Mandela or a G@@ and@@ hi will have an iPhone and be protected from government surveillance .
( appl@@ ause ) Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : Chris , thank you so much .
this is used by criminals . this is used by stal@@ kers .
even if you think you have nothing to hide , at the very least , if you have children , teenagers in your lives , make sure you put a stic@@ ker on their camera and protect them .
I know this because I am one of them .
four in the morning on a school day , we 'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van , and the bottles would break .
I propose three strategies .
their stories of overcoming insur@@ moun@@ table odds are so powerful .
teaching young people to learn from their mistakes instead of criminalizing them , and dra@@ gging them out of their classrooms like animals .
William was one of them .
but I remember what Ms. Rus@@ s used to say .
we refined his story to go from being the story of a victim to being the story of a survi@@ vor that has overcome ad@@ versity .
William went on to finish high school , get his security guard certificate to become a security guard , and is now working at a local school district .
any student I 've had the honor of teaching in my classroom is my k@@ id .
wealth was never the primary ambition in our house .
because of this lack of wealth , we lived in a neighborhood that lacked wealth , and henceforth a school system that lacked wealth .
how come I 'm learning to play the viol@@ in while my neighborhood friends don 't even have a music class ?
all of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wrec@@ k that I was saved from through a bus ride .
I now teach in the very same school system from which I sought refuge .
enter Brown v. the Board of Education of Top@@ e@@ ka , Kansas in 1954 ; legal separation of the races is now illegal .
I 'd am@@ assed a modest classroom library of books I 'd accumulated from second@@ hand shops , thri@@ ft stores , at@@ tics -- you know .
on a me@@ zz@@ o level : historically speaking , the education of the black and brown child has always depended on the philanthro@@ py of others .
if your son or daughter or ni@@ ece or ne@@ phe@@ w or neighbor or little Tim@@ my down the street goes to an aff@@ luent school , challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom .
and on a micro level : if you 're a human being , don@@ ate .
just a couple of months into the project , my French b@@ oss , he told me , " You know , M@@ all@@ ory , it 's a good idea , but the data you need for your algorithms is not there .
( la@@ ughter ) Project over .
my experiences back in Rome prove using data you can save lives .
they opened up their data in Senegal and the I@@ v@@ ory Coast and researchers discovered that if you look at the patterns in the p@@ ings to the cell phone towers , you can see where people are traveling .
that 's all going to change in the next few weeks , thanks to private sector collaboration .
hi , Nor@@ man .
and then I want to talk about what we think right here in the United States and in New York .
number two , it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive .
the Chinese are going to dominate it . the Russians are picking up the cr@@ um@@ bs .
now look , there are problems in Asia .
we see that Kim J@@ ong U@@ n , just in the last couple of days , tested yet another nuclear weapon .
Europe does look a little sca@@ red in this environment .
you see Brexit and you see the concerns of popul@@ ism across all of the European states .
but the periphery , countries like Greece and Turkey and others , will not look that good at all .
they had been more opposed to the United States for decades .
increasingly , they 're coming back .
those countries can fall off the map .
so you 're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the los@@ ers across Africa .
a lot of people in that context say , " Let 's go dollar . let 's go New York real estate .
let 's send our kids to American universities . "
you know how much Turkey would love to have neighbors like that ?
here 's the challenge .
the election process this year is not proving a good option for leading by example .
what would we have to do to fix this after November , after the next president comes in ?
half of the human workforce is expected to be replaced by software and robots in the next 20 years .
first : do the unnecessary .
but there is something else that was remarkable about it .
you might not always realize it , but when you cut the unnecessary , you cut everything .
leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary .
so do not kill your orange ballo@@ ons .
there are hundreds of these every day in our organizations that have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one .
so it invited all 36 team members and their partners to one of the Kha@@ ju@@ ra@@ ho Tem@@ ples , known for their famous ero@@ tic sculp@@ tures .
no masks ...
but we 've all been ug@@ ly once .
thank you .
my claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change your perspective .
and by " pattern , " I mean a connection , a structure , some regul@@ arity , some rules that govern what we see .
it 's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens .
but actually , they 're just do@@ ts , right ?
and I can actually recommend this book , it 's a very nice book .
is it a part of a circle ?
it 's actually not a part of a circle .
let 's make more lines .
and I think this is a nice day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day definition .
but today I want to go a little bit deeper , and think about what the nature of this is .
it 's an analogy between two things .
and this number expresses a relation between two numbers .
it has to be like this . this is a beautiful pattern .
four and three and five .
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200 is a television or a computer screen .
you can see this .
that means that when it goes around four times , the other one goes around three times .
let 's trace it and see what happens .
we can multiply it by three @@@ -@@ @ hal@@ ves .
let 's multiply this sound by four @@@ -@@ @ thirds . ( be@@ ep ) What happens ?
again , this is as a rhythm .
four @@@ -@@ @ thirds is a really great number . I love four @@@ -@@ @ thirds !
that 's my aim here .
so you know that this is an R.
every time I do this , something else appears , so I 'm actually learning more about the object when I change my perspective .
well , if you take two of these , join them together and spin it around , there 's your oc@@ ta@@ he@@ dr@@ on again , a beautiful structure .
I 'm telling one story in different ways .
I truly believe this .
we can view the ocean from another perspective .
every time we do this , we learn a little bit more about the ocean .
if you 're able to view a structure from the inside , then you really learn something about it .
that requires imagination .
and this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar to you , because we do it every day .
she frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her after a couple of terms in office and asked , " Can boys really grow up to be president ? "
a few days later , relations to his wife and her family 's companies were also discovered in the Panama Papers , and so he withdrew from the race again .
the polls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had earned .
and I am not saying media is doing this consciously .
we ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that .
( appl@@ ause ) And we need more of that .
and the first one is called " Gag@@ n . "
there was a lot to be taken out of the journey , no matter if the destination was reached or not .
( che@@ ers ) I am incredibly glad that I had the courage to run , to risk failure but receive success on so many levels .
but of course we probably can 't vote there , but one thing we can get from Iceland and have always gotten is inspiration .
it 's December 27 , 2014 : the morning of my brother 's wedding day .
even in that moment , when everything was so distr@@ acting , he was att@@ un@@ ed to me .
he cups my face and says , " Su@@ z@@ anne , I am who I am because of you .
at just 21 , she 'd recently been accepted to join De@@ ah at UN@@ C dental school .
that is who they were .
for months , this man had been har@@ assing them : knoc@@ king on their door , bran@@ dish@@ ing his gun on a couple of occasions .
as she was moving in , he told Y@@ us@@ or and her mom that he did@@ n 't like the way they looked .
the police issued a premature public statement that morning , echo@@ ing his claims without bo@@ ther@@ ing to question it or further investigate .
humili@@ ated .
maybe we we@@ ren 't equipped with the tools to respond in the moment .
but stepping right into that discomfort means you are also stepping into the ally zone .
Martin Lu@@ ther King once said , " In the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends . "
these are all very different examples of people who drew upon their platforms and resources in academia , tech and media , to actively express their all@@ y@@ ship .
many neighbors appeared in this story .
let them know you stand with them in solidarity .
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Music ) ( be@@ eping ) ( Music ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) So a few of my friends were also pretty addic@@ ted to the game , and I invited them to play as well .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Video ) Fri@@ end : what the hec@@ k ?
women make up only 19 percent of the technology workforce .
now , there 's a wide variety of problems that contribute to the lack of diversity in the technology force .
and having a low floor also means that we 're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project .
that 's the beauty of using everyday materials ; it 's very easy to customize using paper and fabric .
in 1971 , he was medic@@ ally retired because he had so much sh@@ rap@@ nel in his body that he was setting off metal detectors .
he self @@@ -@@ @ medic@@ ated with alcohol .
others we hospit@@ alized and gave generic group therapy , and others still we simply said to them , " Just go home and try to forget about your experiences . "
more recently , we 've tried therapy dogs , wilderness ret@@ reats -- many things which may temporarily relieve stress , but which don 't actually eliminate PT@@ SD symptoms over the long term .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's the most common term I 've heard to describe that experience .
so when you try to over@@ lay that mind frame onto a peace@@ time environment , you get problems .
which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life ; there are .
it 's just that the probability of en@@ countering them compared to combat is astronom@@ ically lower .
we train veterans to be fi@@ erc@@ ely rational , to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability of en@@ countering , say , an I@@ ED here in peace@@ time America .
with enough practice , those rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ations stick .
and he wanted to leave , but he did@@ n 't .
people don 't just disagree in the way that we 're familiar with , on the left @@@ -@@ @ right political divide .
ca : and so , those of us who grew up with The Be@@ at@@ les and that sort of hi@@ p@@ pi@@ e philosophy of dre@@ aming of a more connected world -- it felt so ide@@ alistic and " how could anyone think badly about that ? "
the American economy has grown enorm@@ ously from it .
but I think this is the thing , especially in Europe and for us , too , we need to be looking at .
it 's about culture .
we 're really , really good at justifying ourselves .
ca : so this has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people .
another , in America , is the purification of the two parties .
so personal relationships , I think , are probably the most powerful means we have .
and then gradually that chips away or changes your category as well .
and we apply it to the poor , the needy , the suffering .
J@@ H : no . that 's right .
em@@ pa@@ thy is a very , very hot topic in psychology , and it 's a very popular word on the left in particular .
so it 's important to em@@ path@@ ize with the groups that we on the left think are so important .
but I think this year , I 'm hoping it will make people see that we have an exi@@ st@@ ential threat on our hands .
they have all kinds of great advice for how to drop the fear , re@@ frame things , stop seeing other people as your enemy .
ca : here 's my last question : personally , what can people do to help heal ?
if you start with some appreciation , it 's like magic .
J@@ H : thanks , Chris .
and it uses no fuel .
our team has been hard at work over the past few years , conducting missions in some of the tough@@ est ocean conditions on the planet , from the Arctic to the tropical Pacific .
it might be one of the driving forces that 's pushing the pol@@ lock north , and to spread in search of col@@ der regions .
they 've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade , like legal systems , corporations , market@@ places .
but there is a new , technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value , and it 's called the block@@ chain .
we had some informal constraints in place , but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions .
these institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew , and our personal control was much lower .
block@@ chain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ peer network .
this creates an im@@ mu@@ table , unfor@@ geable record of all of the transactions across this network .
the first thing I 'm going to do is look up who I 'm buying from .
are they a power user ?
this is a whole new world in terms of our visibility .
the last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open @@@ -@@ @ ended , and it 's rene@@ ging .
I think this is one of the most exciting ways that block@@ chains lower our uncertainties , because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement .
but in 2009 , Bel@@ le learned that she had brain cancer and four months to live .
it 's called Ba@@ ye@@ sian in@@ ference .
it would rule out the rival theories , but not rule out yours .
and this applies outside the lab to important , real @@@ -@@ @ world problems .
read and listen to people you flag@@ ran@@ tly disagree with .
as Ari@@ sto@@ tle said , " The mark of an educated man is the ability to enter@@ tain a thought without necessarily accepting it . "
some banks suffered from group@@ think , where staff were too afraid to challenge management 's lending decisions , contributing to the financial crisis .
in a meeting , appoint someone to be devil 's advocate against your pet idea .
because data allows you to learn , but learning is only relative to a starting point .
so then , why are experts so mi@@ stru@@ sted ?
because evidence forces you to prove it .
a second reason why experts are not trusted is that different experts say different things .
and academic journals involve peer review , where a paper is rigorously scrutin@@ ized ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) by the world 's leading minds .
but it 's better to go with something checked than something un@@ checked .
very rarely is it possible to prove or predict something with certainty , yet it 's so temp@@ ting to make a sweeping , unqualified statement .
otherwise , we only share the consensus ; we don 't challenge anyone 's thinking .
there have been many attempts - none yet proven - and they treat time in different ways .
my favorite part of my job at UNICEF is a chance to talk to , meet with and hear from young people all around the world .
and they tell me about their hopes and dreams .
but what they 're also telling me is that they have fears .
a crisis of demo@@ graphics , a crisis of education , a crisis of employment , a crisis of violence and a crisis for girls .
if you look at these crises , you realize that they 're urgent and they need to be addressed now .
because they tell us that they 're worried .
and those that are in school feel that they may not be getting the right skills .
no country can be successful if nearly half of its population of young people are unable to read or write .
and young people are also telling me that they 're worried about employment , that they won 't be able to find a job .
they want to go to the cities .
these are all the professions that a country needs , as well as the professions that have not been invented yet .
six hundred and fifty million .
so , no wonder girls are worried about their futures .
but there are tens of millions of young people who are not so lucky .
and they are s@@ ounding the alarm for their futures .
but we think it 's also achievable .
ideas that will give young people a fighting chance for their futures .
so with a ment@@ or and a bit of seed funding , they 've now developed a new app to help the whole community .
to reach more young people in more communities , in more places around the world .
in our everyday lives and in our workplaces , are there ways that we could support young people ?
but they are 100 percent of our future .
the time is now , the need is urgent .
and under the intense conditions of a co@@ aster , gravity 's effects are multiplied .
engineers have to account for the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing a co@@ aster 's supports .
still , these ri@@ des are@@ n 't for everyone .
the floods of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine , light @@@ -@@ @ he@@ ade@@ dness , and motion sickness are@@ n 't going anywhere soon .
I had to hu@@ g the walls just to make it to the bathroom .
I saw every kind of specialist : infectious disease doctors , der@@ mat@@ ologists , endoc@@ rin@@ ologists , cardi@@ ologists .
I would spend most of the next two years in bed .
and then I went online and found thousands of people all over the world living with the same symptoms , similarly isolated , similarly dis@@ believed .
some could still work , but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed , just so they could show up the next Monday .
you 've probably heard it called " chronic fatigue syndrome . "
it do@@ es@@ n 't matter what you once were ; you can 't do it anymore .
it converted these emotions into physical symptoms .
since then , there have been more than 70 outbreaks documented around the world , of a stri@@ k@@ ingly similar post @@@ -@@ @ infectious disease .
in the 1950s , a psychi@@ atr@@ ist named Eli@@ ot S@@ later studied a co@@ hor@@ t of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hy@@ ster@@ ia .
the problem with the theory of hy@@ ster@@ ia or psych@@ ogenic illness is that it can never be proven .
all around the world , ME is one of the least funded diseases .
in the US , we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient , 250 dollars per MS patient and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient .
multiple s@@ cl@@ ero@@ sis could be mis@@ diagnosed as hy@@ ster@@ ical paralysis until the CAT scan and the M@@ RI discovered brain le@@ sions .
and recently , we used to think that stomach ul@@ cers were just caused by stress , until we discovered that H. p@@ yl@@ ori was the cul@@ pri@@ t .
we became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be .
and slowly I added five percent here , five percent there , until eventually , on a good day , I was able to leave my home .
I came together with patients around the world , and we started to fight .
I thought that I would die there .
I don 't know what would have happened had I not been one of the lucky ones , had I gotten sick before the internet , had I not found my community .
how many lives could we save today if we decide to make a real start ?
look at me -- I am huge !
which is a lot , until you realize that 95 percent of them are the same ones you had the day before .
I think things like , " Oh ! I know -- I must clean the floor .
that leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day to actually think something new .
this is odd .
the truth is I have never been any good at sport , OK ?
I 've reached that wonderful age when all my friends say , " Oh , I wish I was as fit as I was when I was 18 . "
I think what the world needs now is the Olympics for people with zero athle@@ tic ability .
I have a full @@@ -@@ @ on career , I 've got three kids , I 've got an elderly mom .
and anyway , I already had a go at changing the world .
I 've always known , I don 't think my family were the least bit surprised .
by the time they were born , I was already hosting my own shows and working in the public eye .
I don 't think secrets are a good thing .
everybody warned me that I would never work again , but I decided it was absolutely worth the risk .
and I promise you there were many moments in the still of the night when I was terri@@ fied by what I had done .
and in 2014 , on the day that the law was changed , I married my wife , who I love very much , indeed .
the hall seats two @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half thousand people .
we invited 150 family and friends , then I let it be known to the public : anybody who wanted to come and celebrate , please come and join us .
love trium@@ phs .
law changed . "
too often , I think history 's what I call the Mount Rus@@ h@@ more model .
until you realize that 17 are run by men called " John . "
( la@@ ughter ) OK . why does it matter ?
well , it 's that pes@@ ky business of the gender pay gap .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's a terrible figure .
do you know what they revised it to ?
television 's been around for 80 years !
the representation of women in positions of power is sh@@ ock@@ ingly low .
nothing .
so science , technology , engineering and mathematics .
pretty much important in every single aspect of our daily lives .
and stra@@ igh@@ ta@@ way people said to me , " Why did you call it that ? "
I can 't tell you how many times I 've heard somebody say , " I 'm not a femin@@ ist , but ... "
and then I started getting asked the hil@@ arious question , " Are you all going to burn your br@@ as ? "
people wrote and said , " Please , can I help ?
first thing : we want to be the only political party in the world whose main aim was to no longer need to exist .
we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political lean@@ ing .
those of you who are able , please stand up .
I 've done it with professors . I 've done it with students .
well , the simple answer is that this is a tr@@ ick@@ le @@@ -@@ @ down approach to social justice , and many times it just do@@ es@@ n 't work .
Em@@ ma , like so many African @@@ -@@ @ American women , sought better employment for her family and for others .
but she applied for a job , and she was not hired , and she believed that she was not hired because she was a black woman .
only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination that Em@@ ma De@@ Gra@@ ff@@ en@@ re@@ id was facing .
it felt to me like injustice squ@@ ared .
the frame that the court was using to see gender discrimination or to see race discrimination was partial , and it was distorting .
and then the traffic in those roads would be the hiring policies and the other practices that ran through those roads .
I take it quite seriously , but I 'm here to talk about something that 's become very important to me in the last year or two .
and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives , but whether , if we could see the Earth a century from now , we 'd recognize it .
the evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
incredible , is@@ n 't it ?
but there 's no way to treat animals well , when you 're killing 10 billion of them a year .
eating ethnic was un@@ heard of unless you were ethnic .
f@@ ats , car@@ bs , proteins -- they we@@ ren 't bad or good , they were food .
gol@@ d@@ fish sw@@ am .
the effects of this are well known . they are everywhere .
for des@@ sert , store @@@ -@@ @ bought ice cream or cookies .
this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself .
we we@@ ren 't all hi@@ pp@@ ies , either .
similarly , let 's look at a gran@@ ola bar .
that 's good .
and if that sal@@ mon 's from Chile , and it 's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles , whatever , dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere ?
I don 't know .
even though we 've come to this from different points , we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food .
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue , the over@@ production and over@@ consumption of meat and jun@@ k food .
and this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so .
An@@ n Co@@ op@@ er 's right .
after their deaths , a bone from each of their sk@@ elet@@ ons was craf@@ ted by human hands into a fl@@ ute .
but in fact , the origins of the modern computer are much more play@@ ful , even musical , than you might imagine .
fl@@ utes and music led to even more powerful break@@ through@@ s .
the organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions en@@ coded by placing p@@ ins on a rotating cylinder .
and as de V@@ auc@@ ans@@ on was designing his robot musi@@ cian , he had another idea .
and pun@@ ch cards were used by computer programmers as late as the 1970s .
our son is fine now , and our doctor has reas@@ sured us we can always contact her .
but in that moment , I should 've spoken up , but I did@@ n 't .
can I correct my b@@ oss when they make a mistake ?
that 's what happened with my wife and I.
and this range of acceptable behavi@@ ors -- when we stay within our range , we 're rewarded .
when we step outside that range , we get punished in a variety of ways .
now , the first thing we need to know is : what is my range ?
but the key thing is , our range is@@ n 't fixed ; it 's actually pretty dynamic .
power comes in lots of forms .
and perspective @@@ -@@ @ taking is really simple : it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person .
but here 's the problem : perspective @@@ -@@ @ taking is hard to do .
and you can see over here , that 's the correct E.
that 's the perspective @@@ -@@ @ taking E because it looks like an E from someone else 's v@@ ant@@ age point .
this shirt or that shirt ? OK , that shirt .

two , I 've actually done research on the strategic benefits of asking for advice .
I took their perspective , I became more invested in their cause , I became more committed to them because they asked for advice .
expertise gives us credibility .
but L@@ iz@@ z@@ ie Wol@@ f has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion , the condemnation of our c@@ rying dis@@ appears for both men and women .
I want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother 's wedding .
my d@@ ad was a psych@@ ologist like me , but his real love and his real passion was cinema , like my brother .
those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow , change and expand the self .
and we can evolve bacteria and we can evolve plants and we can evolve animals , and we 're now reaching a point where we really have to ask , is it really ethical and do we want to evolve human beings ?
you can hold soft @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ iled eggs .
so when you 're talking about a heart pac@@ em@@ aker as a pros@@ thetic , you 're talking about something that is@@ n 't just , " I 'm missing my leg , " it 's , " if I don 't have this , I can die . "
and one of the other sides of E@@ d is he 's been thinking about how to connect the brain using light or other mechanisms directly to things like these pros@@ the@@ tics .
you can record , and oh , by the way , they also put a phone into this .
as you 're thinking of the consequence of that , if you believe that extin@@ ctions are common and natural and normal and occur periodically , it becomes a moral imperative to diversify our species .
we don 't know , if you change the gravity substantially , if the same thing will happen to create your body .
forget about the mo@@ ons of Nep@@ tune or J@@ up@@ iter .
maybe you breathe by having oxygen flow through your blood instead of through your lun@@ gs .
but you 're talking about really radical re@@ designs , and one of the interesting things that 's happened in the last decade is we 've discovered a whole lot of planets out there .
and some of them may be Earth @@@ -@@ @ like .
so all life on this planet is made in AT@@ C@@ Gs , the four letters of DNA .
but why is that so interesting ?
one of the things they used to do is they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor so the done@@ e could tell the doctors , " Do you recognize this person ? do you love this person ?
do you feel anything for this person ? "
we thought this was emo@@ tion and we thought maybe emotions were trans@@ planted with the heart . N@@ ope .
second option : the new mouse recognizes Min@@ ni@@ e M@@ ouse .
and the reason you want to alter the human body is because you eventually want a picture that says , that 's us , and that 's us , and that 's us , because that 's the way humanity survi@@ ves long @@@ -@@ @ term extinction .
it 's easy to forget that last night , one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity .
two and a half billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels or clean heating fuels .
and it 's easy for us not to be em@@ pa@@ thetic with those people who seem so di@@ stan@@ ced from us .
this is the United States Energy Information Agency 's assessment of what will happen if the countries implement the climate commitments that they 've made in Paris between now and 20@@ 40 .
that 's on top of the 550 gig@@ at@@ ons that are in place today .
it 's a function of their climate .
many , many , many things go into the choices of countries , and they each make a different choice .
China has made the choice , and will make the choice , to run on coal .
it can run on natural gas as a result of the inventions of frac@@ king and sh@@ ale gas , which we have here .
in 1980 , 80 percent of China 's population lived below the extreme poverty level , below the level of having $ 1.@@ 90 per person per day .
they have a remarkable path to follow .
what can we do that changes this forecast that 's in front of us ?
because it 's a forecast that we can change if we have the will to do it .
this week , between one and three one @@@ -@@ @ gig@@ aw@@ att coal plants are being turned on around the world .
two , it had to be a technology that was scal@@ able , that it could deliver the same benefits on the same timetable as fossil fuels , so that they can enjoy the kind of life , again , that we take for granted .
and third , it had to be cost @@@ -@@ @ effective without subsidy or without mandate .
that 's what the EIA forecast tells us .
to give them a better choice , it 's going to have to meet the Ch@@ indi@@ a test .
what we need is a choice .
if they can 't make it safe , if they can 't make it cheap , it should not be deployed .
thank you very much .
we love to engage on the issues of the day .

this works for the satellite because it 's small , but satellites that are higher or in larger orb@@ its or are larger altogether , like the size of school buses , will require other disposal options .
and then one really cool possibility is the idea of orbital to@@ w trucks or space mechanics .
but also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth , and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact .
Earth orbit is breath@@ tak@@ ingly beautiful and our gateway to exploration .
why are people afraid of the ocean ?
I 'm going to make it right now in case I forget .
everything I 'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school .
we used to ridic@@ ule continental drift . it was something we laugh@@ ed at .
I have a characterization .
this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water .
it is not a map .
no , no , that 's the only place a ship 's been .
we had more exploration ships down there during Cap@@ tain Cook 's time than now . it 's amazing .
you know , we 're going to do this , we 're going to take it away from something else .
do the math , I 'm 66 . and I went out to sea on a Scrip@@ ps ship and we almost got sun@@ k by a giant ro@@ gue wave , and I was too young to be -- you know , I thought it was great !
and with the absence of pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thesis you have no plant life , and as a result , you have very little animal life living in this under@@ world .
tens of thousands of active volcan@@ oes .
but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then .
it 's not a flood , it was pushed up there .
we wanted to get a temperature probe , we stuck it in there , looked at it -- it pe@@ gged off scale .
so the Easter Bun@@ ny has put things in the ocean floor , and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we 're making in this mountain range .
we discovered a pro@@ fusion of life , in a world that it should not exist [ in ] . giant tube wor@@ ms , 10 feet tall .
we went and found these incredible cl@@ am beds sitting on the barre@@ n rock . large cl@@ ams , and when we opened them , they did@@ n 't look like a cl@@ am .
so , we wanted to accelerate this process .
we went in under@@ ne@@ ath and tapped it , and we found that it had the pH of D@@ ran@@ o .
and the hydro@@ thermal ven@@ ts were in an aci@@ dic environment .
we 've been discovering these along ancient trade routes , where they 're not supposed to be .
more recently , into the Black Sea , where we 're exploring .
and within that , we 're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine , blue @@@ -@@ @ gold team , switching them off and on , running 24 hours a day .
it 's a big blank sheet on our planet . we 'll map it within hours , have the maps disseminated out to the major universities .
I would not let an adult drive my robot .
the game is not over -- it 's over by the eighth grade , it 's not beginning .
watching exploration live from thousands of miles away , and it 's just da@@ w@@ ning on her what she 's seeing .
want to hide our sou@@ l@@ ful ec@@ centr@@ icities and authenticity .
I 'll never forget the magic that would happen when a woman stopped resi@@ sting the pain and opened .
( la@@ ughter ) " A perfect match for her ? "
which is pretty typical for si@@ bl@@ ings .
in si@@ blin@@ gh@@ ood , that 's where we start assembling many of those first layers that cover our soul .
when I discovered I was my sister 's match , I went into research mode .
what if we left the bone mar@@ row trans@@ plant up to the doctors , but did something that we later came to call our " soul mar@@ row trans@@ plant ? "
could we forgive ?
after the trans@@ plant , we began to spend more and more time together .
the same happened for me .
after that best year of my sister 's life , the cancer came ro@@ aring back , and this time there was nothing more the doctors could do .
we can do this for the soul of the world .
in this treatment timeline , you can see two points at which we conducted interviews .
and that illustrates my research approach .
by designing techniques like this , I can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview , because I want to hear that from them .
so , I asked them about their birth story .
my m@@ om@@ my went there , and she took two from the jar , one for me and one for my sister .
so only when they started mentioning the donor , I asked questions about him , using their own words .
I think he should be in the trunk , because he made my family possible .
if he would not have done this , that would really be sad because my family would not be here , and I would not be here . "
so also , parents constructed family tales -- tales to tell their children .
one couple explained their in@@ semination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet in@@ semin@@ ate cows .
they even had the hospital parking tickets in there .
it was about how special and how deeply loved their child was .
well .
he was donor @@@ -@@ @ conceived but not part of our study .
one day , he had an argument with his father , and he y@@ elled , " You 're telling me what to do ?
that was exactly what the parents in our study feared .
now , the boy soon felt sorry , and they made up .
it was about pu@@ ber@@ ty -- being difficult .
it will pass . "
I don 't know ; that 's quite different from how we respond to children 's questions .
and that 's the strange thing about advice .
( appl@@ ause ) I will not end here with what went wrong ; I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families .
I was a new mother and a young rab@@ bi in the spring of 2004 and the world was in sha@@ m@@ bles .
now , throughout history , people have committed horri@@ ble crimes and atrocities in the name of religion .
at the very same time that we need religion to be a strong force against extremism , it is suffering from a second per@@ n@@ icious trend , what I call religious routine @@@ -@@ @ ism .
the first is w@@ ak@@ efulness .
we all saw this picture .
this is extremely difficult to do .
psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what 's broken in our world , the less likely we are to do anything .
one says , " I am but dust and ashes . "
I can 't control everything , and I CA@@ N@@ NOT do this on my own .
which is to say it 's true that I can 't do everything , but I can surely do something .
I can protest .
the fourth and final is inter@@ connec@@ tedness .
how small our world has become .
and yet , we know that it is systems of oppression that benefit the most from the lie of radical individu@@ alism .
well , not so , because this is also my problem .
we are all in this together .
because science is knowledge in process .
we make an observation , guess an explanation for that observation , and then make a prediction that we can test with an experiment or other observation .
it do@@ es@@ n 't surprise me that in this climate , many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a hec@@ k of a lot like Ji@@ ff@@ y Lu@@ be .
now , I am a surgeon who looks after patients with sar@@ com@@ a .
in 1966 , Pe@@ y@@ ton R@@ ous got the Nobel Prize for realizing that chick@@ ens had a trans@@ missible form of sar@@ com@@ a .
we learned about it when doctors Li and Fra@@ u@@ meni were looking at families , and they realized that these families had way too many sar@@ com@@ as .
this is a person .
this out@@ lier , this exception , may lead to the advancement of science , but this is a person .
he was asleep , but I found his mother reading by flash@@ light next to his bed .
she came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes .
therefore , every encounter with medicine is an experiment .
but his conversations with the patient were exactly what a patient might want : bri@@ m@@ ming with confidence .
so I performed a much more invasive surgery and had a very different conversation with the patient afterwards .
what will they tell you ?
and those tendencies are derived from the very nature of the physics , chemistry of wires and switches and electr@@ ons , and they will make re@@ occurring patterns again and again .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT see where it 's going , but the general direction is very inevitable : it 's downward .
so we have many ongoing tendencies right now , and I think one of the chief among them is this tendency to make things s@@ mar@@ ter and s@@ mar@@ ter .
human pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes , the rest of the time the AI was driving .
it 's much more like a sym@@ phony of different notes , and each of these notes is played on a different instrument of cogn@@ ition .
it 's not thinking like us .
it 's not being distr@@ acted , it 's not worrying about whether it left the stove on , or whether it should have ma@@ jo@@ red in finance .
( la@@ ughter ) Just driving , OK ?
and robots are going to be bo@@ ts , they 're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done .
it runs on that fact that you have one failure after another .
so , the future : where does that take us ?
so when I think about our current education reform initiatives , I can 't help asking : what are our students of color learning about themselves ?
that way , you save eight minutes every half hour , so in the course of two hours of watching TV , you find 32 minutes to exercise .
( la@@ ughter ) An@@ y@@ way , the idea is we 'll save bits of time here and there , add it up , we will finally get to everything we want to do .
if you 've ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a h@@ ug@@ ely damaging , frigh@@ tening , s@@ op@@ ping m@@ ess .
winds up taking seven hours of her week .
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement , she found seven hours .
if you think about it , that 's really more accurate language .
but these letters serve a purpose , which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your personal life that mat@@ tered to you over the year .
Don 't send it .
( la@@ ughter ) But we are willing to think about what those should be .
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others .
you say you 're working more than 60 hours .
well , are you sure ?
so we have plenty of time , which is great , because guess what ?
we don 't even need that much time to do amazing things .
even if we are busy , we have time for what matters .
we had no idea what was causing this disease .
it was also called consumption , and it was the disorder of po@@ ets and artists and intellectuals .
you have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur .
and to be fair , it 's not entirely their fault .
and mental set is another thing . right ?
but it does make you wonder what else we 've missed .
and in science , we try and remove our bias , right , by running double @@@ -@@ @ blin@@ ded experiments or being statistically ag@@ nos@@ tic as to what our results will be .
so we 've focused on ser@@ ot@@ onin now for the past 30 years , often to the exclusion of other things .
we still have no cu@@ res , and what if ser@@ ot@@ onin is@@ n 't all there is to depression ?
and it 's also re@@ purpos@@ ed .
and then we ran it again in a PT@@ SD model , and we ran it again in a physiological model , where all we did was give stress hormones .
and we had our under@@ gra@@ ds run it .
but what if it were active ?
maybe we could enhance it , sort of ak@@ in to putting on arm@@ or .
we could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time .
there are no incentives in place once a drug is generic and off patent and no longer exclusive to encourage pharm@@ a companies to develop them , because they don 't make money .
it is possible that 20 , 50 , 100 years from now , we will look back now at depression and PT@@ SD the way we look back at tuberculosis s@@ anit@@ ori@@ ums as a thing of the past .
thank you , guys .
and are you a hero ? "
just here in the United States , we 've dropped nuclear weapons on the Carol@@ in@@ as twice .
but if that 's not enough to get your attention , there was the 1995 Black B@@ rant incident .
it would take a ren@@ a@@ issance of sorts , the kinds of innovation that , for better or worse , underpinned both the Manhattan Project , which gave rise to nuclear weapons , and the Meg@@ at@@ ons to Meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts program .
it would take us to 20@@ 45 .
now , 20@@ 45 happens to be the 100th anniversary of the birth of nuclear weapons in the New Mexico desert .
have inspired a generation of inno@@ v@@ ators .
they 're re@@ defining what we all consider possible .
now , every day , I get to meet people who are real pione@@ ers in the field of nuclear threats .
let 's end the nuclear weapons chapter on the 100th anniversary of its inception .
surely , a century of economic development and the development of military strategy will have given us better ways to manage global conflict .
it 's time we pledge our resources as leaders across the spectrum to work on this old problem in new ways , to ask , " How might we ? "
she was born a genetically modified designer baby with numerous upgrades .
if you 're honest with yourself , she 's s@@ mar@@ ter than you , and she 's five years old .
she 's beautiful , tall , athle@@ tic , and the list goes on and on .
Mari@@ anne 's been c@@ rying , and last night when you took her to bed to k@@ iss her good@@ night , she said , " D@@ add@@ y , will Jenn@@ a even be my friend anymore ? "
so now , as I 've been telling you this imagined 2030 story , I have a feeling that I may have put some of you into this sc@@ i @@@ -@@ @ fi frame of reference . right ?
you think you 're reading a sc@@ i @@@ -@@ @ fi book .
researchers in China just a few months ago reported the creation of genetically modified human embry@@ os .
this was the first time in history .
and I think some people are going to run with this technology and try to make designer babies .
in some countries , you cou@@ ld@@ n 't do that .
so I 've been talking about this CR@@ IS@@ PR technology .
and the next tool is like sc@@ iss@@ ors that can cut the DNA right in that spot .
it 's really that simple .
they 're studying human disease and other important elements of science .
imagine those trends , those forces , with a boo@@ ster rocket of this CR@@ IS@@ PR technology that is so powerful and so u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous .
he was Vienn@@ ese , and he was born here in 1929 .
and when my grand@@ parents had little baby Peter , the world was very different . right ?
but I admit I think maybe a lot of us could agree that human beings , maybe we could use a little bet@@ ter@@ ment .
I don 't think so . I don 't think it 's going to get to that extreme .
so I 'll just give you one example , and that is in vit@@ ro fertil@@ ization .
tak@@ ers are self @@@ -@@ @ serving in their interactions .
and I found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking .
the engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more fav@@ ors than they got back .
( la@@ ughter ) And then in sales , too , the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous sal@@ es@@ people .
( la@@ ughter ) And that way justice gets served .
and so the logical conclusion is : it must be the mat@@ chers who are the best performers .
take a look at some data I gathered from hundreds of sal@@ es@@ people , tracking their revenue .
they make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue , but also the highest revenue .
that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other .
we found that on certain floors , nurses did a lot of help @@@ -@@ @ seeking , and on other floors , they did very little of it .
I fig@@ ured , you want a culture of productive generosity , you should hire a bun@@ ch of gi@@ vers .
whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives : what are your values ? what are your intentions toward others ?
or as an engineer put it , " Oh , dis@@ agre@@ eable gi@@ vers -- like somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system . "
so I worked really hard , got a scholarship to the United States , where I became a cancer researcher , and I loved it .
and Nairobi , the major business hub , was rated 17@@ 7th on the quality of living index .
we all know this is a temporary solution .
in 2014 when he came , Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries .
now imagine with me , if you had a process you had to go through -- had no other alternative -- and this process was inefficient , complex and very , very slow .
I think you might start by trying to find somebody to out@@ source it to , so that they can just take care of that for you .
if that do@@ es@@ n 't work , maybe you 'd consider paying somebody to just " un@@ officially " take care of it on your behalf -- especially if you thought nobody was going to catch you .
many of my colleagues had been working their entire careers for this moment , and frankly , to little curious me , this was the moment I 'd been waiting for my entire life .
and then a few weeks later , we found a b@@ ump .
gravity may seem super strong to you , but it 's actually cra@@ z@@ ily weak compared to the other forces of nature .
if this were true , we would have to expand our Standard Model of particles to include an extra particle , a hyper@@ dimensional particle of gravity , a special gra@@ vit@@ on that lives in extra @@@ -@@ @ spatial dimensions .
which would not be the end of physics , but a novel beginning .
we no longer di@@ g d@@ it@@ ches by hand , pound tools out of w@@ rought iron or do book@@ keeping using actual books .
I 'm going to call the first of these the O @@@ -@@ @ ring principle , and it determines the type of work that we do .
but those tell@@ ers were doing somewhat different work .
probably something else will break anyway .
in much of the work that we do , we are the O @@@ -@@ @ rings .
and that brings me to the second principle : never get enough .
if you think about it , is@@ n 't it kind of self @@@ -@@ @ evident that once we get sufficiently productive at something , we 've basically worked our way out of a job ?
many of the products that we spend a lot of our money on -- air conditioners , sport utility vehicles , computers and mobile devices -- were un@@ at@@ tain@@ ably expensive , or just had@@ n 't been invented a century ago .
as automation fre@@ es our time , increases the scope of what is possible , we inv@@ ent new products , new ideas , new services that command our attention , occupy our time and spur consumption .
so if you accept these two principles , the O @@@ -@@ @ ring principle and the never @@@ -@@ @ get @@@ -@@ @ enough principle , then you agree with me .
does that mean there 's nothing to worry about ?
just by way of comparison , the US is typically ranked around 12th or 13th .
Norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility .
Saudi Arabia has raised living standards while frustr@@ ating many other human stri@@ v@@ ings .
and this brings me to the challenge that we face today , the challenge that automation poses for us .
the challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs , and many citizens CA@@ N@@ NOT qualify for the good jobs that are being created .
it also turned out to be one of the best investments the US made in the 20th century .
adjusting to the rapid pace of technological change creates real challenges , seen most clearly in our pol@@ arized labor market and the threat that it poses to economic mobility .
but it is feasible .
so what this picture is@@ n 't showing you are all the planets that we know about out there in space .
so hydrogen , hel@@ ium and many other things make up what 's known as the Earth 's atmosphere .
because when you think about the solar system , you might think about this picture here .
and this helps us confirm ideas , like why Mars is red , from that lost hydrogen .
but the New Horiz@@ ons mission is currently studying atmospheric escape being lost from the planet .
and these planets that we call tran@@ siting have the special feature that if you look at that star in the middle , you 'll see that actually it 's bl@@ inking .
well , in the far future , the Sun is going to get brigh@@ ter .
but curi@@ ously , the frequency of their pur@@ rs , between 25 and 150 her@@ tz , is within a range that can promote tissue regeneration .
too often , harassment and discrimination is a lon@@ ely and isol@@ ating experience , but we need to help people out from under their desks .
how can we speak up in a society that too often dis@@ credits or dimin@@ ishes our experiences ?
now , here 's where I can come in .
and now I 'm turning my attention to helping people tackle recording and reporting of workplace harassment and discrimination .
because as soon as your share your story with friends or family or colleagues or therap@@ ists , you have the potential to distort or change your memory of the event .
I want you to keep track of this and simply fill in the blan@@ ks .
and is there any other evidence such as Wh@@ at@@ s@@ Ap@@ ps , photos or emails that might lend more credibility to your case .
these are all details that are incredibly easy to record contem@@ por@@ an@@ eously but are also incredibly easy to forget later on .
assume that you 're going to forget .
assume you have to write it down .
you don 't have to talk to a person , there 's no fear of judgment , and you can do it whenever and wherever you need .
we 're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies , two kinds of desirable women , anyway .
tell me . what are the first words that come to mind when you picture a pregnant woman ?
she 's cu@@ te , remember ?
so what do the experts say ?
I think we can all agree that it 's worth the trouble to do so .
thank you .
my sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago .
my cou@@ sins all teach .
four ch@@ efs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes .
in this episode , the main @@@ -@@ @ course mystery ingredient was quin@@ oa .
Cher@@ yl was the nutrition director at High School in the Community in Connecticut .
she 's 12 years old , she 's smart as a whi@@ p and she wants to be a phy@@ sic@@ ist when she grows up .
her chances of getting a nutri@@ tious meal , one with fruit and milk , one lower in sugar and salt , dramatically increase .
why ?
overall , All@@ ison is in much better health than the average school k@@ id .
research shows that kids who do not have consistent nour@@ ishment , particularly at breakfast , have poor cognitive function overall .
a few years ago , D@@ onn@@ a decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming , and overhaul her nutrition standards .
she improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains .
what would be the impact ?
and I wanted to really not just work on the sk@@ ins , but I wanted to work on the entire human experience .
but designers are really the glue that brings these things together .
and Hos@@ ain Rah@@ man , the CEO of Ali@@ ph J@@ aw@@ bone , you know , really understands that you need a different structure .
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
so we called it Y Water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional design , the ideas , the bran@@ ding , it all becomes deeply connected .
not from a solid block of stone , but from a pile of dust , somehow glu@@ ing millions of these particles together to form a statue .
the only way you get a statue from a pile of dust is if the statue built itself -- if somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together to form the statue .
it 's like this ultimate toolkit .
and the reason is , these nan@@ om@@ ater@@ ials -- they 're like a double @@@ -@@ @ ed@@ ged sword .
and we just don 't have the tools that are small enough to work with them .
now that last one , that 's a really important one .
and this pace exists because of our ability to pack more and more devices onto a computer chip .
it cou@@ ld@@ n 't do anything that your smartphone does .
the science is scre@@ aming at us , " This is what you should be doing to solve your problem . "
so , all right , let 's get started , let 's do this .
let 's just figure out what 's missing .
when Fre@@ do betra@@ ys his brother Michael , we all know what needs to be done .
and nature 's not crude like us , just h@@ acking away .
and she 's already at the n@@ ano .
chemistry is the missing tool .
they 're out there forever , and anyone anywhere can pick them up and use them , and help to deliver on the promise of nano@@ technology .
most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this met@@ aph@@ or , falling , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
and I picture it this way because falling is not jumping .
( la@@ ughter ) I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty turbul@@ ent relationship right from the start .
I can remember one moment in particular .
I had no gu@@ idebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
( la@@ ughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel mis@@ erable in love .
this really should not be surprising , considering that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two albums and one novel with the title " Cra@@ zy Love . "
I expected my first love to feel like mad@@ ness , and of course , it met that expectation very well .
but I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
in fact , there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal , because , neuro@@ chem@@ ically speaking , romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished .
and most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
but the good news is , it do@@ es@@ n 't always last that long -- usually from a few months to a couple of years .
our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a break@@ up , that neuro@@ chemical reward is withdrawn .
it seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like mad@@ ness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustr@@ ating and emo@@ tionally demanding .
and love involves both joy and pain .
when 14 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Jul@@ ie@@ t first meets -- or , when 14 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Jul@@ ie@@ t CA@@ N@@ NOT be with Rom@@ eo , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disappointed or ang@@ sty .
and just as a refresher , at this point in the play , act three of five , Rom@@ eo is not dead .
instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when tr@@ usting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
this is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you 're gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
when I was a child , I knew I had super@@ powers .
you know , white , brown , whatever -- I loved them all .
very quickly , he also had me performing for larger and larger audiences , and b@@ iz@@ ar@@ rely , I became almost a kind of poster child for Norwegian multiculturalism .
so very quickly , I was starting to become attacked at my own concerts .
so I kind of got lost .
so I decided that I wanted to put my childhood super@@ power to some use by trying to make people on the different sides of these issues understand what it 's like to be a young person stuck between your family and your country .
she had been str@@ ang@@ led , she had been beaten to death by three men , three cou@@ sins , on the orders of her father and uncle .
and the problem with this is that not only are so many of our kids facing these problems within their families and within their families ' communities , but they 're also meeting misunderstandings and ap@@ a@@ thy in the countries that they grow up in .
when their own families betra@@ y them , they look to the rest of us , and when we don 't understand , we lose them .
the same men , or similar men , to the ones that have h@@ ounded me for most of my life .
and what I also learned is that extremist groups , terrorist groups are taking advantage of these feelings of our young people and chann@@ eling that -- cy@@ n@@ ically -- chann@@ eling that toward violence .
the invisible and the silent are finally seen and heard .
what I am trying to say is that we have to understand why some of our young people are attracted to this .
I also found men brut@@ alized by racist violence , but who found a way to stop feeling like victims by becoming violent themselves .
in fact , I found something , to my horror , that I recognized .
the same feeling of being lost and torn between cultures .
I could see that understanding is the answer , instead of violence .
I would like to ask -- to Muslim parents and Muslim communities , will you love and care for your children without forcing them to meet your expectations ?
a life defined by you and nobody else .
and for the rest of us , when will we start listening to our young people ?
they think we don 't accept them .
and in the long term , revenge and violence will not work against extremists .
a complete new species .
I often wonder : why is it that we are having so much trouble trying to solve the problem of cancer ?
for the past decade and a half or so , I 've been trying to figure out how these little du@@ des do what they do , and how they pull this magic trick off .
and that 's because , unfortunately , these seven animals essentially correspond to 0.00@@ 09 percent of all of the species that in@@ habit the planet .
we , like all other species on this planet , are inextricably wo@@ ven into the history of life on this planet .
like with typ@@ es@@ et@@ ting , the important thing was cra@@ fting a user interface that was both natural and efficient for non@@ computer people to use .
again , numbers , words , laid out in ways that made sense .
what they would do is they would explain what was going on and then dictate information that the professor would trans@@ cri@@ be onto the many motorized black@@ boards in the front of the class , and then we 'd have a discussion .
but I had worked on interactive word processing and on @@@ -@@ @ demand personal computation .
so I decided to build a prototype .
and , if I did it like a map and put AB@@ C across the top and numbers along the side , if you saw B@@ 7 in a formula , you 'd know exactly where it was on the screen .
it also opened up new capabilities , like the ability to have ranges of cells .
I wrote a reference card to act as documentation .
print was@@ n 't working yet , so I had to copy everything down .
save was@@ n 't working , so every time it crash@@ ed , I had to type in all of the formulas again , over and over again .
I A@@ CED the case . Vi@@ si@@ Cal@@ c was already useful .
well , I did@@ n 't want to tell him about our secret program .
( la@@ ughter ) So I said , " I took this and added this and multiplied by this and sub@@ tracted that . "
I said , " H@@ ah ! a ratio -- that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have been as exact ! "
in June of 1979 , our publisher announced Vi@@ si@@ Cal@@ c to the world , in a small booth at the giant National Computer Conference in New York City .
but some did .
so I was excited , then I pan@@ ic@@ ked , then I was excited , then I pan@@ ic@@ ked , and in between the excitement and the pan@@ ic@@ king , I started to do my research , and my research primarily consisted of Go@@ og@@ ling how to give a great TED Talk .
I want to talk to you about the power of stories , of course , but I also want to talk about their limitations , particularly for those of us who are interested in social justice .
and I round the corner , and they 've captured him , they 've caught him .
I was married to a Sco@@ t for 14 years , so I said , " C@@ unt means many different things in different countries -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) but I 'm pretty sure you ep@@ it@@ om@@ ize the global standard of a dic@@ k . "
and there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ...
it is the non@@ consensual sharing of an image used tac@@ tically to shame and humili@@ ate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us .
and my expressing it does not pornography make .
I was able to start the Spe@@ ech Project with colleagues .
and guess what ?
I get hate speech for that .
" Oh , you live in an echo chamber . "
kids , schools , caregivers , parents : it 's essential .
so apparently , I 've got a pretty bold voice .
A@@ J : God does good work .
and yet , it 's so easily forgotten .
actually , why don 't we all right now together take one big , collective , deep breath in .
this is a work I made in 2014 .
I was particularly interested in moments of time that are examples of life changing the air , but also the air that can influence how life will evolve , like Car@@ bon@@ if@@ erous air .
humans made this air , but it 's also the most potent greenhouse gas that has ever been tested .
( in a lowered voice ) It has another quite surprising quality .
it 's immediate , vital and intimate , as well as being am@@ orph@@ ous and cumbersome .
to figure out the minimum number of rub@@ ies you 're guaranteed to win , you need to look for the worst case scenario , as if the merchant already knew your move and could arrange the rub@@ ies to minimize your win@@ nings .
you can buy everything there , from a base @@@ -@@ @ level attack to a much more advanced version .
you can check references .
you can even buy attacks that come with a money @@@ -@@ @ back guarantee -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) if you 're not successful .
of course , if you 're going to buy an attack , you 're going to buy from a repu@@ table criminal with good ratings , right ?
this is an actual screen@@ shot of a vendor selling malware .
they 've had 400 positive reviews in the last year , and only two negative reviews in the last month .
what are they going to do -- sue you if you violate them ?
so they wrote her this very email , ple@@ ading their case and making the argument that they felt she had evaluated an older version .
what is the top priority ?
we 've got to get governments , private institutions and security companies willing to share information at speed .
and here 's why : because if you share the information , it 's equivalent to in@@ oc@@ ulation .
but there 's an even bigger benefit .
as you can imagine , this got quite a reaction .
and our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations to join us in the fight , and do the same thing and share their information on when and how they 're being attacked as well .
all we have to do is look to the response that we see in the world of health care , and how they respond to a pandemic .
there 's people wan@@ dering around in packs , not thinking for themselves , seized by this mob mentality trying to spread their disease and destroy society .
and what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards , we found that liber@@ als , it did@@ n 't matter what ess@@ ay they read .
let 's do it despite the politicians and the media and Facebook and Twitter and Congres@@ sional redi@@ stric@@ ting and all of it , all the things that divide us .
thank you .
I would go into these private places , and I would put my ideas and my pas@@ sions into objects -- and sort of learning how to speak with my hands .
and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests .
so , I was able to sort of exercise all of that .
for me , it 's kind of a feeling about the fle@@ e@@ tin@@ gn@@ ess of the present moment , and I wanted to express that .
what would I love ?
so , that 's a finished gear .
( la@@ ughter ) And the idea , their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street , and there 'd be no subjective decision about what was the best .
it 's always a struggle , but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought out into an object , and then it 's there , OK .
and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside , out to the physical , to someone per@@ cei@@ ving it .
I 'm a relationship buil@@ der .
when you think of a relationship buil@@ der , don 't you just automatically think " architect ? "
my team and I have been applying insights from ecology to architecture to see how physical space can help build stronger relationships .
they thought a place for preparing food together could do that .
it 's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes , but it was so important to the concept , we got it done .
but is it working ?
well , more and more people are coming here , for one , and as a result of the fire@@ side ch@@ ats and a full calendar of programming , people are applying for the Ar@@ cus Fellow@@ ships .
they can seem isol@@ ating and inward .
about 15 years ago in Chicago , they started to replace old police stations , and they built this identical model all over the city .
it was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station , but it was@@ n 't equity in the sense of responding to each community 's individual needs .
" pol@@ is " is a Greek word that means a place with a sense of community .
these insights came directly from the community members and the police officers themselves , and as designers , our role was just to connect the do@@ ts and suggest the first step .
so with the help of the city and the parks , we were able to raise funds and design and build a half @@@ -@@ @ court , right on the police station parking lot .
but now , they even have bas@@ ket@@ balls inside the station that kids can borrow .
and parents report something aston@@ ishing .
engaging the public can be intim@@ idating , and I 've felt that , too .
architects really are relationship builders .
the de@@ tractors , or the people telling you that businesses will prevail , are right .
they self @@@ -@@ @ governed their behavior , and they won the contract over some very powerful companies .
B@@ F : so speaking of guidelines and self @@@ -@@ @ governance , you 've spent an entire lifetime creating guidelines and norms for the internet .
do you think those days are over ?
let 's say -- Facebook comes to mind -- they would say they have their users ' best interests at heart , but I think a lot of people would disagree with that .
FC : it 's been very difficult to watch how tech companies have reacted to the citiz@@ en@@ ry 's response to their technologies .
and some of them , two or three years ago , basically dismissed it .
I just have a technology platform . "
so I think there is a maturity that is starting to set , especially in that Sil@@ icon Valley area , where people are beginning to say , " We have a role . "
we don 't need any Geneva Conventions . we self @@@ -@@ @ regulate . "
and unless we play into that power table , I think we 'll end up in a bad place .
and the answer -- from every nuclear power -- to this question was , nothing .
the story , of course , is the rise of China .
never before have so many people risen so far so fast , on so many different dimensions .
for perspective on what we 're now seeing in this rival@@ ry , it 's useful to locate it on the larger map of history .
so just in November , we 'll all pause to mark the 100th anniversary of the final day of a war that became so encompassing , that it required historians to create an entirely new category : world war .
question : forty years ago , 1978 , China sets out on its march to the market .
what about the numbers ?
and China 's president has promised that within the next three years , those last tens of millions will have been raised up above that threshold .
so , about this war that destroyed classical Greece , Th@@ uc@@ y@@ di@@ des wrote fam@@ ously : " it was the rise of Athens and the fear that this insti@@ l@@ led in S@@ part@@ a that made the war inevitable . "
" Th@@ uc@@ y@@ di@@ des 's Tra@@ p " is a term I co@@ ined several years ago , to make vivid Th@@ uc@@ y@@ di@@ des 's insight .
so as we saw with this f@@ li@@ pping the pyramid of poverty , China has actually so@@ ared .
how long did it take for them to complete the project ?
by 2014 , its GDP was equal to ours .
for example , in the current trade conflict , China is already the number one trading partner of all the major Asian countries .
so how does this work ?
so I 'm hopeful that as this sinks in and as you reflect on it , some of you are going to have some bold ideas , actually some wild ideas , that when we find , will make a difference in this space .
a remarkable group of Americans and Europeans and others , not just from government , but from the world of culture and business , engaged in a collective surge of imagination .
after World War II , Americans felt exhausted .
they had demobilized 10 million troops , they were focused on an urgent domestic agenda .
over the course of the next 20 years , more will change around the way we do our work than has happened in the last 2,000 .
and then the Agricultural Age lasted several thousand years .
let 's start with cognitive aug@@ mentation .
our very first tool only cut where we struck it .
the ch@@ is@@ el only car@@ ves where the artist points it .
I 'll give you an example .
in the case of this aerial dr@@ one chassis , all you would need to do is tell it something like , it has four prop@@ ell@@ ers , you want it to be as lightweight as possible , and you need it to be aer@@ odynam@@ ically efficient .
it takes big computers to do this .
what 's exciting is we 're starting to see this technology out in the real world .
we 've been working with Air@@ bus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future .
it 's a ways out still .
well , every time the owner picked up the le@@ ash , they went for a walk .
in fact , rather than working from pre@@ defined recipes , Wat@@ son had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents .
I mean , consider -- in the space of a human lifetime , computers have gone from a child 's game to what 's recognized as the pin@@ n@@ acle of strategic thought .
what 's basically happening is computers are going from being like Spo@@ ck to being a lot more like Kir@@ k .
( la@@ ughter ) Right ? from pure logic to in@@ tuition .
( la@@ ughter ) And you arrived at that decision in a split second .
you just sort of knew that bridge was unsafe .
we 're not doing a very good job on our own , we could certainly use all the help we can get .
I think the era of human aug@@ mentation is as much about the physical world as it is about the virtual , intellectual realm .
OK , there 's certainly a fear that robots are going to take jobs away from humans , and that is true in certain sectors .
but I 'm much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together are going to augment each other , and start to in@@ habit a new space .
as an experiment , we set it up to help a person working in construction doing repeti@@ tive tasks -- tasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in dry@@ wall .
the humans acted as labor .
they cru@@ ised around the construction site , they manip@@ ulated the b@@ ambo@@ o -- which , by the way , because it 's a non @@@ -@@ @ is@@ om@@ orph@@ ic material , is super hard for robots to deal with .
and then we had an AI that was controlling everything .
it was telling the humans what to do , telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands of individual components .
what 's interesting is , building this pavilion was simply not possible without human , robot and AI aug@@ menting each other .
our nervous system , the human nervous system , tells us everything that 's going on around us .
these guys are crazy -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) in the best way .
and the car 's nervous system captured everything that was happening to the car .
you get this .
I think we 're going to see a world where we 're moving from things that are fabricated to things that are f@@ armed .
we 're going to have a world with more variety , more connec@@ tedness , more dynamism , more complexity , more adap@@ tability and , of course , more beauty .
the shape of things to come will be unlike anything we 've ever seen before .
why ?
I even saw children , who looked the same age as me , filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the road@@ side .
you can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to puri@@ fy larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time .
now , over the course of this , my journey h@@ as@@ n 't really been easy .
and for that reason , I 'm continuing to work on this science fair project from 2012 to bring it from the laboratory into the real world .
and this summer , I founded Cat@@ aly@@ st for World Water , a social enterprise aimed at cataly@@ zing solutions to the global water crisis .
my in@@ box is full of hate mails and personal abuse and has been for years .
" when something happens to you , it will give the police a lead . "
emails that started with words like " terrorist , " " R@@ ag@@ head , " " rat , " " wh@@ ore . "
to my surprise and shock , he answered the phone .
and then he said , " I have to ask my wife . "
when I got home , I was very ambi@@ val@@ ent about my experience .
the vast majority of people I approach agree to meet me .
I know that feeling .
I know what I 'm talking about .
if you want to prevent hate and violence , we have to talk to as many people as possible for as long as possible while being as open as possible .
( la@@ ughter ) All those words have been used to vil@@ ify those groups .
before the end of this year , I challenge you to invite someone who you demon@@ ize -- someone who you disagree with politically and / or culturally and don 't think you have anything in common with .
we delete the hate mails .
we hang out only with people who think like us and talk about the others in a category of dis@@ d@@ ain .
we un@@ friend people on Facebook , and when we meet people who are discrimin@@ ating or de@@ human@@ izing people or groups , we don 't insist on speaking with them to challenge their opinions .
it is not .
Sergio rejected any suggestion of revenge and instead said this ...
I thought if I was going to ask Gre@@ g to spend the rest of this life with me , then I should ask him in front of two people who had pledged to be together for eternity .
the thr@@ ill of archaeological discovery is as powerful as love , because ancient history is the most se@@ duc@@ tive mi@@ stress imagin@@ able .
many seek .
on my first day in Egypt , I worked at a site in the Nor@@ theast Egyptian Delta called M@@ end@@ es , dating to 4,@@ 200 years ago , in a cemetery .
I am a space archae@@ ologist .
we 're back at the site just south of Cairo .
we know that IS@@ IL is pro@@ fi@@ ting from the looting of sites , but we don 't know the scale .
it 's aston@@ ishing .
and putting that data together -- you can see the looting p@@ its marked here .
at one site , the looting got bad from 2009 , 2011 , 2012 -- hundreds and hundreds of p@@ its .
that 's what was taken .
if we don 't do anything , they 'll be back . "
we started finding engra@@ ved inscri@@ ptions .
you can see it written out here , in hier@@ og@@ ly@@ phs .
he handed me a check for $ 2,000 , and said , " This is to cover your expenses .
thus , my TED Prize wish is partial pay@@ back , plus interest -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) for a great human being 's generosity and kindness .
so this figure prompted a lot of hand @@@ -@@ @ wr@@ inging in Wh@@ ite@@ hall .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's the part of mathematics that even mathemati@@ cians don 't particularly like , because whereas the rest of ma@@ ths is all about precision and certainty , statistics is almost the reverse of that .
and I was so thr@@ illed with this study , I started to take questions out in presentations . I was referring to it .
I@@ p@@ so@@ s MO@@ RI expanded the survey in recent years to go across the world .
they thought 56 out of every 100 Japanese people lived in rural areas .
and that has enormous repercussions for decision making .
I said , this is clearly a global problem , but maybe geography is the issue here .
if we re@@ frame the questions and say , how well do you know your local area , would your answers be any more accurate ?
so I devised a qu@@ iz : how well do you know your area ?
and I was very conscious in designing this .
you drag the sli@@ der to highlight your icons , and then just click " Sub@@ mit " to answer , and we anim@@ ate away the difference between your answer and reality .
so this one 's now asking about home@@ ownership : for every 100 households , how many are owned with a mortgage or loan ?
( la@@ ughter ) And actually , these get harder , these questions , because when you 're in an area , when you 're in a community , things like age -- there are clu@@ es to whether a population is old or young .
just by looking around the area , you can see it .
now the truth is , when we published this qu@@ iz , the census data that it 's based on was already a few years old .
was more than I could have hoped for .
( la@@ ughter ) This URL contains the words " statistics , " " go@@ v " and " UK , " which are three of people 's least favorite words in a URL .
the national st@@ atisti@@ cian of England and Wales , John Pul@@ l@@ inger , you would expect he would be pretty good .
( la@@ ughter ) Jeremy P@@ ax@@ man -- admittedly , after a glass of wine -- 36 .
( la@@ ughter ) At this time , I was inter@@ ning at the Public Defender Service in Washington DC , and I was visiting a police station for work .
I was on my way out , and before I could make it to my car , two police cars pulled up to block my exit , and an officer approached me from behind .
all of them had hand@@ guns , some had assault rifles .
but they we@@ ren 't including any of these details .
and this description carried on into their police reports .
I never expected to be described by my own government in these terms : " l@@ ur@@ king , " " nef@@ arious , " " terrorist . "
and when he did that , it really s@@ ank in how completely I was at their mercy .
and when I had to pay it , it felt anno@@ ying and it felt bad , but I paid it and I moved on .
but today I want to talk about a different aspect of the relationship between their police force and their citizens .
in fact , the whole cell was never cleaned , so the floor and the walls were lined with blood and m@@ uc@@ us .
the only attention you get from the guards in there is sexual . "
so , they 'd take the debtors to this place and they 'd say , " We 're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt . "
and if you could -- if you could call a family member who could somehow come up with some money , then maybe you were out .
but he can 't pay his fines and fees because he has nothing to give .
we 're told that our j@@ ails are places for criminals , but statistically that 's not the case : three out of every five people in jail right now are there pretrial .
so while you 're watching the movie , or even if you haven 't , when you think about Mars , you 're probably thinking about how far away it is and how distant .
so while she sle@@ eps , we work on her program for the next day .
right ? so you can imagine how confusing that is .
right ? and we did@@ n 't start out -- I got this watch in 2004 when Spirit and Opportunity , the ro@@ vers back then .
we started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other .
( la@@ ughter ) Tom@@ orrow became " n@@ ex@@ ter@@ so@@ l " or " sol@@ orrow . "
( la@@ ughter ) So we have the watches and the language , and you 're detecting a theme here , right ?
( la@@ ughter ) So now instead of the watches , we can also use our phones .
so these ro@@ ver missions are our first steps out into the solar system .
I have wanted to work at J@@ PL on these missions since I was 14 years old and I am privileged to be a part of it .
the car , an in@@ anim@@ ate object , has more say over public policy than this group of citizens .
I come from a family of civil rights advocates , and I had spent my career until that point working with low @@@ -@@ @ income children and families .
it was@@ n 't until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong .
and even if they had ideas , w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't they be chil@@ dish ?
do our cities really need a park made out of can@@ dy ?
( la@@ ughter ) While these concerns sound legitimate , I realized that not including children in city planning was a bigger design problem .
and separated bi@@ king and walking paths , so speeding bi@@ kers won 't hit young people as they stro@@ ll by the cre@@ ek .
so , were all of the kids ' ideas implemented at the Civic Area ?
democracy is a mess@@ y process .
literally .
( la@@ ughter ) Who w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't enjoy a tree house containing a little lending library and comfortable be@@ an@@ bag chairs for reading ?
they want nature right in their back@@ yards , not four blocks away .
for better or worse , this is logical , because five @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds today are rarely allowed to walk four blocks to access a park by themselves .
it may come as a surprise , but we even take into consideration the desires or our lit@@ t@@ lest citizens , babies and to@@ dd@@ lers .
so if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaper food venues , we meet the needs of many other populations , too .
it turns out I did@@ n 't end up being part of the play , but through it I met Th@@ ord@@ is .
we 'd been in a bud@@ ding relationship for a bit over a month when our school 's Christmas B@@ all was held .
Th@@ ord@@ is El@@ va : I was 16 and in love for the first time .
I broke up with Th@@ ord@@ is a couple of days later , and then saw her a number of times during the remainder of my year in Iceland , feeling a sharp sta@@ b of heav@@ y@@ hear@@ tedness each time .
but that day , I watched in wonder as the words stream@@ ed out of my pen , forming the most pivotal letter I 've ever written , addressed to Tom .
we decided upon the city of Cape Town , and there we met for one week .
nowhere else has healing and rap@@ pro@@ chement been tested like it has in South Africa .
over the course of this week , we literally spoke our life stories to each other , from start to finish .
and our individual realities were ai@@ red with an un@@ filtered purity that cou@@ ld@@ n 't do any less than ligh@@ ten the soul .
it 's what I call a parad@@ ox of ownership .
I thought my certificate of humanity would be burnt .
I feel that way . I try my best .
then we concentrate on what we have already ma@@ stered and we try to minimize mistakes .
he built an underground room where he could practice without interrup@@ tions and not distur@@ b other people .
and since courts at the time were very nois@@ y , he also practiced by the ocean , projec@@ ting his voice above the ro@@ ar of the waves .
his activities in the learning zone were very different from his activities in court , his performance zone .
we create social risks for one another , even in schools which are supposed to be all about learning , and I 'm not talking about standardized tests .
I mean that every minute of every day , many students in elementary schools through colleges feel that if they make a mistake , others will think less of them .
no wonder they 're always stressed out and not taking the risks necessary for learning .
that way , we gain clarity about what success is , when , and how to best support one another .
second , we can execute and perform as we 're expected , but then reflect on what we could do better next time , like Bey@@ onc@@ é does , and we can observe and em@@ ulate experts .
what if we each always had something we were working to improve ?
very interesting .
and like I tell my family , and my wife reminds me every time , " You 're ris@@ king your life , you know , every time you go to that country . "
you remember all that oil ?
yes , I 'm sorry if it up@@ sets some of you , but I think you need to see this . that 's the floor , OK ?
we 're going to do some open @@@ -@@ @ heart surgery . I was the only B@@ rit , on a team of about nine American cardi@@ ac surge@@ ons , cardi@@ ac nurse , intensive care nurse .
so , here we are , mission . big trouble .
yes , that 's the medical advice the committee chairman says , " Yes , I told you , you we@@ ren 't going to be able to , you can 't do this , I just know it . "
so what we going to do now ?
the reason I have this picture here , this X @@@ -@@ @ ray , it 's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X @@@ -@@ @ rays .
people still believe in Vo@@ odo@@ o . heart disease , V@@ SD , hole in the heart , tetr@@ alog@@ ies .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company .
and currently we 're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on @@@ -@@ @ site .
the technology for oxygen delivery is not new .
like a tor@@ n@@ ado strike in an area without an early warning system , there is no alarm to warn , for the danger is already at your door@@ step when your odds of survival are greatly reduced .
so , there 's still a lot of room for improvement , even for can@@ cers that do have screening options , and , of course , considerable benefits for those that don 't .
this is so tiny that you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell .
that 's roughly the difference between a golf ball and a fine grain piece of sand .
aside from his father , I was the one person who knew and loved D@@ yl@@ an the most .
many who have ongoing feelings of fear or anger or hop@@ elessness are never assessed or treated .
she heard me say that D@@ yl@@ an could not have loved me if he could do something as horri@@ ble as he did .
and he had a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alien@@ ation , and who was seriously disturbed , controlling and hom@@ ic@@ idal .
the attacks happened everywhere : in the hardware store , in my office , or even while reading a book in bed .
but here 's something I 've learned : if love were enough to stop someone who is su@@ ic@@ idal from hur@@ ting themselves , su@@ icides would hardly ever happen .
and also I gave that talk exactly a month ago , and you can see it at TE@@ D.@@ com@@ .
a bit of a pre@@ ten@@ tious term , it 's a little tongue @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ che@@ ek , but it 's something I 've thought about for a long time , and I 'd like to share what I think I 've fig@@ ured out .
it 's so easy to understand , the places where you only live , the places where you only work , the places where you only shop , and our super @@@ -@@ @ sized public institutions .
it 's in Panama City .
this is a real place .
this is a slide that epidem@@ i@@ ologists have been showing for some time now , ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) The fact that we have a society where you drive to the parking lot to take the escal@@ ator to the t@@ read@@ mill shows that we 're doing something wrong .
this is where I 'm going to tell you what I tell every audience I meet , which is to remind you about induced demand .
we 've doubled the amount of on @@@ -@@ @ street parking .
the typical city is more like C@@ ed@@ ar Rap@@ ids , where they have an all four @@@ -@@ @ lane system , half one @@@ -@@ @ way system .
( la@@ ughter ) This is a sub@@ division outside of Washington from the 1960s .
1960s , 1980s .
these are two @@@ -@@ @ way roads , very narrow rights of way , and he shows this well @@@ -@@ @ known phil@@ os@@ op@@ her , who said , " B@@ road is the road that leads to destruction ...
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) This plays very well in the South .
now : bicycles .
but where you build it , they come .
he sent me this . I said , " W@@ as that bike to work day ? "
even automotive cities like Long Beach , California : vast up@@ tick in the number of bi@@ kers based on the infrastructure .
and here , you know , this street : yes , it will drain within a minute of the hundred @@@ -@@ @ year storm , but this poor woman has to mount the curb every day .
so then quickly , the comfortable walk has to do with the fact that all animals seek , simultaneously , prospect and refuge .
and then , finally , the interesting walk : signs of humanity .
we are among the social pri@@ mates .
this one I call the Ch@@ ia Pe@@ t Gar@@ age . it 's in South Beach .
to the left is the convention center neighborhood , full of pedestrians .
to the right is the Short North neighborhood -- ethnic , great restaurants , great shops , struggling .
so find those places where you have most of them and fix what you can , fix what still needs fixing in those places .
worldwide , over 1.5 billion people experience armed conflict .
children , without a doubt , are the most innocent and vulnerable victims ...
it was always the people scre@@ aming and running that really got me the most , especially those terri@@ fied @@@ -@@ @ looking children .
would my daughter 's bright , happy eyes lose their shine ?
the question I had was , could parent training programs be useful for families while they were still in war zones or refugee camps ?
she listened carefully and pati@@ ently , and then to my joy she said , " If that 's what you want to do , and it means so much to you , then let 's do it .
now , to know how to help families that have been through conflict support their children , the first step must obviously be to ask them what they 're struggling with , right ?
so I travelled to refugee camps in Syria and in Turkey , and I sat with families , and I listened .
they were making attempts at seeking support from NGO workers , from refugee camp teachers , professional medic@@ s , other parents .
one mother I met had only been in a camp for four days , and had already made two attempts at seeking support for her eight @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter who was having terri@@ fying night@@ ma@@ res .
but sadly , these attempts are almost always useless .
the other piece of paper was a feedback questionnaire , and of course , there was a pen .
to have that in Manchester would be a huge achievement , let alone in a conflict zone in Syria -- really highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families .
people have been using media to talk about sex for a long time .
though , I do know what this means -- I think you do too .
people are into all sorts of things that you may not be into , like blue cheese or cil@@ an@@ tro .
right now most people are thinking about sex@@ ting without really thinking about consent at all .
it 's often te@@ ens who are dis@@ liked by their partner 's parents .
child pornography is a serious crime , but it 's just not the same thing as teen sex@@ ting .
and most of the time , nothing goes wrong .
people ask me all the time things like , is@@ n 't sex@@ ting just so dangerous , though ?
if you come back the next day and all the money is just gone , you really need to dump that guy .

it can be really hard to get those images taken down .
everything digital is not just automatically public .
that do@@ es@@ n 't make any sense .
all of your financial information is held in digital databases , but your credit card company can 't just post your purchase history online .
we 're always told that privacy is our own , sole , individual responsibility .
these companies have very little incentive to help protect our privacy because their business models depend on us sharing everything with as many people as possible .
she shared n@@ ude photos of herself with her high school boy@@ friend , thinking she could trust him .
Jenn@@ if@@ er was embar@@ ras@@ sed and humili@@ ated , but instead of being comp@@ assi@@ onate , her class@@ mates harassed her .
they called her a s@@ lu@@ t and a wh@@ ore and they made her life mis@@ erable .
ultimately , Jenn@@ if@@ er decided to end her own life .
and when we assume that privacy is impossible in digital media , we completely write off and excuse her boy@@ friend 's bad , bad behavior .
so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of bl@@ aming them , let 's do this instead : let 's shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let 's respond with compassion .
I 'm swe@@ ating .
and my breath is a little bit shallow .
but the physical sens@@ ations I 'm experiencing right now are actually the result of a much more basic mind @@@ -@@ @ body mechanism .
it 's a very old and very necessary response that sends blood and oxygen to the organs and muscles that I might need to respond quickly to a potential threat .
so basically , if this response happens inf@@ requ@@ ently : super @@@ -@@ @ necessary for my well @@@ -@@ @ being and survival .
now , let 's imagine for a moment that I was pregnant .
stress during pregnancy is linked with things like high blood pressure and low infant birth weight , and it can begin a casc@@ ade of health challenges that make birth much more dangerous for both parent and child .
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams , the person who pione@@ ered the tools that have proven these linkages , says that the more marginalized groups in our society experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health .
I became a dou@@ la , a lay person trained to provide support to people during pregnancy and childbirth .
in certain parts of the country , particularly the De@@ ep South , the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in Sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan African .
even nationally , black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women .
the solution is called , " The J@@ J Way . "
in what she calls her easy @@@ -@@ @ access clinics , Jenn@@ ie and her team provide prenatal care to over 600 women per year .
Jenn@@ ie 's waiting room feels more like your a@@ unt 's living room than a clinic .
their approach is casual and friendly .
during one visit I observed , Tr@@ ina chat@@ ted with a young soon @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ be mom while she took her blood pressure .
Jenn@@ ie says that Tr@@ ina and Alex@@ is are actually the center of her care model , and that her role as a provider is just to support their work .
one woman tex@@ ted to ask if a medication she was prescribed at the hospital was OK to take while pregnant .
another woman tex@@ ted with pictures of an infant born under Jenn@@ ie 's care .
this is a big departure from the traditional medical model , because it places responsibility and information back in the woman 's hands .
she 's been able to get almost all her clients to term with healthy , ch@@ un@@ ky babies like this one .
a similar demographic of women in Jenn@@ ie 's area who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did were three times more likely to give birth to a baby below a healthy weight .
well , you 'd be wrong .
they come from long hi@@ stories of racism , classi@@ sm , a society based on race and class str@@ ati@@ fication .
and during pregnancy , that buffer can be an incredible tool towards shifting the impact of racism for generations to come .
thank you .
but there was a crack in the wall , a problem with our industry , that I felt we needed to fix .
and of the stories that did make it , more than 80 percent of them were about us .
there were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008 that went to the war in Afghanistan .
we had drawn a blank , and it was@@ n 't just Iraq and Afghanistan .
if you were a Middle @@@ -@@ @ East specialist , you knew that Syria was that important from the start .
Syria is in@@ timately tied to regional security , to global stability .
we got passionate requests to do other things " De@@ e@@ ply . "
all of us in the tren@@ ches know that something is wrong with the news industry .
and the stati@@ stic you 're seeing up there is from September -- it 's argu@@ ably gotten worse .
we can do better as an industry , but it requires us recognizing how we got it wrong last time , and deciding not to go that way next time .
it 's a choice .
I do believe we can fix what 's broken .
post@@ war Kosovo was a very interesting place because NATO troops were there , mostly to make sure the war did@@ n 't break out again .
so I can tell you that when you go into one of these situations and settings , it is absolutely thr@@ illing ...
but the sense of vulnerability that I had was absolutely nothing in comparison to the vulnerability of the families that I got to know over that year .
are very complicated to answer .
questions about security , when you don 't have any security systems , are terri@@ fying .
" my sister , who is pregnant , is bleeding . what should I do ?
" if I need medications , where will I find them ?
and I , as a researcher , really wanted to get started on this problem right away .
these researchers concluded that the vast majority of death and disability from war happens after the cessation of conflict .
the first concern is about corruption , and the concern that people in these settings are corrupt and they are un@@ trust@@ worthy .
they have aggres@@ sively increased access to health care for the majority of the population .
they are rapidly improving the health status of the Afghan population , which used to be the worst in the world .
and that 's when we see doctors fleeing , when we see health resources drying up , when we see institutions cr@@ um@@ bling -- that 's the emergency .
I think we can match their courage with some support .
number three : we need to reach out and make new partnerships .
at our global health center , we have launched a new initiative with NATO and other security policy makers to explore with them what they can do to protect health system institutions during deployments .
then my big favorite is Ben Frank@@ lin , who did many things in terms of creating institutions , but was the mid@@ wife of our constitution .
they talked about building institutions to protect human security , for their generation and also for ours .
and I think our generation should do the same .
now , H@@ AL was a fic@@ tional character , but nonetheless he speaks to our fears , our fears of being sub@@ ju@@ gated by some un@@ feeling , artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity .
in many ways , this is a hard engineering problem with elements of AI , not some wet hair ball of an AI problem that needs to be engineered .
I 'm not building a H@@ AL .
this we are learning to do .
the next question you must ask yourself is , should we fear it ?
but , you may ask , what about ro@@ gue agents , some well @@@ -@@ @ funded non@@ government organization ?
and furthermore , it 's far more than just injecting an internet virus to the world , where you push a button , all of a sudden it 's in a million places and laptops start blowing up all over the place .
do I fear that such an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity ?
( la@@ ughter ) We are on an incredible journey of co@@ evolution with our machines .
how might I extend and enhance human life through cognitive healthcare ?
and that 's the exciting thing .
cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet .
and it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what 's going on on our planet , but what might be going on elsewhere in the cos@@ mos .
audience : chaos .
SB : must , at must . must , must .
you don 't need a designer , or a plan , or fore@@ sight , or anything else .
but that it will get copied if it can , regardless of the consequences .
a mem@@ e is not equivalent to an idea .
stick with the definition .
there 's one particular curious mem@@ e which I rather enjoy .
( la@@ ughter ) What is this all about ?
the mem@@ es are all trying to get copied -- trying , in in@@ ver@@ ted comm@@ as -- i.e. , that 's the shor@@ th@@ and for , if they can get copied , they will .
it always comes back , as Richard D@@ aw@@ kins complained all that long time ago , it always comes back to genes .
we 'll think we 're choosing these things , but the tem@@ es are making us do it .
that way , it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't matter if the planet 's climate was utterly de@@ stabilized , and it was no longer possible for humans to live here .
maybe we will , maybe we won 't .
I have no idea .
hi , I 'm an engineer and I make robots .
so let 's do that .
so they do really interesting things .
now , w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't it be great if you could use some of those characteristics in future robots so that you could solve some really interesting problems ?
well , let 's see if we can do that .
in fact , because we 're using the water boat@@ man as inspiration , and our robot sits on top of the water , and it rows , we call it the " R@@ ow @@@ -@@ @ bot . "
it has a body , and its body is made out of plastic , and it sits on top of the water .
it 's got a plastic body , but it 's got a soft rubber mouth here , and a mouth here -- it 's got two mou@@ ths .
so that 's the body .
the second component might be the stomach .
we need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution , so the pollution goes in , and it will do something .
I 'll put this down , and I 'll lift up the fuel cell .
and it really is a stomach because you can put energy in this side in the form of pollution , and it creates electricity .
if you choose the right micro@@ bes , the micro@@ bes will eat the algae .
here we 've got a couple of videos , the first thing you 'll see -- hopefully you can see here is the mouth open .
a typical cycle for the R@@ ow @@@ -@@ @ bot looks like this : you open your mouth , you move , you close your mouth and you sit there for a while waiting .
well , yes , we have shown that you can do this .
you can make robots which are bio@@ degra@@ dable .
what 's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these bio@@ degra@@ dable robots .
you can make a robot out of j@@ el@@ ly .
and then you sw@@ allow it .
thank you very much for your attention .
well , I 've already told you that white people own time .
since 2012 , conservative state legisl@@ atures across the US have ramp@@ ed up attempts to roll back African @@@ -@@ @ American voting rights by passing restrictive voter ID laws and cur@@ tailing early voting opportunities .
but now , in the name of urban renewal and progress , these communities are pushed out , in service of bringing them into the 21st century .
in other words : white people .
Africans were space @@@ -@@ @ tak@@ ers .
do black people have a future ?
but first , we have to decide that time belongs to all of us .
we can stop ste@@ aling time from black people through long periods of incarceration for non@@ violent crimes .
the police can stop ste@@ aling time and black lives through use of excessive force .
the current internet we are using is about g@@ ate@@ keepers .
and this happens every time you want to reach a website on the web .
but these g@@ ate@@ keepers are vulnerable to internet attacks and also makes the censorship and the surveillance easier .
this move creates much , much more powerful mid@@ d@@ lemen .
they don 't have to worry about maintaining the physical servers .
he then sent an internal email to his co@@ workers .
I wo@@ ke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet . "
so by using the decentralized web , we can help to keep content accessible for other visitors .
with the decentralized web , it 's not the government that decides what gets seen and what do@@ es@@ n 't .
for example , the European Parliament has a new law on the table , a new copyright protection law , that has a part called Article 13 .
if it passes , it would require every big website to implement a filter that automatically blocks content based on rules controlled by big corporations .
they 're removing everything from documentation of human rights abuses , lectures about copy@@ rights and search results that point to criticism of this new Article 13 .
now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger , but she 's not alone .
I study the psychology of good people , and research in my field says many of us care deeply about feeling like a good person and being seen as a good person .
and what if I told you the path to being better people just begins with letting go of being a good person ?
now , let me tell you a little bit about the research about how the human mind works to explain .
un@@ conscious bias is one place where we see the effects of b@@ ounded eth@@ ic@@ ality .
they leave us fighting for that good person identity .
we allow ourselves to get better .
luc@@ k@@ ily , the remaining square is 50 grams , and the minimum effective dose is 10 grams .
you 'll have to use a laser @@@ -@@ @ cutting tool to cut up the square ; every other means available to you is@@ n 't precise enough .
the full moon is rising , and in a moment someone will transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first .
both DG and CH look promising .
that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be as viable if the square had , say , 24 cut points , but with just 8 there are only so many reasonable options .
neither the question nor the answer are new in the Spanish language .
it is , because the Spanish language , in contrast to English , French or others , always strongly resisted writing words too differently to how we pron@@ ounce them .
we all went to school , we all invested big amounts of learning time , big amounts of pl@@ i@@ ant , child@@ like brain time in dic@@ tation , in the memor@@ ization of sp@@ elling rules filled , nevertheless , with exceptions .
this is true only for some levels of language .
so what happened ?
and to make matters worse , when we read the terms and conditions , we discovered the following , and I 'm going to need to take out my reading glasses for this one .
sub@@ conscious manipulation : companies can analyze your emotions based on your photos and ch@@ ats , targeting you with ads when you are at your most vulnerable .
essentially , you 're an assistant movie producer who does the un@@ gl@@ amor@@ ous work that goes into the creative aspect of producing a movie .
and I 'm embar@@ ras@@ sed to admit that I had the guy send me the script , and I read 30 pages before I was sure that it was as bad as I thought it was .
three hundred seventy @@@ -@@ @ seven million worldwide , 10 O@@ scar nominations and eight wins .
a ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee tells his story of living with the legendary pop star Michael Jackson .
but it is a script called " Bu@@ b@@ bles , " that is going to be directed by Tai@@ ka W@@ ai@@ ti@@ ti , the director of " Th@@ or : R@@ ag@@ nar@@ ok . "
and everyone has their method to address these problems .
and when you 're in tri@@ age , you tend to default to conventional wisdom about what works and what do@@ es@@ n 't .
in which case , my mother 's weekly phone calls , asking me if my law school entrance exam scores were still valid was something I should probably pay more attention to .
so I had to do something .
so late one night at my office , I made a list of everyone that I had had breakfast , lunch , dinner or drinks with that had jobs similar to mine , and I sent them an anonymous email .
send me a list of up to 10 of your favorite screen@@ plays that meet three criteria .
about a week into my time on vacation , I stopped by the hotel 's business center to check my email .
this was a pre @@@ -@@ @ iPhone world , after all .
and my first reaction , that I can 't actually say here , but will describe it as fear , the idea of surveying people about their scripts was certainly not a novel or a gen@@ ius one .
I was in my office , on Sun@@ set , and got a phone call from another writer 's agent .
now , that 's not the interesting part .
because this agent then told me , and I quote , " Don 't tell anybody , but I have it on really good authority this is going to be the number one script on next year 's Black List . "
after the call ended , I sat in my office , sort of st@@ aring out the window , altern@@ ating between shock and general g@@ id@@ d@@ iness .
and yes , " Sl@@ um@@ dog Mil@@ lion@@ aire . "
now , I think it 's really important that I pause here for a second and say that I can 't take credit for the success of any of those movies .
about 325 have been produced .
hundreds of writers from across the world have found representation , have had their work op@@ tioned or sold .
simply put , the conventional wisdom about screen@@ writing merit -- where it was and where it could be found , was wrong .
what does it mean for how we see ourselves and how we see the world and for how the world sees us ?
like many , I d@@ rank at an early age .
and I did -- a lot .
some w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't even utter the words .
we hear these stories , time and time again , on TV , online , we hear it from public officials , and we hear it from family and friends .
think about that .
but somehow people with addiction have to wait for treatment or often can 't get when they need it .
for too long our country felt like we could arrest our way out of this problem .
but stories don 't give everyone the same opportunity to appear within them , particularly not stories com@@ part@@ ment@@ alized in the form of American movies .
let 's take a look at really some problematic trends .
they do not match !
so , as soon as I recognized these patterns , I wanted to find out why , and it turns out that there are two drivers to inequality on @@@ -@@ @ screen : content creator gender and mis@@ perceptions of the audience .
more underrepresented -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Sor@@ ry .
more underrepresented characters in terms of race and ethnicity , and most importantly , more women working behind the camera in key production roles .
or is it ?
it 's actually not .
800 films , 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2015 , 8@@ 86 directors .
they perceive the traits of leadership to be mas@@ cul@@ ine in nature .
why ? because it makes sure that there 's women on set .
second solution is for A @@@ -@@ @ list talent .
because it ex@@ poses or introduces executives to female directors who otherwise fall prey to exclu@@ sionary hiring practices .
we need to make our voices heard and our dollars count .
none of us in this room have grown up or experienced a stor@@ yt@@ elling landscape with fully realized female characters , none of us , because the numbers haven 't changed .
well I 'm here to tell you today that it 's not only possible to change what we see on @@@ -@@ @ screen but I am imp@@ ati@@ ent for it to get here .
now , the SD@@ Gs are of course spectac@@ ularly complicated .
seventeen goals ranging from ending poverty to inclusive cities to sustainable fisheries ; all a comprehensive plan for the future of our world .
and everyone else is somewhere in between .
can we get there ?
maybe not surprising , but I 'll take a win .
and we find that Germany and Japan will get there or there@@ abouts .
but Canada , France , the UK and Italy are all going to fall short .
obviously , the US and Japan would be in that list , but we 've looked at them already .
see Bangladesh in the middle .
so how are we doing on this target ?
well , here we go ...
SD@@ G 1 on poverty , SD@@ G 5 on gender equality , SD@@ G 10 on inequality , SD@@ G 11 on inclusive cities and SD@@ G 16 on peace and justice .
so how are we doing on those issues ?
what on Earth is happening ?
Y@@ N@@ H : to some extent , yes .
for the first time in history , more people commit suicide than are killed by crime and terrorism and war put together .
ca : so some , I guess many liber@@ als out there view Trump and his government as kind of ir@@ rede@@ em@@ ably bad , just aw@@ ful in every way .
and nobody used that line .
so it 's not something we 'll need to think about in 20@@ 40 .
ca : ye@@ ah , no , absolutely .
ca : and those elites might not even be human elites .
it 's a very difficult problem , because in a world where people lose their ability to be employed , the only thing they are going to get is this basic income .
very few people are now willing to kill or be killed for Scottish or for British independence .
one of the things I know as a histor@@ ian is that you should never underes@@ timate human stup@@ idity .
but when you have a lose @@@ -@@ @ lose situation like with climate change , it 's much more difficult without some overarching authority , real authority .
there is a basic imbalance here .
Andrew Solomon : you 've talked a lot about the global versus the national , but increasingly , it seems to me , the world situation is in the hands of identity groups .
nationalism believes in a single , mon@@ oli@@ thic identity , and exclusive or at least more extreme versions of nationalism believe in an exclusive loyalty to a single identity .
sometimes nation@@ alists , for example , think that the nation is a biological entity .
it 's made of the combination of soil and blood , creates the nation .
people often conf@@ use intelligence and consciousness , especially in places like Sil@@ icon Valley , which is understandable , because in humans , they go together .
consciousness is the ability to feel things , to feel joy and sad@@ ness and bo@@ re@@ dom and pain and so forth .
so first step is , you go in that direction , expand .
I mean , for me , maybe the most important question , both as a scientist and as a person , is how to tell the difference between fiction and reality , because reality is there .
if it can suffer , it 's real .
if it can 't suffer , it 's not real .
a nation CA@@ N@@ NOT suffer .
my basic reaction as a histor@@ ian is : if this is the era of post @@@ -@@ @ truth , when the hell was the era of truth ?
it was incorporated into the charter of those organizations that the truth mat@@ tered .
there is nothing that -- I don 't know -- Joseph Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s , did@@ n 't know about all this idea of fake news and post @@@ -@@ @ truth .
and many view the election as the ultimate po@@ ke in the eye to anyone who believes in that .
and at the same time , biology tells us about Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens that we are social animals , but that we are social on a very , very local level .
so you must be very connected .
Y@@ N@@ H : I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair , and that we should realize that .
Y@@ N@@ H : I focus on the most dangerous possibilities partly because this is like my job or responsibility as a histor@@ ian or social cri@@ tic .
similarly , now , artificial intelligence and bio@@ engineering and all of that -- they don 't pre@@ determine a single outcome .
and many countries basically took out war from their political toolkit .
when she said that , it reminded me of summer camp .
the vision is to create a lit@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ free world .
so I started telling people what I was doing , and they started participating .
my two kids go to school right in that bull@@ se@@ ye .

and then they got su@@ ed by big tobacco , who claimed that collecting information with p@@ enc@@ ils and clip@@ boards is neither precise nor pro@@ vable .

the problem is , pe@@ ek @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ o do@@ es@@ n 't really work if I can 't see you , and my robot cou@@ ld@@ n 't see me .
the organizers decided to take participants on a tour of local start @@@ -@@ @ ups .
one of the start @@@ -@@ @ ups had a social robot , and they decided to do a demo .
well , we have to look at how we give machines sight .
computer vision uses machine learning techniques to do facial recognition .
this is a face . this is a face . this is not a face .
but don 't worry -- there 's some good news .
training sets don 't just materialize out of nowhere .
so there 's an opportunity to create full @@@ -@@ @ spectrum training sets that reflect a richer portrait of humanity .
police departments can currently look at these networks unregulated , using algorithms that have not been audited for accuracy .
so what can we do about it ?
so who codes matters .
and finally , why we code matters .
who codes matters , how we code matters and why we code matters .
my mother left school when she was 15 .
( appl@@ ause ) So I started a festival called W@@ O@@ W , Women of the World , seven years ago , and it 's now in 20 countries across five continents .
and one of those countries is Somaliland in Africa .
so I traveled there last year , and part of the joy I had in going there was going to these ca@@ ves .
the La@@ as Ge@@ el ca@@ ves .
these paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old .
that 's what art is for .
I thought it was a bit like me when I was a little girl .
and I thought , well , who painted this joy@@ ful , you@@ thful figure ?
men made these marks . women don 't . "
( la@@ ughter ) So I took my two children when they were little -- Carol@@ ine was eight and Rob@@ by was five -- to see " E.@@ T. "
so the children have a plot .
and then all of a sudden I realized : they we@@ ren 't children ; they were boys -- all boys .
and this is common .
bi@@ ologically speaking , are we not all , in this room , animals ?
this procedure dra@@ ins your blood and replaces it with a toxic , cancer @@@ -@@ @ causing form@@ al@@ de@@ hy@@ de .
and in that vacuum of information the media and the Internet -- that new digital street corner -- are educating our kids for us .
you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't stand for it .
but it was@@ n 't always that boys did@@ n 't want to .
according to research , about three @@@ -@@ @ quarters of college women remove their pu@@ bic hair -- all of it -- at least on occasion , and more than half do so regularly .
though , I kind of wondered if left alone on a desert island , if this was how they would choose to spend their time .
there 's a way that I think that this too is a sign .
Lab@@ ia@@ pl@@ ast@@ y , which is the trim@@ ming of the inner and outer lab@@ ia , is the fastest @@@ -@@ @ growing cosmetic surgery among teenage girls .
it rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015 , and whereas girls under 18 comprise two percent of all cosmetic surg@@ eries , they are five percent of lab@@ ia@@ pl@@ ast@@ y .
the most sought @@@ -@@ @ after look , incidentally , in which the outer lab@@ ia appear f@@ used like a cl@@ am shell , is called ...
young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own org@@ asm .
but absence of pain -- that 's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment .
then kids go into their pu@@ ber@@ ty education classes and they learn that boys have erec@@ tions and ejac@@ ulations , and girls have ...
and it 's worth considering how this is serving girls ; whether it 's keeping them safer from disease , coercion , betra@@ yal , assault .
and it 's worth asking young people : who 's really the more sexually experienced person ?
now I know that 's not enough .
but for all that , it has a lot of holes .
in Greek , there 's a word , " lac@@ he@@ si@@ sm " which is the hunger for disaster .
I 'm German myself , so I know exactly what that feels like .
but one of them I tried out was , " Well , a word is real if you want it to be real . "
I said , " No , it 's -- it 's pen@@ gu@@ in sh@@ it . "
it 's -- you know , today I 'd like to say it 's a zero billion dollar business , but , in fact , it 's negative .
but barbecue 's interesting , because it 's one of these cult foods like chil@@ i , or bou@@ ill@@ ab@@ a@@ is@@ se .
you would not believe it !
and you may be familiar with the movie " Contact , " which sort of popul@@ arized that .
she is ris@@ king her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever .
so , I like to support people that are ris@@ king their lives .
it 's true , some of them cause devastating disease .
within three weeks of applying the ph@@ ages , the chronic infection had healed up , where before , no antibio@@ tic was working .
to this day , I am fasc@@ inated by the medical potential of ph@@ ages .
the image that you see here was taken by an electr@@ on micro@@ scope .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , take a look at your hand .
because after all , ph@@ ages hun@@ t bacteria .
typically , a ph@@ age will only infec@@ t a single bacterial species .
so in this rendering here , the ph@@ age that you see hun@@ ts for a bacter@@ ium called St@@ ap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us , which is known as MR@@ SA in its drug @@@ -@@ @ resistant form .
first of all , the obvious one : yes , something was killing the bacteria , and it was in that liquid .
the other one : it had to be bi@@ ologic in nature , because a tiny drop was sufficient to have a huge impact .
after all , albeit invisible , you had something that reliably was killing bacteria .
and antibiotics really work very differently than ph@@ ages .
for the most part , they inhibit the growth of the bacteria , and they don 't care so much which kind of bacteria are present .
compare that to ph@@ ages , which work extremely narrowly against one bacterial species , and you can see the obvious advantage .
of course , today , we know that this is wrong .
and that 's what 's happening around the globe .
a number of clinical trials are getting underway in Europe and the US .
after all , a ph@@ age might one day save your life .
it 's the case of a four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old who had a progressively enlarging head , and as a result , had loss of developmental milestones , neuro@@ logic milestones , and the reason for this problem is here -- it 's called hydro@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ us .
but unfortunately in some children , there 's a block@@ age of this flow pattern , much like a traffic j@@ am .
but surge@@ ons have been quite creative about this , even our own .
we 've taken the simul@@ ator I just described to you , we 've brought it into the operating room at Boston Children 's Hospital , and these individuals -- these native teams , operative teams -- are doing the surgery before the surgery .
operate twice ; cut once .
ST@@ M 2 : can you lower it down to 10 ?
let me show you a moment of this .
and the baby has not yet been born .
imagine this .
and we did it two hours ago .
and at the end of the morning , before I went home , the teacher had us in a circle , and I actually found myself outside of the circle .
I felt every st@@ are , every gig@@ g@@ le , every pointed finger , not the finger , but every pointed finger , and I h@@ ated it .
and some you can see , like mine .
and so I 'm here to deb@@ un@@ k a myth .
I would not be where I am today if it was not for my family , my friends , my colleagues and the many str@@ angers that help me every single day of my life .
asking for help is a strength , not a weakness .
and we must look past the surface and be confronted with the truth that none of us are what you can see .
there 's more to us than that , and we 're all dealing with things that you CA@@ N@@ NOT see .
but we can do something better than that .
I should know because I was there on opening day .
Dan Bell : I love that so much .
I am hum@@ bled and so appreci@@ ative .
thank you very much .
these are the candidates from the recent presidential election in the tiny island nation of São Tom@@ é and Pr@@ í@@ n@@ cip@@ e , 199@@ ,000 inhabitants , off the coast of West Africa .
so why on earth would you want to vote in another country 's election ?
that 's not what we 're voting on .
but as I say , we don 't ask about domestic questions .
what role do you see it playing ?
his answers to those two questions were basically an 18 @@@ -@@ @ page dis@@ ser@@ tation on his view of Zambia 's potential role in the world and in the international community .
now , Savi@@ our won the global vote , but he did@@ n 't win the Zambian election .
well , obviously , the Donald and H@@ illary show is a bit of a difficult one to follow , but there are some other really important elections coming up .
clearly , the global vote is not a stand @@@ -@@ @ alone project .
and if you don 't like that responsibility , you should not be in power .
well , we all know people care deeply about what others think of them , that we try to be seen as generous and kind , and we try to avoid being seen as sel@@ fish or a mo@@ o@@ ch .
( la@@ ughter ) This teaches us an important lesson though .
what if I told you that the world 's dead@@ li@@ est infectious disease has a cure , in fact , that it 's had one for 70 years , a good one , one that works almost every time ?
it 's incredible , but it 's true .
it 's even worse when you consider the fact that there 's a terrible stigma , and you desper@@ ately don 't want people to find that you have the disease .
so it 's no surprise that people don 't complete treatment .
can our approach really help them ?
but unfortunately , not everywhere is that the norm , and there 's plenty of places where you can just stand on both sides and block the escal@@ ator .
the company OP@@ ower sends people in their electricity bill a small insert that compares their energy consumption with that of people with similarly sized homes .
and that 's it .
many of you are working on problems with important social consequences , and sometimes you might need to motivate people to do more good .
and these tools , they don 't require that you raise additional funds or that you develop any more fancy technologies .
they know that space very well .
I 'd say back to him , " No , it 's not . "
GC : no . I heard a lot of people that would say to me , " W@@ ow , I just wish he would shut up before the election .
they see the cho@@ king hold of government being thrown off in some way and they 're excited by that .
it was Bar@@ ry Gold@@ water versus George Mc@@ G@@ overn , and that was the debate we had been having for a generation .
on one side are those who have the tail@@ winds of globalization and the mer@@ it@@ oc@@ racy blowing at their back , and they tend to favor open trade , open borders , open social mo@@ res , because there are so many opportunities .
and it believes that wisdom and virtue is not held in individual conversation and civil@@ ity the way a lot of us in the enligh@@ tenment side of the world do .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : you are a card @@@ -@@ @ carrying member of the coastal elite , my man .
dB : ye@@ ah , I thought it was his best speech , and it took away the fre@@ ak@@ ish@@ ness of him .
ca : your reputation is as a conservative .
he 's certainly shown real engagement in a lot of what he promised to do , and there is a strong desire to change the system radically .
but politics is essentially a competition between partial tru@@ ths .
they pe@@ aked professionally at age 30 , and it 's all been down@@ hill since .
and then the sense a sense of the phrase " political correctness . "
the narrowing of debate is real .
will they call him out when things are not true , or will they just go along with it ?
so to me , it 's : how is the conservative media going to respond to it ?
they 're no longer the conservative media .
I mean , it 's one of the sc@@ ari@@ est things to people right now , that there is no agreement , nationally , on what is true .
that 's another ground@@ s@@ well kind of emo@@ tion that was going on in the middle of America and not being heard , in thinking that the mainstream media was biased .
to me , that is a very important distinction in this conversation .
so let 's just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media .
because I 'm just off@@ ended as being put in a box as a coastal elite as someone in Middle America is as being considered a fl@@ y@@ over state and not listened to .
if I 'm going to go to a school , I 'm going probably to school where the culture is liberal .
and that actually , at least for a number of years , when I started at National Review with William F. Buc@@ k@@ ley , it made us shar@@ per , because we were used to arguing against people every day .
( la@@ ughter ) No , I reject the category .
so if you are a Trump supporter , watch the other side for a day , because you need to come out of the bubble if you 're ever going to have a conversation .
ca : and so the internet is definitely contributing to this .
ca : that we have too many -- DB : immigrants in the country , especially from Britain .
and so there has been a genuine narrowing of what is permissible to say .
so , be a little more self @@@ -@@ @ suspicious of , are we doing that ?
I was told that every single day .
dB : I think you 're being too optimistic .
GC : right -- I was just going to say , until Twitter happens again .
how would you advise them to bridge or to relate to other people ?
GC : I would just start by saying that I really think any change and coming together starts from the top , just like any other organization .
is he going to do that ? I have no idea .
but I think that everything starts from the top , and the power that he has in encouraging his supporters to have an understanding of where people are coming from on the other side .
( la@@ ughter ) This quest took me months .
( la@@ ughter ) And then I would thank the people who made the asph@@ alt for the pa@@ vement .
I decided to call my project " Than@@ ks a Th@@ ous@@ and . "
( la@@ ughter ) You know what it is -- pre@@ ca@@ ffe@@ ination .
so I thanked E@@ d .
and this idea of sav@@ oring is so important to gratitude .
psychologists talk about how gratitude is about taking a moment and holding on to it as long as possible .
( la@@ ughter ) But can you do that while keeping your hands on the wheel ?
the bean is actually inside this fruit called the coffee cher@@ ry .
and that we should resist the temptation to retreat into our si@@ los .
we 'll be so , " Oh , everything 's wonderful , I 'm so grateful . "
it reminded me that what I take for granted is not available to millions of people around the world .
like water .
and I 'm not expecting the Nobel Prize committee to kno@@ ck down my door , but it 's a baby step , it 's a little something .
it could be anything .
and you don 't have to go around the world , you can just do a little gesture , like make eye contact or send a note to the designer of a logo you love .
being aware of the thousands of people involved in every little thing we do .
and when it comes to numbers , especially now , you should be skep@@ tical .
what makes this claim different is it do@@ es@@ n 't come from a private company , it comes from the government .
among supporters of President Trump it 's even higher ; it 's about 7 out of 10 .
on the one hand , there are those who say these statistics are crucial , that we need them to make sense of society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes and measure progress in an [ objective ] way .
this is a problem .
the draft law says that government money should not be used to collect data on racial segregation .
this is a total disaster .
if we don 't have this data , how can we observe discrimination , let alone fix it ?
so I started to feel really determined that the one way to make numbers more accurate is to have as many people as possible be able to question them .
my job is finding these data sets and sharing them with the public .
let 's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeav@@ or .
we don 't use decimal places to describe the temperature .
how on earth can predic@@ ting the behavior of 230 million voters in this country be that precise ?
what I did was I started taking real data sets , and turning them into hand @@@ -@@ @ drawn visu@@ al@@ izations , so that people can see how im@@ precise the data is ; so people can see that a human did this , a human found the data and visu@@ alized it .
this is -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) a bad shot to show in February .
facts like injustice and inequality leave a huge mark on our lives .
facts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells that are smaller than the size of an average parking space .
so let 's say you hear a claim like , " The average swimming pool in the US contains 6.@@ 23 fec@@ al accidents . "
that do@@ es@@ n 't mean every single swimming pool in the country contains exactly 6.@@ 23 tur@@ ds .
and I just spent one evening re@@ distributing po@@ op .
so you can kind of see how misleading averages can be .
if someone asks you , " How much pe@@ e is a lot of pe@@ e ? "
OK , so the third and final question that I want you guys to think about when you 're looking at statistics is : how was the data collected ?
when I want to check a number like that , I 'll start off by finding the original questionnaire .
there 's no way of knowing if those people even identified as Muslim .
they 're civil servants .
you just keep checking everything .
fl@@ ames were p@@ ouring out , smoke was in the air and it looked like our wooden deck was about to catch fire .
my mom was f@@ rea@@ king out , my d@@ ad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a Sn@@ ap@@ chat video .
drink a cup of coffee ?
well , those Sty@@ ro@@ foam coffee cups are sure going to add up .
so why do we have these gh@@ ost accum@@ ulations of Sty@@ ro@@ foam waste ?
well , simply put , recycled poly@@ sty@@ rene is too expensive and potentially contaminated , so there is very little market demand for Sty@@ ro@@ foam that has to be recycled .
what if we could make the impossible possible ?
we were so ready to give up .
we then proceeded to receive funding from the N@@ STA 's e@@ C@@ Y@@ B@@ ER@@ MI@@ SSION S@@ TEM @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ Action program sponsored by the US Army , as well as FIR@@ ST Global Innovation Awards sponsored by X@@ PR@@ I@@ Z@@ E .
and using these funds , we plan to file a full patent on our process and to continue to work on our project .
if you look at it and focus on the white , what you see is a world full of angels .
but let 's look more deeply , and as we do , what appears is the dem@@ ons , the de@@ vil@@ s in the world .
it also means " the morning star , " in some scrip@@ ture .
and apparently , he dis@@ o@@ bey@@ ed God , and that 's the ultimate dis@@ obedience to authority .
and so Lu@@ ci@@ fer des@@ cen@@ ds into hell , becomes Satan , becomes the devil , and the force of evil in the universe begins .
so , this arc of the cosmic transformation of God 's favorite angel into the De@@ vil , for me , sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good , ordinary people into perpetrators of evil .
evil is the exercise of power .
and that 's the key : it 's about power .
it 's the few bad apples , the few ro@@ gue soldiers . "
and it all happened in a single place , Ti@@ er 1 @@@ -@@ @ A , on the night shift .
let 's go down to that dun@@ ge@@ on .
that 's one of the visual illustrations of evil .
this is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
and so we 're interested in what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel ?
and it 's a dynamic inter@@ play .
when it gets up to here , there 's " XXX " -- the pornography of power .
two thirds go all the way to 450 vol@@ ts .
and look at this .
and secondly , we know there 's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners .
in some cultures , they go to war without changing their appearance .
and it happens when you 're in a new or un@@ familiar situation .
so social and psychological research reveals how ordinary , good people can be transformed without the drugs .
they had to put him in hiding , because people wanted to kill him , and then his mother and his wife .
I did@@ n 't know it was out of control . I was totally indifferent .
to be a hero , you have to learn to be a devi@@ ant , because you 're always going against the conformity of the group .
and I want to end with a known story about W@@ es@@ ley Au@@ tre@@ y , New York subway hero .
he 's black , the guy 's white , and he 's got two kids .
this is what I 'm supposed to naturally be able to do .
you know what else is ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily ancient ?
and nobody expects us to start out being good at it .
I 'm talking to you , job creators and collective bargaining units , and workers , and shareholders .
environments or ec@@ ologies , or communities where there 's high risk of infectious disease , breast milk can be incredibly protective .
and he started telling me that the rats , like humans , l@@ ick their pu@@ ps in very different ways .
so then I was thinking to myself : is this magic ?
so how can this work ?
are there going to be a lot of cats and sn@@ akes around , or will I live in an upper @@@ -@@ @ class neighborhood where all I have to do is behave well and proper , and that will gain me social acceptance ?
and now one can think about how important that process can be for our lives .
we inherit our DNA from our ancestors .
it evolved during evolution .
so this is good .
but is true only for rats ?
so if a poor child develops a certain property , we don 't know whether this is caused by poverty or whether poor people have bad genes .
so gene@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts will try to tell you that poor people are poor because their genes make them poor .
so we moved to look into our cou@@ sins , the mon@@ keys .
and when they were old , they were completely different animals .
these are Day @@@ -@@ @ 14 mon@@ keys , and what you see here is the modern way by which we study ep@@ ig@@ ene@@ tics .
and here 's a visual presentation of this .
the genes that got less meth@@ yl@@ ated are green .
and what 's interesting is that the mon@@ key number one is much healthier than mon@@ key number four .
then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time by cue , the colors of the c@@ age when they saw cocaine .
and they go crazy .
they will press the lever to get cocaine until they die .
so what did we learn about DNA ?
you 're , like , watching a movie of your life , with the DNA , with your remote control .
but the question was : what were they made of ?
pop this one back on .
and my field 's a bit unusual , because it crosses between curi@@ osity @@@ -@@ @ driven research and technology with real @@@ -@@ @ world applications .
but it 's the combination of those two things that gets me really excited about what I do .
I mean , the idea s@@ ounded ridic@@ ulous .
or , take these X @@@ -@@ @ rays .
and that uses a particle acceler@@ ator .
the first ones we developed let us split the atom .
we 'd actually learned how to control these particles .
eventually , we got to huge ring @@@ -@@ @ like machines that take two beams of particles in opposite directions , squee@@ ze them down to less than the width of a hair and sm@@ ash them together .

in fact , here I show one of the highest resolution images ever taken of the moon from Earth .
this data is then processed in a lab right here in Massachusetts .
if we had teles@@ cop@@ es located everywhere on the globe -- in other words , the entire disc@@ o ball -- this would be tri@@ vial .
we 'd probably want the model to say it 's pretty unlikely that someone would post this noise image on the left , and pretty likely that someone would post a sel@@ fi@@ e like this one on the right .
one way we can try to impose different image features is by using pieces of existing images .
it still amaz@@ es me that although I began this project with no background in astro@@ physics , what we have achieved through this unique collaboration could result in the very first images of a black hole .

we 're convinced that kids don 't need our help , that they " know everything " about technology .
and when I come back late , they say , " No , you need to be home at the time we said . "
it sounds absurd , right ?
technology forces us to re@@ think the relationship between adults and kids .
it 's impossible to find an answer without doing new things -- things that make us uncomfortable , things we 're not used to .
a lot of you may think it 's easy for me , because I 'm relatively young .

when I started my career , many believed that it was simply about racial differences in income and education .
stri@@ k@@ ingly , some of the effects are observed at a very young age .
one explanation for this pattern was a phenomenon that 's called " implicit bias " or " un@@ conscious discrimination . "
there is institutional discrimination , which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions .

this is what my last week looked like .
what I did , who I was with , the main sens@@ ations I had for every wa@@ king hour ...
I was a teen@@ ager in Italy .
we had all of the hard data we could think of -- just like the p@@ und@@ its before the election -- but what is the point of all these numbers ?
they 're always the means to an end .
we became much more in tune with ourselves , much more aware of our behavi@@ ors and our surroundings .
but I 'm asking you to consider data -- all kind of data -- as the beginning of the conversation and not the end .
short @@@ -@@ @ ter@@ m@@ ism , for many reasons , has per@@ v@@ aded every no@@ ok and cran@@ ny of our reality .

it requires us to push into it .

I recently heard this ly@@ ric by Leon@@ ard Co@@ hen : " ring the bel@@ ls that still can ring .
and each time I tried to read those books called " the femin@@ ist classi@@ cs , " I 'd get bo@@ red , and I really struggled to finish them .
gender matters everywhere in the world , but I want to focus on Nigeria and on Africa in general , because it is where I know , and because it is where my heart is .
we do a great dis@@ service to boys on how we raise them ; we sti@@ f@@ le the humanity of boys .
in fact , it had not occurred to me to be worried because a man who would be intim@@ idated by me is exactly the kind of man I would have no interest in .
the language of marriage is often the language of ownership rather than the language of partnership .
we teach females that in relationships , compromise is what women do .
we teach girls that they CA@@ N@@ NOT be sexual beings in the way that boys are .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I mean , the loss of vir@@ g@@ inity is usually a process that involves ...
( la@@ ughter ) Because the sad truth is that when it comes to appearance we start off with men as the standard , as the norm .
I 've actually ban@@ ished it from my clos@@ et , by the way .
I actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men .
because I 'm female .
two months ago , my kids and I h@@ ud@@ dled around a cell phone watching the live stream of the Game Awards , one of the video game industry 's biggest nights .
every night , I told them more of the story , but I never let the story end .
fortunately , I never did have to finish that bed@@ time story .
we 'd all prefer to win , but when you discover that you can 't win , what do you value instead ?
maybe you 're a little surprised by our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through a video game .
but when our hearts break , they heal a little differently .
the school of architecture that I studied at some 30 years ago happened to be across the street from the wonderful art gallery designed by the great architect Louis Ka@@ hn .
and it was the way he did it , the expression on his face -- something touched me .
I could see it , and I remember thinking , " W@@ ow . how does architecture do that ? "
and it touched me to the core .
and I loved this idea of the inner and the outer , like when you see someone and you say , " That person is radi@@ ant . "
you can imagine also that movement within a circle could mean movement and sti@@ ll@@ ness , like the cos@@ mos , something you see in many places .
and then we ended up with this .
so here you see the structure .
but it was the third surprise that was most ...
surprising .
she looked weak and fra@@ il , and I guess physically she probably was , but emo@@ tionally , cogn@@ i@@ tively , psych@@ ologically , she was among the tough@@ est people I 've ever met .
and I 'd heard all that before .
we 'll see our function decline , some of us will see our cogn@@ ition decline , we 'll be no longer able to care for ourselves , to do the things that we want to do .
how do they do it though ?
education from the fol@@ ks behind the counter , but also education from fol@@ ks in the waiting room .
those waiting rooms really are a hi@@ ve of interaction , advice and support .
that should be ba@@ ked into the way that healthcare is delivered .
but we can learn from them , and we have to learn from them .
thank you .
I wanted to explore strange new worlds .
but I also learned that the universe is strange , wonderful and vast , actually too vast to be explored by spac@@ eship .
now , that is local dust that 's obsc@@ uring the light of the stars .
there 's cars going by .
there is a technique .
this is a light called syn@@ chro@@ tr@@ on radiation , and it 's formed from electr@@ ons spir@@ aling around cosmic magnetic fields .
and here we are deploying them across the desert .
it 's al@@ ight with syn@@ chro@@ tr@@ on radiation , and thousands of do@@ ts are in the sky .
our large Mag@@ el@@ lan@@ ic Cl@@ oud , our nearest gal@@ actic neighbor , is orange instead of its more familiar blue @@@ -@@ @ white .
the colors in this image tell us about the physical processes going on in the universe .
it 's been a long @@@ -@@ @ standing mystery to astronom@@ ers where all the super@@ no@@ va remnants are .
but it continued for so long because scientists and engineers at government agencies in the state of Michigan and in the federal government did not follow federal regulations for treating the water right .
just consider this email that an EPA employee wrote , where she goes , " I 'm not so sure F@@ lin@@ t is a community we want to go out on a lim@@ b for . "
what they 're doing is inviting us into what psychologists call shared reality .
so exactly as I described , right at the beginning , potential solutions were captured from everywhere .
at this point , they all look the same , they have no separate identity .
or a series of op @@@ -@@ @ eds for and against a big idea that don 't tell you where the writers worked .
our public conversations , even our private disagreements , can be transformed by deb@@ ating ideas , rather than discussing identity .
for and against compulsory voting .
and that exercise f@@ lips a kind of cognitive switch .
it has precedent .
but on the other side of that table , we need many , many , many more Senator Past@@ ores .
to explain to me and to each other what it would take to change their minds .
once you start thinking about what it would take to change your mind , you start to wonder why you were quite so sure in the first place .
and we should bring it to our workplaces , our conferences , our city council meetings .
to stop dis@@ missing and to start persu@@ ading .
( la@@ ughter ) It was my first time eating Nigerian " j@@ ol@@ l@@ of . "
my doctor asked if I 'd like to speak with a mental health professional about my stress and anxiety .
the first time I heard " mental health , " I was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from Ghana , at the Ped@@ die School in New Jersey .
we all know this man .
" drugs !
( la@@ ughter ) Come down with pneum@@ onia , and your mother will rush you to the nearest hospital for medical treatment .
according to the World Health Organization , mental health is about being able to cope with the normal stres@@ sors of life ; to work produc@@ tively and fruit@@ fully ; and to be able to make a contribution to your community .
mental health includes our emotional , psychological and social well @@@ -@@ @ being .
even worse , we have a severe shortage of psychi@@ atri@@ sts in Africa .
as a result , we suffer in sol@@ itude , sil@@ enced by stigma .
but few cited other known causes of mental illness , like gene@@ tics , socioeconomic status , war , conflict or the loss of a loved one .
photo@@ journalist Rob@@ in Ham@@ mond has documented some of these abuses ...
I heard the whis@@ pers .
I stood by his side as his community isolated him , but our love never wa@@ vered .
we need to see mental health as important as physical health .
talk to your friends .
talk to your loved ones .
speak up if you 're struggling .
being honest about how we feel does not make us weak ; it makes us human .
it is time to end the stigma associated with mental illness .
think of me .
how do groups get anything done ? right ?
I 'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples , but always pointing to the broader themes .
and what I want to call your attention to is not the Mer@@ ma@@ id Par@@ ade itself , charming though it is , but rather to these photos .
and the answer is : I got them from Fl@@ ick@@ r .
delicious is a social book@@ marking service .
to draw those people into some pre@@ arranged structure that has explicit goals .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
so , the head of the curve can be shar@@ per or flat@@ ter .
many , many institutions are still in denial , but we 're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining .
and you can see why , from Ball@@ mer 's point of view , that 's a bad idea , right ?
journalism was an answer to an even more important question , which is , how will society be informed ?
now , when the larger group is a bun@@ ch of drun@@ ks , and the small group wants to stay so@@ ber , then we think , that 's a great support group .
and institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure , and the more rig@@ idly managed , and the more they rely on information monopolies , the greater the pressure is going to be .
we were on the highway , and I took the wrong exit .
but for that , I also had to give of myself .
I had to have the strength to let him go , which was extremely difficult .
there is no need to be an expert nor do anything heroic to include someone .
that was my life .
the big hom@@ ey told me this : money rules the world and everything in it .
soon after , I committed my first crime , and it was the first time that I was told that I had potential and felt like somebody believed in me .
nobody ever told me that I could be a lawyer , doctor or engineer .
she still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that .
everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted , the drug dealers , the rob@@ bers , the blood bank .
and this old man said , " He@@ y youn@@ g@@ ster , you pick stocks ? "
he gave me this brief description of what stocks were , but it was just a g@@ lim@@ pse .
so at 20 years old , I did the hardest thing I 'd ever done in my life .
but little did I know I was receiving the greatest gifts I had ever dre@@ amed of : self @@@ -@@ @ worth , knowledge , discipline .
( la@@ ughter ) He said , " Let me get some . " I said , " N @@@ -@@ @ O. No . "
and then at 22 , feeling myself , feeling confident , I remembered what the O@@ G told me .
I wanted to find these rich white fol@@ ks .
as I fur@@ thered my career in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest , I soon learned that I had to take responsibility for my own actions .
true , I grew up in a very complex environment , but I chose to commit crimes , and I had to own up to that .
sports Il@@ lu@@ str@@ ated said that over 60 percent of N@@ BA players and N@@ FL players go broke .
how in the world were members of society going to help incarcer@@ ated individuals back into society if they cou@@ ld@@ n 't manage they own stuff ?
our access to justice , our social status , living conditions , transportation and food are all dependent on money that most people can 't manage .
at 60 ?
I co@@ founded a program that we call Financial Empowerment E@@ mo@@ tional Literacy .
a financially sound incarcer@@ ated person can become a tax@@ paying citizen , and a financially sound tax@@ paying citizen can remain one .
and let 's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum that gets to the heart , the heart of what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is .
I could walk my daughter to school , I could go out to dinner with my husband ; I could fo@@ ol people .
my nurse , Jo@@ anne , walked in the door , and every bone in my body was telling me to get up out of that chair and take for the hills .
and in that moment she said the one thing I had overlooked , and that was that at some point , my life would get back to normal .
Brid@@ get was born in Cameroon , the oldest of four children .
this is J@@ ason Short .
he talked about his experience of being a nurse in Germany and taking care of the soldiers coming right off the battlefield .
you 've already given enough , brother . "
Bri@@ an is both a nurse and a soldier who 's seen combat .
so that puts him in a unique position to be able to relate to and help heal the veterans in his care .
and before we left , she went into the room of a dying patient .
we 're going to need all the help we can get .
and then they knew how long to leave me in the room with my mother after she died .
thank you so very much .
they trained special libr@@ arians .
so they started this mighty enterprise to reform public schools by improving these libraries .
so you have three options , pick any of the three .
what I wanted to do was dis@@ pel the idea that these were mu@@ sty old libraries , the kind of places that everyone is bo@@ red with , you know , not your grand@@ parents ' library .
Don 't worry about that at all .
I 'm well Red .
( la@@ ughter ) I really loved this idea , and I somehow was not focused on the idea that libr@@ arians as a class are sort of interested in sp@@ elling and I don 't know .
just call it , one last try , a library .
then -- this is because I 'm cle@@ ver -- move that into the " i , " make it red , and there you have it , the Library Initiative .
" here 's your logo . put it off to the side . "
so everything was going sw@@ im@@ mingly .
then I got a call from one of the architects , a guy named Richard Le@@ wis , and he says , " I 've got a problem .
and so he said , " But can 't you think of anything ? "
we had Raf@@ ael E@@ squ@@ er do these great sil@@ hou@@ et@@ tes .
he would work with the kids , asking for words , and then based on those promp@@ ts , come up with this little , deli@@ rious kind of con@@ stell@@ ation of sil@@ hou@@ et@@ tes of things that are in books .
and eventually there were going to be 60 of these libraries , so we probably got to see maybe half a dozen in one long day .
solidarity , however , is not an automatic mechanism .
the " you " is always a real presence , a person to take care of .
each and every one of us is ir@@ replaceable in the eyes of God .
it is like some invisible ye@@ ast that allows the whole d@@ ough to grow , that brings flavor to all aspects of life .
a single individual is enough for hope to exist , and that individual can be you .
ten@@ derness means to use our eyes to see the other , our ears to hear the other , to listen to the children , the poor , those who are afraid of the future .
a child 's love for mom and d@@ ad grows through their touch , their gaz@@ e , their voice , their ten@@ derness .
God himself des@@ cended into Jesus to be on our level .
if you don 't , your power will ru@@ in you , and you will ru@@ in the other .

8 : 00 : result This can vary between stories .
how about assistance ?
that 's how stage f@@ right works .

after all , there 's not much you can do with it .
a hundred dollar bill is printed by the government and designated as official currency , while other pieces of paper are not .
as with any other workout , disciplined , structured practice in playing music strengthens those brain functions , allowing us to apply that strength to other activities .
or could it be that people who go into music were already s@@ mar@@ ter to begin with ?
I really believe he will have an answer for the first . "
but power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics .
this is the use of law and bureaucracy to compel people to do or not do certain things .
norms don 't have the centralized machinery of government .
they can certainly make people change behavior and even change laws .
think about how norms around marriage equality today are evolving .
these are the six main sources of power , what power is .
so if you are@@ n 't taking action , you 're being acted upon .
politics is the work of harnessing that flow in a direction you prefer .
policy is power frozen .
law number three : power compounds .
Gay and lesbian couples seek the legal right to marry .
your challenge is to learn how to read power and write power .
understand why it turned out this way , who 's made it so , and who wants to keep it so .
read so you may write .
this question is@@ n 't about strategy .
this is a great help when mig@@ rating or en@@ countering other potentially hostile ele@@ ph@@ ants .

this is the size of the brain relative to what we 'd expect for an animal 's body size , and the ele@@ phant 's E@@ Q is nearly as high as a ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee 's .
sleep occupies nearly a third of our lives , but many of us give surprisingly little attention and care to it .
well , not so fast .
it turns out that sleep is also crucial for your brain , with a fifth of your body 's circul@@ atory blood being chann@@ eled to it as you drift off .
this consolidation occurs with the help of a major part of the brain , known as the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus .
for example , memories that are formed in times of heightened feeling , or even stress , will be better recorded due to the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus ' link with emo@@ tion .
sleep is composed of four stages , the deepest of which are known as slow @@@ -@@ @ wave sleep and rapid eye movement .
EE@@ G machines monitoring people during these stages have shown electrical impul@@ ses moving between the bra@@ inst@@ em , hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , thal@@ am@@ us , and cor@@ te@@ x , which serve as relay stations of memory formation .
so based on the studies , going to sleep three hours after memor@@ izing your formulas and one hour after practicing your scales would be the most ideal .

fertil@@ ization can occur by one of two techniques .
in the first , the eggs are incub@@ ated with thousands of sperm and fertil@@ ization occurs naturally over a few hours .
the second technique maxim@@ izes certainty of fertil@@ ization by using a needle to place a single sperm inside the egg .
common convention is to transfer the embry@@ o three days after fertil@@ ization , when the embry@@ o has eight cells , or on day five , when the embry@@ o is called a bl@@ ast@@ ocy@@ st , and has hundreds of cells .

so if we know that micro@@ management is@@ n 't really effective , why do we do it ?
is it that the definition is wrong ?
we actually asked hundreds of people around the country -- hundreds of managers across the country -- do you want to hire d@@ ull and un@@ imagin@@ ative people ?
well , interesting results as well .
and if you 're really good at that , what happens after that ?
at this point in time , we started doing things that actually we@@ ren 't part of our core mission and people started failing at it .
so how does she keep turning ?
between each turn , the dan@@ cer pa@@ uses for a split second and faces the audience .

imagine you 're watching a run@@ away trolley bar@@ rel@@ ing down the tracks straight towards five workers who can 't escape .
that track has a worker on it , too , but just one .
what do you do ?
this is the trolley problem , a version of an ethical dilemma that phil@@ os@@ op@@ her Philipp@@ a Fo@@ ot devised in 1967 .
do we pick the action with the best outcome or stick to a moral code that prohibits causing someone 's death ?
these judgments are consistent with the philosophical principle of util@@ it@@ ari@@ anism which argues that the morally correct decision is the one that maxim@@ izes well @@@ -@@ @ being for the greatest number of people .
but in this case , only about 10 % of people say that it 's OK to throw the man onto the tracks .
the dilemma in its many variations reveal that what we think is right or wrong depends on factors other than a logical weighing of the pro@@ s and cons .
so are people who watch a com@@ edy cli@@ p before doing the thought experiment .
but new technology is making this kind of ethical analysis more important than ever .
type 1 has extreme high@@ s alongside the lows , while Type 2 involves brief@@ er , less extreme periods of el@@ ation inter@@ s@@ pers@@ ed with long periods of depression .
type 1 's extreme high@@ s are known as man@@ ic episodes , and they can make a person range from feeling irrit@@ able to inv@@ inci@@ ble .

G@@ K : she knows you .
do you feel guilt about that ?
do you feel joy in that ?
S@@ W : we were always brought up to be super@@ close , and we are incredibly close .
not only her .
G@@ K : so before a big match , the two of you don 't get together and say , look , we 're going to go out there and -- there 's nothing ?
I started taking pictures of her , which is totally inappropriate , but she was so mad at me .
S@@ W : well , it 's interesting , and I 'm glad you brought that up .

by mid @@@ -@@ @ stage Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's , we have massive inflammation and t@@ angles and all @@@ -@@ @ out war at the syn@@ ap@@ se and cell death .
now let 's look at your DNA .
but what happens if you short@@ change yourself on sleep ?
many scientists believe that poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predic@@ tor of Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's .
a single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in am@@ y@@ lo@@ id beta .
and am@@ y@@ lo@@ id accumulation has been shown to disrupt sleep , which in turn causes more am@@ y@@ lo@@ id to accumulate .
but you might not be .
it has to do with ne@@ ural plas@@ ticity and cognitive reserve .
the average brain has over a hundred trillion syn@@ ap@@ ses , which is fantastic ; we 've got a lot to work with .
and this is@@ n 't a static number .
every time we learn something new , we are creating and strengthening new ne@@ ural connections , new syn@@ ap@@ ses .
you know that Lis@@ a Gen@@ ova wrote " S@@ till Al@@ ice , " and that 's the only thing you know about me .
you have that single ne@@ ural connection , that one syn@@ ap@@ se .

take this for another example .

but how meaningful is that truth if you don 't know why it 's being revealed to you ?
this is a network composed of minds inter@@ acting with computers and devices .
and above all , you must have the courage to un@@ fl@@ in@@ ch@@ ingly pursue the truth .
I ask myself that frequently .
we 're trying to di@@ g a hole under LA , and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion .
ca : how much ?
em : 200 kilometers an hour , or about 130 miles per hour .
the deepest mines are much deeper than the t@@ all@@ est buildings are tall , so you can alleviate any arbitrary level of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network .
this is a very important point .
ca : but people -- seen traditionally , it 's incredibly expensive to di@@ g , and that would block this idea .
well , they 're right .
so it 's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the subway extension in LA .
so ye@@ ah , it 's quite difficult to di@@ g tunnels normally .
I think we need to have at least a ten@@ fold improvement in the cost per mile of tun@@ n@@ eling .
em : actually , if you just do two things , you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement , and I think you can go beyond that .
I think you can get at least a factor of two , maybe a factor of four or five improvement on top of that .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : you want to beat G@@ ary .
ca : but a lot of people imag@@ ining , dre@@ aming about future cities , they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars , d@@ ron@@ es , etc .
obviously , I do rockets , so I like things that fly .
let 's just say that if something 's flying over your head , a whole bun@@ ch of flying cars going all over the place , that is not an anxiety @@@ -@@ @ reducing situation .
things like that .
is there a tie @@@ -@@ @ in here with Hy@@ per@@ loop ?
could you apply these tunnels to use for this Hy@@ per@@ loop idea you released a few years ago .
and it actually ends up being the biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Had@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der , by volume .
and looking at tun@@ n@@ eling technology , it turns out that in order to make a tunnel , you have to -- In order to seal against the water table , you 've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmos@@ p@@ heres .
so to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere , or near @@@ -@@ @ vacuum .
em : so , ye@@ ah .
you 're going under a lot of buildings and houses , and if you go deep enough , you CA@@ N@@ NOT detect the tunnel .
( la@@ ughter ) EM : what 's funny about that ?
ca : you 've called it a hob@@ by .
em : ye@@ ah , exactly .
ca : you started T@@ es@@ la with the goal of persu@@ ading the world that electri@@ fication was the future of cars , and a few years ago , people were laugh@@ ing at you .
em : OK .
obviously the Model 3 is coming soon .
ca : OK , we 're going to come to this .
so Model 3 , it 's supposed to be coming in July @@@ -@@ @ ish .
one of the things that people are so excited about is the fact that it 's got autop@@ il@@ ot .
ca : there 's obviously autop@@ il@@ ot in Model S right now .
em : ye@@ ah , so this is using only cameras and GPS .
if you don 't solve vision , it 's not solved .
so that 's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision ne@@ ural net that 's very effective for road conditions .
like , you can probably do it ten times better than humans would , just cameras .
so it 's not sort of limited to LA to New York .
em : ye@@ ah , I drove it around the parking lot , and I was like , this is crazy .
em : ye@@ ah , we 're starting off with two , two initially , and the second two will be introduced early next year .
em : I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof .
em : ye@@ ah , so that 's the G@@ ig@@ a@@ factory , progress so far on the G@@ ig@@ a@@ factory .
I think we should talk for -- Ac@@ tually , global market .
you do not send your aircraft to Bo@@ eing in @@@ -@@ @ between flights .
the thrust level of this is really -- This configuration is about four times the thrust of the Satur@@ n V moon rocket .

ca : as one does . em : ye@@ ah .
our internal targets are more aggressive , but I think -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) CA : OK .
like , why do you want to live ?
and this feels like a distr@@ action .
you shou@@ ld@@ n 't be thinking about this .
and to be fair , you 've done a fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy .
it 's like a bran@@ ching stream of prob@@ abilities , and there are actions that we can take that affect those prob@@ abilities or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing .
if there was no T@@ es@@ la , if T@@ es@@ la never existed , it would have to happen out of necessity .

and in the past few years , I myself have paid over 500 dollars in late fines .
there are reasons like responsibility .

there 's even another library in Wisconsin that offers scratch @@@ -@@ @ off tickets at their counter , so you can scratch off and get 10 or 20 percent off your fines that day .
and there are amnesty days .
that same day , they received more than 700,000 items that were overdue .
now that can still be a lot of money .
so that our front@@ line staff is standing there , talking to people about their fines , sometimes arguing with people about fines .
or at the very least , we would be able to real@@ locate our staff time to pursu@@ its that better fit those missions we talked about .
thank you .
in 1956 , a documentary by Jacques Cou@@ ste@@ au won both the Pal@@ me d '@@ Or and an O@@ scar award .
and despite this , there is no place on Earth that I would rather be than the Arctic , especially as days leng@@ then and spring comes .
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater sound@@ scape .
we are , in effect , with climate change , conducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet .
over the past 30 years , areas of the Arctic have seen decreases in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks to four months .
that is the time of year when the Arctic is navig@@ able to vessels .
those of us who e@@ av@@ es@@ drop on the oceans for a living use instruments called hydro@@ phones , which are underwater micro@@ phones , and we record ambient noise -- the noise all around us .
and what are the new sounds that they are producing doing to the sound@@ scape underwater ?
just this past summer , a massive cruise ship made its way through the Nor@@ thwest Pass@@ age -- the once @@@ -@@ @ my@@ th@@ ical route between Europe and the Pacific .
and all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space over which Arctic marine mammals can communicate .
and in retro@@ spec@@ t , considering all the noise we are creating in the oceans today , perhaps it really was " The Silent World . "
I looked on the table but all I found was a circular co@@ aster , on which I wrote the lines my teacher dictated .
in each place , they 've given it a different name , and set it to different music .
for those of you with head@@ phones on -- I see that some of you are listening to the translation -- please take them off for a minute .

I wrote the first one having only recently learned how , and it has some errors in terms of meter , so it 's not pres@@ en@@ table in its current state .
I had just returned from doing a concert in Israel , and I was very emotional over a problem that hits really close to home , which is the Israeli @@@ -@@ @ Palestinian conflict .

we learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions .
Paul did@@ n 't want a ventil@@ ator and CPR .
and I learned that when we approach it together , we get to decide what success looks like .
( la@@ ughter ) It was so shoc@@ king and heart@@ breaking ...
some people don 't want to know how long they have left , others do .
either way , we never have those answers .
families can struggle with those conversations , but for us , we also found that information immen@@ sely helpful with big decisions .
the things is , we deal with them , too .
but doctors can 't make sure your wishes are respected until they know what they are .
that 's true at the end of life and for medical care throughout our lives .
what medical care will help you live the way you want to ?
our job is@@ n 't to fight fate , but to help each other through .
not as soldiers but as shepher@@ ds .
but there 's some people I would like to see killed , but I 'm against the death penalty .
when it 's the right kind of violence , we love it .
and there 's another compl@@ ication , which is , in addition to us being this mis@@ er@@ ably violent species , we 're also this extra@@ ordinarily al@@ tru@@ istic , comp@@ assi@@ onate one .
and this brings us into the realm of a brain region called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
and thus , adoles@@ cence and early adul@@ thood are the years where environment and experience s@@ cul@@ pt your fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x into the version you 're going to have as an adult in that critical moment .
but pushing back even further , even further back to childhood and fe@@ tal life and all the different versions that that could come in .
but pushing even further back , back to when you were just a fe@@ tus , back to when all you were was a collection of genes .
genes and environment interact , and what 's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger reflects your lifetime of those gene @@@ -@@ @ environment interactions .
now , remarkably enough , we 've got to push even further back now , back centuries .
for example , ecosystems change .
he landed his helicopter in between some surviving villagers and American soldiers and he trained his machine guns on his fellow Americans , and said , " If you don 't stop the killing , I will mo@@ w you down . "
what we have here is the opposite of it .
it also covers the forces that govern how particles move , interact , and bind together to give shape to the world around us .
zo@@ oming in on the fragments of the cup , we see molecules , made of at@@ oms bound up together .
a molec@@ ule is the smallest unit of any chemical compound .
it was the first Standard Model particle ever discovered .
this remains a mystery .
inter@@ acting with this field is how all the fundamental matter particles acquire mass , according to the Standard Model .
it 's the feedback of the system of the planet telling us what 's going on .
the problem is global warming , provoked by the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases caused by human activity .
eighty already exist today , and when taken together , those 80 can achieve drawdown .
these are solutions that are viable , scal@@ able and financially feasible .
now , when we think about climate solutions , we often think about electricity generation .
now , before going into some details of specific solutions , you may be won@@ dering how we came to these calculations .
and we chose a conservative approach , which under@@ lies the entire project .
this is a family on a straw island in Lake Ti@@ tic@@ aca receiving their first solar panel .
and we need to re@@ think how we produce our food to make it more regener@@ ative .
that means we don 't need to cut down forests for food production .
the top solutions would take us far along the path@@ way , but there 's no such thing as a small solution .
a plant @@@ -@@ @ rich diet , reduced food waste results in a healthy global population with enough food and su@@ sten@@ ance .
protecting our ecosystems also protects biodiversity and safeguards planetary health and the oxygen that we breathe .
we need to re@@ think our global goals , to move beyond sustainability towards regeneration , and along the way reverse global warming .
and it 's a story that did work . it did happen , and the machines are all around us .
and this is V@@ on Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n and Mor@@ gen@@ stern , who wrote the " The@@ ory of Games . "
this is a letter from the director , concerned about -- " especially unfair on the matter of sugar . "
then they switched to a magnetic drum .
this includes a large amount of human error .
so , he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running , let alone having , you know , software problems .
" Code error , machine not guilty . "
" IBM machine putting a tar @@@ -@@ @ like substance on the cards . the tar is from the roof . "

if you 're a mathemati@@ cian , you get that , because Mar@@ ston was a mathemati@@ cian who objected to the computer being there .

that was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the Institute .
so it 's almost exactly -- it 's 50 years ago next Tuesday , I guess .
and he published it . it was@@ n 't locked up and disappeared .
you have a geno@@ type and you have to have a phen@@ o@@ type .
every time there was a new , fast machine , he started using it , and saw exactly what 's happening now .
and he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lif@@ eli@@ ke , or a new kind of life .
it just was another version of the same thing happening .
and could you do it again now ?
and the question is , should we run them or not ?
you know , could we get them running ?
do you want to let it loose on the Internet ?
these machines would think they -- these organisms , if they came back to life now -- whether they 've died and gone to heaven , there 's a universe .
he was thinking far ahead , to how this would really grow into a new kind of life .
and that 's what 's happening !
we 've been doing that since , you know , since we started P@@ CR and synthe@@ sizing small strings of DNA .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's when my friends , Chris and Jul@@ ie@@ t called me here to speak about the future " you . "
as a matter of fact , everything I did@@ n 't say or do also met with the same fate .
( che@@ ers ) It really did .
with this face .
I will do anything to defend myself against interference with this objective that I have been given . "
if you want to remember one thing , it 's that you can 't fet@@ ch the coffee if you 're dead .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's very simple . just remember that . repeat it to yourself three times a day .
but we might not be so lucky .
there are three principles involved .
so here 's a PR@@ 2 robot .
so that 's the first and second principles right there .
there 's all kinds of things you don 't want the robot doing .
but in fact , it do@@ es@@ n 't quite work that way .
this is clearly following my wife 's values which is " Happy wife , happy life . "
and the robot sees the cat .
so to summarize : I 'm actually trying to change the definition of AI so that we have pro@@ v@@ ably beneficial machines .
so imagine that you have a self @@@ -@@ @ driving car and you want to send your five @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old off to preschool .
thank you so much for that talk . that was amazing .
they moderate our climate .
but I 'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean , the sea@@ water pH goes down .
now in Ireland , scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification -- scientists at the Marine Institute and NU@@ I Gal@@ way .
but why should we care ?
so ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain -- and right onto our dinner plates .
or many other fish species whose food source in the ocean could be affected ?
we will see acidification .
you 're barely passing .
across the country , many schools are starting around 7 : 30@@ am or earlier , despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high school start no earlier than 8 : 30@@ am .
around the time of pu@@ ber@@ ty , teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock , which determines when we feel most awa@@ ke and when we feel most sle@@ ep@@ y .
I can 't think straight , I 'm irrit@@ able , and I probably shou@@ ld@@ n 't be driving a car .
but this is how many American teenagers feel every single school day .
for many te@@ ens batt@@ ling chronic sleep loss , their go @@@ -@@ @ to strategy to compensate is consuming large quantities of ca@@ ffe@@ ine in the form of ven@@ ti fra@@ p@@ pu@@ c@@ cin@@ os , or energy drinks and shots .
so essentially , we 've got an entire population of tired but wired youth .
( la@@ ughter ) Who am I to contradict my baby girl ?
it may even be better .
this has been the curse of every international climate negotiations , including Paris .
finally , we have the partisan barrier .
that means every market transaction is based on incorrect information .
and these benefits would be significant .
assuming a carbon tax rate that starts at 40 dollars per ton , a family of four would receive 2,000 dollars per year from the get @@@ -@@ @ go .
this illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution based on free markets and limited government .
do@@ es@@ n 't that sound like something we could all support ?
one by one the domin@@ oes fall .
let 's take China as an example .
well , nothing could do more to ha@@ sten that transition than giving every Chinese citizen a monthly dividend .
all we need is a country to lead the way .
and there are three reasons why , which I 'll go through real quickly .
in fact , we 're finding a number of For@@ tune 100 companies supporting our program .
if it stays in Paris , as many are pushing for in the administration , well then that be@@ gs a question : what 's the plan ?
we have the plan .
our Secretary of State will be asking other countries for NATO contributions , and they 'll be saying , " No , give us our Paris commitment .
so , international , business and even the Republican base will all be calling for a Republican replacement plan .

now , there are some skep@@ tics that believe that art just belongs in an art museum .
they believe that it has no practical use beyond its aesthetic value .
who was l@@ ur@@ king ?
now , instinc@@ tively , crime scene investigators look for what is apparent , but this detec@@ tive did something different .
it illustrates that finding hidden connections in everyday objects can res@@ onate so deeply .
and don 't mis@@ understand me , I 'd eat that dou@@ gh@@ nut in a minute .
the poor borrow more , save less , smoke more , exercise less , drink more and eat less health@@ fully .
why ?
well , the standard explanation was once summed up by the British Prime Minister , Marg@@ aret Th@@ at@@ cher .
some of you may believe that the poor should be held responsible for their own mistakes .
if we could just change them , if we could just teach them how to live their lives , if they would only listen .
and to be honest , this was what I thought for a long time .
it turns out that people behave differently when they perceive a thing to be scarce .
so the long @@@ -@@ @ term perspective goes out the window .
eventually , it free@@ zes -- not because it 's a bad computer , but because it has too much to do at once .
the poor have the same problem .
a recent analysis of 201 studies on the effectiveness of money @@@ -@@ @ management training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all .
but it 's not enough .
I still remember sitting there , per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ed .
the big question is , of course : what can be done ?
we could help the poor with their paper@@ work or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills .
but I 'm afraid that brand of left @@@ -@@ @ wing politics you 've got in Amsterdam -- it do@@ es@@ n 't exist in the States . "
what it is ?
could it really be that simple ?
for three years , she subjected the data to all manner of statistical analysis , and no matter what she tried , the results were the same every time : the experiment had been a res@@ ounding success .
when it comes to poverty , we , the rich , should stop pre@@ tending we know best .
( appl@@ ause ) Because , I mean , the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self @@@ -@@ @ appointed experts think they need .
I believe that a basic income would work like venture capital for the people .
just look at the cost of child poverty in the US , for example .
but let 's talk about the ele@@ phant in the room .
how could we ever afford a basic income guarantee ?
this means that your income is top@@ ped up as soon as you fall below the poverty line .
you could actually eradicate poverty .
nowadays , millions of people feel that their jobs have little meaning or significance .
a recent poll among 2@@ 30,000 employees in 142 countries found that only 13 percent of workers actually like their job .
it 's like Bra@@ d Pit@@ t says in " Fight Club , " " To@@ o often we 're working jobs we hate so we can buy sh@@ it we don 't need . "
if they stopped working , we 'd be in trouble .
here we are .
in and out it went , and with every stroke , one by one , my class@@ mates stopped concentrating on their reading and started looking at me .

and then , when it was sure everybody was looking at us , in its final show and official introduction , I had my first full @@@ -@@ @ blown seizure , which was the beginning of what has been a 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ long affair .
this story begins in 1985 , when at age 22 , I became the World Ch@@ ess Champ@@ ion after beating Anatoly Kar@@ pov .
( la@@ ughter ) Mach@@ ines were weak , and my hair was strong .
and this competitive rhetoric is standard now .
people are being replaced as if they had van@@ ished from the Earth .
nobody re@@ members that I won the first match -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) In Philadelphia , before losing the re@@ match the following year in New York .
I was Mt . E@@ ve@@ rest , and De@@ ep Blue reached the summit .
no , no it was@@ n 't , at least not in the way Al@@ an T@@ uring and other founders of computer science had hoped .
but even at the incredible speed , 200 million positions per second , De@@ ep Blue 's method provided little of the dre@@ amed @@@ -@@ @ of insight into the myster@@ ies of human intelligence .
soon , machines will be taxi drivers and doctors and professors , but will they be " intelligent ? "
what really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines .
I immediately sen@@ sed something new , something un@@ settling .
these were human doubts , human fears , and the only thing I knew for sure was that my opponent De@@ ep Blue had no such worries at all .
what I learned from my own experience is that we must face our fears if we want to get the most out of our technology , and we must conqu@@ er those fears if we want to get the best out of our humanity .
advanced Ch@@ ess found its home on the internet , and in 2005 , a so @@@ -@@ @ called freestyle chess tournament produced a revelation .
the winners were a pair of amateur American chess players operating three ordinary PCs at the same time .
but unlike in the past , when machines replaced farm animals , manual labor , now they are coming after people with college degrees and political influence .
eventually , every profession will have to feel these pressures or else it will mean humanity has ceased to make progress .
machines have calculations .
we have understanding .
machines have instructions .
we have purpose .
instead , we should worry about what they still CA@@ N@@ NOT do today , because we will need the help of the new , intelligent machines to turn our grand@@ est dreams into reality .
our humanity is not defined by any skill , like sw@@ inging a ham@@ mer or even playing chess .
thank you .
T@@ MD : 60,000 is a lot of people , so if you can imagine me and Van@@ essa inspiring 60,000 women to walk with us last year , we were fired up .

I 'm sha@@ king a little bit .

82 percent of Black women are over a healthy weight right now .
we took our message directly to the streets , and women responded .

do you call it -- do they blo@@ om ?
T@@ MD : and I 'll bring us back to this moment and why it 's so important for my dear , dear friend Van@@ essa and I.

I 'd once had my hopes crushed in a war , but because of them , I had a chance to pursue my dream to become a doctor .
but nurses and doctors are concentrated in cities , so rural communities like Mus@@ u 's have been left behind .
Mus@@ u was 48 when I met her .
what if we could invest in her with real training , equip her with real medicines , and have her have a real job ?

in December 2013 , something happened in the rain@@ forests across the border from us in Guinea .
and it was@@ n 't until three months later that the world recognized this as Ebola .
community members across Liberia learned the symptoms of Ebola , te@@ amed up with nurses and doctors to go door @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ door to find the sick and get them into care .
and we know that the great majority of these deaths are happening in these 75 blue @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ aded countries .
if we could help these countries scale , we could save millions of lives , and at the same time , we could create millions of jobs .
or when you drink a little too much at a party , just out of anxiety .
or when you ove@@ reat because your feelings are hurt , or whatever .
and that 's what I look at with my photographic work .
this is an image I just recently completed , that is -- when you stand back at a distance , it looks like some kind of neo @@@ -@@ @ Gothic , cartoon image of a factory spe@@ wing out pollution .
and as you get all the way up close , you realize that it 's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups .
and if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life , that 's the size it would be .
so , I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms , and in the actual print of this piece , each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge .
and so , this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes .
and do you remember the response ?
it rever@@ ber@@ ated around the world , and will continue to rever@@ ber@@ ate through time .
and the day after that , another 1,100 Americans died from smoking .

now , art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hur@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ bur@@ ly of politics in my daily work at the AC@@ L@@ U , but not anymore .
it was almost like the old master was ta@@ unting me .
Si@@ ena 's political leaders , who would literally govern under the eyes of these alleg@@ or@@ ical figures , were Lo@@ ren@@ ze@@ tti 's intended audience .

fraud , with the fl@@ igh@@ ty wings of a bat .
she uses a car@@ pen@@ ter 's saw to cho@@ p her body in half .
and F@@ ury wi@@ elds the weapons of the mob , the stone and knife .
that 's what we do .
( appl@@ ause ) CA : Anthony , you spoke to so many of us so power@@ fully .
( la@@ ughter ) The point of telling you all this is that -- for me this is what it feels like to have an idea .
and there 's always a component of surprise to wonder , so we 're not just looking for good ideas , we 're looking for good ideas that surprise us in some way .
you think of an idea .
.@@ 99 to the 130@@ th power is ...
but really think about that .
how many parts of your lives are 99 percent reliable ?
like that is -- that thing is going to work , right ?
so what we do is we try to identify some place where there might just be a ton of those un@@ tried ideas .
let 's try to make to@@ ast with a laser cu@@ tter .
so this may seem to you like testing , but it really is@@ n 't , because at this point we don 't yet know what our idea is , we don 't have a plan to be testing .
so we 're just -- we 're just playing , we 're just trying everything we can think of , because we need to get this idea space filled up with a chaos like the one in my high school bedroom .
it was like my play@@ space was 400 lines long and 25 columns wide -- which I pre@@ sume that if anybody is going to understand that , it 's this crowd .
and there 's no known cure .
it was actually doctors in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern Brazil who first noticed , just a year ago , after a Z@@ ika outbreak , that there was a peak in the incidence of micro@@ ce@@ ph@@ aly .
researchers at the nearby Yellow Fe@@ ver Research Institute identified an unknown virus in a mon@@ key in the Z@@ ika forest which is how it got its name .
there was an outbreak that affected fully 75 percent of the population .
getting vacc@@ inated is not an option , because there is@@ n 't a vaccine yet and there probably won 't be for a couple of years .
the protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that kill people as well as bugs .
these are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua .

it 's just not the sort of place you really want to just hang out and chat .
public spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons .
new coatings make it change mood in the shifting light .

many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on , but it 's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out .
then there 's co@@ vert attention .
right ?
in this case , not surprisingly , we saw that these fl@@ ick@@ ering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming from the back of their head , which is responsible for the processing of your visual information .
the filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention , which is missing in some people , for example in people with AD@@ HD .
so a person with AD@@ HD CA@@ N@@ NOT inhibit these distr@@ actors , and that 's why they can 't focus for a long time on a single task .
but what if this person could play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer , and then train his own brain to inhibit these distr@@ actors ?
we can use these cognitive brain @@@ -@@ @ machine interfaces for many other cognitive fields .
he could understand everybody , but there was no way to respond , even not writing because he was illiterate .

the challenge of looking at nature 's designs -- and I 'll tell you the way that we perceive it , and the way we 've used it .
well , many bi@@ ologists will tell engineers , and others , organisms have millions of years to get it right ; they 're spectacular ; they can do everything wonder@@ fully well .
( la@@ ughter ) And you can absolutely never , absolutely never , because of history and the inherited plan , start with a clean s@@ late .
it 's a beautiful model . let 's look at the mathematics .
whereas nature tends to be small , and cur@@ ved , and it ben@@ ds and t@@ wi@@ sts , and has legs instead , and ap@@ pend@@ ages , and has many muscles and many , many sensors .
this is a collaboration we have with Stan@@ ford .
here 's what some of you did this morning , although you did it outside , not on a t@@ read@@ mill .
this is an eight @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged scor@@ pi@@ on , six @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged ant , forty @@@ -@@ @ four @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged centi@@ pe@@ de .

questions mix with fear and erup@@ t like bile in my throat .
" share ? "
this moment , more than any other , lit a fire beneath my husband P@@ at and me .
in addition , the lack of sharing that we experienced was pervasive .
researchers compe@@ ted with each other because the ecosystem was designed to reward competition rather than to alleviate suffering .
we realized that we would have to do work on this condition ourselves to find solutions for ourselves and others like us .
the second barrier : researchers don 't share .
through all this , we lived with fear .
fear of researchers , so well cred@@ enti@@ aled and positioned in a world made for them .
fear that the n@@ ay@@ sa@@ yers were right and the cats would simply find a new food .
I need to face my personal fears .

because what we don 't talk about is how the handful of people working at a handful of technology companies through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today .
if you see a notification , it schedules you to have thoughts that maybe you did@@ n 't intend to have .
when we talk about technology , we tend to talk about it as this blue sky opportunity .
and I want to get serious for a moment and tell you why it 's going in a very specific direction .
YouTube wants to maximize how much time you spend .
so the internet is not evolving at random .
and they invented a feature called Sn@@ ap@@ st@@ rea@@ ks , which shows the number of days in a row that two people have communicated with each other .
so it 's not even like they 're having real conversations .
because outra@@ ge do@@ es@@ n 't just schedule a reaction in emotional time , space , for you .
it 's only accountable to maximizing attention .
so you can target , you can precisely target a lie directly to the people who are most susceptible .
I don 't know a more urgent problem than this , because this problem is under@@ ne@@ ath all other problems .

or we get an un@@ planned failure while I 'm actually flying around .
she was sent to start a new life in a new country on her own at the age of 12 .
these are not people moving to another country to get a better life .
many of you will know this picture .
her parents were Palestinian refugees living in the Y@@ arm@@ ou@@ k refugee camp outside Damascus .
she was born to refugee parents , and now she 's a refugee herself in Lebanon .
she 's working for the International Rescue Committee to help other refugees , but she has no certainty at all about her future , where it is or what it holds .
the future " you " is about your duties to str@@ angers .
that means they cross a border into a neighboring state .
the average length of displacement is 10 years .
it 's called D@@ ad@@ a@@ ab .
it was built in 1991 @@@ -@@ @ 92 as a " temporary camp " for Somalis fleeing the civil war .
that 's why I say that this refugee crisis is a trend and not a bli@@ p .
but half of the world 's refugee children of primary school age get no education at all , and three @@@ -@@ @ quarters of secondary school age get no education at all .
solution number three : most refugees are in urban areas , in cities , not in camps .
the most vulnerable refugees need to be given a new start and a new life in a new country , including in the West .
what happens is they take risky journeys .
we can 't say we don 't know what 's happening in Juba , South Sudan , or Aleppo , Syria .
it 's also revealing about whether we know our own history .
tra@@ sh the protections of refugees , and we tra@@ sh our own history .
what they mean is what we stand for is more important than the bombs we drop .
and there 's one other thing it reveals about us : whether we have any hum@@ ility for our own mistakes .
and when I was teen@@ ager , I asked my a@@ unt , " Can you take me to meet Mon@@ si@@ e@@ ur Maur@@ ice ? "
in the months following the 2009 presidential election in Iran , protests erupted across the country .
my parents , who emig@@ rated to the United States in the late 1960s , spend substantial time there , where all of my large , extended family live .
to share this information with you , I wore one of the early consumer @@@ -@@ @ based EE@@ G devices like this one , which recorded the electrical activity in my brain in real time .
it 's hardly the most sophisticated neuro@@ imaging technique on the market .
this is extraordinary .
already , using one of these devices , an ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tic can know they 're going to have an ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tic seizure before it happens .
a US @@@ -@@ @ based company has developed a technology to emb@@ ed these sensors into the head@@ rest of automo@@ bil@@ ies so they can track driver concentration , distr@@ action and cognitive load while driving .
that we will trade our brain activity for reb@@ ates or discounts on insurance , or free access to social @@@ -@@ @ media accounts ...
workers are even sent home if their bra@@ ins show less @@@ -@@ @ than @@@ -@@ @ stell@@ ar concentration on their jobs , or emotional ag@@ itation .
what would 've happened during the Iranian Green Movement if the government had been monitoring my family 's brain activity , and had believed them to be sympa@@ thetic to the protesters ?
this is exactly why our bra@@ ins need special protection .
instead , we should be focusing on securing rights and remedies against the misuse of our information .
but what if the Iranian government had used brain surveillance to detect and prevent the protest ?
the number of deaths from terrorism went up 150 percent .
are there new ways of thinking about how we can rise to meet these aspirations ?
they actually met in New York City and got married in New York City .
at the age of 19 , he left his family in the northern part of the country , escaped through the border and never saw his family again .
their aspirations went up .
they understood what it was like to live in a place like New York City in the 1950s .
and at the time , the aspirations of the World Bank Group , the organization I lead now , were extremely low for Korea .
so the situation is Korea is in a tough position , my parents have seen what life is like in the United States .
and they felt that in order to give us an opportunity to reach their aspirations for us , we had to go and come back to the United States .
for people who have the great privilege of studying medicine and anthro@@ pology -- I had come from parents who were refugees .
Paul grew up literally in a bus in a sw@@ amp in Florida .
this is my very first visit to Haiti in 1988 , and in 1988 , we elaborated a sort of mission statement , which is we are going to make a preferential option for the poor in health .
we were reading everything and we had to come to a conclusion of how are we going to structure our work ?
I recognized them .
and the people that we fought with were the World Health Organization and probably the organization we fought with most was the World Bank Group .
a few months of medicines , and this is what he looked like .
and we argued with the World Bank .
what we hear about is job loss . you 've all heard that .
our own data suggest to us that two thirds of all jobs , currently existing jobs in developing countries , will be lost because of automation .
that 's what we want to do .
now , what are we going to do ?
78 trillion dollars is the size of the global economy .
that 's a negative interest rate bond .
that 's what we need , and we need that from all of you .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you . thank you .

so we will help you do that . we will make the introduc@@ tions .

I visit the future for a living .
but this work is not about predictions .
let 's imagine we are living in a city with d@@ ron@@ es like this one .
we call it The n@@ igh@@ tw@@ at@@ ch@@ man .
we don 't connect with that future " us . "
so now let 's go to that future where this lawsuit is unfolding , and meet the defendant , Ar@@ n@@ old Man@@ n .
how on earth did Ar@@ n@@ old manage to do that ?
but what about what we can 't avoid ?
insects ? pig@@ e@@ ons ? fo@@ xes ?
people usually contract bacterial men@@ ing@@ itis by breathing in tiny particles of m@@ uc@@ us and sali@@ va that spray into the air when an infected person s@@ nee@@ zes or cou@@ gh@@ s .
this triggers inflammation as the body 's immune response kic@@ ks into over@@ drive , bringing on fever and intense head@@ aches .
that increases the chance of organ shut down -@@ -@@ and alongside spreading sep@@ tic@@ emia , threatens death .
so fast treatment , or better yet , prevention , is critical .
in addition , ceme@@ teries all over the world are reaching capacity .
back in architecture school , I was thinking about all this , and I set out on a plan to re@@ design death care .
and I was like , " MM@@ MM . "
mortality com@@ posting is where you take an animal high in nitrogen and cover it with co @@@ -@@ @ com@@ posting materials that are high in carbon .
( la@@ ughter ) So basically , all we humans need to do is create the right environment for nature to do its job .
I began designing a system based on the principles of livestock mortality com@@ posting that would take human beings and transform them into soil .
over the next few weeks , the body decom@@ poses naturally .
( appl@@ ause ) Who 's thinking about l@@ emon mer@@ in@@ gue pi@@ e right now ?
we want to bring back the aspect of ritual that 's been diluted over the past hundred years as cre@@ mation rates have risen and religious affiliation has declined .
we want to help individuals , organizations , and down the road , municipalities design and build facilities in their own cities .
this pilot program has allowed us to demonstrate that it 's possible to harness the incredible power of natural decom@@ position to turn human bodies into soil , and we 're working with other universities as well .
but I always thought it would get better , that no one could force me to leave , no one could take my home away from me .
I b@@ ounced around from state to state and eventually ended up in North Carolina .
" why do they hate us ? "

( la@@ ughter ) But when I got to prison , it soon became apparent that my background was very different to that of most of the prisoners .
how can we help prisoners to stay in contact with their families ?

and prisoners often cry .
once the recording is finalized , it 's transferred to a CD or a DVD and sent out to the families so that the children can watch them whenever they feel the need .

the first thing is in the West we 've stopped telling this story of who we are and why , even in America .
so when you tell a story and your identity is strong , you can welcome the stranger , but when you stop telling the story , your identity gets weak and you feel threatened by the stranger .
I think collectively we 've got to get back to telling our story , who we are , where we came from , what ideals by which we live .
I had@@ n 't realized this would be such a universal phrase .
to remind you : there are a billion people on this planet who live with absolutely no infrastructure : no roads , no electricity and thus , no health care .
in 2013 , on a field trip to detect sch@@ i@@ st@@ os@@ om@@ ia@@ sis with Fol@@ d@@ sc@@ opes , I made a minor observation .
you separate components of blood or body fluids to be able to detect and identify path@@ ogens .
and of course , they don 't work without power .
how many of you have played with this as a k@@ id ?
if I was to stick you right here and have it spin , you would think about the types of forces you would experience .
here is a little lan@@ ce@@ t .
I 'm going to draw a little more blood .
and now that 's sealed the sample .
and you see the object starts sp@@ inning .
it goes back and forth , back and forth ...
it 's called ab@@ u@@ z@@ z -- the idea that all of you could help us fight mosqu@@ it@@ oes ; you could all help us track our enemies .
( la@@ ughter ) We can record these acoustic signatures from mosqu@@ it@@ oes .
I caught some mosqu@@ it@@ oes outside .
using a f@@ lip phone , we mapped one of the largest acoustic databases with 25 to 20 species of mosqu@@ it@@ oes that carry human path@@ ogens .
and we hope that science is going to provide the answer .
but before you leave this theatre today , I want you to promise one thing .
we 're going to make science accessible -- not just to the people who can afford it , but a billion others who can 't .
and these two conditions define me .
what is that responsibility ?
but neutrality won 't necessarily lead me to the truth .
life is much more complicated , and I believe journalism should reflect that very complexity .
for example : what happens if you 're called to cover a dictatorship , like Aug@@ us@@ to Pin@@ och@@ et 's regime in Chile or F@@ ide@@ l Castro 's in Cuba ?
to me it seemed like a brilliant idea to expose the president , but to my b@@ oss -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) My b@@ oss did@@ n 't think it was such a great idea .
not only did I resign from television , but I had also decided to leave my country .
and I survived with what little I had .
so I did what any other repor@@ ter would have done : I wrote him a letter by hand requesting an interview , and I sent it to his Tower in New York .
( la@@ ughter ) But I learned two things .
I would confront the candidate and show that he was wrong , that what he said about immigrants in the US was not true .
less than three percent have committed a serious crime , or " fel@@ ony , " as they say in English .
Donald Trump : who 's next ? yes , please .
you CA@@ N@@ NOT deny citizenship to children in this country .
J@@ r : it 's not about you -- Man : get out of my country !
one member of his ent@@ oura@@ ge , as if he had been given permission , said , " Get out of my country , " not knowing that I 'm also a US citizen .
neutrality helps only the op@@ pres@@ sor , never the victim . "
basically , we journalists should be on the opposite side from those in power .
so I 'm not looking to make a good impression or to forge a connection .
it 's a pretty exciting place to live .
but I want to share with you guys today my perspective as a ge@@ ologist in how understanding earth 's past can help inform and guide decisions that we make today about how to sustainably live on earth 's surface .
what happened is the KO@@ SI River jumped its banks , and for reference , the scale bar here is 40 miles .
these are sort of bigger jum@@ ps that we 've been talking about .
so this was a pretty warm time and it happened really ab@@ rup@@ tly .
this yellow blo@@ b here , this is actually a fossil river , so just like this cartoon I showed , these are deposits that were laid down 55 million years ago .
eventually , the rivers rever@@ ted back to a state that was more similar to what they would have looked like before this climate event , but it took a long , long time .
in fact , there 's a school quite near Sil@@ icon Valley called the Wal@@ dorf School of the Peninsula , and they don 't introduce screens until the eighth grade .

the problem is , 5 and 6@@ pm looks different on different days .
we don 't know how they 're going to react as the planet he@@ ats up , and hidden in that uncertainty might be hope .

and others are literally more ch@@ ill .
these low , thick clouds are extremely effective sun@@ sh@@ ades .
they turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us .
that 's because high clouds live in the upper reaches of the atmosphere , where it 's very cold .
right now , these two effects -- they don 't cancel out .
but remember , clouds are so important in regulating the earth 's temperature , and they both warm and cool the planet .
if global warming triggers cloud changes that make for a less powerful greenhouse or a more effective sun@@ sh@@ ade , then that would enhance the cooling power of clouds .
I see everybody from the Pacific Nor@@ thwest is like , " I have some suggestions for you . "

in the story I 'm going to tell you , our conscious experiences of the world around us , and of ourselves within it , are kinds of controlled hall@@ uc@@ inations that happen with , through and because of our living bodies .
but people no longer think that .
( distorted voice ) OK , so what 's going on here ?
( la@@ ughter ) Now I 'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self , the specific experience of being you , is also a controlled hall@@ uc@@ ination generated by the brain .
and there are experiences of being a continuous and distinctive person over time , built from a rich set of memories and social interactions .
well , just the same principles apply .
so experiences of having a body are deeply grounded in per@@ cei@@ ving our bodies from within .

but I had a lot of data , and I was very confident about my insights , so I was very excited to share them with Nokia .
we 're looking outside of market dynamics so that we can get ahead of it . "
well , you know what happened to Nokia ?
but Nokia 's not alone .
once you predict something about human behavior , new factors emerge , because conditions are constantly changing .
it 's very easy just to slip into silver @@@ -@@ @ bullet thinking , as if some simple solution existed .
well , those were the temple guides , and they worked hand in hand with the or@@ acle .
you get to also work with data that h@@ as@@ n 't been collected .
( la@@ ughter ) So Net@@ f@@ li@@ x was like , " Oh . this is a new insight . "
and once they verified it and validated it , Net@@ f@@ li@@ x decided to do something very simple but imp@@ ac@@ tful .
they said , instead of offering the same show from different genres or more of the different shows from similar users , we 'll just offer more of the same show .
for some , integrating thick data insights into the algorithm could mean life or death , especially for the marginalized .
as all of our lives become more automated , from automo@@ bil@@ es to health insurance or to employment , it is likely that all of us will be impacted by the quanti@@ fication bias .
it was geographically spati@@ alized in almost e@@ er@@ ily the same way that it is today , and it often has been throughout US history .
there actually was a birth moment -- a moment in US history when parti@@ san@@ ship sn@@ apped into place .
he himself was the E@@ in@@ stein of not only the US Constitution , but of constitutional thought more globally , and , to give him his due , he knew it .
that was his initial explanation .
namely , that if you were out of power , you could still say that the government was terrible .
it turns out , you actually can 't govern unless you bring on board the center .
and it worked for our grand@@ parents , our parents , and it 's going to work for us .
I mean , this was -- was I my things ?
these are some pieces of things I used in my S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik feature film , which opens in New York in two weeks downtown .
that was a desk took 40 @@@ -@@ @ some years to build .
I came up with this idea : a life of bits and pieces , which I 'm just starting to work on -- my next project .
how did you do all of that and be visually impaired ? "
because we relied on our strengths , our best strengths , we achieved tremendous outcomes .
as I mo@@ tioned in the direction I thought she should go , saying , " There are no stores on this side of the street so your best bet is to cross -- " " Oh my goodness , " she interrupted .
" the two R@@ oc@@ ket@@ tes on the left are@@ n 't kic@@ king in a straight line . "
today , tens of thousands of can@@ cers are understood down to exquisite molecular detail .
however , scientists were able to map the mu@@ tations of this cancer and give a specific treatment that targets one of the mu@@ tations .
so even if you have a drug that 's highly effective , that kills almost all the cells , there is a chance that there 's a small population that 's resistant to the drug .
for example , in o@@ varian cancer , if you detect cancer in stage four , only 17 percent of the women survive at five years .
for example , mam@@ mo@@ graphy has problems in women with dense brea@@ sts .
I 'm excited to tell you about this latest technology we 've developed .
so does this actually work in patients ?
we just finished a major trial with Professor Charles Sw@@ anton at University College London , examining this .
and from these two vi@@ als of blood we will be able to compare the DNA from all known signatures of cancer , and hopefully then detect can@@ cers months to even years earlier .
it turns out we humans , like all vertebr@@ ates , have lots of ol@@ factory recep@@ tors .
however , about a year or so later , a report emerged of an ol@@ factory recep@@ tor expressed in a tissue other than the nose .
we now know that these recep@@ tors are found all over the body , including in some pretty unexpected places -- in muscle , in kid@@ neys , lun@@ gs and blood vessels .
OK , so far this is not going very well .
we had a ble@@ aching event in 2010 in the Caribbean that took off big patches of skin on b@@ oul@@ der cor@@ als like these .
it 's doing what a healthy coral does .
we can be incredibly p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic on the short term , and mour@@ n what we lost and what we really took for granted .
thanks very much .
no , now we 're just valued for our data .
that makes it harder to predict .
we ended up with social media .
you can 't scale with people .
I mean , where 's the button on the ride ha@@ iling app for the drivers to talk to one another about their working conditions or to uni@@ on@@ ize ?
but since when is education about getting jobs ?
education was compensation for a job well done .
he kills , I kill . "
OK , I 'm on " Team Human . "
of course you would .
( la@@ ughter ) All of a sudden , the car experiences mechanical failure and is unable to stop .
this scenario is inspired by the trolley problem , which was invented by philosoph@@ ers a few decades ago to think about ethics .
of course no accident is going to look like this ; no accident has two or three options where everybody dies somehow .
we 're interested in scenarios in which this is not possible .
so it seems that people want cars to be util@@ itarian , minimize total harm , and that 's what we should all do .
( la@@ ughter ) We 've seen this problem before .
when it comes to the regulation of dri@@ ver@@ less cars , the common land now is basically public safety -- that 's the common good -- and the farmers are the passengers or the car owners who are choosing to ride in those cars .
but more importantly , doing this exercise is helping people recognize the difficulty of making those choices and that the regulators are tasked with impossible choices .
a robot may not harm a human being , a robot may not dis@@ obey a human being , and a robot may not allow itself to come to harm -- in this order of importance .
so it 's a data @@@ -@@ @ driven hardware design .
so it 's time for Spo@@ t to come back out , and we 're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility , de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity and perception .
one of the cool things about a leg@@ ged robot is , it 's omni@@ directional .
now , Spo@@ t has a set of cameras here , stere@@ o cameras , and we have a feed up in the center .
Se@@ th is driving it around .
it 's gone over to that location .
( la@@ ughter ) Me , too !
what are the other applications that you see for your robots ?
H@@ W : so what about the dark side ?
are they interested ?
Mr : sure , the military has been a big f@@ under of robo@@ tics .
Mr : OK , you 're welcome .
all of us in this room will experience lon@@ eliness at some point in our lives .
we live in a co@@ housing community that I not only designed , but developed and have my architecture practice in .
in fact , we look identical to the one next door , except that we 're bright yellow .
this one 's mine , and this one is Sp@@ enc@@ er and She@@ ila 's .
from our homes , we look down into the courtyard , and depending on the time of year , we see this : kids and grow@@ n@@ ups in various combinations playing and hanging out with each other .
instead of pursuing the American dream , where we might have been isolated in our single @@@ -@@ @ family homes , we instead chose co@@ housing , so that we can increase our social connections .
I know others that have an occasional pot@@ luck once or twice a month .
when you eat together , you share more things .
we 're motivated to resolve our differences .
we follow up , we check in , we speak our personal tru@@ ths and , when appropriate , we apolog@@ ize .
and this epidemic is not restricted to the US alone .
and in the library , I found the images that really captured the ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist of the Great De@@ pression .
but they do make you think , because the artist is actually -- it 's almost a puzzle ; the artist is drawing the do@@ ts , and you , the reader , have to complete the picture .
my dog is in fact a mal@@ am@@ ute .
so we 've made amazing strides in image classification , but what happens when we run our classi@@ fier on an image that looks like this ?
we see that the classi@@ fier comes back with a pretty similar prediction .
and it 's correct , there is a mal@@ am@@ ute in the image , but just given this label , we don 't actually know that much about what 's going on in the image .
I work on a problem called object detection , where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects , put b@@ ounding boxes around them and say what those objects are .
this is a detector that we trained on 80 different classes in Microsoft 's CO@@ CO datas@@ et .
and we can turn down our threshold for detection a little bit , so we can find more of you guys out in the audience .
and that 's because dar@@ k@@ net is open source and in the public domain , free for anyone to use .
when I was little , I 'd climb the highest tree , and I 'd approach any animal fear@@ lessly .
my father used to say , " Good steel can withstand any temperature . "
I wanted to end corruption ; I wanted to cut ties between politicians and drug traffickers .
the following year , the Colombian people elected me with the highest number of votes .
as they took me into the deepest depths of the j@@ ung@@ le , the FA@@ RC soldiers announced that if the government did@@ n 't negotiate , they 'd kill me .
from that point on , I went to sleep in fear every night -- cold swe@@ ats , sha@@ king , stomach ache , in@@ som@@ nia .
and so , I began to doubt myself , to doubt my mental health .
and with doubt came desper@@ ation , and with desper@@ ation came depression .
I still have enough freedom to decide who I want to be . "
that 's when I learned that fear brought me face to face with myself .
it 's a world of shad@@ ows , of rain , with the h@@ um of millions of bugs -- maj@@ i@@ ña ants , bullet ants .
I once came face to face with a 24 @@@ -@@ @ foot long an@@ ac@@ ond@@ a that could have sw@@ allowed me in one b@@ ite .
and at night , we would leave , get in the water , and we would swim and let the current carry us .
but after having lived through that with Lu@@ cho , after having faced fear together , united , not punishment , not violence -- nothing -- could ever again divide us .
the third step is very important to me , and it 's a gift that I want to give to you .
and he asked me to help him .
" In@@ grid , you know I don 't believe in God . "
seventeen days passed -- and believe me , I counted them , because they were torture for me .
I called the man up@@ stairs , and he sent me the patrol that rescu@@ ed me from the j@@ ung@@ le . "
it 's what gives us the strength to stand up in the face of fear look above it , and see beyond it .
you are free ! "
the shri@@ ek that came out of all of us when we reg@@ ained our freedom , continues to vibr@@ ate in me to this day .
the " No " vote on the peace referendum in Colombia ; Brexit ; the idea of a wall between Mexico and the United States ; Islamic terrorism -- they 're all examples of using fear politically to divide and recruit us .
we all feel fear .
but we can all avoid being recruited using the resources we have -- our principles , unity , faith .
you can survive cra@@ w@@ ling along , fear@@ ful .
thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) So you answer this question a hundred more times , easily , in the negative , but you finally arrive .
so .
it just sat there for 20 @@@ -@@ @ some @@@ -@@ @ odd years .
he asked whether I 'd be interested in designing a program called a " conviction review unit . "
a conviction review unit is essentially a unit in a prosecutor 's office where prosecutors look at their past cases to determine whether or not they made mistakes .
the program is still going on , and they 're up to 21 releases now -- 21 people who spent significant time behind bars .
so let me tell you about a couple other of the men and women that I inter@@ acted with in the course of this program .
one name is Rog@@ er Log@@ an .
can you look at my case ? "
at first bl@@ ush , the case seemed like it was open and shut , but my research had shown that single @@@ -@@ @ witness identification cases are prone to error .
the eye@@ witness said she heard a shot , and she ran to the next building and turned around and looked , and there was Mr. Log@@ an .
right ?
so we looked through the file , a piece of paper in the file had a number on it .
but my research showed that juvenile confessions without a parent present are prone to error .
we knew what really happened ; someone told them to say this .
he looked up after the arguments and said , " Mr. Mc@@ Call@@ um , " he said five beautiful words : " you are free to go . "
I knew my baby did@@ n 't do this . "
if there 's anything that we 've learned , anything that I 've learned , with this conviction integrity work , it 's that justice do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
justice is something that people of goodwill make happen .
we make justice happen .
just one -- to look through the file , find the receipt , give it to the public defender .
it was on the two @@@ -@@ @ year anniversary of his release .
and we talked , we laugh@@ ed , we h@@ ug@@ ged , we cried .
and he 's doing quite well .
there is a narrative , an idea that with resilience , g@@ rit and personal responsibility people can pull themselves up and achieve economic success .
but the truth is that the challenges of making this happen have less to do with what we do and more to do with the wealth position in which we are born .
this does not diminish the value of education .
there are clear intrinsic values to education , along with a public responsibility to expose everyone to a high @@@ -@@ @ quality education , from grade school all the way through college .
in 1944 , President Frank@@ lin Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t introduced the idea of an economic Bill of Rights .
of course , the f@@ lip side is that the virtues of the market will likewise sanction those that are not a@@ stu@@ te , those that lack motivation or those that are simply la@@ zy .
in other words , the deserving poor will receive their just rewards .
we en@@ vision end@@ owing American new@@ bor@@ ns with an average account of 25,000 dollars that gradually rises upwards to 60,000 dollars for babies born into the poorest families .
if the federal asset @@@ -@@ @ promoting budget were allocated in a more progressive manner , federal policies could be transformative for all Americans .
it is time to get beyond the false narr@@ atives that attribute inequality to individual personal deficits while largely ignoring the advantages of wealth .
you know , they 're the sort of eye@@ ball @@@ -@@ @ rolling poster children for how money , kind of , takes away motivation .
and therefore the motivation to do that .
it 's you , right ? you 're feeling you ?
now all the cracks in my day were filled with phone time .
I updated my calendar while I was sitting on the cou@@ ch .
we call it " getting sh@@ it done , " but here 's what neuro@@ scientist Dr. Daniel Le@@ vi@@ tin says we 're actually doing .
( audio ) Dr. G@@ lor@@ ia Mark : so we find that when people are stressed , they tend to shift their attention more rapidly .
so we part@@ nered with some apps that would measure how much time we were spending every day on our phone .
( audio ) Antonio Gar@@ c@@ ía Martínez : the saying is , if any product is free then you 're the product ; your attention is the product .
I deleted the game Two D@@ ots and nearly cried .
but I really liked deciding for myself when to think about or access my social networks , not giving my phone the power to decide that for me .
after a brief period of really horri@@ ble withdrawal feeling , like lack @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ ca@@ ffe@@ ine head@@ ache , I now feel lovely .
maybe I 'll have to start giving myself challenges and reminders like this every morning .
and we really need this next generation to be able to focus on some big problems : climate change , economic disparity , massive cultural differences .
you inter@@ acted with the company that you work for or that you own .
so in my talk today , I want to share with you some insights I 've obtained and learned in the last 10 years of conducting research in this .
his basic idea was that if everybody beha@@ ves in their own self @@@ -@@ @ interests , that 's good for everybody in the end .
self @@@ -@@ @ interest is@@ n 't a narrowly defined concept just for your immediate utility .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , the straight @@@ -@@ @ up , self @@@ -@@ @ interested move here is to go for that .
that might be us , weighing the benefits and costs of our actions .
in other words , this is a very economic motivation of trying to get people to be more honest , or more aligned with the corporation 's principles .
we try to build a reputation , maybe for being honest , because then people trust us more in the future .
meet Im@@ manuel K@@ ant , 18th @@@ -@@ @ century German phil@@ os@@ op@@ her super@@ star .
he knows that the sa@@ usage is very tasty , but he 's going to turn away because he 's a good dog .
so , what are people actually motivated by ?
we strip away facts which are confusing in reality .
if you say , " I had four tails thro@@ ws , " then you get paid 20 francs .
it 's anonymous , nobody 's watching what you 're doing , and you get paid that money anonym@@ ously .
simple , nine @@@ -@@ @ item survey that 's quite predic@@ tive in these experiments .
so there are two very , very different visions here .
why do certain configurations of line and color and form exc@@ ite us so ?
for most of human history , these questions have been approached using logic and speculation .
many people find mixed @@@ -@@ @ race individuals attractive and in@@ b@@ red families less so .
the second factor that contributes to beauty is sym@@ metry .
sym@@ metry , it turns out , is also an indicator of health .
in the 19@@ 30s , a man named Mak@@ sy@@ mil@@ ian F@@ ak@@ tor@@ ow@@ ic@@ z recognized the importance of sym@@ metry for beauty when he designed the beauty micro@@ meter .
but they don 't have to be , and let me explain why .
these beauty detectors , it seems , ping every time we see beauty , regardless of whatever else we might be thinking .
attractive people receive all kinds of advantages in life .
these kinds of observations reveal beauty 's ug@@ ly side .
the police response to a community in mour@@ ning was to use force to impose fear : fear of milit@@ arized police , imprisonment , fines .
Michael Brown 's death and the subsequent treatment of the community led to a string of protests in and around Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and St. Louis .
and it was beautiful -- until the police showed up .
now , I 'm not going to lie ; when I saw those ar@@ mo@@ red vehicles , and all that gear and all those guns and all those police I was terri@@ fied -- personally .
but I also saw people with something else inside of them .
my goal was to raise awareness and to raise the morale .
and I think that 's part of our job as artists .
and one day they featured a video of my band on the homepage , which was amazing -- we got a bun@@ ch of new fans .
and we built a recording studio .
but there was one big problem : making money as a creative person in 2013 was super we@@ ir@@ d .
so , I actually have a theory about this .
but now , for the first time , you could store the orchestra 's performance on a physical object , and like , listen to it later , which was amazing .
this is De@@ rek Bo@@ d@@ ner , a sports journalist who used to write for Philadelphia Magazine until a few months ago when the magazine cut out all sports coverage .
a couple years ago , they launched F@@ an Funding ; more recently , they launched Super Ch@@ at as a way for creators to mone@@ tize live streaming .
thanks , everybody .
we developed the model for the state of California so they could get on with reducing carbon emissions .
and the results are ast@@ ounding .
why not just stop polluting ?
Los Angeles , as a result of these efforts , has now decided to transform itself into a more transit @@@ -@@ @ oriented environment .
it 's like any other place .
all of a sudden , our principles called for green space preserving the important ecological features .
they know each other .
they 're serious about getting back to their bi@@ king history .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : so , OK : autonomous driving , self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars .
what they don 't say is you 're going to get a lot more vehicle miles .
we call it , " There 's a Better Way . "
we also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first .
I decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated .
he works with the homeless every day .
and they do the paper@@ work , they do the insurance , they do all of the other forms that I can 't do quickly .
if you live in a city of eight @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ half million people , you can do this .
you could do anything .
and people say to me , " Mayor , that 's just a little too simple .
it can 't work that way . "
I can 't wait to see what their experiment looks like , what their pilot project looks like , so we can start taking a collective approach nationally through the dignity of work .
the classi@@ fier was pretty good , but not as good as the person , who got it right most of the time .
that 's a lot of cancer that would have otherwise gone un@@ treated .
but human memory is fam@@ ously flawed .
what if we could remember the consequences of every food we eat , every pill we take , every all @@@ -@@ @ n@@ igh@@ ter we pull ?
and imagine how this could revolu@@ tion@@ ize the way we manage aller@@ gies and chronic disease .
it 's absolutely essential that this be kept very secure .
are you wrong to have enjoyed it as something the artist did@@ n 't intend ?
if you find this problematic , you might be more in line with Ste@@ ven Kn@@ app and Walter Ben@@ n Mic@@ ha@@ els , two literary the@@ ori@@ sts who rejected the In@@ ten@@ tional Fall@@ acy .
they argued that an artist 's intended meaning was not just one possible interpretation , but the only possible interpretation .
contemporary phil@@ os@@ op@@ her No@@ el Car@@ roll took this stance , arguing that an artist 's intentions are relevant to their audience the same way a speaker 's intentions are relevant to the person they 're engaging in conversation .
you respond by handing them a lighter , gathering that their motivation is to light their cigarette .
but there is one place in the world where men live as long as women .
it 's a remote , mountainous zone , a blue zone , where super longevity is common to both sexes .
I decided to research the science and the habits of the place , and I started with the genetic profile .
now , social isolation is the public health risk of our time .
but Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe , he was@@ n 't suspicious at all .
actually , no .
( la@@ ughter ) Me@@ et Gi@@ ov@@ ann@@ i Cor@@ ri@@ as . he 's 101 , the gr@@ um@@ pi@@ est person I have ever met .
still not a strong predic@@ tor .
this means how much you interact with people as you move through your day .
but we do have evidence now , fresh evidence , that there is a difference .
and by the way , if you want to know how she fit two people in an M@@ RI scanner at the same time , talk to me later .
now , this research by Nicholas E@@ ple@@ y at the University of Chicago Business School is quite amazing because it tells us a simple thing .
now , to return to the beginning , why do women live longer than men ?
fresh evidence shows that these in @@@ -@@ @ person friend@@ ships create a biological force field against disease and decline .
why men who 've had a stroke who meet regularly -- this is something very powerful they can do .
it seems like he 's connecting pretty well .
so we 're just learning , but I would say there are some improvements that we could make in the technology .
now , I have to gather myself every time I get that question .
Bank of America building , there , in Atlanta .
now , we 're probably all a little bit guilty of that at times .
I get that t@@ we@@ et a lot , actually .
( la@@ ughter ) So confirmation bias , D@@ unning @@@ -@@ @ K@@ ru@@ ger and cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance .
we have knowledge .
but think about this ...
whatever you want to call it .
when in fact , the perception was that it was not going to be as bad , but it was actually an upgrade .
you take inventory of your own bi@@ ases .
your upbringing , your political perspective , your faith -- what shapes your own bi@@ ases ?
the sooner we get off this ham@@ ster wheel of age denial , the better off we are .
right ? think about it .
but what never da@@ w@@ ns on most of us is that the experience of reaching old age can be better or worse depending on the culture in which it takes place .
because our future leaders are learning from senior role models who just are@@ n 't ready to role model yet , much less change the systems that made them so successful .
so , if we can 't fully count on role models or the system right now , it 's on John to not miss this critical development window .
he said , " We haven 't done it because we just don 't trust that they 're going to make the right decisions .
( guitar ) And then there 's you .
thank you .
they sort and separate the winners from the los@@ ers .
let me give you an example .
the New York Post filed a Freedom of Information Act request , got all the teachers ' names and all their scores and they published them as an act of teacher @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ming .
it would filter out women because they do not look like people who were successful in the past .
it 's a process by which techn@@ ologists hide ug@@ ly tru@@ ths inside black box algorithms and call them objective ; call them mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic .
they call it their " secret sau@@ ce " -- that 's why they can 't tell us about it .
now you might think , since all this stuff is private and there 's competition , maybe the free market will solve this problem .
we can 't . we have to check them .
what is that bias looking like in other crime categories , and how do we account for it ?
second , we should think about the definition of success , audit that .
we need to separate those two things .
I have two more messages , one for the data scientists out there .
( appl@@ ause ) And the rest of you , the non @@@ -@@ @ data scientists : this is not a math test .
this is a political fight .
and you ask yourself : what is the convers@@ ational nature of reality ?
but all of us live at this convers@@ ational frontier with the future .
how do you hold the conversation of life that brings you to this place ?
I said , " A@@ st@@ on@@ ishing .
those people that make money from your work .
and I have to be really honest .
we 're going to need money , people and training .
also , union halls are full of union members who understand the importance of solidarity and the power of collective action .
and this group of businesses now employs 80,000 people and ear@@ ns more than 12 billion euros in revenue every year .
and all of the companies there are owned by the people that work in them .
" our strategy should not be only to confront Empire , but to lay siege to it .
to deprive it of oxygen .
another world is not only possible , she 's on her way .
I had a lot to learn .
I had never encountered poverty like that before in my life .
but over the course of the next year , I came to discover that this orphan@@ age that I had been supporting was terri@@ bly corrupt .
as I adjusted to my new life running an orphan@@ age in Cambodia , ( Khmer ) I learned to speak Khmer flu@@ ently , which means that I learned to speak the Khmer language flu@@ ently .
in a total ec@@ lip@@ se , for all of two or three minutes , the moon completely blocks the face of the sun , creating what he described as the most a@@ we @@@ -@@ @ inspiring spectac@@ le in all of nature .
well , about 10 minutes before the total solar ec@@ lip@@ se was set to begin , we@@ ir@@ d things started to happen .
and I g@@ lan@@ ced upward , and I was just du@@ mb@@ struck .
I had lived on earth long enough to know what the sky looks like .
up above , it was a deep purple @@@ -@@ @ grey , like tw@@ il@@ ight .
and so let me tell you : before you die , you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar ec@@ lip@@ se .
it makes us feel connected .
just maybe , this shared experience of a@@ we would help heal our divisions , get us to treat each other just a bit more human@@ ely .
this crazy Canadian named Po@@ wel Cros@@ ley commerci@@ alized this thing called the I@@ cy@@ B@@ all , in 1928 .
( la@@ ughter ) Because you 're using ammonia , you get h@@ ug@@ ely high pressures if you heated them wrong ; it top@@ ped 400 p@@ si .
you put it on a cooking fire .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
thank you .
but we now know , many decades later , that it 's much more complicated than that , and that the sug@@ ars on our cells are actually very complex .
but what are they trying to tell us ?
in fact , one of those drugs may well have spared President J@@ im@@ my Car@@ ter 's life .
and that 's important , because our immune system needs to leave the good cells alone .
housing , land , seas , birds , beast and all of mankind , exclusively the interface where you and the elements meet and vibr@@ ate harmon@@ iously .
all I give to humanity ?
their alignment enables their autonomy , and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible .
you see lots of people in suits taking elev@@ ators to go to their department , marke@@ ters sitting with marke@@ ters , engineers with engineers , etc .
you see meetings with 20 people where nothing gets decided .
" it depends . "
you can imagine our surprise .
change is not only about embracing the new ; it 's about giving up on some of the old as well .
and clearly , every company has their own skep@@ tics about why this is not going to work for them .
but for this bank and also for the other companies that I have worked with afterwards , change was possible .
you would hear someone saying , " Ah , so you 're the guy that I was always ch@@ asing for answers . "
we still need some kind of management matrix .
it 's about all of us stepping up to take initiative .
but you know how they say that information is a source of power ?
everything we do is transparent for everyone .
now , today , to know how things are going , instead of looking at status reports , he needs to walk down to the team floors to attend one of their sessions .
now they have releases every few weeks , and without the hand@@ overs and the red tape , the whole organization becomes more efficient .
and the hardest part of that change is not in structure or process or procedure , and it 's also not just senior executives taking charge .
leaders will be all of those in the organization who embrace the change .
now sing@@ ul@@ arity is the issue .
then the machine reads the page .
this is the original problem written in Japanese , and we had to teach it 2,000 mathematical ax@@ i@@ oms and 8,000 Japanese words to make it accept the problems written in natural language .
even more we@@ ir@@ d , but probably this is the most fun part for the machine .
let me show you a typical error it made in the English test .
but To@@ da@@ i Ro@@ bot chose number two , even after learning 15 billion English sentences using deep learning technologies .
OK , so now you might understand what I said : modern A@@ Is do not read , do not understand .
and To@@ da@@ i Ro@@ bot chose the correct answer , too .
NA : yes , yes , yes .

and my co@@ workers started acting differently .

when the crew was safely home a few days later , they were asked about the mission .

this facility is the second @@@ -@@ @ bu@@ si@@ est in the world by terms of total tonn@@ age , accounting for one @@@ -@@ @ fifth of the world 's shipping containers and one half of the annual supply of crude oil .
so once cows reach a particular weight , roughly 300 kilograms , they are moved here and placed on a specialized diet .
so this facility contains 2,@@ 650 mirrors which are ar@@ ra@@ yed in con@@ centric circles around an 140 @@@ -@@ @ meter @@@ -@@ @ tall tower at its center .
this is the E@@ ix@@ ample district in Barcelona , Spain .
this is the D@@ ad@@ a@@ ab Refugee Camp in northern Kenya , the largest such facility of its kind in the world .
it 's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion and natural disasters , but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid .
this is actually the crow@@ d@@ sourced reconstruction of it before it was destroyed .
well , the key to this technology is called photo@@ gram@@ metry , and it was invented here , in Germany .
well , simply because the statue was positioned against a wall .
this works the same way if you visit a museum , and a statue is found in fragments ; it 's put together for the people to see it .
however , we 're much more interested in what virtual reality has to offer for lost heritage .
so we 're already finding photographs to complete a digital reconstruction of this .
we need to remember that the destruction of cultural heritage is@@ n 't a recent phenomenon .
fast @@@ -@@ @ forward to 2001 , when the Taliban ble@@ w up the Bam@@ i@@ yan Budd@@ has in Afghanistan .
you see , cultural heritage is about our shared global history .
but cultural heritage offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people for future generations .

and this image made me really sad .
and the governments all around the world are fighting their war on smo@@ g , but I wanted to make something within the now .
( appl@@ ause ) And every month or so , it opens like a spac@@ eship -- like a Mar@@ il@@ yn Monro@@ e with the -- well , you know what .
this is Beijing smo@@ g .
if you live next to a highway , it 's the same as 17 cigarettes per day .
and we put this online -- K@@ ick@@ star@@ ter campaign , crow@@ d@@ funding .
these are smo@@ g @@@ -@@ @ free bicycles which -- I 'm Dutch , yes ? -- I have this " bicycle DNA " inside of me somewhere .
we did the design for that -- 2008 .

so some of the sustainability is about doing more , not about doing less .
but the moment you present a new idea , there 's this we@@ ir@@ d tendency to reply to every new idea starting with two words .
which are ?
but ladies and gent@@ lemen , let 's not be afraid .
so I wanted to en@@ roll in this youth camp to get a better understanding of why people were joining .
so Er@@ in got turned into Ir@@ é@@ na , and Sal@@ t@@ man got turned into S@@ ó@@ s , which means " sal@@ ty " in Hungarian .
but going to this camp , I was further shocked to realize that it was actually really fun .
and what 's really tragic is that of@@ ten@@ times there 's no one profile .
and this is what I want to talk you through , as well as how do we challenge this in a modern era ?
one of the aspects is the internet and the usage of social media , as we 've all seen in head@@ lines t@@ wee@@ ting and videos of be@@ headings .
and with ISIS , all of a sudden , this idea of a clo@@ aked , dark figure of a ji@@ had@@ ist changed for us .
they were t@@ wee@@ ting .
how do we get rid of terrorist content ?
it 's not just recruiting combatants ; it 's trying to build a state .
if you want to talk , I 'm here . "
so what we 're trying to do is actually bring unlikely sectors to the table .
we have amazing activists all over the world , but of@@ ten@@ times , their messages are not strategic or they don 't actually reach the audiences they want to reach .
and we work with them to bring the tech sector to the table with artists and cre@@ atives and marketing expertise so that we can actually have a more robust and challenging of extremism that works together .
and Africa is a serious place where only serious things happen .
so when I present my work somewhere , someone will always ask , " What 's so important about it ?
and it do@@ es@@ n 't .
and maybe it 's because of the funding .
so art becomes a tool for agenda .
how could that happen ?
one route is that we 'll just keep accum@@ ulating better software , like we 've been doing for 70 years .
I 'm going to call them " ems . "
when they talk about it , they say , " Is this even possible ?
these are all fascinating questions that I 'm going to ignore ...
I spent four years trying to analyze it , using standard academic tools , to guess what would happen , and I 'm here to tell you what I found .
this is what you might look like if you were using virtual reality .
but still , it could see and experience the same thing .
and an em can move its brain , the computer that represents its brain , from one physical location to another .
also , ems need computer hardware , energy , cooling , or they can 't exist .
that means ems have to be working most of the time .
so that means this is what ems usually see : beautiful and luxurious , but desks -- they 're working most of the time .
this is not only how they see themselves in virtual reality , it 's also how they actually are physically cra@@ m@@ med together .
this is your life : you start and you end , really simple .
subjec@@ tively , they remember a life of leisure .
since I was a k@@ id , I 've had a terrible ro@@ te memory .
and I did@@ n 't like following instructions , I was no good at following instructions .
and that was just because the stock market was hot at the time .
but I tri@@ pled my money , and I tri@@ pled my money because I got lucky .
that if I could solve the pu@@ zzles , they would give me g@@ ems .
and that was because the computer could make decisions much faster , it could process a lot more information and it can process decisions much more -- less emo@@ tionally .
( video ) Mr. Chairman , Mr. M@@ itch@@ ell , it 's a great pleasure and a great honor to be able to appear before you in examination with what is going wrong with our economy .
that has been how we 've run the investment business , and it 's how we also deal with the people management .
and it shifts the conversation from arguing over our opinions to fig@@ uring out objective criteria for determining which opinions are best .
it 's given us more effective work , and it 's given us more effective relationships .
thank you very much .
and the other one wrote , " G@@ lor@@ ious opportunity . they don 't have any shoes yet . "
( la@@ ughter ) Now , there 's a similar situation in the classical music world , because there are some people who think that classical music is dying .
maybe you have this child at home .
( music ) ( Music ends ) He practices for another year and takes lessons -- he 's nine .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Now , if you 'd waited for one more year , you would have heard this .
( music ) And the second , with an impulse every other note .
( music ) You can see it by looking at my head .
( music ) The 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old , on every eight notes .
he was the president of a corporation in Ohio .
you should be a one @@@ -@@ @ but@@ to@@ ck player . "
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
the audience gas@@ ped when they heard the difference .
then I got a letter from this gent@@ l@@ eman .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you .
my estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music .
you ad@@ ore classical music . your FM is always on that classical dial .
that 's the first group , quite small .
then there 's another bigger group .
now comes the third group : people who never listen to classical music .
and then there 's a very small group .
amazing number of people think they 're tone @@@ -@@ @ deaf .
if you were tone @@@ -@@ @ deaf , you cou@@ ld@@ n 't change the gears on your car , in a stick shift car .
you cou@@ ld@@ n 't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome .
you have a fantastic ear . everybody has a fantastic ear .
but I tell you what .
of course , I 'm not sure they 'll be up to it . "
this is a beautiful pre@@ l@@ ude by Ch@@ op@@ in .
when I started , you thought , " How beautiful that sounds . "
( music ) " I don 't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year . "
and of course -- ( Appl@@ ause ) Of course , if the piece is long and you 've had a long day , you might actually drift off .
then your companion will di@@ g you in the ribs and say , " W@@ ake up ! it 's culture ! " and then you feel even worse .
if I 'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it .
( music ) ( Music ends ) And for the rest of your life , every time you hear classical music , you 'll always be able to know if you hear those impul@@ ses .
so let 's see what 's really going on here .
we have a B. This is a B.
the next note is a C.
( la@@ ughter ) Com@@ pos@@ ers know that .
if they want sad music , they just play those two notes .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , it goes down to A.
and if we have B , A , G , F , what do we expect next ?
( music ) That might have been a flu@@ ke .
( music ) Oh , the TED cho@@ ir .
and then he backs away , he goes up to him again , almost kills him .

a beloved grand@@ mother , a lover -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart , but that person is no longer with you .
now , how would you walk -- my profession , the music profession do@@ es@@ n 't see it that way .
( la@@ ughter ) How would you walk ? how would you talk ? how would you be ?
how would you walk or talk ? how would you be ?
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
you look at their eyes .
I learned this from a woman who survived Aus@@ ch@@ witz , one of the rare survivors .
and ...
what words come to mind when you look at me ?
so what the general straight public saw was this very aw@@ ful thing happening to a group of people who were already on the fr@@ ing@@ es of society .
but that perme@@ ating fear and that perception , it still ling@@ ers .
I would reel with na@@ us@@ ea , and it was difficult to walk .
but it was@@ n 't to appe@@ ase them .
they would assume things about my sex life or my sex habits .
they would assume I put myself or others at risk .
of course the f@@ lip side to that is being unclean , or dirty , when you do have HIV .
and what 's the difference between being happy and having meaning in life ?
but Jonathan insisted on paying , so he went to the store and bought something he did@@ n 't need to make change .
he was trying to do something kind , but Jonathan had rejected him .
of course , for many of us , that happens through work .
but that also means that issues like disengagement at work , unemployment , low labor force participation -- these are@@ n 't just economic problems , they 're exi@@ st@@ ential ones , too .
of course , you don 't have to find purpose at work , but purpose gives you something to live for , some " why " that drives you forward .
one study had students look up at 200 @@@ -@@ @ feet @@@ -@@ @ tall e@@ uc@@ aly@@ p@@ tus trees for one minute .
but we don 't always realize that we 're the authors of our stories and can change the way we 're telling them .
your life is@@ n 't just a list of events .
you can edit , interpret and ret@@ ell your story , even as you 're constrained by the facts .
when I was younger , I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars .
their practice also involved serving all of creation through small acts of love , which meant being kind even when people wron@@ ged you .
but it gave them a purpose : to re@@ in in the ego .
eventually , I left home for college and without the daily gro@@ unding of Su@@ f@@ ism in my life , I felt un@@ mo@@ ored .
of course , the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones .
but that 's exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives .
lying there facing death , he had a reason to live : love .
that 's the power of meaning .
happiness comes and goes .
our perception of what physics is needs a bit of a shift .
it 's inaccessible , it 's somewhere else and fundamentally , why should I care ?
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean .
so this is definitely physics happening here -- there 's lots of things -- this is definitely physics .
and yet it 's not included in our cultural perception of physics , and that bo@@ thers me .
that 's allowed .
and then there 's cos@@ m@@ ology , which is up there ; very large , very far away , also very we@@ ir@@ d .
and if you go to some places like black holes in the beginning of the universe , we know that these are frontiers in physics , right ?
and these are also run by physics , you 'd be surprised -- there is physics in the middle , it 's just that nobody talks about it .
and the thing about all of these is that they all run on a relatively small number of physical laws , things like New@@ ton 's laws of motion , ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics , some rot@@ ational dynamics .
when these laws work together , they bring about the beautiful , mess@@ y , complex world we live in .
and this is the bit that we don 't talk about .
there 's plenty of physics research going on here .
but because it do@@ es@@ n 't involve pointing at stars , people for some reason think it 's not that .
I want you to tell me which one is which .
which one 's raw ?
( audience responds ) The one on the left -- yes !
this is the Hu@@ b@@ ble Space Tel@@ es@@ cope .
Hu@@ b@@ ble has been floating in free space for 25 years , not touching anything .
it 's got gy@@ ro@@ sc@@ opes which are sp@@ inning , and because of the law of conservation of angular momentum , they keep sp@@ inning with the same axis , indefinitely .
Hu@@ b@@ ble kind of rot@@ ates around them , and so it can orient itself .
so the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use , also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time .
so this is the fun bit of physics , that you learn these patterns and then you can apply them again and again and again .
the thing that 's best about this is it involves playing with toys .
so I think we should play with these patterns .
basically , there are a small number of concepts that you can become familiar with using things in your kitchen , that are really useful for life in the outside world .
magne@@ ts that you can play with in your kitchen get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation .
and it 's fundamentally democratic , right ?
and so there 's two important things to know about science : the fundamental laws we 've learned through experience and experi@@ mentation , work .
and being familiar with these concepts means we 're not helpl@@ ess .
and I think it 's really important that we 're not helpl@@ ess , that society feels it can look at things , because this is@@ n 't about knowing all the answers .
it 's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions .
all of us can have fun playing with toys , and we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be embar@@ ras@@ sed about it .
the framework for physics is remarkably constant ; it 's the same in lots and lots of things that we measure .
so , the question is -- I get asked sometimes : how do you start ?
but if you don 't have any of those little moments on your way home from this event , here are some things to start with .
I 'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are te@@ ac@@ ups around .
physics is right here ; it 's for us , and we can all play with it .
and then they 've got me mapped .
but what about the Christians and the Muslims and the a@@ the@@ ists that I grew up with ?
and it 's about how we ap@@ prehend ourselves as well as others .
and often the conflict is based on old stories of identity and belonging and origins .
they give us a sense of belonging .
he 's a very high @@@ -@@ @ risk security prisoner in the UK and one of the most important Al Qaeda figures to be arrested in Britain .
and you get the impression in the news that they are after us in the West , but they are actually mainly after people from other Muslim backgrounds .
now here , their claim to tradition is at war with history , but they 're nevertheless very certain about their purity and about the imp@@ urity of others .
purity , certainty , the return to authentic tradition , the quest for these can lead to lethal visions of perfect societies and perfec@@ ted people .
it was a member of the same Hindu fundament@@ alist movement who shot dead Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi .
now , culture is@@ n 't just about language , food , clothing and music , but gender relations , ancient monuments , a heritage of sacred texts .
what about you , now , listening to this ?
and this is what you are when you say , " I , " " am , " or " me . "
if we don 't need origin stories and fixed identities , we can challenge ourselves to think cre@@ atively about each other and our future .
they should be kept separated .
there are days when you feel as if you 're floating among the clouds .
they prefer to lie than to become divorced from their desires . "
that 's why I 've brought this back@@ pack today .
you 're all familiar with Earth Day .
could we live in an ecosystem floating among the clouds ?
it asks the question : what might these transnational spaces be like ?
these are fragile ecosystems .
on July 16 , 1945 , on the White S@@ ands of New Mexico , an atomic bomb was deton@@ ated for the first time .

but now our government has grown up , and we have that technology today .
these same fusion centers have sp@@ ied on Muslim community groups ' reading lists and on Qu@@ akers who are resi@@ sting military recruiting in high schools .
we are all activists now , which means that we all have something to worry about from surveillance .
Mike lost his job to a machine .
in fact , automation is spreading to every production line in every country around the world .
and I work in the middle of a highly connected network of manufacturers all collaborating from around the world to produce many of the products we use today .
I 've had the pleasure of being able to see how many different products are manufactured , from golf clubs to laptop computers to internet servers , automo@@ bil@@ es and even air@@ planes .
now , this approach to processing goes on all around the world to manufacture many of the products we use every day , from skin cream to air@@ planes .
economist Michael Por@@ ter described what 's going on here best .
so what he 's talking about here is shared production , and efficiency is the name of the game .
companies today focus on manufacturing what they produce best and most efficiently , and they trade for everything else .
so this means they rely on a global , interconnected , interdependent network of manufacturers to produce these products .
in fact , that network is so interconnected it 's almost impossible to dismantle and produce products in just one country .
that 's about 200 billion dollars , or the same as the GDP for Portugal .
now , remember , this is only looking at one str@@ and of the production chain between the US and Mexico , so multiply this out across all of the str@@ ands .
the reality is that shared production allows us to manufacture higher quality products at lower costs .
it 's that simple .
it 's really important to remember that for shared production to be effective , it relies on efficient cross @@@ -@@ @ border movement of raw materials , components and finished products .
so remember this : the next time you 're hearing somebody try to sell you on the idea that protectionism is a good deal , it 's just not .
this ad@@ orable organism -- well , I think it 's ad@@ orable -- is called Te@@ tra@@ hy@@ men@@ a and it 's a single @@@ -@@ @ cell@@ ed creature .
it 's also been known as pond sc@@ um .
now , when I started my quest , all we knew was that they helped protect the ends of chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es .
it was important when cells divide .
and some of those cells have to divide thousands of times .
every time the cell divides and the DNA is copied , some of that DNA from the ends gets worn down and shortened , some of that tel@@ om@@ ere DNA .
so , end of story .
well , sorry , not so fast .
now , remember that little pond sc@@ um crit@@ ter Te@@ tra@@ hy@@ men@@ a ?
and so we have to think about this .
( appl@@ ause ) Not so fast , I 'm sorry .
El@@ iss@@ a 's question to me , back when she first came to my lab , indeed had been a life @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ death question .
not good for your tel@@ ome@@ res .
can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone ?
now that you know how to protect your tel@@ ome@@ res , are you curious what are you going to do with all those decades of bri@@ m@@ ming good health ?
and now that you know you could impact the tel@@ ome@@ res of others , are you curious how will you make a difference ?
but since I do not have the 2.5 billion dollars to send my own robot to Mars , I study the most Mar@@ tian place on Earth , the At@@ ac@@ ama Des@@ ert .
these type of findings suggest to me that on Mars , we may find even pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thetic life inside ca@@ ves .
how ? you already know the answer .
and a key theme in AI is being able to understand intelligence by creating our own compu@@ tational systems that display intelligence the way we see it in nature .
it 's quite small , about the size of a quarter , and you can program how it moves , but it can also wi@@ relessly communicate with other robots , and it can measure distances from them .
and the important thing is that no one is in charge .
and here , we can take inspiration from social insects .
so here , you 're going to see some simulated robots .
they 're almost identical to real life .
a very striking learning experience for a twenty @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old .
I was really fasc@@ inated about the world , about the DNA , about , you know , the language of life , the program of learning .
we did sequence , also , one species many , many times ...
to understand history , to understand what kind of learning process the gen@@ ome has been through for the millions of years .
a lot of things could be studied , but look at that : 30 years ago , we were still poor in China .
you have this statistical risk of certain diseases when you are born .
but every day you make different choices , and those choices will increase or decrease the risk of certain diseases .
the only way to make that digital me work ...
what if I eat less ?
what is the right breakfast for me ?
and that probably will be an interesting treatment in the future for cancer and things like that .
but I still hate the smell .
about the question I just posed at the very beginning : " what is life ? "
thank you .
it costs many dollars to do all the sequ@@ encing and so forth .
so for the digital me , it 's the same thing .
I think it has to be 100 dollars .
and it seems that with all this merging of the technology , I 'm thinking that in the very near future , let 's say three to five years , it will come to reality .

giant cl@@ ams , dead or alive , are not safe from us .
my fasc@@ ination with giant cl@@ ams got me started on conservation research to fill in the knowledge gaps on their ecology and behavior .

this same mind@@ set popul@@ arized the over@@ processed , lef@@ to@@ ver rice debris known as " broken rice , " which was imported to Senegal from In@@ do@@ china and introduced by the colonial French .
last year , a business partner and I secured a commitment from Whole Fo@@ ods Market , the US 's largest natural food store chain , to carry fon@@ io .
we drew up a vision with a beneficial and commercially sustainable supply chain for fon@@ io , and we connected ourselves with organizations that can help us achieve it .
nice vision , right ?
however , in that drough@@ t@@ - and famine @@@ -@@ @ prone region , fon@@ io grows freely .
and we soon found out we had almost everything in common .
la : and I 'd say I 'm a little to the left , like all the way to the left .
we replace our ego and our desire to win with curi@@ osity , em@@ pa@@ thy and a desire to learn .
I was anno@@ yed and irrit@@ ated that entire day , really because of two things .
la : and under normal circumstances , I would agree with Ca@@ it@@ lin .
la : and I shared with Ca@@ it@@ lin that we actually started talking about the March weeks before we participated .
la : the second topic that challenged our ability to engage in dialogue was around my need to understand how Ca@@ it@@ lin could vote for Trump .
la : and so after our conversation , I was struck by a few things .
but the most important thing about this conversation is that it happened at all .
C@@ Q : so life with boys .
and perhaps most importantly for our relationship , we have made the commitment to each other that our friendship is way more important than either of us being right or winning a conversation about politics .
and you know what triggered it ?
steam power , machines , new chemical processes -- in two words , technological innovation .
it 's a lot of fun sometimes .
think about it .
is that still true today , because the office people are starting to realize that working in the office and being in the office may not be the same thing anymore .
and do you know how much it costs for a company to even have an office ?
but that is going to change by the convergence of two technologies : augmented reality and tele@@ presence robots .
you know how they say that most human communication is non@@ verbal ?
access to services and goods .
and it 's expected to reach 2.@@ 38 by the end of 2017 , according to e@@ Mar@@ ke@@ ter .
a vehicle carrying a squ@@ ad@@ ron of d@@ ron@@ es .
the driver does some of the deliveries while the d@@ ron@@ es are flying back and forth from the truck as it moves .
so that 's two .
now , what was the third reason why people move to cities ?
actually , as social groups become smaller , they grow stronger .
a recent study made in the UK by the Office for National Statistics showed a higher life satisfaction rating among people living in rural areas .
so han@@ dy@@ men , small workshops , service companies will thrive .
by now , you 're probably thinking of all the advantages of country living .
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't need more people to come .
( la@@ ughter ) I just think they will once they realize they can have the same benefits the city has .
anyway , I guess now you have some thinking to do .
it was totally on purpose .
and this is what I tried to do with my architecture as well .
they were right under my feet : mud , earth , dirt , clay , however you call it ...
we had also tried a bit cows , but inte@@ res@@ tingly , they were too intelligent .
they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't mix the mud , the straw -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) the sand , which are the ingredients in the walls .
that gives such an enormous boost of trust and confidence in yourself and the community .
you just take the broken part , make it wet , and put it back on the wall , and it will look the same as before .
( la@@ ughter ) You ? OK .
students and faculty rolled up their sle@@ eves , got their hands dirty and transformed the front into a warm place for people to gather .
and this wall in my own home is our hum@@ id@@ fier .
its archa@@ ic warmth is touching deep within .
my personal dream is to build a mud sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ per right in Manhattan .
I had just seen The Green Lady .
deployed .
the social circle is what 's key here .
let 's just work with what we have .
and the stress of it all is tr@@ ick@@ ling down through the population .
what would it feel like if the circle were broken ?
I went and told my head@@ master that , at pre@@ p school .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
but you 've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line , because it 's constant .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what spir@@ ited this , plus the influence of Jo@@ e and others . we started One Lap@@ top per Child .
I did@@ n 't bring one with me , but they really work much better off @@@ -@@ @ board .
that the reason that you want to be below two wat@@ ts is that 's roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
and the reason I think design matters is@@ n 't because I wanted to go to art school .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
it 's a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
Latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
I 'm willing to suspect some of you had@@ n 't even heard of them before .
so what I want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it 's rich .
and if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
we 've pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
the first kids got their laptops . they got them by ship , and I 'm talking now about 7,000 , 8,000 at a time went out this week .
you see them , so they must see you .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't see myself represented .
women 's Day was coming up .
ju@@ x@@ tap@@ os@@ ed with the hy@@ poc@@ ris@@ y of how women are treated , especially in public spaces today , I decided to do something about it .
I mean learning institutions , places where young people , young minds are being shaped .
on that -- well , that year , I had just begun my master 's at the University of Cape Town .
and so I started con@@ j@@ uring her mentally , spirit@@ ually and through dress .
one word : knowledge .
if Africa is to become a continent that offers the best life for humans , it must become a knowledge society immediately .
this is what I have called " Africa 's knowledge imperative . "
for instance , Africa does not have a water crisis .
does Africa have a food crisis ?
again , the answer is no .
it is knowledge .
why can 't Libya 's aquifers grow sor@@ gh@@ um in northern Nigeria ?
now only buc@@ can@@ e@@ er capit@@ alists from Europe are schem@@ ing of doing the same , but for exports to Europe and South Africa .
the ensla@@ ved Africans , on the other hand , knew their were embo@@ di@@ ments of knowledge .
the list is endless .
African universities are now all too content to have e @@@ -@@ @ connections with libraries elsewhere , having given up ambitions on building libraries to which the world would come for intellectual edi@@ fication .
it is a game about building cities .
these are from YouTube .
but what Sil@@ v@@ arre@@ t has done here is that what he wanted to make was not a real city .
this is a fantasy city , even though it looks real .
like , it 's not enough to have a hospital .
A@@ ster@@ ge@@ a by Y@@ ut@@ th@@ o .
and this is what you can do with this game .
so anyone could download the map , play the game , build the area and submit their cre@@ ations to the city council .
so we need the solutions and these people , playing the game , they are trying out different kinds of solutions .
so it might be that this is not just a game .
it might be a way to decide our own fate .
and like you , and like most parents , the honest truth is I have pretty much no idea what I 'm doing .
so I 've spent most of their lives just making it up as I go along .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , this war@@ time study actually ended up being so successful that scientists did it again .
altogether , more than 70,000 children have been involved in these studies across those five generations .
they 've even collected 9,000 plac@@ ent@@ as from some of the births , which are now pic@@ k@@ led in plastic buc@@ kets in a secure storage warehouse .
these are some of the best @@@ -@@ @ studied people on the planet , and the data has become incredibly valuable for scientists , generating well over 6,000 academic papers and books .
they 've been more likely to do worse at school , to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money .
so the second lesson is this : parents really matter .
it seems that parents and what they do are really , really important , especially in the first few years of life .
in other words , which ones beat the odds .
the data showed that what mat@@ tered more than anything else was parents .
having engaged , interested parents in those first few years of life was strongly linked to children going on to do well at school later on .
talking and listening to a child , responding to them warmly , teaching them their letters and numbers , taking them on trips and visits .
reading to children every day seems to be really important , too .
but scientists working with this British study are working really hard to get at causes , and this is one study I particularly love .
were the children going to bed at regular times , or did they go to bed at different times during the week ?
so wait , does that actually mean , then , that poverty do@@ es@@ n 't matter after all ?
you could argue it do@@ es@@ n 't matter if a child is born poor -- as long as their parents are good parents , they 're going to do just fine .
good paren@@ ting only reduced the educational gap between the rich and poor children by about 50 percent .
now , as you can imagine , the answers are@@ n 't quite as simple as that .
it 's a bit embar@@ ras@@ sing .
our sense of isolation grows , because our imagination goes into over@@ drive about the people and the spaces that we no longer engage with .
our sense of other@@ ness grows , and we lose em@@ pa@@ thy .
certainly , we did@@ n 't share a lot of the same public spaces with others .
divisions along religious lines are deepening , and we 're doub@@ ting more and more how much we have in common .
he had an idea .
and neighbors , by picking up a pa@@ int@@ brush with other neighbors , would engage not just with their heads but with their hands and with their hearts .
and so we challenged them and we asked the question , " So what will it cost ?
and if we pay for your faith , is it really faith ? "
we started the project asking the question , " Where does your faith live ? "
and these fears are justified .
for some , it was to tell the world that they 're not terrorists .
and for some it was simply to build neighborhood solidarity in advance of feared election violence .
the sun sh@@ ines on us all equally .
we painted in Nairobi , and then we painted in Mom@@ basa .
colour in Fa@@ ith is literally highlighting those who mean well in yellow .
when I first saw it , it reminded me of a gal@@ axy .
so I practiced on some other found specimens , and I approached the Oxford University Museum of Natural History to see if I could have access to their collection , to progress the project .
in fact , I had a show in Milan two weeks ago , and we had some prints there that were nine meters long .
so with the help of Ro@@ b Ch@@ and@@ ler and Will Co@@ ok@@ son , we developed a website that enables the viewer to immer@@ se themselves into the full four @@@ -@@ @ gig@@ aby@@ te files , and they can explore all that micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic detail .
the kids are using them on the tablet .
I do want to leave you with one final image , if that 's OK .
this has to do with Charles Dar@@ win .
I 'm talking about the creature in the box , not my cat .
that 's the size of the state of Louisiana , where I live .
we want to measure longit@@ udes , distances .
these detectors are very , very , very sensitive ; they 're the most precise instruments in the world .
what 's the purpose of ca@@ resses ?
but it will probably take a lot of time .
this is just the beginning .
we might get po@@ op@@ ed and dem@@ or@@ alized , but V@@ on@@ ne@@ gu@@ t inter@@ s@@ pers@@ ed his gri@@ m assessments with more than a few mor@@ sels of hope .
but I needed to know . like , I wanted to know .
all right ? so I pressed on .
I mean , America seems to be hel@@ l@@ bent on filling its textbooks with Cli@@ ff@@ s@@ Notes versions of its dark past .
I don 't have infinite olive branches to extend to people who , like , would not want to see me on this planet . right ?
now listen , I know what it is to fear for the fate of your people .
so they 're not hearing certain anti @@@ -@@ @ racist and political voices , voices like T@@ im W@@ ise and Michel@@ le Alexander , Dr. Jo@@ y De@@ G@@ ru@@ y , Bo@@ y@@ ce Wat@@ kins , Tari@@ q Nas@@ heed .
and I ain 't talking about online safe conversations from the security of your laptop .
there is no way out of each other .
stop trying to find one .
these courageous conversations are the way that these bridges are built .
as a black woman , I 've had to develop extraordinary resilience to succeed .
I did@@ n 't think I had the right to be depressed .
I will always regret that I cou@@ ld@@ n 't be there for my ne@@ phe@@ w .
I 'm going to begin today with a story and end with a revolution .
audience : yes !
all my life I wanted to be an actress .
that 's my grand@@ mother , not Mer@@ yl Stree@@ p .
( la@@ ughter ) So that 's where I come from .
OK . so I graduate .
and I start audi@@ tioning and I get work , slowly .
but , remember -- I came here to play smart , will@@ ful , complicated , interesting complex , confident female characters , right ?
attractive , cu@@ te , and fl@@ ir@@ ty , she is the ideal girl and Bri@@ an 's prize throughout the entire film . "
( la@@ ughter ) And I said , " Oh . that 's funny .
we 'll just make our own movie .
so , you do understand that at some point you are going to have to hire a male producer on@@ board , right ?
just so that people will trust you with their money . "
it 's just the way it is . "
it 's just the way it is .
it happens , maybe , out of a genuine desire to teach a young woman the way that the world " just is . "
the problem is that unless we do something about it , that is the way the world will always be .
right ?
that affects all of us .
they 're the way we develop em@@ pa@@ thy for people who have experiences different than our own .
and so you don 't get change by asking them or even y@@ elling at them .
now , please don 't worry -- I promise you , here , now , today , our body count will be very low .
( la@@ ughter ) So , now before I get to my four @@@ -@@ @ point plan for the revolution -- yes , I have a four @@@ -@@ @ point plan -- I have two pieces of very good and important news for you .
good news number one : there are female fil@@ m@@ makers .
we actually graduate from film schools at the same rate that men do -- 50 percent .
but the good news is , we exist , and there is a vast amount of un@@ tapped potential over here .
( che@@ ers and appl@@ ause ) It 's true .
the Washington Post recently released a study showing that films that feature women make 23 cents more on every dollar than films that don 't .
fact : women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets .
we have so many stories to tell .
and despite everything we 've heard : you want to see them .
or not ?
I 'm telling you , once you see this , you 're not going to be able to un@@ see it .
Don 't wait for permission .
if we can figure out how to make our movies and deliver them to the audiences that want them , that 's it .
that 's the whole game .
and whatever they 're doing in the middle is going to cease to be quite so important .
if you can give a female fil@@ m@@ maker 25 dollars in a crow@@ d@@ funding campaign , great , do that .
come pick it up .
this is about making a better world .
so the traffic moved a bit , and I quickly gra@@ bbed a copy , and we moved on .
looking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact that not much has changed in the education curricula in Africa .
some decades back , I was taught out of a similar alphabet sheet .
and because of that , I struggled for years .
I looked at my ance@@ stry , I looked at my line@@ age with dis@@ respect .
it took a lot of experiences and some studies for me to begin to have a change of mind@@ set .
I was in the United States in Washington , DC studying towards my doctorate , and I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region .
he said this project was@@ n 't so sustainable , and it bo@@ thered those that instituted the whole package .
the plant can only assimil@@ ate as much water as needed until harvest time .
in an experiment that was conducted , two similar plots of land were used in the experiment , and one plot of land did not have the T@@ ass@@ a technique on it .
the other one had T@@ ass@@ a technique constructed on it .
the plot of land with T@@ ass@@ a technique yielded 5@@ 53 kilograms of mil@@ let per hec@@ tare .
he said , " Oh , when I go to Africa , it 's so easy .
my bos@@ ses are happy with me . "
and I looked across the table at my African brothers and sisters .
you own the knowledge . you know it all .
that 's a record .
I agree with M@@ wal@@ im@@ u .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you .
" Rob@@ am k@@ b@@ ach Bor@@ an , " or the art of Khmer classical dance , is more than 1,000 years old .
all of these curves create a ser@@ pen@@ tine impression , and this is important because before the introduction of major religions , Kh@@ mers , and people all over the world practiced anim@@ ism .
we have four primary hand ge@@ stures that we use .
can we do them together ?
so for example , I can say , " I. "
( la@@ ughter ) " Go . "
the artist -- the sil@@ ap@@ ak@@ ar , or the sil@@ ap@@ ak@@ aran@@ i , then , is nothing short of a mag@@ ician .
they became the oppression that they sought to end .
they t@@ ore families apart and bra@@ in@@ washed children against their own parents .
in other words , nine out of 10 visions for the tradition and future were lost .
yet beauty is a most resilient thing .
beauty is a liberation from suffering .
I am the incar@@ nation of the beauty , dreams and power of those who came before me .
over 40 percent of Americans check their phones within five minutes of wa@@ king up every morning .
and then they look at it another 50 times during the day .
they have the power to tell us more about what a child is learning than a standardized test can .
Maria dropped the mouse , pushed back from the table , le@@ ap@@ ed up and started w@@ aving fran@@ tically back at him .
this was a human experience .
fear number one : " screens are passive .
could those cameras capture a very natural k@@ id play pattern -- pre@@ tending to be animals ? "
and researchers came in and had 80 prescho@@ ol@@ ers play these games .
and this is the computer 's prediction of each child 's score , based on playing some Cu@@ rious George games .
so the third fear I want to address is the one that I think is often the biggest .
just the act of talking to kids about their media can be incredibly powerful .
last summer , Texas Tech University published a study that the show " Daniel Tig@@ er 's Neigh@@ bor@@ hood " could promote the development of em@@ pa@@ thy among children .
what if we start talking to kids regularly about the content on these screens ?
but first , I think it 's important to recognize that we brought this problem on ourselves .
and it 's not just because , you know , we are the one building the robots .
the first is that these narrowly defined jobs will be the first to be displaced by robots , because single @@@ -@@ @ task robots are just the easiest kinds to build .
our entrepreneurs and engineers already live in this world , but so do our nurses and our plum@@ bers and our therap@@ ists .
a few years ago , I was working at a large bank that was trying to bring more innovation into its company culture .
this contest was not only a chance to build anything that you wanted but also be anything that you wanted .
for those few weeks , people got to be creators and inno@@ v@@ ators .
and it 's when we 're most anno@@ yed and most curious that we 're motivated to di@@ g into a problem and create change .
because when you can bring your Saturday self to work on Wedn@@ es@@ days , you 'll look forward to Mon@@ days more , and those feelings that we have about Mon@@ days are part of what makes us human .
and music has psychological effects on us .
it invo@@ kes feelings of no@@ st@@ alg@@ ia , happiness , sad@@ ness , falling in love .
in doing that , I become a bridge between the hearing world and the De@@ af world , making sure that I 'm representing music and the arti@@ stry of what music represents .
looking down in the audience and seeing De@@ af and hard @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ hearing members , all of those people dancing and j@@ am@@ ming out and feeling included in that music experience .
hair up in a bu@@ n that 's the most fun .
top k@@ not turn up . it 's a top k@@ not turn up .
my time is not your property when I 'm productive like my ov@@ aries .
please do not trouble me when I am focused .
( la@@ ughter and che@@ ers ) So I 'm here to build the alternative instead .
thinking about how we could be so much better .
all my bad habits have got to , got to go .
all my bad habits have got to , got to go .
( music ends ) ( Appl@@ ause and che@@ ers ) Than@@ k you .
I recently read about what the young generation of workers want in Harvard Business Review .
we were at the border .
when we were in the middle of the frozen river , we were fil@@ ming about the condition of the cold weather and the environment that North Kore@@ ans had to deal with when they seek their freedom .
then I saw my colleague La@@ ura L@@ ing fall on her knees .
at that moment , he raised his rifle to hit me , but I saw that he was hes@@ itating .
and I got up .
she said , " We are the enemy . "
and I was supposed to be frigh@@ tened , too .
but I kept having these odd experiences .
this time , an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm , because I lost my coat on the frozen river while batt@@ ling with one of these soldiers .
to us , North Korea was always the enemy , even before I was born .
now , back to my detention .
this young guard came to my cell and offered me this small bo@@ iled egg and said , " This will give you strength to keep going . "
do you know what it is like , receiving a small kindness in the enemy 's hand ?
whenever they were kind to me , I thought the worst case was waiting for me after the kindness .
one officer noticed my ner@@ v@@ ousness .
at that time , I really had nothing else to do , so I paid attention to these two female guards and listened to what they were talking about .
guard B stopped by my room to say good@@ b@@ ye , because she was leaving the detention center .
now I 'm back home and back to my life .
and I 'm in this place where I read and hear about North Korea provo@@ king the US .
the 2050 narrative started to evolve shortly after global food prices hit all @@@ -@@ @ time high@@ s in 2008 .
we could have a ti@@ pping point in global food and agriculture if sur@@ ging demand sur@@ passes the agricultural system 's structural capacity to produce food .
that 's the point I decided to walk away from a career on Wall Street and start an entrepreneurial journey to start G@@ ro Intelligence .
now , no one knows we 've been working on this problem and this is the first time that I 'm sharing what we discovered .
why do we talk about food in terms of weight ?
but what we care about in food is nutritional value .
this map shows you where the world was 40 years ago .
and what 's surprising is that China used to actually be food self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient .
how is it that two regions that started off so similarly in such similar trajec@@ tories take such different paths ?
this will be driven both by the fact that demand is growing from a population growth standpoint plus economic growth .
next , Africa will continue to be a net importer of cal@@ ories , again driven by population growth and economic growth .
we have the solution .
we just need to act on it .
so before I do that , just one warning , which is that this presentation has been rated ' R ' by the Mo@@ tion Pic@@ ture Association of America .
( la@@ ughter ) Because crack cocaine was an un@@ beli@@ evable innovation .
so this is where we enter the picture .
not really me -- I 'm really a bit player in all this .
now , the three months before he came to Chicago , he had spent following the Gr@@ at@@ eful De@@ ad .
the first building ? well , there 's nobody there .
but he hears some voices up in the stair@@ well , so he clim@@ bs up the stair@@ well , comes around the corner , and finds a group of young African @@@ -@@ @ American men playing dic@@ e .
you don 't like to be surprised .
now , Sud@@ h@@ ir was lucky -- he was such a f@@ rea@@ k , and that clip@@ board probably saved his life , because they fig@@ ured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clip@@ board .
the hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $ 3.@@ 50 an hour .
this was the best way out .
why is it such a bad job ?
well , the reason it 's such a bad job is that there 's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time .
so for comparison 's purposes , let 's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky .
I think the first one is that they got fool@@ ed by history .
it used to be the gang was a rite of passage ; that the young people controlled the gang ; that as you got older , you dropped out of the gang .
the first set of people in Sil@@ icon Valley got very , very rich .
indeed , the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s are still running the major gangs in Chicago today .
and so for instance , one thing the gang would do is -- the gang leaders would have big ent@@ oura@@ ges , and they 'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry .
so it turns out -- I 'm sort of getting ahead of myself -- it turns out , in the gang , when there 's a war going on , they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money .
so if I g@@ onn@@ a be asked to put my life on the line , then front me the cash , man . "
one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like -- the gang leader always got paid .
( la@@ ughter ) May@@ be " weak and sh@@ it " is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis .
( music ) [ Eric D@@ yer ] [ Anim@@ ator ] [ compos@@ itor ] And at night , I would make my own experimental films .
( music ) And I was spending a lot of time , way too much time , in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen , and I had this great need to get my hands back on the work again .
I took these ideas to Denmark .
now , I invented my own form of the zo@@ e@@ tro@@ pe , which removes the drum and replaces the sl@@ its with a video camera .
it is an imag@@ inary , super @@@ -@@ @ magn@@ ified medical device that fits around the optic nerve .
and instead of a visually intensive process in the studio , primarily , I 'm also getting out@@ doors a lot more and using more of my senses .
this landscape is a couple hours east of San Di@@ ego , California .
my brother lives out that way .
and next to the print piece there 's a video monitor that shows the animation hidden within the art@@ work .
now , I want to leave you with a tribute to one of my ment@@ ors .
( dog bar@@ king ) ( Do@@ g bar@@ king and spring bo@@ inging ) Than@@ k you .
I get this question a lot .
question five : why are co@@ workers often attracted to each other ?
well , the obvious answer is people tend to be attracted to each other the more time they spend together .
and I always tried to reas@@ sure them .
and I 've read article after article b@@ emo@@ an@@ ing ...
it 's hard not to feel num@@ b .
but we resha@@ pe that imbalance by speaking out against it in un@@ ison and by creating spaces to speak truth to power .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't have to perform our pain over and over again for the sake of your awareness .
we also try to teach survivors to not lean into their trauma , but to lean into the joy that they cur@@ ate in their lives instead .
he was born ensla@@ ved , his parents were ensla@@ ved , and he had no reason to believe that a black man in America w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't die a slave .
in 2006 , 12 years ago , I laid across a mat@@ tress on my floor in my one @@@ -@@ @ bedroom apartment , frustrated with all the sexual violence that I saw in my community .
I know some of y '@@ all are tired , because I 'm tired .
we owe future generations a world free of sexual violence .
off the ru@@ gged coast of the pac@@ ific northwest , po@@ ds of kill@@ er wh@@ ales in@@ habit the fri@@ g@@ id waters .
the matri@@ arch shows the younger wh@@ ales where to find the most fertile fishing grounds .
in the long term , we 'll need more studies like the Center for Wh@@ ale Research 's .
but when Scot@@ t 's party finally reached the pole , losing the " race " was the least of their problems .
but the journeys of these early explo@@ rers are not forgotten .
he do@@ es@@ n 't ask my mom for the invitation that 's at the bottom of her very volum@@ inous pur@@ se .
and the fact that we were too poor to have our own car -- that was a story he told himself .
( la@@ ughter ) And so they proceeded to engage this gent@@ l@@ eman in a very robust discussion of his decision @@@ -@@ @ making skills .
( la@@ ughter ) My father may have mentioned that he was going to spend eternity in a very fi@@ ery place if he did@@ n 't find my name on that checklist .
no matter what I do , I ask myself three questions : what do I want ?
why do I want it ?
I want change .
but in the pursuit , I became the first black woman to ever become the nom@@ inee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party .
( appl@@ ause ) Our campaign tri@@ pled the number of L@@ ati@@ no@@ s who believed their voices mat@@ tered in the state of Georgia .
but I also understand that there are three things that always hold us hostage .
that 's why God created n@@ aps .
Cra@@ ig V@@ enter chairs that event .
you take an air@@ plane , you fly over the top , you 're weigh@@ tless for 25 seconds .
( la@@ ughter ) And he wanted to go .
well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .
we took him out to the Kennedy Space Center , up inside the NASA vehicle , into the back of the zero @@@ -@@ @ g air@@ plane .
a few TE@@ D@@ sters here .
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the air@@ plane .
we were monitoring his PO@@ 2 of his blood , his heart rate , his blood pressure .
and my partner By@@ ron L@@ ich@@ ten@@ berg and I carefully suspended him into zero @@@ -@@ @ g .
( la@@ ughter ) And a seventh and an eighth .
we are living on a precious je@@ wel , and it 's during our lifetime that we 're moving off this planet .
and it 's mostly done by women , more than 90 percent women , disproportionately women of color .
it makes it possible for all of us to go out and do what we do in the world every single day , knowing that the most precious aspects of our lives are in good hands .
I want to tell you a story of a woman I met early on in this work .
her name is L@@ ily .
and so her lawyers and I asked L@@ ily , did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her .
instead , we filed a civil lawsuit , and we eventually won the case , and her case became a r@@ all@@ ying cry for domestic workers everywhere .
inside that processing center , there were hundreds of children who were being held , processed and then prepared to be shipped all over country to be jail@@ ed in facilities hundreds of miles away from their parents .
how ?
they love and they care , and they show compassion no matter what .
we live in a time of moral choices everywhere we turn : at the border , at the ballot box , in our workplaces , right in our homes , full of moral choices .
actually , that 's not true .
they have a mix of chro@@ mos@@ ome types with X , with X@@ Y or with XXX .
they 're finding that the brain is like a pat@@ ch@@ work mosaic -- a mixture .
you can think of it like this : inside our cells , there 's different contra@@ ptions building things , connecting circuits , doing all the things they need to make life happen .
and then this one is carrying a huge sa@@ c of neuro@@ transmit@@ ters from one end of the brain cell to the other .
( la@@ ughter ) This one is an entire molecular factory -- some say it 's the secret to life .
they dissolve , and then they 're rebuilt each day , kind of like a traveling car@@ ni@@ val where the ri@@ des are taken down and then rebuilt every single day .
in our cells , there are no such skilled craf@@ t@@ smen , only dum@@ b buil@@ der machines that build whatever 's written in the plans , no matter what those plans say .
that 's where DNA comes in .
( la@@ ughter ) So , instead it changes shape , and that 's where those DNA kno@@ ts come in .
to truly understand DNA decision @@@ -@@ @ making , we need to see the process of k@@ not formation in atomic detail .
what if we tried to simulate these on a computer ?
for that we 'd need a million computers to do that .
so here we 're showing the DNA making up an entire gene folded into very specific shapes of kno@@ ts .
for the first time , my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA -- the largest biom@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular simulation performed to date .
it 's directly related to intellectual disability and breast cancer .
these DNA decisions also happen in other parts of the body .
so the current working model is that a unique mix in my mom 's wom@@ b caused the precursor gen@@ itals to transform one way , but the precursor brain to transform the other way .
sometimes it raises eye@@ bro@@ ws , but it also raises awareness .
there 's so many transgender people -- especially women of color -- that are just one de@@ meaning comment away from taking their own lives .
on the other hand , maybe it 's our shared sense of common@@ ality that makes us women .
and to be honest , for many years , my answer would be , " I don 't know . I simply love learning languages . "
what an ing@@ en@@ ious method , right ?
but we can create that time if we just plan a bit ahead .
now , some of you may be thinking , " That 's all very nice to enjoy language learning , but is@@ n 't the real secret that you poly@@ g@@ lots are just super talented and most of us are@@ n 't ? "
and then Luc@@ as started to experiment with methods , looking for his own way to learn , for example , by having Skype chat conversations with str@@ angers .
stories that offer transformation , that lean into trans@@ cend@@ ence , but that are never senti@@ mental , that never look away from the dar@@ k@@ est things about us .
in South Africa , they have a phrase called U@@ buntu .
I don 't really see it , I don 't pay attention to it until there 's , you know , like a bug that 's dead on the window .
then suddenly I see it , and usually , it 's never good .
I should tell you some stories about remarkable people , so I thought I 'd start with my mother .
this is how English my mother is -- or was , she just passed .
( la@@ ughter ) And , " How sw@@ ol@@ len is your vul@@ va ? "
it takes her one year , through refugee camp after refugee camp , to make her way to an air@@ strip where we can fly out of the country .
at every single refugee camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark , who was nine , and make him a boy soldier .
and she said , " You know , you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble , any kind of horror .
and they would sing them only when they planted the rice , as though they were see@@ ding the hearts of the dead into the rice .
but when it came for harvest time , they would sing these joy@@ ful songs , that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year .
but today , women are rebuilding Rwanda .
their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .
anyway , a go@@ at 's eyes are like a child 's eyes .
I was a w@@ im@@ p .
and then afterwards he said to me , " It will always be difficult , but if you cry like this every time , you will die of heart@@ break .
so , here was this 14 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old k@@ id on death row .
and when he got tired of reading them , he started to teach the men in death row how to read , with these com@@ ic books .
this was my " Hello , World ! " of experi@@ menting with printing with pollution .
this is the same pollution that I showed you in the pe@@ tr@@ i dish , which is the result of any fossil fuel that is being burned out there .
we took a garage , and during the early stages , we were driving around Bang@@ al@@ ore with contra@@ ptions like these .
suc@@ k it up .
why do I act the way that I act ?
it was in a circle session that my life took a turn .
my desire is for them to understand that being a man is not some mach@@ is@@ mo car@@ ic@@ ature , and that characteristics usually defined as weaknesses are parts of the whole healthy man .
eventually this sophisticated che@@ es@@ emaking tool spread around the globe , giving way to a wide variety of new , harder che@@ eses .
in the Alps , Swiss che@@ es@@ emaking was particularly successful - producing a myriad of cow 's milk che@@ eses .
voting is one of our most fundamental rights .
when we look at comparable democracies , the US has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the world .
I work with thousands of local election officials across the country to build tools and skills that they can use immediately to transform the way that they 're engaging today 's voters .
they recruit and train the volunteers at your local polling place .
all of the new tools that people were using to get information -- the internet , social media -- they were difficult to figure out how to use effectively .
to K@@ at and Marie , not having and election website was unacceptable , but they did@@ n 't have very many options .
it 's already transformed how we connect with one another and understand the world around us , but our democratic institutions -- they 're being left behind .
K@@ at and Marie are online now .
in 2016 , the Bal@@ lot Information Project connected the public with information about candidates and referen@@ da over 200 millions times , helping between a third and a half of every single person who cast a ballot .
that kind of transformation is possible in voting .
now , if you have any technical bone in your body , I know what you 're thinking .
we collectively have the expertise .
investment in technology and investment in the skills of local election officials to run 21st @@@ -@@ @ century elections , because if we don 't invest in the long game , we risk finding ourselves perpe@@ tually behind .
organizations that are doing this work year @@@ -@@ @ round need you .
this was my first time there , and as I observed , I saw that there was one person that was responsible for recording the outcome of a conversation .
so here was my opportunity to see exactly how that worked .
nothing really special , but a good pair of hands . "
who is going to speak for me ?
you CA@@ N@@ NOT have a 100 percent mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic environment when there is a human element involved in the evalu@@ ative equation , because by definition , that makes it subjective .
what do you call this person ? "
it was almost two years later when I realized what this person should be called .
and frankly , why do you need one ? "
and number three , it may attract a sponsor .
but here 's where the other currency is now most important .
the first is he do@@ es@@ n 't think that he has enough exposure to your work to have real credibility behind closed doors to be imp@@ ac@@ tful and effective on your behalf .
I CA@@ N@@ NOT tell you how important it is to have a sponsor .
if you have been invited into the room , know that you have a seat at that table , and if you have a seat at the table , you have a responsibility to speak .
use it .
for now , however , he was only a slave - one of millions taken from the territories conqu@@ ered by Rome to work the mines , till the fields , or fight for the crowd 's entertainment .
when the news reached Rome , the Senate was too busy with wars in Spain and the Pon@@ tic Empire to worry about some un@@ ru@@ ly slaves .
un@@ concerned , pra@@ e@@ tor Cla@@ u@@ dius G@@ lab@@ er took an army of three thousand men to the rebel 's refuge at Mount Ve@@ su@@ vi@@ us , and blocked off the only passage up the mountain .
all that remained was to wait and star@@ ve them out@@ - or so he thought .
after failed attempts to build rafts , and a stin@@ ging betra@@ yal by local pirates , the rebels made a desperate run to break through Cra@@ s@@ sus 's lin@@ es@@ - but it was no use .
of course , I was immediately intri@@ gu@@ ed .
and to my aston@@ ishment , she agreed to let me photograph her grand@@ daughter .
the family had a small shed on the side of the house , so I said , " C@@ ould I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings ? "
the grand@@ mother was incredibly f@@ ond , deeply in love with this little girl .
the way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bric@@ ks under the floors , so the heat radi@@ ates from under@@ ne@@ ath the floor .
I had photograph@@ ed , as I said , a lot of these kids .
I noticed that at rec@@ ess , she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team .
it was incredibly cold .
I said , " Well , tell him that I was asked by this little girl 's grand@@ mother to find a family for her . "
and as we started talking , I saw him y@@ ell something , and Eu@@ n @@@ -@@ @ So@@ ok came and brought us some food .
and I was really app@@ alled , and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't figure out what to do .
but I bought an airline ticket and I 'm stuck here for a week .
and the pictures before were taken in September .
and I always felt that the grand@@ mother had kind of demanded , and insisted , that the villagers treat Eu@@ n @@@ -@@ @ So@@ ok with the same respect they treated her .
G@@ ay@@ le cou@@ ld@@ n 't come .
and they spent a lot of time h@@ ud@@ dled over a dictionary .
now , we went out to dinner that night to celebrate .
and Gen@@ e was showing Nat@@ asha how to use a knife and for@@ k , and then Nat@@ asha was returning the u@@ tensi@@ l lessons .
so at 1@@ am , the whole room would be like 20 below zero , and I 'd get up .
so the two of us were just like , " Oh my God , oh my God . "
this has got to be a night@@ mare , this can 't be happening .
and the other is un@@ beli@@ evable guilt .
it was one of just the most horri@@ fying nights .
so , these are the greenhouse tents .
we were both so drunk , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe it .
this is the last picture before Gen@@ e and T@@ im headed back .
this is saying good@@ b@@ ye to everybody at the orphan@@ age .
I had a wonderful deal with Cath@@ ay Pacific airlines for many years , where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography .
just to make things even cra@@ z@@ ier , G@@ ay@@ le , Nat@@ asha 's new mom , was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter .
gene and G@@ ay@@ le know everyone in Atlanta -- they 're the most social couple imagin@@ able .
so , at this point , Nat@@ asha do@@ es@@ n 't speak a word of English , other than what little Father Ke@@ ane taught her .
she 's being baptized .
now , a lot of parents , when they adopt , actually want to er@@ ase their children 's history .
she h@@ ates this picture -- it was her first job .
gene 's been restoring this car for a million years .
this is her first trip back to Korea . so there 's her uncle .
that 's her best friend 's mother .
this is Sydney , who 's going to be three years old in a couple of days .
and there 's E@@ van .
some years ago , I was visiting Paris and walking along the Se@@ ine River during a beautiful summer afternoon .
when I was there , a man bought a pair of sticks for 10 euros , which surprised me .
I know the right trick to make the giant bubbles is the right so@@ apy water mixture itself -- not the sticks , which may be needed , but you can easily make them at home .
so I would like to share with you a few stories about the science of creating bubbles and the science of eliminating the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic ones .
but how do we kick them out ?
even some plants use m@@ im@@ ic@@ ry : there are or@@ ch@@ ids that look and smell like female was@@ ps to attract ha@@ pl@@ ess males , who end up pol@@ lin@@ ating the plant .
that sends me@@ er@@ k@@ ats , p@@ ied bab@@ bl@@ ers , and others d@@ ashing for cover .
but the d@@ ron@@ go will also sound a false alarm when those other species have captured prey .
and that works - bl@@ u@@ ff@@ ers are more likely to keep their homes than non @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ u@@ ff@@ ers .
I am a woman leading a department in a male @@@ -@@ @ dominated profession .
( cou@@ gh@@ s ) Exc@@ use me .
I am trained to put out many different types of fires .
as a first respon@@ der , I consider myself the cav@@ al@@ ry .
we 're k@@ nights in sh@@ ining arm@@ or .
but that just do@@ es@@ n 't happen when we 're dealing with somebody with substance use disorder .
and you know what ?
at some point , I realized that it is up to us as first respon@@ ders and as a community to solve this problem , to find better ways to deal with those that are suffering .
so what I did is I started observing more on over@@ doses .
I wanted to know what led them to where they are .
what exactly are they experiencing ?
the education that I have received and continue to receive on a street level in Hun@@ ting@@ ton has been both eye @@@ -@@ @ opening and life @@@ -@@ @ changing for me .
as a team , they go out and visit people who have over@@ dos@@ ed within 72 hours of that re@@ su@@ sc@@ itation .
a patient comes in , they 're immediately assessed by somebody who 's an addiction specialist .
this does several things for us .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) We 've also provided on @@@ -@@ @ duty massages , which is fab@@ ulous .
and I had@@ n 't seen that in years .
and that relaxed state is tr@@ ick@@ ling down to the community , to the citizens .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old .
talking in a non @@@ -@@ @ judg@@ mental way .
and left him with a bag valve mask .
( la@@ ughter ) You know , I recognize that there have been drug epidemics before .
and I understand that criticism , because we as a country mess@@ ed up .
we can 't forget that .
and we in Hun@@ ting@@ ton deal with people suffering from substance use disorder of every color and every background , on the streets , every day .
the job of a first respon@@ der : prevent unnecessary deaths .
obviously , I 'm a stub@@ born fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter and nurse .
so ...
our current over@@ doses are down 40 percent .
but each and every one of us has a part to play in this epidemic .
representation matters .
authentic representations of women matter .
Sh@@ ir@@ ley Ch@@ ish@@ ol@@ m , the first woman to seek the US Democratic party 's presidential nomination -- ( Appl@@ ause ) As a museum cur@@ ator , I understand why these stories are so se@@ duc@@ tive .
exceptional women are inspiring and aspir@@ ational .
but those stories are limiting .
those stories do not create a broad base for incorporating women 's history , and they don 't reflect our daily realities .
museums are actually rated one of the most trust@@ worthy sources of information in the United States , and with hundreds of millions of visitors from all over the world , we should tell accurate hi@@ stories , but we don 't .
through the display of art and arti@@ facts , we can incite creativity and foster inclusion , but we are guilty of historical mis@@ representation .
or immigrant women , or Asian women , or Native women , or trans women , or undocumented women , or women over 65 , or girls -- the list can go on and on and on .
I am so pro@@ ud@@ ly and inextricably both .
they called my slides " activist , " and they meant that negatively .
( appl@@ ause and che@@ ers )
I 'm born in the Western Congo , in an area around here , and then went to university in Kisangani .
and for three to four years , I went to university .
it has also ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es .
on their way , they looted everything .
I 've been working with him about 10 years .
because he 's Py@@ g@@ my , he knows how to track ele@@ ph@@ ants in the forest .
he has been attacked by a le@@ op@@ ard and they abandon him in the forest .
we don 't think so .
I say , " No way , you are not going to do it here . "
and he asked me , " Do you know how to use this ? "
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dis@@ sect it , until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander .
but now I think that I would have titled it , " The Language of Gun@@ s . "
now we are talking about re@@ constitution , rebuild Africa .
everybody is happy , but see what it 's doing , see what is going in Darfur .
I did it myself .
many , many of you have seen the talents of Africans , but there are few who are going to school .
many people were beaten and thrown in jail .
the question before us tonight is very serious .
and despite everything , I still believe in America .
the only reason why I care about a changing climate is because of who I already am .
( la@@ ughter ) But fear is not what is going to motivate us for the long @@@ -@@ @ term , sustained change that we need to fix this thing .
( la@@ ughter ) What we need to fix this thing is rational hope .
yes , light bul@@ bs .
I love my plug @@@ -@@ @ in car .
now , I live in Texas , and Texas has the highest carbon emissions of any state in the United States .
well , climate impacts might seem a little further down the road , but air quality impacts are right here today .
( appl@@ ause ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Yes , they 're still burning coal .
India may be the first country to industri@@ alize without relying primarily on fossil fuels .
but it just is@@ n 't changing fast enough .
it just is@@ n 't going fast enough .
you gu@@ essed it .
one treatment changed everything .
after two courses of electro@@ con@@ vul@@ sive therapy , or EC@@ T , her symptoms lifted .
they may feel ach@@ y , fati@@ gu@@ ed , or na@@ us@@ e@@ ated right after treatment .
ne@@ ur@@ ons in the brain communicate via electrical signals , which influence our brain chemistry , contributing to mood and behavior .
EC@@ T also stimulates the flow of hormones that may help reduce symptoms of depression .
the question now , however , is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation .
but we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions .
most of the globe experiences the state as repressive , as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights , about denial of justice , rather than provision of it .
and in terms of experience of capitalism , there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences .
who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today , if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943 ?
the least important form of capital , in this project , is financial capital -- money .
it 's just cash .
it takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D.
the first challenge is to re@@ think , fundamentally , the issue of the time .
the absolute majority of the world 's population are below 20 , and they are growing larger and faster .
but if you don 't think through the problems of corruption , who will ?
as the work on paradig@@ ms , long time ago showed -- Thomas Ku@@ hn 's work -- it 's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true break@@ through@@ s -- occur .
and I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor , through this means .
so the first is when the scale is that , we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure .
how to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror .
I mean , I really can 't believe how lucky I am here , standing in front of you , speaking .
I think we can make it , and the reason we can make it is because of the people .
yes , I have an advisory position with the U.@@ N.
what we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms .
so I think economically , the critical issue really is to now think through .
I 'm all for it ; after all , I raised a lot of it .
second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents ; it could be 20 cents ; or it could be four dollars .
you would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidi@@ zing to function in developing countries , provide advice , but they do .
and along came a brilliant inven@@ tor , a scientist , who came up with a partial cure for that disease .
and they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds and up .
but indeed , in recent crashes the lap @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ shoulder se@@ at@@ belts , actually , are doing even better than the car seats .
they say , " Well , that 's impossible , that can 't be . "
we can 't risk alien@@ ating them by testing se@@ at@@ belts relative to car seats . "
and so , we went to Bu@@ ff@@ alo , New York , and here is the precursor to it .
and then , here 's how the crash test works .
so I just wanted you to look at this .
the car seat 's moving all over the place .
and so this is a test that 's very much rig@@ ged in favor of the car seat , OK ? so , that k@@ id in this crash fa@@ red very well .
so , in some sense , what this is suggesting is that it 's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong , which is putting children at risk . it 's just that , fundamentally , the car seats are@@ n 't doing much .
it 's just actually -- you see , this is folding up -- it 's behind the seat .
it seems to me that this can 't be a very expensive solution , and it 's got to work better than what we already have .
this is a cli@@ p from a game called " Grand The@@ ft Auto 3 . "
and what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .
I 've made him run into a wall here , over and over again .
and maybe , if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because , I mean , it 's very , very tri@@ vial .
thank you very much . Chris An@@ derson : that 's it ?
those are then selected by the algorithm , reproduced with mu@@ tation and re@@ combinations to introduce sex as well .
we did get it to work eventually , after t@@ we@@ aking a bit here and there .
and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
at the beginning , it can 't walk at all , but it will get better and better over time .
now , at this stage , it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds .
and what you see is , it 's going to fall over the obstacle .
and again , if you move the obstacle a tiny bit , it 'll again fall differently .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , what you see , by the way , at the top there , are some of the ne@@ ural acti@@ vations being fed into the virtual muscles .
so we put quite a bit of biom@@ echan@@ ical knowledge into this thing , and tried to make it as realistic as possible .
now , what I 'm going to do right now , in a moment , is just push this character a tiny bit and we 'll see what happens .
it falls over , but it falls over like a ra@@ g doll , basically .
it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it .
now , it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well .
what you see is it takes steps back@@ wards , it tries to counter @@@ -@@ @ balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land .
and then , finally hits the floor .
that 's something that you CA@@ N@@ NOT do right now .
what this is now is a real simulation . that 's what I want to show you now .
that was the first time we 've seen that .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stun@@ t@@ man and that 's what we 've been working on for the past few months .
in this case , they were using a real st@@ unt man . it was a very dangerous st@@ unt .
it was just voted , I think in the Sunday Times , as one of the most impressive stun@@ ts .
now , we 've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves , " Can we do that ourselves as well ? "
there 's very often very surprising behavior that you did@@ n 't predict before .
several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stun@@ t@@ men , and they 're going to hit the screen quite soon , actually , for some major productions .
but I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that Tom Mel@@ cher has shown us .
so it 's just -- ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ ks .
so , I wanted to follow that rule .
but it was really interesting , because I was able to make some progress , because I cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts .
this was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that I almost pre@@ tended to be a better person , and I became a little bit of a better person .
you don@@ ate money to a cause , and you become emo@@ tionally involved in that cause .
and I explained my project , and he said , " Well , I am an adul@@ te@@ rer , are you going to stone me ? "
so I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take @@@ -@@ @ a@@ ways , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year .
well , that 's another . I did spend some time shepher@@ ding .
and it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all .
they really did a fantastic job .
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the Sab@@ bath , because I am a work@@ a@@ hol@@ ic , so having this one day where you CA@@ N@@ NOT work , it really , that changed my life .
thou shall not stereo@@ type .
I wanted it to be about religion in America .
I 'm very proud because I think I 'm the only person in America to out Bible @@@ -@@ @ talk a Jehovah 's W@@ itness .
thank you . bless you , bless you .
and their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality .
you blow out cand@@ les on top of a birthday cake .
so the key is to choose the right rit@@ uals , the ones that are not harmful -- but rit@@ uals by themselves are not to be dismissed .
and finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose .
and this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible .
the key is to pick and choose the right parts .
( la@@ ughter ) But if I say , " What color is Ul@@ tra She@@ en ? " -- oh , a smile emerges , stories about their grand@@ mother 's bathroom ensu@@ e .
" He@@ y , did you paint that ? "
and I refuse to be an accompl@@ ice to genocide .
people have said that yes , the internet came , its promise was to expon@@ entially explo@@ de our access to more democracy , more information , less bias , more varied information .
and this is a -- this is what they 've decided to do .
and he said , " I love my wife , she is part of me , we 've been together for decades . "
but what about fast @@@ -@@ @ moving plants ?
and to understand why that is , we need to know a little bit more about the behavior of the F@@ ly@@ trap .
so how does it do that ?
it counts the number of seconds between successive touching of those ha@@ irs .
so now if I go back in there and if I 'm a fly moving around , I 'm going to be touching the leaf a few times .
there 's no bra@@ ins in here .
thank you .
today , I study implicit gender bias in start @@@ -@@ @ ups , which I consider to be far more insi@@ di@@ ous than mere over@@ t bias for this very same reason .
well , despite the comparability of companies in my sample , male @@@ -@@ @ led start @@@ -@@ @ ups went on to raise five times as much funding as the female @@@ -@@ @ led ones .
I first analyzed the trans@@ cripts by loading a dictionary of regulatory @@@ -@@ @ focused terms into the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Coun@@ t software called LI@@ WC .
well , the very first thing that I found is that there 's no difference in the way entrepreneurs present their companies .
I then moved on to analyze entrepreneurs ' responses to those questions , and I found that entrepreneurs are apt to respond in kind to the questions they get , meaning a promotion question be@@ gets a promotion response and a prevention question be@@ gets a prevention response .
those pl@@ uc@@ ky entrepreneurs who managed to switch focus by responding to prevention questions with promotion answers went on to raise 14 times more funding than those who responded to prevention questions with prevention answers .
the d@@ war@@ ves ! - their legendary sm@@ i@@ ths could make anything .
the ra@@ bb@@ its are her@@ m@@ aph@@ ro@@ di@@ tic , and each rab@@ bit in a given cell will breed once with every rab@@ bit in the horizontally adjacent cells , producing exactly one off@@ spring each time .
that means you don 't actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold all the ra@@ bb@@ its - and the reproduction is already underway !
all we need to figure out is how many tra@@ iling zer@@ os it has .
your statement still has to be carefully craf@@ ted .
if " you will free my brother " is true , then the tro@@ ll has to release your brother .
so , does anybody recognize the artist on the left ?
I heard " Ro@@ th@@ ko , " ye@@ ah .
so there 's three people in front of the Ro@@ th@@ ko on the left , so you take the third letter , which is a T.
this coin .
what I did@@ n 't mention before is that the prize for winning is that you get to construct the whole hun@@ t for the following year .
and what 's incredible to me is that this experience , which is very emotional and kind of almost physical , is something that can be carefully designed .
who here knows what " Se@@ tt@@ lers " is ?
( la@@ ughter ) But what this puzzle emphasized for me is the value of perspective shifts in inspiring an a@@ ha .
and not a single one had a book in their hands .
and what they 're doing is empowering Indians in all kinds of extraordinary ways .
and yet , none of these changes that I was seeing around me were reflected in my world , my world of books .
I moved into a single large room in a cheap bo@@ hem@@ ian district of Delhi , with a small team .
I 'd have to fit into their lifestyle and schedules .
the idea was to be relevant to every moment of a reader 's life .
and one day , you get an in @@@ -@@ @ app notification and it says that your favorite actress has written a sex@@ y short story and it 's waiting for you .
it starts as small as a po@@ em , an ess@@ ay , a single short story ...
he was convinced he had stories in his mind .
and what he loved about it was that he felt this was a place where he could stand head and shoulders , equally , with the very writers that he most admi@@ red .
it 's not an exagg@@ eration to say that a threat to the ozone layer is a threat to human safety .
and in fact , Mid@@ g@@ ley fam@@ ously inhal@@ ed CFCs and ble@@ w out a cand@@ le to demonstrate , at a scientific conference , that they were safe and non@@ flammable .
and although we now know that CFCs are the root cause of this ozone hole , at the time , the science was far from settled .
in fact , yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol .
are there any ? I think there are .
ignoring risk and focusing only on uncertainty is a distr@@ action .
this is a coin game .
it starts with a coin showing heads , and the computer will play first .
well , quantum physics describes the behavior of at@@ oms and fundamental particles , like electr@@ ons and pho@@ tons .
so a quantum computer operates by controlling the behavior of these particles , but in a way that is completely different from our regular computers .
here 's how it works .
so if you are confused by quantum , don 't worry , you 're getting it .
you 've seen the data for yourself .
nearly 100 years ago , almost today , most women in the United States finally won the right to vote .
and so I 've given some thought about how to build this women 's political revolution and that 's what I want to talk to you about today .
for the first time , 50 percent women .
and unfortunately , that 's what we 've learned the hard way in the US for women .
so , starting November 10 and going through the end of the year , they simply put an out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ office mem@@ o on their email to indicate all the weeks they were working without pay .
and so I have a few ideas about how we could do that .
mill@@ enn@@ ials , they support gender equality .
and number five : invest in women , all right ?
they can engineer drought @@@ -@@ @ resistant crops and create apples that don 't brown .
originally found defending single @@@ -@@ @ cell@@ ed bacteria and archa@@ ea against inv@@ ading viruses , naturally occurring CR@@ IS@@ PR uses two main components .
the second are C@@ as , or " CR@@ IS@@ PR @@@ -@@ @ associated " proteins which cho@@ p up DNA like molecular sc@@ iss@@ ors .
those viral codes are then copied into short pieces of R@@ NA .
with the right tools , this viral immune system becomes a precise gene @@@ -@@ @ editing tool , which can alter DNA and change specific genes almost as easily as fixing a typ@@ o .

silence is one of the most precious conditions for humans , because it allows us to feel the depth of our presence .
( h@@ um ) But silence can also be a problem .
in these situations , sound can become our precious companion .
these regulations have generated different reactions among those who favor sounds and those who fear the presence of too much noise in the city .
however , I don 't see it as the noise of the car .
so how do we go after it ?
but the streets of the 21st century are a great case study te@@ em@@ ing with transi@@ ence , cross purposes and dis@@ array .
the first one is the definition of a sonic organism , the second one is a description of sonic variations , and the third one is the composition of sound genes .
the description of a sonic organism is based on a cluster of properties that every sound that I com@@ pose should have .
[ sound is hy@@ p@@ no@@ tizing . ] And sound has the power to create an unexpected sense of wonder , which Hy@@ p@@ no@@ tiz@@ es .
and ultimately , [ Sound is super@@ human . ] sound goes beyond the human condition , because it allows us to trans@@ cend .
as a second step , we define the sonic variations .

compared with men , women small@@ holders have less access to resources , including land rights , credit and capital , training , tools and technology .
they farm as cap@@ ably and efficiently as men , but this well @@@ -@@ @ documented disparity in resources and rights means women produce less food on the same amount of land .
the implications for hunger , for health , for household income -- they 're obvious .
but if existing farms produce enough food , forests are less likely to be lost .
addressing this in@@ equity can also help women cope with the challenges of growing food as the climate changes .

fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin , which represents some 20,000 square miles .
two million years ago at Lake Turk@@ ana , Hom@@ o erec@@ tus , one of our human ancestors , actually lived in this region .

he was very able to use stones effectively as tools .
so , Hom@@ o erec@@ tus was the first human ance@@ stor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe .
but they lived only 18,000 years ago , and that is truly extraordinary to think about .
the question now is , well , who are we ?
we 're certainly a polluting , wa@@ st@@ eful , aggressive species , with a few nice things thrown in , perhaps .
( la@@ ughter ) For the most part , we 're not particularly pleasant at all .

" I can 't wait to see them racing for the first time at Day@@ t@@ ona next month , because I feel the need for speed . "
they have time . when did it take place ? dates -- when did it occur ?
so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in " The Wh@@ ale H@@ unt " and the two wh@@ ales that were killed down here .
and when they made a wish , I would write their wish onto one of the ballo@@ ons and take a picture of them holding it .

then , the " Descent of Man , " controversial book .
and then , the book about the development of the human infant .
when the book was published , William was 37 years old .
and that 's why it 's appropriate that one of his last great works is the " For@@ mation of Vege@@ table M@@ ould Th@@ rough The Action of Wor@@ ms . "

the question is why .
anger is a human emo@@ tion , neither good nor bad .
and yet , in culture after culture , anger is reserved as the moral property of boys and men .
so in the United States , for example , an angry black man is viewed as a criminal , but an angry white man has civic virtue .
so what if we did@@ n 't do that ?
what happens too often is that for all of us , indign@@ ity becomes imminent in our notions of femin@@ inity .
are you a sp@@ ic@@ y hot L@@ atin@@ a when you 're mad ?
this puts us at an enormous disadvantage , particularly when we have to defend ourselves and our own interests .
if we 're faced with a threatening street har@@ asser , pre@@ datory employer , a sex@@ ist , racist class@@ mate , our bra@@ ins are scre@@ aming , " Are you kid@@ ding me ? "
if you ask women what they fear the most in response to their anger , they don 't say violence .
think about what that means .
if you have multiple marginalized identities , it 's not just mo@@ ck@@ ery .
if you defend yourself , if you put a stake in the ground , there can be dire consequences .
now we reproduce these patterns not in big , bold and bl@@ unt ways , but in the everyday ban@@ ality of life .
his parents were there , but they never intervened before the fact .

I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired .
there is anger that 's acceptable .
let 's say , as teenagers -- patriarchal rules and regulations -- we don 't blame systems , we blame them .
and we can be angry at men with lower status in an expres@@ sive hierarchy that supports racism or xenophobia .
we can take emotions and think in terms of competence and not gender .
I 'm here to tell you how change is happening at a local level in Pakistan , because women are finding their place in the political process .
fifty percent of them won .
( appl@@ ause ) And they are now sitting in the councils , taking part actively in the legislation , planning and budgeting .
most of them are now investing their funds on women 's health , education , skill development and safe drinking water .
imagine with me a world where thousands of us stand up and they support other young women together , creating opportunities and choices that benefit all .
every year , more than 50 million people die worldwide .
and this becomes evident when we look at one aspect that many of these diseases have in common : the probability for successful treatment strongly depends on when treatment is started .
and I want to put special emphasis on the words " rapidly " and " easily " because many of the existing screening methods are exactly the opposite .
this ranges from imaging techniques such as radi@@ ography or magnetic reson@@ ance imaging to the analysis of blood or tissue .
the analysis of these volatile organic compounds in our breath is called breath analysis .
in fact , I believe that many of you have already experienced breath analysis .
now , I 'd say my driving was pretty good , but let me check .
secondly , breath analysis is non@@ invasive and can be as simple as blowing into an alcohol breath te@@ ster .
especially the latter would give access to something very valuable that is called longitudinal data .
sounds pretty great , right ?
what exactly is a disease ?
but often , this would not come without side effects .
but they did@@ n 't stick together .
Ocean currents are driven by a range of sources : the wind , ti@@ des , changes in water density , and the rotation of the Earth .
as water moves towards the North Pole , it gets col@@ der .
however , rising sea temperatures are causing the convey@@ or belt to seemingly slow down .
after losing both parents and a brother to yellow fever at the age of 16 , she supported her five remaining si@@ bl@@ ings by working as a school@@ teacher in Mem@@ ph@@ is , Tennessee .
her friends , for example , had been ly@@ n@@ ched when their gro@@ cery store became popular enough to divert business from a white competi@@ tor .
her careful documentation of the hor@@ rors of ly@@ n@@ ching and imp@@ assi@@ oned public speeches drew international attention .
although she participated in the founding of the NA@@ ACP , she was soon sidel@@ ined from the organization .
( la@@ ughter ) You know that all of the cool people are -- they 're doing it .
and you 're on the outside , you 're at home .
and I think that 's what I 'd like to talk about today .
how many of you saw USA Today , today ? there it is . looks like that .
and these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today .
what 's interesting about it is not the shape .
here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that 's what will happen in the end .
there are only 16 different pieces of wood , only 16 different assembly parts here .
it 's a great place for parties -- it was , it was only up for six weeks .
they were able to create that .
here we 're going to walk across the bridge at night .
it 's all about sen@@ su@@ ality . it 's all about transforming .
it 's about stimulation .
f@@ iz@@ zy , fresh , soft , l@@ us@@ ci@@ ous , ju@@ ic@@ y , smooth , big and sweet wines , all explained to you by color and texture on the wall .
M@@ We : I had extraordinary parents . I was so lucky .
and she always insisted , even back then , on having her own di@@ me .
but I always knew I was as smart as my brothers .
I always knew , from the time I was four years old , that I was@@ n 't going to accept being put into slots .
we did@@ n 't like it at the time , but that 's how we learned that it was our obligation to take care of those who cou@@ ld@@ n 't take care of themselves .
I remember that .
( la@@ ughter ) But they were great readers .
and they said , " It was@@ n 't much wrong with you .
and I used to go then secret@@ ly and switch water signs everywhere I went .
M@@ We : well , because so many of the things that I saw in Mississippi and across the South had to do with children .
well , I knew hundreds of them , thousands of them .
and I asked , please , come and see yourself , and when you come and see , see hungry people and see star@@ ving children .
and they came , and he brought the press , and that began to get the movement going .
but they wanted to push all the poor people to go north and to get away from being voters .
and so , you know , Head Start came , and we applied for it , because the state turned it down .
they had books that had children who looked like them in it , and we were attacked all over the place .
but it was pretty clear that whatever you called black independent or brown independent was going to have a shrinking constituency .
we must end that .
I 'm dressed like one , I guess .
in my case , it means I was born with X@@ Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , which you probably know as male chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es .
are they kind , generous , funny ?
you have your internal sex organs , your hormone production , your hormone response and your secondary sex characteristics , like breast development , body hair , etc .
did you know that besides XX or X@@ Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , you could have XX and X@@ Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es ?
where do they go ?
you know the one .
just notice .
we just automatically place each other into one box or the other , as if it actually matters .
in fact , a lot of people might not know that they 're inter@@ sex .
a friend of mine found out last year , in his 50s .
how many times have you seen kids play with the " wrong " toys for their gender ?
or try on the " wrong " clothes ?
they don 't have shame until we put it on them .
yet , because there 's such a lack of information about inter@@ sex people , my doctors never understood the difference .
they never really understood my body .
it 's just that we live in a society that causes some doctors to " fix " those of us who don 't fit their definition of normal .
it literally , most likely , just means that their hair fol@@ lic@@ les respond to testosterone in different ways .
it 's not black or white .
but now , look down , and what you 're going to see is that the rocks are covered by all sorts of sea creatures that are just staying there in place , no problem .
so these are mus@@ sels , and you 'll notice they 're covering the rocks .
what they do is they cement to each other , and they build these huge , extensive ree@@ f systems .
so they 're really quite influential .
and then another thing is it also helps with reproductive efficiency .
so we induce them to make the adhesive , we collect it , we study it .
and then this picture -- I guess let me step back before I tell you what this is .
and I just think it 's a really cool image , because you can imagine yourself flying in and going back there .
any@@ ways , those are some of the things we 're doing to understand how marine biology is making these materials .
but what we do want to do with this information ?
so imagine you 're at home and you break your favorite fig@@ urine or a mu@@ g or something like that ?
you want to put it back together .
so where do you go ?
you go to my favorite place in town , which is the glue a@@ is@@ le of the hardware store .
I know where you spend your nights , because you 're all hip , cool people , because you 're here , and you 're going to the bars and concerts -- this is where I hang out every night .
we need to scale this up , ideally maybe train car scale .
you start running around the lab , just stic@@ king stuff together .
that 's a good day in the lab . it 's stronger than super@@ glue .
and here 's something else that we can do .
and then , we want to make an adhesive bond , or joint , and so we take another piece of metal and we put it on there and just position it .
this is a tube with lead shot in it , nothing fancy .
and you pick it up .
I never know what 's going to happen .
and it 's stuck .
so we can actually get very strong underwater adhesion .
it 's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce , so for us , it 's pretty exciting . it 's pretty cool .
well , here are some products that you 're probably really familiar with .
and it sticks . it sticks really well .
but maybe more importantly , here , it 's also degra@@ dable , and we can de@@ grade it under very mild conditions , with water .
and so what we can do is we can set things up and we can bond them strongly when we want , but then we can also take them apart .
it 's something we 're thinking about .
it 's just aw@@ ful . it hur@@ ts .
so I 'd love it if we could replace systems like these with adhe@@ sives .
and if you start talking to surge@@ ons , they get pic@@ ky -- " Oh , actually I want the adhesive to set on the same time frame as the surgery . "
or , " Oh , I want the adhesive to de@@ grade so the patient 's tissues can remo@@ del the site . "
so what we 're doing is we 're getting all sorts of bones and skin and soft and hard tissue , and sometimes we 'll wh@@ ack it with a ham@@ mer .
so if you think about people putting on fake nails or e@@ yel@@ ash extensions , what do they use ?
so what I would like to encourage you all to do in the future is put down your non@@ recycl@@ able laptops and cell phones and go out and explore the natural world and then start asking some of your own questions .
thanks very much .
and we are observing that the results are intri@@ gu@@ ing .
and we are doing it ourselves with our hands in our shop , and we are architects . we 're not professional builders but we want to make sure it 's possible .

[ this talk contains mature content ] In 1969 , I was standing behind a Syl@@ vania black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white television set .
hearing about these things happening on the set in the front , I was the guy , you know , moving the rab@@ bit ears for my d@@ ad , and my sister and my mom .
I 'm like , " D@@ ude , come one , I can read : ' Mer@@ ita B@@ read and Rol@@ ls ' on the side of this truck .
we plum@@ bed a propane tank to a Col@@ eman stove , we built bun@@ k beds that f@@ lip down .
it showed me what it meant to be an explo@@ rer , at a very early age .
and I suppressed all that neg@@ ativity , all that trauma , because I was learning to be an explo@@ rer .
so as I went on this journey through a high school , and I went to college , and I got a football scholarship to play football in college .
so the next selection , I filled out the application , and I got in .
and I did@@ n 't know what it meant to be an astr@@ on@@ aut : the training , the simul@@ ations , all these things to get you ready for this coun@@ t@@ down : three , two , one , lif@@ to@@ ff .
and eight and a half minutes later , the main engines cut off , and we 're now floating in space .
white fol@@ ks , black fol@@ ks , Russian fol@@ ks , French fol@@ ks , you know .
all these different people co@@ existing in harmony as one race .
so I have to tell you that in my family , we watch a lot of space movies about astr@@ onau@@ ts and stuff like that .
and I was like , is that normal ?
but I do know that in the 135 shuttle flights that we 've had , the shuttle that I flew on , we had two accidents that killed everyone on that mission .
CP : ye@@ ah , I 've only seen the Hollywood version -- it looks pretty terri@@ fying , I have to tell you .
when the sun reaches the right angle in the sky , a focused beam of light will ric@@ och@@ et along the mirrors , strike your diff@@ user , and illumin@@ ate the great chamber where the v@@ am@@ pires sleep .

it has not crash@@ ed ; it 's running uninterrupted .
what are the dimensions of this machine ?
and there 's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world .
there 's two million emails per second .
it 's just a huge machine , and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .
so I did something else . I fig@@ ured out 100 billion clic@@ ks per day , 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of syn@@ ap@@ ses in your brain .
so to a first approxim@@ ation , we have these things -- twenty pe@@ ta@@ her@@ tz syn@@ ap@@ se fir@@ ings .
of course , the memory is really huge .
and the second thing is , we 're going to restructure its architecture .
and thirdly , we 're going to become completely co@@ dependent upon it .
first of all , we have all these things in our hands .
and the clou@@ d@@ book do@@ es@@ n 't have any storage .
they 're going to speak the Web language .
and so every thing will be part of the Web .
the media wants to be liquid .
the reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them , not so that they are " free " as in " beer , " but " free " as in " freedom . "
so those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media .
and we saw that , where you have all the computers of the world .
now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages , so one page links to another page .
and what we 're sharing were links , so you had to be kind of open with links .
and so , giving an example of this thing , I live in Pac@@ ific@@ a , rather than -- right now Pac@@ ific@@ a is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere .
all these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data .
and I found out by looking at it that I search most at 11 o 'clock in the morning .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing .
so the next 5,000 days , it 's not going to be the Web and only better .
and again , the price of that will be transparency .
and thirdly , it 's going to become more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous in terms of filling your entire environment , and we will be in the middle of it .
and the One is us . we are in the One .
then I became an adult and started knowing who I was , and tried to maintain that person@@ a -- I became creative .
the first person was wearing a black tie , a tu@@ x@@ edo . it was me .
you know , I became -- I took this very icon@@ o@@ cl@@ astic approach .
this is the cl@@ own sk@@ ull .
and he did something that was very tr@@ ick@@ y .
" relaxation . "
I used the dust at the Wh@@ it@@ ney Museum to render some pieces of their collection .
I was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there .
this is a pipe .
that process is called a syn@@ ap@@ se .
so , we are at the stage where we don 't really know how to compu@@ te with these kinds of devices .
and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity , just by it flowing through the network .
in fact , the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet .
and they fig@@ ured out all the different cells , and they fig@@ ured out the network , and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silic@@ on chip .
but the point that I want to make -- I 'll show you up here .
how cool is that ?
so this combination has given us lower cost , higher performance and higher efficiency electronics that we all enjoy today .
the latest systems for doing this patter@@ ning have become so complex that they reportedly cost more than 100 million dollars each .
and what 's more , this could even be the dawn of a new era of molecular manufacturing .
it 's pretty mind @@@ -@@ @ blowing .
it 's also bad for the economy .
I believe that at the cru@@ x of all of this is a single piece of paper : the r@@ é@@ sum@@ é .
algorithms picking your next job sounds a little bit sc@@ ary , but there is one thing that has been shown to be really predic@@ tive of someone 's future success in a job , and that 's what 's called a multi@@ measure test .
but if you cla@@ p immediately on red and sometimes cla@@ p on green , that might mean that you 're more impul@@ sive and creative , and we 've found that top @@@ -@@ @ performing sal@@ es@@ people often embody these traits .
the way we actually use this in hiring is we have top performers in a role go through neuro@@ science exercises like this one .
we can create algorithms that are more equitable and more fair than human beings have ever been .
instead , he focused on the question of power@@ - how to acquire it , and how to keep it .
at first glance , The Prince 's reputation as a manual for ty@@ ran@@ ny seems well @@@ -@@ @ deserved .
according to this view , M@@ achi@@ a@@ vel@@ li was the first to understand a difficult truth : the greater good of political stability is worth whatever un@@ sav@@ ory tactics are needed to attain it .
in fact , both readings might be true .
through his brutal and shoc@@ king honesty , M@@ achi@@ a@@ vel@@ li sought to shat@@ ter popular del@@ u@@ sions about what power really entails .
( Be@@ at@@ boxing ) Y@@ o , for example ...
so what we can do then is we can take that and put the phase of the stro@@ be and the sound just out of syn@@ c .
when we apply that to the lar@@ yn@@ x , we get this fluid , slow @@@ -@@ @ motion of the vibr@@ ating vocal fol@@ ds .
TT : he bought it at SE@@ X@@ PO .
and there you can see the soft pal@@ ate .
( Be@@ at@@ boxing ) ( Tr@@ um@@ pet sound ) ( Be@@ at@@ boxing ) ( Be@@ at@@ boxing ) Back to basics .
and that is what orig@@ ami used to be .
if you look close , it 's this shape , called a crane .
and I want to tell you how we did that in orig@@ ami .
the directions of the fol@@ ds at any verte@@ x -- the number of mountain fol@@ ds , the number of valley fol@@ ds -- always differs by two . two more or two less .
and if you want to go really crazy , 1,000 scales on a r@@ att@@ les@@ na@@ ke .
and I can put it in this simple equation .
so how do we do that ? well , we break it down into a few smaller steps .
but that 's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hum@@ p .
and I 'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something .
take a square . fold it in half , fold it in half , fold it again , until it gets long and narrow , and then we 'll say at the end of that , that 's a fla@@ p .
if I make the fla@@ p as sk@@ in@@ ny as possible , I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed .
it 's free . it runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows .
and if you say , " Well , but the guitar , bass -- that 's not so hot .

I gave up and voted along with the other 11 jur@@ ors .
but if it 'll make you feel better , I forgive you . "
within two minutes of his execution , they had given him a stay .
and he said , " You know , I had a responsibility in that man 's death . "
he also told me that if the State of Mississippi wanted to keep the death penalty , then he@@ y , they needed to provide counseling for the jur@@ ors .
and I asked her , " D@@ id that make me a murde@@ rer ? "
my son looked at me , sho@@ ok his head , and said , " Than@@ ks , M@@ om . "
it also gave me confidence to be able to see through the eyes of my grand@@ daughters , that this younger generation , they 're capable and they 're willing to tackle these difficult social issues .
if we look across the world , the median turnout in presidential elections over the last 30 years has been just 67 percent .
in principle , democracy is the ability of people to exert power .
that representative is a bottlenec@@ k , or a weak spot .
so the big question is : is this the end of history ?
some people have been thinking about alternatives , and one of the ideas that is out there is the idea of direct democracy .
and those senators are going to be able to read every bill and they 're going to be able to vote on each one of them .
it did@@ n 't appear to have anything to do with making babies .

it 's the full structure of the cl@@ itor@@ is .

but I think the impulse to tri@@ vi@@ alize sex is part of our problem .
we use it to sell everything .

they feel they 've lost a connection with their partners and themselves .
some people are starting to champion a richer definition of sexuality .
well , not quite . because Dar@@ win was talking about our distant ance@@ stry , our common ance@@ stry with ap@@ es .
I 'm asking about our human ance@@ stry , things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room .
how do we study that ?
and he did a pretty good job .
it 's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well @@@ -@@ @ inten@@ tioned but ultimately ben@@ ighted mus@@ ings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre @@@ -@@ @ Dar@@ w@@ ini@@ an era .
if you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body , and stretch it end to end , it 's around two meters long .
and so when you 're copying this DNA molec@@ ule to pass it on , it 's a pretty tough job .
what 's the take @@@ -@@ @ home message ?
but what 's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y @@@ -@@ @ chro@@ mos@@ ome side , the male side of the story , the Y @@@ -@@ @ chro@@ mos@@ ome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago .
this was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chro@@ mos@@ ome diversity around the world .
well , that 's a big question . these " why " questions , particularly in gene@@ tics and the study of history in general , are always the big ones , the ones that are tough to answer .
and so when all else fails , talk about the weather .
the last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago .
so what was going on here ? we we@@ ren 't covered in ice in Africa .
if you think about Antarctica , it 's technically a desert , it gets so little precipitation .
the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time , roughly 70,000 years ago , crash@@ ed to fewer than 2,000 individuals .
we became much more social . the social networks expanded .
well , you want the ultimate African success story ?
the grass@@ lands at that time -- this was during the last ice age -- stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea , and the entire continent was open to them .
now , that story I just told you is literally a whir@@ l@@ wind tour of how we populated the world , the great Pal@@ e@@ oli@@ thic wan@@ der@@ ings of our species .
which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic .
I live in the Eastern Se@@ abo@@ ard of North America when I 'm not traveling .
but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contex@@ tu@@ alize the DNA results .
how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project ?
it 's a charitable entity , basically a grant @@@ -@@ @ giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational , cultural projects initiated by them .
we still give patients chem@@ otherapy , which is so non @@@ -@@ @ specific that even though it kills the cancer cells , it kind of kills the rest of your body , too .
and yes , we have developed more selective drugs , but it 's still a challenge to get them into the tumor , and they end up accum@@ ulating in the other organs as well or passing through your urine , which is a total waste .
so I ask you guys : if immune cells are already traveling to places of injury or disease in our bodies , why not add an extra passenger ?
did you know that over 90 percent of cancer deaths can be attributed to its spread ?
so if we can stop these cancer cells from going from the primary tumor to a distant site , we can stop cancer right in its tracks and give people more of their lives back .
so what we did was we injected the nan@@ op@@ articles , and they bound almost immediately to the immune cells in the blood@@ stream .
we found that in our treated group , over 75 percent of the cancer cells we initially injected were dead or dying , in comparison to only around 25 percent .
side hu@@ stle cap@@ tures a certain kind of sc@@ rap@@ py , entrepreneurial spirit .

they recognize all the learning and growth that comes with running a side hu@@ stle .
this photograph was taken by Dr. Eu@@ an Mas@@ on in New Zealand last year , and it was submitted and published in National Geographic .
you 've got to be able to make them all the time .
and that is what N@@ ick did , up to a point .
he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned .
from here , the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany , where they meet up with their families for the first time .
but then Paul got in the water .
so , she is pretty significant in size .
so what she did was she started to bring pen@@ gu@@ ins to him , alive , and put them in front of him .
she 'd kind of look at him , like " What are you doing ? "
they 're the co@@ workers who actually keep the engines of our organizations running , but who are@@ n 't seen as the inno@@ v@@ ators who drive excellence .
but seventh grade was a game chan@@ ger .
I spent my home@@ work time on the phone , reviewing each day 's events .
as a former research libr@@ arian and an educ@@ ator , my mother knew that I was capable of accompl@@ ishing a lot more .
so she moved me to a different school .
she held me accountable and , along the way , she convinced me that I had the power to create my own story .
all of our journeys are made up of a series of rest stops , acceler@@ ations , losses and wins .
the result was that the kids really bought into the notion that they were accountable for achieving these college degrees .
it can transform our organizations as well .
and it 's been so wonderful to look back and see all of my former colleagues who 've gone on to get doc@@ torates and assume leadership roles in other organizations .
because , in the final analysis , what is often mistaken for a period is really just a comm@@ a .
we also text patients .
we 're open evenings and weekends .
and for the rest of you , who don 't work in health care , what did you write on your applications ?
four months later , this artist -- PA : and this organizer -- AM : moved into a little home with a big back@@ yard , in Miami .
this woman would have to kno@@ ck me completely off course . "
am : non@@ stop ...
she forced me -- AM : lov@@ ingly -- PA : to see our organizing work with new eyes .
I was discouraged .
meeting Phil@@ lip brought so much joy , love , truth into my life , and it pulled me out of isolation .
am : the idea was set : art was an anchor , not an accessory to movement .
our home was a home of radical imagination ; an instrument of our nurturing hearts ; a place of risk where were da@@ red to laugh , love , cry , debate .
here 's a place to be loved , to be felt , to be heard , and where we prepare for the most pressing political issues in our neighbor@@ hoods .
art -- ( Appl@@ ause ) Art as organizing is even changing and opening doors in places seen as the opposite of freedom .
in the in@@ tro , he says ...
PA : four years ago , this artist ...
PA : our worlds truly did colli@@ de , and in many ways ...
am : thank you .
I 'd like to dedicate this next song to Car@@ mel@@ o , who was put to sleep a couple of days ago , because he got too old .

I fell into depression , I stopped talking , and I stopped eating .
so , why are we not reducing our emissions ?
because how could we ?
and no one talks about it .
the year 20@@ 78 , I will celebrate my 7@@ 5th birthday .
so when school started in August of this year , I decided that this was enough .
and I 'm sorry , but it do@@ es@@ n 't work .
they haven 't .
and yes , we do need hope , of course we do .
once we start to act , hope is everywhere .
there are no rules to keep that oil in the ground .
thank you .
I 'm often asked why I do art , what do I want to say with my art photography , and what is the use of it ?
my theory is that all of us struggle sometimes to escape in order to analyze our reality , appreciate it or change .
I was a student living abroad in London .
I was working at two places at the same time as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
there is a unique power in art to transform and lift our limits .
it do@@ es@@ n 't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum , which is what we use to detect things .
gal@@ ax@@ ies themselves are not stre@@ wn randomly in space ; they tend to cluster .
and this is an example of a very , actually , famous cluster , the Com@@ a cluster .
we can measure the speeds of these gal@@ ax@@ ies , their orbital vel@@ o@@ cities , and figure out how much mass is in this cluster .
I 'm just putting this big , blue blo@@ b on there , OK , to try to remind you that it 's there .
can we see it more visually ? yes , we can .
are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye ?
so there 's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a con@@ e -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer 's eye .
a circle , a ring . it 's called an E@@ in@@ stein ring . E@@ in@@ stein predicted that , OK .
because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise , that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect .
and now put the lens over the gal@@ axy , and what you 'll find is that you 'll see a ring , an E@@ in@@ stein ring .
now , move the base off to the side , and the ring will split up into ar@@ cs , OK .
and also , you can tell by eye , by looking at this , that these ar@@ cs are not centered on individual gal@@ ax@@ ies .
OK , so , a quick review then , to see that you 're following .
if you could do this , what you would find that with each passing day , each passing year , each passing billions of years , OK , the distance between gal@@ ax@@ ies is getting greater .
it was the opposite of what was expected .
now it turns out , in the mathematics , you can put it in as a term that 's an energy , but it 's a completely different type of energy from anything we 've ever seen before .
so clusters of gal@@ ax@@ ies will tend to form , because of all this gra@@ vit@@ ational attraction .
now , what do I mean by well motivated ?
and they 've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota , OK , deep under the ground , and in fact , in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far .
now , unfortunately , there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy , so it will be hard to tell the difference .
from resent@@ ment cou@@ ched in ple@@ as@@ an@@ tries to arguing that masks attraction , her work explo@@ res the be@@ wil@@ dering collision of emotions and e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette .
they often think they have all the answers .
and by telling the story from their perspective , Au@@ sten tric@@ ks the viewer into believing their hero@@ ine knows best@@ - only to pull the rug out from under the pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist and the reader .
in " Em@@ ma , " the tit@@ ular character feels surrounded by d@@ ull neighbors , and friends who can 't hope to match her w@@ it .
it was a question that caught me by surprise .
I told her that some people experience an overlap in their senses so that they could hear colors or see sounds , and many writers were fasc@@ inated by this subject , myself included .
but she cut me off , a bit imp@@ ati@@ ently , and said , " Y@@ ea@@ h , I know all of that .
sometimes it draws circles , even slides back@@ wards , and that generations can make the same mistakes that their great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ fathers had made .
and now we know that there 's no such thing as solid countries versus liquid countries .
( la@@ ughter ) H@@ aving seen how our dreams of democracy and how our dreams of coexistence were crushed in Turkey , both gradually but also with a be@@ wil@@ dering speed , over the years I 've felt quite dem@@ or@@ alized .
I think East and West , we are losing multiplicity , both within our societies and within ourselves .
and multiple attachments mean multiple stories .
I have always been very vocal about and written extensively about minority rights , women 's rights , LGBT rights .
so even stronger than my emotions is my awareness that not only gender , not only identity , but life itself is fluid .
I think we need to go back to the basics , back to the colors of the alphabet .
and from isol@@ ation@@ ists , we will learn the need for global solidarity .
and I like that combination , because it makes me think hom@@ el@@ ands do not need to be rooted in one place .
the master of short@@ cuts -- it 's , of course , nature .
up , don 't move the wr@@ ist . over the heart , don 't move the wr@@ ist .
and I think I 'll take off this one .
memory system , right ?
and here , I had a mat here to make it a little -- the critical moment is -- sorry .
I start with three que@@ ens .
( la@@ ughter ) So , first , the first term is estimation .
so here I have , actually -- I know exactly where the cards are .
LG : here -- you see some are missing ?
you see , ye@@ ah , perfect .
the person who said five of clubs say stop , when the cards are in the air , right ?
( audience : Queen of hearts . ) LG : Queen of ? Queen of hearts .
and que@@ en of hearts . yes !
so , I use the que@@ en , and here 's five of clubs .
do the cameras see the cards now ?
name -- anyone , name , please , any suit .
and now , look , ace of diamonds will guide .
no ? now ?
yes , yes , OK .
blind@@ folded .
all right .
( la@@ ughter ) And I give you a diamonds , so they -- so you put them here , in a nice row , right . and you can see , ye@@ ah ? good .
I never ever miss two . this is interesting .
and the deck is a gift to you after , so let the skep@@ ticals here , in this , examine them , right ? remind me . it 's a gift .
sorry , two of diamonds . I 'll do it quick now .
Chris An@@ derson : you 're pe@@ e@@ king .
OK , now .
we will try .
LG : it 's not here ? Zo@@ e : it 's not there .
so here , all the cards are face down -- you agree ? ( audience : yes . ) LG : yes ? you see that in the screen ?
ye@@ ah , I do this . I know where it is , because I pe@@ e@@ ked before and then I do this .
touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
ca : ladies and gent@@ lemen , L@@ enn@@ art Green ! LG : ok@@ ay , thank you .
so , when we train , we 're always trying to take into account the dog 's point of view .
we don 't take the dog 's point of view into account .
so you get a little pu@@ pp@@ y , he comes . his only crime is he grew .
you bend down , you p@@ at him -- you reward him for jumping up .
so , this whole dominance issue -- number one , what we get in dog training is this Mic@@ key @@@ -@@ @ M@@ ouse interpretation of a very complicated social system .
and they take this stuff seriously .
because he grew ?
well , I 've got news for you .
the dog do@@ es@@ n 't speak English , or American , or Spanish , or French .
at the moment , he 's in the park , and you are competing with sm@@ ells , and other dogs , and squ@@ ir@@ rels .
they think a punishment is something nasty .
it do@@ es@@ n 't have to be .
and I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house , and they never took it outside .
( la@@ ughter ) If he had kicked a dog , I would have pun@@ ched him out .
and then , a little behavior problem comes up .
and we cra@@ ve one thing , even though we kind of don 't know it all the time .
let 's separate the performance , as a thing , out from the recording , which was how it was made .
and it 's the data hidden inside the recording .
he just got tired of being in front of an audience , and felt like -- a performing mon@@ key was , in fact , his term .
it 's a game chan@@ ger .
and at some point he 's dancing with his -- and I won 't ru@@ in the episode for you , from 1967 .
it says right now , we think music is notes and how they 're played .
it 's one minute long .
I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat .
the question is , what 's the good you can do with it ?
I don 't know , Taiwan Stra@@ its 2025 .
there is nobody we can 't take down .
what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow , and creating the peace space that allows us to move on .
and that poor country runs off that ledge , does that cartoon thing and then drops .
it 's about non @@@ -@@ @ lethal technologies , because if you fire real amm@@ o into a crowd of women and children ri@@ oting you 're going to lose friends very quickly .
you have to create internal partners . you have to access coalition partners .
in that transition space you 're mostly hat not enough cattle .
but we have trouble accessing our outcomes .
we haven 't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 .
would you like a better system ?
they 've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War .
I maintain this is code inside the Army for , " We don 't want to do this . "
we bought one military and we operated another .
I used to give this brief inside the Pent@@ agon in the early 1990s .
it elev@@ ates MO@@ O@@ T@@ W -- how we pron@@ ounce that acrony@@ m -- from cra@@ p to grand strategy , because that 's how you 're going to shr@@ ink that gap .
certain bad things you CA@@ N@@ NOT do .
what 's happened since is that b@@ if@@ ur@@ cation I described .
( la@@ ughter ) I supported the war in Iraq .
I knew we 'd kick ass in the war with the Le@@ vi@@ athan Force .
I knew we 'd have a hard time with what followed .
that plus nu@@ kes rules out great power war .
but ultimately you 're going to civil@@ i@@ an@@ ize it , probably two thirds .
this is where the Mar@@ ines in the audience get kind of tense .
they get up every morning , they want to di@@ g a hole and they want to kill something .
let 's go and try and talk to the head@@ mi@@ stress .
and finally , we fig@@ ured , well , OK , we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital .
with pity , you know . sad@@ ness .
imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village .
he was like , I try and I make .
so , what is to be done ?
first of all , Africans , we need to get better at telling our stories .
four of them are white males -- non @@@ -@@ @ native speakers .
why are we not generating our own content ?
we 're now moving into East Africa .
and we give them business development services , as well as financing loan and equity .
and basically , we started this because we were tired of complain@@ ing about our politicians .
what are they doing ?
they come from us .
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge .
the other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual .
give me something I can do with Pay@@ p@@ al . "
you know , my vision is that my daughter , and any other African child being born today , can be whoever they want to be here , without having to leave .
I would like to see that change , and the change starts with us .
so , people argue vigorously about the definition of life .
and what I want to do is write molecular programs , potentially to build technology .
there 's the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the gir@@ ders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
if we succeed , what will molecular programming look like ?
there are other questions like this , too .
and I 'm going to draw it like this sometimes , just so I don 't sc@@ are you .
you can look in this computer @@@ -@@ @ fabricated arti@@ fact , and he 's got a double @@@ -@@ @ str@@ an@@ ded gen@@ ome -- that 's no good .
you look in his intestin@@ es . there are billions of bacteria .
the net action of many of these on that long str@@ and is to fold it into something like a rectangle .
and each one of these is just one @@@ -@@ @ thous@@ and@@ th the width of a human hair , OK ?
it 's got a needle , like a record needle , that goes back and forth over the surface , bum@@ ps up and down , and feels the height of the first surface .
( la@@ ughter ) So , this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes , OK ?
and we like to draw these tiles as little squares .
and the point of this , if you did@@ n 't catch that , is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns .
so , you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together , form a little binary counter rather than a chec@@ ker@@ board .
so , that answers that sort of first question I was talking about .
you can just change a couple of the DNA str@@ ands in this binary representation and you 'll get 96 rather than 32 .
so , this sort of recap@@ it@@ ulates what I was telling you about development .
so , you can ask , how many DNA str@@ ands are required to build a square of a given size ?
and finally , I 'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers .
and you can see how they count .
so now , what do I want you to take away from this talk ?
many years passed and the feelings that she was feeling and holding all this in grew and grew , and she knew she had to come out to her family .
first , he w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't shake her hand , and second , when he heard she was transgender , all he cared about was getting an HIV test and ending the appointment .
today , in this talk , I want to offer a new way of thinking for three groups of people : doctors , the transgender community and , well , the rest of us .
this is how many transgender individuals feel .
now , the average medical student spends about five hours learning about the LGBT health @@@ -@@ @ related needs while they 're in medical school .
if you don 't speak up for your health care needs , no one 's going to do it for you .
it 's safer to come out .
y '@@ all may have even heard it .
but these four questions , actually , are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'm not quite sure how he died , actually .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , those questions , which , of course , you 've got right , and you haven 't been conf@@ erring , and so on .
and I -- you know , normally , I would pick people out and humili@@ ate , but maybe not in this instance .
the mass of this comes out of the air .
second one : can you light a little tor@@ ch @@@ -@@ @ bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire ?
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bulb , and said , " Can you do it ? " they cou@@ ld@@ n 't do it . right ?
and that 's no different from Imperial College in London , by the way , it 's not some sort of anti @@@ -@@ @ American thing going on .
now , here 's how you do the battery and the bulb .
but if you haven 't played with a battery and a bulb , if you 've only seen a circuit diagram , you might not be able to do that , and that 's one of the problems .
I promise you that most of you will have got that .
but , no , look what I found in the textbooks .
so we 're not empty vessels ; the mental models that we have as children persist into adul@@ thood .
your home@@ work is -- you know , how does an aircraft 's wing create lift ?
Ah ha , right . second question is , why is the sea blue ? all right ?
and you 've all got an idea in your head of the answer .
S@@ W : much better .
E : wo@@ o .
( la@@ ughter ) Since we 've arrived , there 's been a constant bu@@ z@@ z about all the exciting speakers here for the conference .
well , that 's really cool , but what E@@ in@@ stein 's really hoping is that maybe he 'll genetically engineer a five @@@ -@@ @ pound pe@@ anu@@ t .
S@@ W : ye@@ ah . she would get really , really excited .
since E@@ in@@ stein is a bird , she 's very interested in things that fly .
she thinks Bur@@ t R@@ ut@@ an is very impressive .
E : o@@ oh .
E : [ spac@@ eship noise ] S@@ W : even if it do@@ es@@ n 't have a laser ?
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .
S@@ W : do your head now .
E : [ squ@@ aw@@ ks ] S@@ W : all right .
S@@ W : ye@@ ah , that 's right .
( la@@ ughter ) S@@ W : and so do all the fol@@ ks back home in Tennessee .
E : t@@ we@@ et , t@@ we@@ et , t@@ we@@ et .
S@@ W : and the pen@@ gu@@ in ?
( la@@ ughter ) S@@ W : at the zo@@ o we have big cats from the j@@ ung@@ le .
S@@ W : you are very special .
E : I love you .
and A@@ pol@@ lo was one of the greatest moti@@ v@@ ators ever .
they did@@ n 't know what cou@@ ld@@ n 't be done .
the government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be happy in standing for that .
one of the things that we did with the An@@ s@@ ari X PR@@ I@@ Z@@ E was take the challenge on that risk is OK , you know .
we know -- 20 million dollars today , you can go and buy a ticket , but how cheap could it get ?
it 's about 5.7 gig@@ aj@@ ou@@ les of energy .
I have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
and I 'd like to take you there , to that morning , for just a quick video .
( appl@@ ause ) RS : so in my official capacity as the chief judge of the An@@ s@@ ari X PR@@ I@@ Z@@ E competition , I declare that Mo@@ ja@@ ve Aeros@@ pace Ven@@ tures has indeed earned the An@@ s@@ ari X PR@@ I@@ Z@@ E .
I found a vi@@ sionary family , the An@@ s@@ ari family , and Cha@@ mp Car , and raised part of the money , but not the full 10 million .
I had the pleasure of borrowing from the L@@ ong@@ itude Prize and the Or@@ te@@ ig Prize that put Lind@@ ber@@ gh forward .
I showed this slide to Lar@@ ry Page , who just joined our board .
if you have a matching grant , it 's typically two or three to one .
and that 's huge . and then he turned around and said , " Well , if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize , you get 500 to one . "
I said , " Well , that 's great . "
you get publicity increase , and when it 's won , publicity sho@@ ots through the roof -- if it 's properly managed -- and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor .
we are looking at a number of energy prizes .
now , H@@ egel -- he very fam@@ ously said that Africa was a place without history , without past , without narrative .
yet , I 'd argue that no other continent has nur@@ tured , has fought for , has celebrated its history more concer@@ tedly .
I 'm reminded of how , just last year -- you might remember it -- the first members of the al Qaeda @@@ -@@ @ affiliated An@@ sar D@@ ine were indicted for war crimes and sent to the Hague .
and one of the most no@@ torious was Ahmad al @@@ -@@ @ Fa@@ q@@ i , who was a young Malian , and he was charged , not with genocide , not with ethnic cleansing , but with being one of the in@@ stig@@ ators of a campaign to destroy some of Mali 's most important cultural heritage .
they understood the power of narrative to hold communities together , and they conversely understood that in destroying stories , they hoped they would destroy a people .
it 's been fully restored .
history really matters .
and he never quite recovered from what he saw : a granite , dry@@ stone city , str@@ an@@ ded on an out@@ crop above an empty sav@@ ann@@ ah : great Zimbabwe .
these ideas are so ir@@ rational , so deeply held , that even when faced with the physical archae@@ ology , they cou@@ ld@@ n 't think ration@@ ally .
and if Mau@@ ch had really wanted to find an answer to his question , " Where did Great Zimbabwe or that great stone building come from ? "
Sun@@ di@@ ata Ke@@ ita was born about 12@@ 35 , growing up in a time of profound flux .
now , several decades after the death of Sun@@ di@@ ata , a new king as@@ cended the throne , Mans@@ a Musa , its most famous em@@ peror .
it 's been said that 100 cam@@ els each carried 100 pounds of gold .
and today , as the shr@@ ines and the mosque vand@@ alized by An@@ sar D@@ ine have been rebuilt , many of the in@@ stig@@ ators of their destruction have been jail@@ ed .
to see if I could speak to someone , I shou@@ ted out that I was a friend , that I would not hurt them .
I 'm telling you about my reporting in the Central African Republic , but I still ask myself why I went there .
and like him , I loved everything about it : the show@@ manship , the athle@@ tic skill , the drama .
" sure , k@@ id . no problem . "
I knew I was@@ n 't a ch@@ is@@ eled athlete like some of these guys , but I really did@@ n 't care .
I thought about it until my head hurt . I cou@@ ld@@ n 't come up with anything .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And I knew that if I kept turning myself up and pushing myself harder , the opportunities would come .
in the middle of the night , I got a phone call .
it was the call I wish my d@@ ad was around to hear .
( la@@ ughter ) S@@ ure , I was disappointed I did@@ n 't get to wrest@@ le , but very few wrestlers get any kind of call from the WW@@ E .
I mean , I did@@ n 't get to wrest@@ le .
and as time passed , the str@@ ang@@ est thing started to happen .
so maybe helping him turn up makes him become the next Ste@@ ve Jobs .
you never know what you have the ability to do until you di@@ g .
and don 't be afraid to put yourself out there .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Lo@@ ok , the wrestling cir@@ cus do@@ es@@ n 't need to come to your town before you get an invitation to be the real you -- the bigger , more stunning version of yourself .
" when you get married ... "
but the more I read , the more dis@@ hear@@ tened I became .
I read women 's stories , trying desper@@ ately to get this procedure .
( la@@ ughter ) I sat up straight .
and " my long @@@ -@@ @ term partner has this kind of business , " and " I 've done research on this for months .
I felt like I was on the witness stand , being cross @@@ -@@ @ examined .
" well , I 've been with the same man for five years , and he fully supports any decision I make for my body . "
based on his perception of my best interest , regardless of what I , as the patient , want or believe .
( la@@ ughter ) So not long after the f@@ ated Rome event , I chat@@ ted this through with a friend of mine who is a mathemati@@ cian , and we thought it was a problem we could do something about .
we knew we wanted something very precise , but GPS coordinates , latitude and longit@@ ude , were just too complicated .
the human suffering was un@@ beli@@ evable and unprecedented .
yet it 's not only companies who can undermine fair competition .
and they see the market , which was supposed to serve everyone , become more like the private property of a few powerful companies .
the market is not the society .
and that can help us build the trust that we need for real innovation to flourish and for societies to develop for citizens .
M@@ V : no , that was dollars . it 's not so strong these days .
B@@ G : it will be a fascinating case to follow .
and you know what I 've learned after all this time ?
fully formed adults walk in the door every single day .
let 's take the annual performance review .
if you find yourself saying , " Rem@@ ember the way it used to be ? "
as I give this talk , there are more than 700 Con@@ feder@@ ate monuments standing nationwide .
I started M@@ overs and Sha@@ kers , a non@@ profit , to get the statue removed .
you can just do it .
typically , monuments are created to commemorate the achievements of the deceased , but with augmented reality , we can re@@ route the rules .
here are two images of a house .
they never capture every detail of the things they describe , just enough for the brain to determine appropriate responses .
more extensive damage to the network can sometimes lead to a vege@@ tative state , with no sign of consciousness .
random genetic mu@@ tations in or@@ ch@@ ids may result in a tra@@ it@@ - like a s@@ cent or a sha@@ pe@@ - that , by chance , matches the needs of a single in@@ sect species .
over time , though , more or@@ ch@@ id species have formed than died out , and or@@ ch@@ ids are some of the most diverse flow@@ ering plants .
but silence is a pretty rare commodity these days , and we 're all paying a price for it in terms of our health -- a surprisingly big price , as it turns out .
so what do we mean when we talk about noise ?
well , noise is defined as unwanted sound , and as such , both has a physical component , the sound , and a psychological component , the circumstances that make the sound unwanted .
a person attending the rock concert , being exposed to 100 deci@@ bel@@ s , does not think of the music as noise .
you may have to raise your voice to be understood .
noise is stress , especially if we have little or no control over it .
however , we are often not aware of these noise @@@ -@@ @ induced sleep disturbances , because we are un@@ conscious while we 're sleeping .
also , talk to your children about the health effects of noise and that listening to loud music today will have consequences when they 're older .
in general , seek out quiet spaces , especially on the weekend or when you 're on vacation .
this tells you that we don 't realize anymore the constant degree of noise pollution we 're exposed to and how much we could profit from more quiet spaces .
for example , don 't start mo@@ wing your la@@ wn at 7@@ am on a Saturday morning .
I think we 're there , and I hope that we will win this fight , and when we do , we can all have a nice , quiet celebration .
it 's true .
but I fig@@ ured somebody must know the answer to this ; there are so many ideas out there .
and I read all the books , and I went to the conferences , and at one point , we counted more than 100 efforts to study the future of work .
we did a scenario @@@ -@@ @ planning exercise , and we imagined cases where no job is safe .
and then you hear the stories .
and when you talk to people , there were two themes that came out loud and clear .
because what we need to do from the beginning is understand what is it about work that gives people dignity , so they can live the lives that they want to live .
and so that concept of dignity is ...
that 's the Net@@ f@@ li@@ x show that I would bin@@ ge .
her hands were trem@@ bling , and her face was be@@ aming with pride .
these three identities forced me to think that I should never have been born .
that 's because I applied a lot of co@@ con@@ ut oil to my hair .
we go through periods of En@@ thr@@ all@@ ment , followed by reactions in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms , in the finance community best characterized as , what 's the finance term ? IC@@ K poo@@ ey .
but it 's this ir@@ rational view of things that drives us on to the next thing .
to build that , what we 'd do with Wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind technology is we 'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mul@@ hol@@ land , and from the 405 to La Ci@@ en@@ eg@@ a just with those whir@@ l@@ winds .
that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates .
it shows up at places like MI@@ T , and then a mu@@ tation happens .
Dec knew a good thing about w@@ asting time .
it shipped every one of its computers with that game .
R@@ CA had David Sar@@ no@@ ff , who basically commerci@@ alized radio , said this , " I don 't say that radio networks must die .
( video ) Jack Ber@@ ry : boys and girls , I think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set , you just get them out .
it led to law@@ suits -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- federal investigations , and lots of repercussions , and that 's a scandal we won 't discuss today .
here he is talking from the 1960s .
but for this part of the story , I 'd actually like to throw it to America 's leading technology correspondent , John Mark@@ off .
( video ) John Mark@@ off : do you want to know what the counter@@ culture in drugs , sex , rock ' n ' roll and the anti @@@ -@@ @ war movement had to do with computing ? everything .
and into that fer@@ ment came the micro@@ processor .
the title was taken from the lyrics to a Je@@ ff@@ er@@ son Air@@ plane song . the lyrics go , " Rem@@ ember what the dor@@ mouse said .
meanwhile , in California , we were trying to commerci@@ alize a lot of this stuff .
hec@@ k , it was everything . so we ended up writing a marketing brochure .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyper@@ links could go beyond the local area network .
a few years later , T@@ im Ber@@ ners @@@ -@@ @ Lee worked that out .
the year is 1993 and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popul@@ arize all this .
( video ) narr@@ ator : the pyra@@ mi@@ ds , the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um , the New York subway system and TV din@@ ners , ancient and modern wonders of the man @@@ -@@ @ made world all .
yet each p@@ ales to in@@ significance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty @@@ -@@ @ first @@@ -@@ @ century technology , the Digital Super@@ highway .
once it was only a dream of tec@@ hno@@ ids and a few long @@@ -@@ @ forgotten politicians .
narr@@ ator : stir@@ red by the prospects of mass communication and making big buc@@ ks on advertising , David Sar@@ no@@ ff commerci@@ alizes radio .
man 2 : never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand .
it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media .
well , you know where we 're going on from here .
it 's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now .
( video ) MM : because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
I now think a network b@@ oss is anyone who has a cable modem .
meanwhile , you have the TV blog@@ gers going out on strike , in sympathy with the television writers .
pH : Oh , but then he re@@ members he works for Ru@@ per@@ t Mur@@ do@@ ch .
they don 't really notice the new medium that is wrap@@ ping them up .
you remember that wonderful song by Paul Simon ?
but , of course , teles@@ cop@@ es launched 10 years ago , as you just heard , could take this Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ agen , fly it to the moon , and you could see the lights on that Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ agen light up on the moon .
and if you separated it by one plate , you could see two cand@@ les separately at that distance .
and that 's the kind of resolution that you need to begin to image that little spec@@ k of dust as it comes around the sun and see if it has a blue @@@ -@@ @ green signature .
and that is a time of miracle and wonder .
it was like long @@@ -@@ @ distance calls .
and so as you 're looking at these systems , it do@@ es@@ n 't matter , it do@@ es@@ n 't matter , it do@@ es@@ n 't matter , and then it does .
and as you 're looking at this stuff , here 's kind of a country view at a 400 base pair resolution level , and then you zoom in to 550 , and then you zoom in to 850 , and you can begin to identify more and more genes as you zoom in .
so what we 're doing in this stuff is we 're gathering information and just generating enormous amounts of information .
this is one of the cool@@ est maps ever done by human beings .
( la@@ ughter ) It only took us four years and 40 million dollars to be able to take this picture .
no matter what happens , if you leave your cell phone by your bed@@ side , you will not have a billion cell phones in the morning .
but you can also substitute for agricultural lands .
DNA is a really powerful information storage device .
Isaac Ko@@ han@@ e has now created a department based on informatics , data , knowledge at Harvard Medical School .
the third thing that 's happening is this is coming to the consumer .
so you , too , can get your genes sequ@@ enced .
normally , when you advertise something , you really don 't want the consumer to take your advertisement into the bathroom to pe@@ e on .
and a lot of us think , " Oh no , we never want to re@@ design humans . "
build me stuff that was here three billion years ago .
he 's had the precursor of the R@@ NA be absorbed by the cell and then he 's had the cells divide .
so we 're getting to the point where we can rebuild most of our body parts , in the same way as if you break a bone or burn your skin , it reg@@ rows .
nobody 's going to live beyond 120 , 130 , 140 years unless if we fix this .
" where did we come from ? "
[ you can live as if everything is a miracle , or you can live as if nothing is a miracle . ] It 's your choice .
we 're lucky to be able to interact with fol@@ ks like the fol@@ ks who are building all the stuff in this room .

and the way we 've done this -- we teach digital stor@@ yt@@ elling to these kids .
and the way we do it is , we do it in workshops , and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and stor@@ yt@@ elling , and have them work with the kids .
the other thing : I wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
and this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago .
and it was pretty extraordinary , way back then .
they are more like us than any other living creature , and we 've heard about that during this TED Conference .
of course , I gave them names . they can live to be 60 years or more , although we think most of them probably don 't make it to 60 in the wild .

in ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee society , we find many , many examples of compassion , precursors to love and true al@@ tru@@ ism .

we all know that it 's Bill .
people who are high in openness to experience just cra@@ ve novel@@ ty , variety , diversity , new ideas , travel .
you can predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to and what kinds of food they like to eat .
once you understand this tra@@ it , you can understand why anybody would eat at Ap@@ ple@@ be@@ e 's , but not anybody that you know .
let 's find out .
the fifth foundation is purity / sancti@@ ty .
the blue line shows people 's responses on the average of all the harm questions .
we can say liber@@ als have a two @@@ -@@ @ channel or two @@@ -@@ @ foundation morality .
are@@ n 't they the foundations of xenophobia , author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism and pur@@ it@@ anism ?
some of you might recognize this as the ' 6@@ 0s .
" I don 't want to be a suc@@ ker . I won 't cooperate . "
now we get to the cru@@ x of the disagreement between liber@@ als and conserv@@ atives : liber@@ als reject three of these foundations .
they want order , even at some cost , to those at the bottom .
Y@@ in and yang are both necessary , like night and day , for the functioning of the world .
you have the markings of V@@ ish@@ nu on the left , so we could think of V@@ ish@@ nu as the conservative god .
so what should you do ?
and that to misuse them or not to use them er@@ ases us in a certain way .
her pronoun@@ s .
and in part , that 's because modern usage equ@@ ates civil@@ ity with decor@@ um , with formal pol@@ it@@ eness , formal behavior .
and to them , call@@ outs for civil@@ ity are really very much like what George Or@@ well wrote in " 1984 " -- he called it " new@@ speak . "
and I took that to heart , it was very -- The audience was very engaged about that online , as you can imagine .
and after one such incident last year , even the Washington Post -- you know , left @@@ -@@ @ lean@@ ing Washington Post -- wrote an editorial and sided with decor@@ um .
the tear @@@ -@@ @ g@@ assing of kids , the separation of families . "
they were ch@@ asti@@ sed , they were arrested for pursuing the vote for women in the 19@@ 20@@ s .
so I think you get a sense of why civil@@ ity has become a problem , a dirty word , here .
now , does this mean we can 't disagree , that we can 't speak our minds ?
she 's kind of the g@@ uru of civil@@ ity in this country , and the executive director of a body called the National Institute for Civil Dis@@ course .
but civil discourse also needs rules , it needs boundaries .
and I 'm thinking of racial and ethnic groups , I 'm thinking of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , I 'm thinking of the disabled .
and the larger context was , only a few months before , five staff@@ ers had been killed at a Maryland newspaper .
and then he noticed that my dog was off le@@ ash one day , and then he commented that I had gone to the market .
when you have a specific word , though , to describe a problem like that , you know you really have a problem .
but therein lies the third rule : Don 't mistake decor@@ um for civil@@ ity .
even if you have a dow@@ ager coun@@ t@@ ess as fab@@ ulous as D@@ ame Mag@@ gie Smith .
not that long ago , I was at a bak@@ ery , and they make these amazing s@@ con@@ es .
I 've been waiting in line 20 minutes . "
so I think civil@@ ity , with that understanding , is not a dirty word .
thank you .
most of the animals are in the oceans .
and it 's got these jet th@@ ru@@ sters up in front that it 'll use in a moment , and a little light .
and what you 're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed , hydrogen @@@ -@@ @ sul@@ fide @@@ -@@ @ rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .
gets up to 600 , 700 degrees F , somewhere in that range .
and we knew it was volcanic back in the ' 6@@ 0s , ' 7@@ 0s .
what we find out now is that it 's probably coming from inside the Earth .
here 's cra@@ bs here , wor@@ ms here .
it 's just like music -- it really is just like music .
learn to manage it .
over the course of the 1960s , the F@@ BI am@@ assed almost two thousand documents in an investigation into one of America 's most celebrated minds .
at the time , the F@@ BI investigated many artists and thin@@ kers , but most of their files were a fraction the size of Bal@@ d@@ win 's .
so what made James Bal@@ d@@ win lo@@ om so large in the imag@@ inations of both the public and the authorities ?
it was popular with both black and white readers .
it 's only months later that you get an " explanation of benefits " that explains exactly nothing .
San Francisco , the same M@@ RI , 475 dollars or 6,@@ 221 dollars just 25 miles away .
we used the data to tell stories about people who were suffering and how to avoid that suffering , to avoid that " Go@@ t@@ cha " bill .
and I 've got to think that a lot of us and the system itself would be a lot healthier .
so it meant if you attacked us , we would attack you virtually simultaneously , and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine .
so the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you . that 's the way we lived .
and it 's particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union , now in Russia .
the second thing is , what about the know @@@ -@@ @ how ?
the fourth element is that the high @@@ -@@ @ value U.S. targets are accessible , soft and pl@@ enti@@ ful .
five to seven percent only are inspected -- five to seven percent .
you put the elements into a suit@@ case .
you can 't get an exact number for that kind of probability , but what I 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .
there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the super@@ powers to destroy the Earth many , many times over .
we 're coming down , and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here , in the Financial District .
this is the ultimate .
in that 10 to 15 minutes , all you have to do -- and I mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the blast .
but in 2008 , there is@@ n 't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear deton@@ ation disaster .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhel@@ med psych@@ ologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
and we 're trying to tell them , " It 's not futile .
now , this is my favorite civil defense slide , and I -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- I don 't want to be in@@ delicate , but this -- he 's no longer in office . we don 't really care , OK .
and this is a real crisis for them .
it strip @@@ -@@ @ mines carc@@ asses , and it has amazing teeth , because it enables the hy@@ ena to essentially eat bones .
now , the end product of that action is up on the board here .
Richard W@@ ur@@ man : that 's the end ! Ke@@ ith Bel@@ lows : ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah .
about a hundred yards , it broke down .
there 's also one other aspect about these cam@@ els .
and the cam@@ els come down again like elev@@ ators , we sort of cl@@ um@@ si@@ ly get off , and they , obviously , try to take another ch@@ un@@ k out of my leg .
it 's the best designed animal in the world . "
and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the ca@@ mel .
so , I got a National Geographic film crew .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , if you 've ever seen a 2,000 pound ca@@ mel in ru@@ t , it is a sc@@ ary , sc@@ ary thing to behold .
the desert 's extremely win@@ dy as well as being very cold .
he 's basically a walking mul@@ ch pile .
and it makes him very dangerous at this time of year .
but before I do , I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SU@@ V of the sand , the ship of the desert .
I 'm seven feet , 2,000 l@@ bs . , with brown hair and eyes , long legs -- and I 'm very well ... hun@@ g .
e@@ yel@@ ashes that keep out sand and a third e@@ yel@@ ash that works like a wind@@ shield wi@@ per .
long legs that allow heat to escape .
no surprise .
my dried bones are pri@@ zed as a sort of iv@@ ory .
I 'm a libr@@ arian , and what I 'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it .
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
I think that 's one of the reasons why the Kin@@ dle is so great .
I don 't have to feel like I 'm at work to read a Kin@@ dle .
and it turns out to not be very hard .
in India , they 've got another couple book@@ mobil@@ es running around .
and kids starting to make their own books , and a happy k@@ id with the first book that he 's ever owned .
there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well .
and I don 't mean to steal any th@@ under here , but we 've gone and used one of these things to be an e @@@ -@@ @ book reader .
we 're in good enough shape .
and we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page .
people seem to love it .
( la@@ ughter ) And especially if it 's kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .
so 10 cents a page , 300 pages in your average book , 30 dollars a book .
but a million books , I think , actually would be a pretty good start , and that would cost 30 million dollars . that 's not that big a bill .
as best we can tell , there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large @@@ -@@ @ scale theat@@ rical distribution . it 's just not that many .
we only put one week up , which is mostly for cost reasons , which is the 9 / 11 , sort of from 9 / 11 / 2001 . for one week , what did the world see ?
were they ? let 's look at the Palestinian television and find out .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
so books , music , video , software . there 's only 50,000 titles of it .
what 's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward ?
you still with me ? ( la@@ ughter ) I called her up .
and I said , " Well , I 'm not sure . "
Cam@@ agu@@ ey is a province in Cuba .
I love that , but we don 't have the time .
good stor@@ yt@@ elling is cra@@ fting a story that someone wants to listen to .
my Cuban mother , which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch , came to the United States one thousand years ago .
we went from Havana , Cuba to Dec@@ at@@ ur , Georgia .
any vehic@@ ular ou@@ ting with that woman from the time I was a young child , guys , naturally included flashing , blue lights .
but now she was a sep@@ tu@@ ag@@ en@@ arian , she 'd stopped driving .
Rock@@ ports -- they 're for this .
that 's why they call them that .
" I think so . "
I mean , I 've got a mouth as dry as the Kal@@ a@@ har@@ i Des@@ ert .
it 'll help my breathing . it 'll do something for my pulse , maybe .
" Mom@@ my , I know you have been stopped . "
" you mean , like , in the car ? "
correct the other direction now , it 's OK .
well , I stood up to her .
she has amazing land speed for a woman her age , too .
this is new and fast , just so you -- are you still with us ?
she says , " Ma , you got to look ! "
Don 't you want to look ?
we all secret@@ ly want our blan@@ k@@ ie and our Bo@@ o Be@@ ar .
( la@@ ughter ) And she 's bringing me in with a slight sal@@ sa movement .
I 'm thinking , " Accel@@ er@@ ator , break . acceler@@ ator , break . "
I jump out next to her going , " Don 't you move ! "
and the result of it is , we have diseases .
big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non @@@ -@@ @ nutrient foods to kids .
this is the US@@ DA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
why can we have 29 @@@ -@@ @ cent Big gul@@ ps and 99 @@@ -@@ @ cent double bur@@ gers ?
you know , what 's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken ?
in fact , this may be what a lot of parents serve , as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .
this is what we 're serving this week at the schools .
this is available on my website in English and Spanish , and it 's a visual way to talk to kids about food .
where is soci@@ alization ? where is discussion ?
and then , at one in the afternoon , they 're totally crashing .
these are your children and grand@@ children that are totally melting down when you pick them up , because they haven 't had lunch .
and , you know , I 'm not that better off now .
but we really have to educate .
instead of the National School Lun@@ ch Program being under the US@@ DA , I think it should be under C@@ DC .
that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools , 80 to 90 cents . in L.@@ A. , it 's 56 cents .
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .
and a friend of mine , April , who I 've had since kindergarten , she thanks her children for doing their cho@@ res .
and I 'm treating you , my inner circle , like you 're the enemy .
I want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear .
( la@@ ughter ) And my mother was Irish Catholic , and -- but she did@@ n 't take religion too seriously .
and by the age of 11 , I was no longer going to Sunday Mass , and going on bir@@ d@@ watching walks with my father .
it was@@ n 't going anywhere toward , you know , saying what the gene was ; it was just nuclear science . and oh , that 's the book , little book .
sort of crystall@@ ine . so DNA had a structure , even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions .
so there was something universal about the DNA molec@@ ule .
and there I met Francis C@@ ric@@ k .
and so I came back with that news to Cambridge , and Bra@@ g@@ g said , " Build models . "
and we knew it was big because , you know , if you just put A next to T and G next to C , you have a copying mechanism .
it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an R@@ NA molec@@ ule , and then how do you go from R@@ NA to protein ?
for about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of R@@ NA .
it did@@ n 't yield . it did@@ n 't give good x @@@ -@@ @ ray photographs .
George Gam@@ ow , also a great phy@@ sic@@ ist , he designed the tie .
we haven 't yet looked at the parents , but the parents probably don 't have that loss , or they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be parents .
it 's how they , see , have those album things -- kids don 't know what they are .
and a guy named St@@ an Re@@ z@@ nikov did this as a pilot .
as he said , I was co @@@ -@@ @ inven@@ tor of the Fur@@ by .
I did the body and creature -- well , you 'll see .
this is a smaller one , and I have a little moving torso on there .
and , you know , I want to make it bl@@ ink and do all that at the same time .
and then I 've got to start building it , so this is the real thing .
so there 's the back of his head with a billion holes in it .
and there he is , a little bush baby on -- caught in the head@@ lights there .
and since then , every time I come home from To@@ ys " R " Us with dol@@ ls or something , they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house .
so now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff I don 't know how to do .
and I started working with Sol@@ id Works and a whole other group to do that .
so they ran all the shells for us , which was nice of them .
and on the weekend we ran the parts for that .
why do you , you know , try to do this stuff ?
not a robot that kind of does , but let 's really go for it .
so I picked a Cam@@ ar@@ as@@ a@@ ur@@ us , because the Cam@@ ar@@ as@@ a@@ ur@@ us was the most abundant of the sau@@ ro@@ po@@ ds in North America .
so there 's the motor .
and about this time , you know , all these other people are starting to help .
there 's some Sol@@ id Works versions of it .
there 's a photo@@ realistic eye behind a lens .
they had to fit within the envelope .
now you start doing the sculpture for this .
and you can see we got a guy from -- who 's just a fan@@ atic about din@@ osa@@ urs to do the sculp@@ ting for us , down to the spo@@ on @@@ -@@ @ shaped teeth and everything .
so you see -- he@@ y , come on . He@@ y , did you feel that ?
there 's something big and loud over here .
He@@ y .
that 's what the investors think , that it 's just -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- right , right . so they 're really sweet little guys .
but mostly they ev@@ oke a feeling of caring .
anyone can take Ple@@ o and they can totally re@@ do his personality .
so they 're a handful . we hope you get one .
but thinking is really very straightforward : it 's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning , or something .
but that 's not the hard part . "
the other day , I was reading something , and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is hand@@ sha@@ king in the West .
and I haven 't the f@@ og@@ gi@@ est idea of where you find the ones that don 't hand@@ shake , because they must be hiding .
well , the single best way is to get them to understand that what they 're being told is a whole lot of non@@ sense .
how do we make stable societies ? longevity .
anyway , the question I think people should talk about -- and it 's absolutely tabo@@ o -- is , how many people should there be ?
and I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million .
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that be enough ? and then the children would get plenty of support , and nurturing , and mentoring , and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy .
and so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes , we can live 200 years .
( la@@ ughter ) And it 's very hard to find an eth@@ ic@@ ist who considers any change worth making , because he says , what about the consequences ?
so I see emotions as highly evolved sub@@ sets of your capability .
so , the very first question you 've got to figure out is : what is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you come to them pit@@ ching your new business idea ?
therefore , the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
experience : you 've got to be able to say , " He@@ y , you know , I 've done this before . "
those skills include everything from technical skills if it 's a technology business , to marketing and sales and management and so on .
you 've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it , or else you can .
I don 't want someone who 'll cut and run at the first opportunity .
so it 's got to be both .
is this how to do a PowerPoint presentation ? what do you think ?
just give me your company logo .
then you 've got to walk me through , show me who your management team is .
I want to know the size of the market . why is this market worth getting at ?
do a can@@ ned demo , or something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is .
there 's never been a company with no competition , even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
so how do I know what 's going on ?
you think that I 'm looking at that ?
there 's another program called O@@ vation you can get from Adobe that they bought last summer , which helps you run the tim@@ ers and lets you figure out what 's going on .
so , here 's my wrap @@@ -@@ @ up to take you to the moon , right ?
have you seen me touch the computer ? no . why not ?
the screen should come up behind you and supplement what you 're doing , instead of replace you .
another thing that many women -- we think that we have to do everything .
because , you know , when we actually look at the animal kingdom , and we see who are the most fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ous , the male or the female ?
so , one day , while we were sitting in the office , a farm worker comes in .
so I went back to the office , and I told Mr. Ros@@ s , " They won 't let me make an application . "
and he said to me , very ster@@ nly , " You go right back down to that welfare office , and you demand to see a supervisor .
going door to door .
Phone banking , talking to voters , because many voters have a lot of doubts and they don 't know how to vote .
now , we did this in the past .
and I want to give an example of issues that we are facing in the United States of America , for instance .
and then we think , " H@@ m , ban@@ anas . "
and that country is Cuba .
thank you very much .
human origins .
the last common ancestors between humans and ch@@ im@@ ps date somewhere between six and eight million years .
with each new fossil discovery , we get a little bit closer to better understanding who we are and where we came from .
I first traveled there in 2003 , and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. P@@ les .
this treasure tro@@ ve of f@@ ossi@@ ls was being recovered from a new site called the Din@@ al@@ ed@@ i Chamber in the R@@ ising Star cave system .
an unprecedented approximately 1800 specimens -- so far -- have been excav@@ ated from the R@@ ising Star system , representing at least 15 individual sk@@ elet@@ ons .
the research team that I was invited to join was tasked with describing , comparing and analyzing the f@@ ossi@@ ls , with the difficult goal of identifying to what species the f@@ ossi@@ ls belonged .
( la@@ ughter ) And after long , intense days in the lab , the different teams would meet up at night and discuss our findings , still consumed by questions from our analyses .
it was incredible how different the interpretations were .
and if we had only recovered the sk@@ ull , we might have called it one thing ; if we had only recovered the pel@@ vis , we might have called it another .
however , the brain is scar@@ c@@ ely half the size of a modern human one .
why is there so much morph@@ ological variation in the gen@@ us Hom@@ o ?

with two species co@@ existing in Africa at 300,000 years , we can no longer assume we know the maker of tools at sites with no associated species .
who did it evolve from ?
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
what might this be ?
invented in the early 20th century by Swiss psychi@@ atr@@ ist Her@@ mann R@@ or@@ sch@@ ach , the R@@ or@@ sch@@ ach Test is actually less about the specific things we see , and more about our general approach to perception .
he studied how our process of perception do@@ es@@ n 't just register sen@@ sory inputs , but trans@@ forms them .
and when he started working at a mental hospital in eastern Switzerland , he began designing a series of pu@@ zz@@ ling images to gain new insight into this en@@ ig@@ matic process .
patients suffering from the same mental illnesses also performed similarly , making the test a reliable diagnostic tool .
in 1921 , R@@ or@@ sch@@ ach published his coding system alongside the ten bl@@ ots he felt gave the most nu@@ an@@ ced picture of people 's percep@@ tual approach .
over the next several decades , the test became wil@@ dly popular in countries around the world .
by the 1960s , it had been officially administered millions of times in the U.S. alone .
bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns behind our perceptions .
the anthro@@ polog@@ ist Donald Brown has tried to list them all , and they range from aesthe@@ tics , affec@@ tion and age stat@@ uses all the way down to we@@ an@@ ing , weapons , weather , attempts to control , the color white and a world@@ view .
this is a recent study by the neuro@@ bi@@ ologist Paul Thom@@ pson and his colleagues in which they -- using M@@ RI -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is , the outer layer of the cor@@ te@@ x -- in a large sample of pairs of people .
this is what happens in people who share half of their DNA -- fraternal tw@@ ins .
and you can see huge areas of cor@@ te@@ x where there are massive cor@@ relations in the distribution of gray matter .
as you can see , there are two inven@@ tors with identical contra@@ ptions in their lap , meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney .
and needless to say , there were certain risks in taking on these subjects .
I note that among the long list of human univers@@ als that I presented a few slides ago are art .
someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflec@@ t ire from discussions of gender and Naz@@ ism and race and so on . I won 't comment on that .
the genetically controlled studies have some so@@ bering results .
remember the Mal@@ lif@@ ert tw@@ ins : separated at birth , then they meet in the patent office -- remarkably similar .
that would make them super @@@ -@@ @ similar , right ?
there 's a small m@@ all with a restaurant , a pu@@ b , a supermarket , a club room .
de@@ men@@ tia is a terrible disease , and we still don 't have any cure for it .
and they did@@ n 't understand why they lived there .
and their menu , well , is more French cuisine than traditional Dutch .
that one ci@@ gar was the only luxury he could afford for himself .
and until the day he died in the Ho@@ ge@@ we@@ yk , he was in this little shed , every day , after lunch , to smoke his ci@@ gar .
there 's more in life , everybody wants fun in life and a meaningful life .
even if you 're living with advanced de@@ men@@ tia .
and they had fun together .
and then they said good@@ b@@ ye , and each went their own way .
they should be designing for the places and the people , the landscapes that the wall end@@ angers .
my favorite line is the first one : " something there is that do@@ es@@ n 't love a wall . "
but the reality is that the wall is cutting through people 's lives .
it is cutting through our private property , our public lands , our Native American lands , our cities , a university , our neighbor@@ hoods .
and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't help but wonder what it would be like if the wall cut through a house .
because I wanted to communicate how the wall is not only dividing places , it 's dividing people , it 's dividing families .
it was designed by graphic designer John Ho@@ od , a Native American war veteran working for the California Department of Transportation .
and he was tasked with creating a sign to warn motor@@ ists of immigrants who were str@@ an@@ ded alongside the highway and who might attempt to run across the road .
hood related the plight of the immigrant today to that of the Nav@@ aj@@ o during the Long Wal@@ k .
ye@@ ah , I think that 's pretty likely -- there 's going to be lots of robots everywhere .
on the right there is another robot doll , who you could get a couple of years ago .
at the bottom right is one that I built in my lab about 10 years ago , and we finally turned that into a product .
( la@@ ughter ) Don 't worry , relax , no , relax , it 's a robot , it 's smart !
but we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our lab@@ s .
the worst thing that 's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters .
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay . he 's pretty good . ye@@ ah . good , good , good .
it looks for highly saturated colors , from toys .
and it looks for things that move around .
and it looks right at that .
robot : Oh , cool .
and the question is , you know , will someone accid@@ entally build a robot that takes over from us ?
before that has to come to be a mil@@ dly bad robot , and before that a not so bad robot .
and another student , let 's call her Ab@@ by , had just raised her hand and volunteered : " maybe some people don 't like black people because their skin is the color of po@@ op . "
so just take a second to freeze this scene in your mind .
and as much as I wanted this moment to be over , and that I knew both of these options would help me escape the situation , I knew that this was far too important of a te@@ ac@@ hable moment to miss .
when we have these conversations with students at a young age , it actually takes away some of that tabo@@ o feeling when those topics come up at a later age .
now , a little while back , I wrote a lesson about consent .
but my students are third @@@ -@@ @ gra@@ ders , so we 're not talking about sex in class .
a few weeks ago , somebody t@@ wee@@ ted during the midterm elections in the United States that Election Day should be made a holiday .
then I remember the sacrifice of my father , who was tortured so many times for d@@ aring to protest against the regime .
it got to a point where the military knew their hand@@ writing , so as soon as they stum@@ bled upon one , they 'd go and get them .
so they are always protecting us from some foreign forces .
and they suppress institutions and destroy them so that they don 't have to be held accountable .
you know when we talk about animals , we say animal cruelty when animals are abused , because there 's no charter acknowledged by the UN saying animal rights charter .
on August 28th , 1963 , Martin Lu@@ ther King J@@ r@@ . delivered his " I Have a Dre@@ am " speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom .
you can 't help but actually ri@@ pping that spi@@ der web apart .
I would never have the money to actually pay for the install@@ ment or pay for all the bil@@ l@@ boards or the production of these , so there 's always a client attached to them .
if it 's -- see it for a long enough time , I actually do something about it .
this is our roof in New York , the roof of the studio .
this is news@@ print plus st@@ enc@@ ils that lie on the news@@ print .
the second key thing is that the machines are , in a limited sense , beginning to think .
they 're solving problems , and most importantly , they 're learning .
now , at least to me , there are two things that really stand out about the game of Go .
now , based on what I know about the game of Go , I would 've gu@@ essed that it really ought to be on the safe side of that line .
but the fact that it is@@ n 't , and that Google solved this problem , suggests that that line is going to be very dynamic .
it 's going to shift , and it 's going to shift in a way that con@@ sumes more and more jobs and tasks that we currently perceive as being safe from automation .
that 's something that we should absolutely strive to move toward .
now , basic income is becoming a very important idea .
it 's an idea that we can build on and refine .
and yet , suppose you know that at some point in the future , no matter what , you 're going to get the same basic income as everyone else .
thank you very much .
the logic behind this , which is aw@@ ful , is that more resources are taken up caring for an injured soldier than dealing with a person who has been killed .
almost 15 million people are living now in the countryside of Colombia .
imagine , for a moment , if we can crow@@ d@@ source information from all of them to help people like Adri@@ ana and her children to find safe and reliable paths .
this information can also help them to become more productive .
we want to go big , and we want to scale the project to every single place where land mines are still a threat .
Don 't worry , I 'm not going to give you my whole speech in the dark .
first , I 'm not here ...
I am here to tell you that I am a stati@@ stic that CA@@ N@@ NOT be ignored .
it 's here , it came all the way with me .
then we combined it with the ashes that came from the land@@ fills .
we also need electricity , we need the energy .
we teach local vendors and technicians to sell , install and provide customer services for people .
we got the project off the ground by providing 15 families with solar energy .
and I told them , " We have a great idea .
now , families are approaching us from all around the Gaza Strip .
now I can control my source of energy .
what you take for granted is a privilege for others .
she do@@ es@@ n 't want to fight .
I could fit all movies ever made inside of this tube .
all of our thoughts and actions these days , through photos and videos -- even our fitness activities -- are stored as digital data .
now , this is very temp@@ ting , but I decided to go back and look at the TED website 's very humble begin@@ nings .
as you can see , it 's changed quite a bit in the last 30 years .
we don 't worry about storing our emails and our photos .
there 's a way to store it all .
after all , it contains all the information necessary to build and maintain a human being .
each pix@@ el in a black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white photo is simply a zero or a one .
now , while DNA is more robust than any man @@@ -@@ @ made device , it 's not perfect .
it 's really hard to grasp what 's important today , or what will be important for future generations .
but the point is , we don 't have to decide today .
items are nominated to be added to the collection , including that film that we en@@ coded .
instead of asking the current generation -- us -- what might be important in the future , we could store everything in DNA .
every advance in writing data has required a new way to read it .
as long as we 're around , DNA is around , and we 'll find a way to sequence it .
I built a school just for girls so that they can be free from FGM and early marriage .
at my first enrol@@ l@@ ment -- ( Appl@@ ause and che@@ ers ) At my first enrol@@ l@@ ment , I had hoped for 10 girls .
( che@@ ers and appl@@ ause ) I started to realize just how big this dream was , and soon I learned that my school could be the foundation -- but it was@@ n 't going to be enough .
some had been abused , others were orphans , and some came from families that are very traditional , that had never sent any girl to school .
her older sister had already gone through FGM and already married , but Fa@@ ith was so determined .
so I came to realize once again , as I did when I needed help to go to university , that while I could dream or have a dream , I could not make it come true all by myself .
with each visit , he built a strong relationship with his daughter -- notic@@ ing not just her grades but also accepting her as someone with full potential .
I also brought mothers to the table , including my own .
and in the process , I was embraced by the world , and you have become my village .
and then the lim@@ e that you produce can be used in industrial processes , and in being used , it scru@@ bs CO2 out of the air .
overall , the process is carbon negative .
none of us will see that day , but we must start in the hope that future generations will be able to finish the job .
you talked about , we need to do an experiment on this .
you would do a small experiment .
that lim@@ e is going to get out there .
and people feel outra@@ ged about doing experiments on the planet , as we 've heard .
I would put it in the following equation : no 9 / 11 , no war .
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol , for example .
and I would add that bin La@@ den and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy , or at least capitalist democracy , on the one hand , and the world of Islam as they see and define it .
and the same problem with respect to Islam .
you can show a mosque , or you can show wor@@ shippers , but there 's not a straightforward way of depic@@ ting Islam .
you know , post @@@ -@@ @ 9 / 11 , we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying , " Islam means peace . "
well , so says George W. Bush .
some people would say that Islam means submission .
you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago , which was fear .
what I want to suggest to you , though , in the next couple of minutes is that there 's also a hopeful response to this .
and by virtue of being technologies , they 're manip@@ ul@@ able .
and they 're manip@@ ul@@ able in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes .
what do I have in mind ?
and these Muslims -- and it 's the vast majority of Muslims -- disagree profoundly with bin La@@ den 's approach , profoundly .
and it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other , and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them .
and there are Muslims , many Muslims out there , who are saying precisely this .
and they 're making this argument wherever they 're permitted to make it .
so in Morocco , for example , they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats .
so had they contested a larger number of the seats , they would have done even better .
now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world .
what does it mean to say that there 's an Islamic democracy ?
it will be transformative of Islam as well .
so last year , I ran for mayor of my home@@ town , Tul@@ sa , Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a .
he publicized a letter that he sent to President Obama pro@@ testing Syrian refugees , even though none of them were coming to Tul@@ sa .
( la@@ ughter ) He ran ads on TV that my kids thought made me look like Vol@@ dem@@ ort , and sent out little g@@ ems in the mail , like this .
and so on election day , I , G.@@ T. B@@ yn@@ um , a guy whose name reminds people of a cir@@ cus promo@@ ter ...
( la@@ ughter ) I won the election by 17 points .
now , why is that story and that approach so novel ?
why do we always allow ourselves to fall back on philosophical disagreements that ultimately lead to division ?
the conventional wisdom is that to win an election , you have to dum@@ b it down and play to your constituencies ' bas@@ est , divi@@ sive instinc@@ ts .
over 150 programs had their funding reduced because they could not demonstrate success .
but unfortunately , there was@@ n 't ever a well @@@ -@@ @ publicized increase in funding for those programs that did demonstrate success , and because of this , the program was never really popular with Congress , and was eventually shut@@ tered .
but the spirit of that program lived on .
now , while Mit@@ ch Dani@@ els applied this at the federal level , the state level , and in higher ed , the guy that really crac@@ ked the code for cities is a Democ@@ rat , Martin O '@@ Mal@@ ley , during his time as Mayor of Balti@@ more .
then , in such a tight pipe , there are so many immune cells that are being trained there .
( la@@ ughter ) And I did study medicine but I had no idea , so I had to go up to my room and look it up in different books .
I thought that was nice .
this is not because we 're hungry .
but for most of the people , is just results that it 's far easier to bur@@ p when you 're laying on your left side instead of your right .
it happened that I had been sitting next to that person the day before , and I sm@@ elled that he had very bad breath .
that the gu@@ t has something to contribute to this process .
the research we have today is creating a new definition of what real clean@@ liness is .
and , actually , the thing is , it 's about a healthy balance , I think .
and then I was like , " Oh , wait .
and it 's my theory at the moment that maybe we all do .
while moving up the lad@@ der working as a management consultant across Europe and the US , I started to realize how often I was the only woman in the room and how hom@@ ogenous leadership still is .
well , there 's no such thing as bad publicity , right ?
those few female board members alone , they won 't make a difference .
education just did not translate into leadership .
all is good .
congratulations .
your ancestors , back to the earliest f@@ ishes , over@@ came all these challenges .
96 percent of all fish species died during the Han@@ gen@@ berg event , 359 million years ago : an interval of fire and ice .
the handful of survivors came from many groups -- all greatly out@@ numbered by their own dead .
they ranged from top pre@@ dat@@ or to bottom @@@ -@@ @ fee@@ der , big to small , marine to freshwater .
( la@@ ughter ) And they found opportunity , prolif@@ erated , and won the future for their 60,000 living species , including you .
and then you notice , to your horror , that your watch is broken , and there 's no time to fix it .
how can you use the f@@ uses and lighter to time exactly 45 seconds ?
here 's the key insight : if you start a f@@ use on one side and it burns for 30 seconds , there 'll still be 30 seconds of f@@ use left .
so , this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do .
and this is the highest honor to be best@@ owed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar .
and our work do@@ es@@ n 't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all .
also the visual separation .
moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago .
the building incorporates the site , but it dispen@@ ses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is chore@@ ograph@@ ed .
then you come up in this glass elevator right near the cur@@ tain wall .
and this building , which is just naturally her@@ me@@ tic , we stripped .
but what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself , which is kind of where we 're really doing a massive amount of work .
one thing is that the subway is running and rum@@ bling right under the hall .
it 's like a co@@ ff@@ in , it basically sends all the sound , like a gu@@ tter @@@ -@@ @ ball effect , down the a@@ isl@@ es .
because we can 't eliminate a single seat , the architecture is restricted to 18 inches .
but it 's ac@@ ous@@ tically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . and here 's an acoustic shelf .
( la@@ ughter ) For us humans , who are earth@@ bound , birds represent freedom .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) In@@ deed , these birds have been part of our lives and cultures all over the world for centuries , and every society has a story about birds .
birds also build houses like us .
an interesting one : birds also love and date just like us humans .
( appl@@ ause ) Some have even learned to che@@ at on their spouses .
vul@@ tures clean up our environment by literally dig@@ esting disease @@@ -@@ @ causing path@@ ogens , and they finish carc@@ asses that would otherwise cost us lots of money to clear from the environment .
moreover , power lines are electro@@ cu@@ ting birds and wind farms are s@@ lic@@ ing birds when they fly through the blades .
but when we started , there was a big challenge .
come join us in citizen science and tell us the birds you 're finding in the places where you visit .
the children indeed are our future .
let us please teach them to love our fea@@ ther@@ makers , because the love of birds can be a huge gateway to appreciating all forms of nature .
these highly evolved beings want to trade DNA by breeding with humans so that each species " genes can diversify and forti@@ fy the other .
But@@ ler wanted to write diverse characters for diverse audiences .
there , they seek to live in accordance with Lau@@ ren 's found religion , Ear@@ th@@ seed , which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an ever @@@ -@@ @ changing world .
if she do@@ es@@ n 't save him , she herself will cease to exist .
she said that someone attacked her from behind , told her not to scream , said he had a gun and that she shou@@ ld@@ n 't move .
he raped her and then fled the scene . "
I never felt so alone , like I had been kidnapped .
but there 's another way to avoid the discomfort .
and if that had happened , it would have been worse , perhaps , than the rape itself .
she talked to him as if everything that was happening were normal , so he w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be thinking that she would turn him in later .
so two years ago , I joined the Education Commission .
our first task was to find out : how big is the learning crisis ?
what we did is actually we looked at countries by income level : low @@@ -@@ @ income , mid @@@ -@@ @ income , high @@@ -@@ @ income .
no dis@@ respect , Finland .
in the 2015 P@@ ISA -- Program for International Student Assessment -- Vietnam out@@ performed many wealthy economies , including the United States .
Don 't all countries track student progress and make those achievements public ? "
only half of the developing countries have systematic learning assessment at primary school , and even less so at lower secondary school .
maybe we should spend less . "
if every student in Somalia became a teacher -- every person who fin@@ ishes tertiary education became a teacher -- we won 't have enough teachers .
they developed the media center solution .
first of all , as I told you , because in many countries , we just don 't have enough qualified teachers .
you 're going to say , " How are we going to implement this all over the world ? "
so we 're pooling donor money in a finance facility for education , which will provide more finance for education .
but let me bring this back to the personal level , because this is where the impact lands .
education is the civil rights struggle , it 's the human rights struggle of our generation .
quality education for all : that 's the freedom fight that we 've got to win .
it was the size of the state of Connecticut .
N@@ B : are you man enough for me ?
N@@ B : are you man enough for me ?
you know , that might be something to consider , but that 's a distant threat .
now , artificial intelligence has started bol@@ stering their business as well .
and it may seem like artificial intelligence is just the next thing after online ads .
it 's a jump in category .
that 's why you see it in every supermarket .
in the physical world , we live with those limitations .
let 's say you want to sell plane tickets to Vegas . right ?
so in the old world , you could think of some demo@@ graphics to target based on experience and what you can guess .
I can ignore that .
that 's why Facebook wants to collect all the data it can about you .
so let 's push that Vegas example a bit .
they could do this , and you 'd have no clu@@ e that 's what they were picking up on .
I gave this example to a bun@@ ch of computer scientists once and afterwards , one of them came up to me .
now , the problem is@@ n 't solved if he do@@ es@@ n 't publish it , because there are already companies that are developing this kind of technology , and a lot of the stuff is just off the shelf .
it will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out . "
this simple t@@ weak .
imagine what a state can do with the immense amount of data it has on its citizens .
and this won 't be Or@@ well 's author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism .
this is@@ n 't " 1984 . "
now , if author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism is using over@@ t fear to terror@@ ize us , we 'll all be sca@@ red , but we 'll know it , we 'll hate it and we 'll resist it .
I 've written about how crucial social media is for social movements .
but it 's not the intent or the statements people in technology make that matter , it 's the structures and business models they 're building .
it 's either one or the other .
these structures are organizing how we function and they 're controlling what we can and we CA@@ N@@ NOT do .
in this context , it means that we are the product that 's being sold .
we need a digital economy where our data and our attention is not for sale to the highest @@@ -@@ @ bidding authoritarian or dem@@ ago@@ gue .
the trans@@ porter shi@@ vered in the sand and I held my breath .
now , the weight of my entire life was pressing on my shoulders .
by the time they all realized what I 'd done and where I was going , I 'd have left the planet .
at least some luck was on my side .
this idea of leaving but bringing and then becoming more is at one of the hearts of A@@ fro@@ fu@@ tur@@ ism , or you can simply call it a different type of science fiction .
still , not all science fiction has the same ancestral blood@@ line , that line being Western @@@ -@@ @ rooted science fiction , which is mostly white and male .
growing up , I did@@ n 't read much science fiction .
so I 'm Nigerian @@@ -@@ @ American .
specifically I cite those family trips to Nigeria in the late ' 9@@ 0s .
let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow .
so , that 's Ki@@ ber@@ a , the largest squ@@ at@@ ter community in Nairobi .
so , these are the cities of the future , and we have to engage them .
so -- " The hu@@ t was made of cor@@ ru@@ gated metal , set on a concrete pad .
it was a 10 by 10 cell .
Arm@@ strong O '@@ Bri@@ an , J@@ r@@ . shared it with three other men .
'@@ in case you owe one month , the land@@ lord will come with his hen@@ ch@@ men and bun@@ dle you out . he will confisc@@ ate your things , ' Arm@@ strong said .
but it stood in j@@ ar@@ ring contrast to something Arm@@ strong had said as we were eating -- that he trea@@ sured the quality of life in his neighborhood .
'@@ it 's a simple life , but nobody is restricting you .
this is perhaps the most primitive sh@@ an@@ ty that you can find in Ki@@ ber@@ a , little more than a stick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ mud hu@@ t next to a garbage he@@ ap .
this is home improvement : putting plastic tar@@ ps on your roof .
so , that 's a restaurant .
so , the question is how do you go from the mud @@@ -@@ @ hu@@ t village , to the more developed city , to the even highly developed Sultan@@ bel@@ yi ?
one is people need a guarantee they won 't be evicted .
how about this ?
look , a hundred people die every day due to vehic@@ ular crashes .
a car traveling at 55 miles an hour covers the length of an American football field in just under four and a half seconds , but just so happens to be the same amount of time it takes the average person to check a text message .
think about it .
or is that just the easy answer that gets us slow websites , sc@@ ary healthcare and dangerous roads ?
look , failure and im@@ perfection are basically the same thing .
nothing and nobody is perfect .
but here 's the really sc@@ ary part .
so this device is able to diag@@ nose genetic diseases in babies and new@@ bor@@ ns sooner , giving doctors an opportunity to start treatments earlier and potentially save the baby 's life .
for example : do you have a place to stay tonight ?
resettlement and integration is one of the greatest challenges of our time .
and our hope is that A@@ tar can provide every single newcom@@ er an advocate .
( la@@ ughter ) I cou@@ ld@@ n 't pick a career .
and I was actually rowing for my school here until this fat@@ eful day , and I f@@ li@@ pped over right in front of the entire school .
so I brought a picture with big hair .
I just want to get that out of the way .
the reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it .
but of course the scientists cou@@ ld@@ n 't help themselves .
this is one of my favorite ones here , where they have rab@@ bit breeding , so males choose the lucky rab@@ bit .
he 's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe .
that was much better .
by 2008 , we 're going to kick the but@@ t of the music industry .
well , obviously it 's for children , right ?
and inte@@ res@@ tingly , the people who buy the most games are 37 .
he did@@ n 't actually buy anything , just some data .
but he got great terms on it .
this purchase included mining and hunting rights , ownership of all land on the island , and a castle with no furniture included .
this is happening in your local cities too , you 're probably just not aware of it .
so I 'd like to play this video .
( music ) In the year of my birth the N@@ inten@@ do Entertainment System also went into development .
( music ) From an early age I learned to invest myself emo@@ tionally in what un@@ folded before me on screen .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
without it , the problems faced in the real world -- poverty , war , disease and genocide -- lack the le@@ vity they should .
their importance bl@@ ends into the sens@@ ation@@ alized drama of prime time TV .
a well @@@ -@@ @ designed video game will seam@@ lessly we@@ ave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience .
something has happened to my brain .
I 'm not sure what the implications of my experience are , but the potential for using realistic video game stimul@@ i in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frigh@@ tening to me .
video games are fun , engaging , and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re @@@ -@@ @ programming .
I 'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization .
part of me is just waiting to let go .
I think it 's going to come from the children who are growing up now that are@@ n 't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past .
I 'm sitting at the front of the class , and they 're actually pit@@ ching their ideas .
the woman , let 's call her " V , " was beaten for over 50 minutes before she died .
one minute and 20 seconds .
I lead a global organization for socially engaged creative solutions .
in a world of endless ways forward , I felt at my final stop .
from this very stage , psychi@@ atr@@ ist and play researcher Dr. Stu@@ art Brown said that nothing lights up the brain like play , and that the opposite of play is not work , it 's depression .
we can only win if we are not afraid to lose .
it is not .
I have a night@@ mare that one day all the past will be forgotten and new clothes will be dri@@ pping the blood of past mistakes .
but way more than that , I have hope .
that 's how we win .
" judge , I want to tell you something . I want to tell you something .
well , that simple idea is procedural justice and it 's a concept that says that if people perceive they are treated fairly and with dignity and respect , they 'll obey the law .
the good news is is that the principles of procedural justice are easy and can be implemented as quickly as tomorrow .
you see , assigning a letter to my father , a letter to my son , " If I knew then what I know now ... "
gives the person an opportunity to be intro@@ spective , go on the inside , which is where all the answers are anyway .
but it also gives them an opportunity to share something with the court that goes beyond their criminal record and their charges .
" N@@ ope . "
and what 's going on with you ? "
versus , " You can read and write , can 't you ? "
" yes , I knew it ! no real man has hips like those . "
I would totally support his right to use the men 's bathroom .
how does he have sex ? "
( la@@ ughter ) And I kept it in my email signature for months afterwards , because you also don 't ever stop coming out .
when I came out to my d@@ ad , to my great relief , he was totally cool with me being trans , but as soon as I started talking about physically transi@@ tioning , he fre@@ aked .
there are dozens of different gender @@@ -@@ @ affirming surg@@ eries from chest surg@@ eries to bottom surg@@ eries to facial feminization and man @@@ -@@ @ sculp@@ ting .
and often we opt to just not go to the bathroom at all .
listen to us .
I 've been doing some thinking .
my d@@ ad has fron@@ to@@ temporal lo@@ be de@@ men@@ tia , or F@@ TD .
( la@@ ughter ) " What a co@@ w@@ boy . "
and you don 't even know how to buy heroin . "
so I went to see D@@ ad .
so I fell over and I sat there with him because for the first time in a long time he seemed kind of OK .
nobody was productive .
both of us are still strong .
and I think it kind of does , because as you 've heard , as the sea levels come up , it takes weaker and weaker storms to do something like this .
so now we have too much , too little , wrong place , wrong time .
and they did .
it 's a place called S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
climate change has greatly reduced the sea ice around here , greatly increasing human activity , and it 's becoming a flash@@ point , and in fact the NATO Parliamentary Assembly is going to meet here on S@@ val@@ b@@ ard next month .
fortunately , our Secretary of Defense , Secretary Mat@@ tis , he understands that as well , and what he understands is that climate is a risk .
it 's not only the US military that understands this .
it do@@ es@@ n 't care which party controls your parliament .
it just mel@@ ts .
cities are the most extraordinary experiment in social engineering that we humans have ever come up with .
the Big Apple has 8.5 million people and an annual budget of 80 billion dollars .
now , I want to talk to you a little bit about the risks that cities are facing -- some of the big mega @@@ -@@ @ risks .
see , over 1.4 million Syrians made the per@@ il@@ ous journey through the Mediterranean and up through Turkey to find their way into two countries , primarily : Germany and Sweden .
I want to take you also all the way over to the West , because this is@@ n 't just a problem in Asia or Africa or Latin America , this is a problem also in the West .
many of you know Miami is one of the we@@ alth@@ i@@ est cities in the United States ; it 's also one of the most flood @@@ -@@ @ prone .
on either side you see land being cleared for pa@@ sture , for cattle , but also for so@@ y and sugar production .
see , the Brazilian government , from the national to the state to the municipal level , has also introduced a whole range -- a lat@@ tice -- of parks and protected areas .
but we 're going to need to see a lot more of it , especially in the global south .
I just want to pass on six .
you could do worse than take a page from the book of Singapore .
second : you 've got to go green .
when done well -- rapid bus transit , light rail , bi@@ ke@@ ways , wal@@ k@@ ways , boat@@ ways -- these can dramatically reduce emissions and congestion .
they don 't have time to waste .
IC@@ LE@@ I , U@@ CL@@ G , Me@@ tropol@@ is -- these are the movements of the future .
as I travel around the world and meet mayors and civic leaders , I 'm amaz@@ ed by the energy , enthusiasm and effectiveness they bring to their work .
they deserve -- no , they have a right to -- a seat at the table .
thank you .
being surrounded by many cultures was the norm , but also a very confusing experience .
in both Chinese and Native folk , I sense this inherent sound of l@@ onging and holding onto the past , an emo@@ tion that greatly drives the music I create today .
after a few years experi@@ menting , I was 17 and had something I wanted to tell and preserve .
in my father 's words , " Being Native is not about wearing long hair in bra@@ ids .
after traveling with this film for over a year , I met indigenous people from around the world , from the A@@ in@@ u of Japan , Sami of Scandin@@ avia , the Maori and many more .
this will be the worst mistake of your life .
( la@@ ughter ) I know that the skep@@ ticism coming from my brothers is out of care and concern for me .
the other 90 percent , they change careers , they work in marketing , sales , education and other fields .
to put things into perspective , the US budget for the military mar@@ ching bands alone is almost twice as much as the entire N@@ EA .
the arts brings meaning to life .
thank you .
and it was a beautiful urban day , and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working .
and I thought , well , this is the power of a city .
they don 't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail .
if they did , it probably was right there at Ground Zero .
there 's one person putting up the link , and there 's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not .
this page is effectively , collectively auth@@ ored by the Web , and Google is just helping us kind of to put the author@@ ship in one kind of coherent place .
I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Techn@@ or@@ ati on the right @@@ -@@ @ hand side of my page , and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes .
so it 's much closer , in a way , to a data fun@@ gu@@ s , in a sense , wrapped around that page , than it is to a deliberate link that I 've placed there .
now , what you 're having here is basically a global brain that you 're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it 's thinking .
Google does the Google Ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist , which looks at search requests to test what 's going on , what people are interested in , and they publish it with lots of fun graphs .
( la@@ ughter ) I also did -- and I don 't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection .
so the first one is -- these are the bur@@ sty words around 18@@ 6@@ 0s -- slaves , emancipation , slavery , rebellion , Kansas .
and I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system .
it follows a power law , so that there are a few extremely well @@@ -@@ @ linked to , popular blogs , and a long tail of blogs with very few links .
now this is a very interesting thing .
it 's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man , one modem democracy , where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .
and so very quickly you can accumulate a bun@@ ch of links , and it makes it more likely for newcom@@ ers to link to you in the future , and then you get this kind of shape .
chronic homelessness is defined as an unaccompanied adult who has been continuously homeless for a year or more or more than four times homeless in three years that totals 365 days .
and I thought , " Now that is one stupid idea . "
there had been an agency in New York City that had been inviting mentally ill homeless individuals to move directly from the street into housing .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ two months later , all 17 were still housed , including K@@ eta , who today , 11 years later , is sleeping in her own bed and is so@@ ber .
now our theory of case management is : anything necessary to keep them housed . "
she was happy to learn otherwise , and they were soon re@@ connected .
but it was a medical enc@@ ycl@@ ope@@ dia that argu@@ ably exerted the most powerful influence on Bas@@ qu@@ i@@ at .

it uses electromagnetic fields to pro@@ pel charged particles like pro@@ tons faster and faster along a spir@@ aling path .
when the pro@@ tons reach their maximum speed , they shoot out onto a target that contains a few mill@@ il@@ iters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen @@@ -@@ @ 18 .
the identity of the trac@@ er depends on what doctors want to observe .
but before we get to that fascinating phenomenon , it 's important to understand the difference between gl@@ aci@@ ers that grow in the wild , and those that humans create .
at the confl@@ u@@ ence of three great mountain ranges , the Him@@ al@@ ay@@ as , Karak@@ or@@ am , and Hindu K@@ ush , some local cultures have believed for centuries that gl@@ aci@@ ers are alive .
in early spring , these frozen pools begin to mel@@ t , supplying villagers with irrigation for their fields .
local people make vertical gl@@ aci@@ ers using the mel@@ tw@@ ater from already @@@ -@@ @ existing gl@@ aci@@ ers high above their villages .
that ensures that the mini @@@ -@@ @ gl@@ ac@@ ier mel@@ ts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water to feed the farmers " crops .
I was visiting this birth center in the north of India .
you dry the baby with a clean cloth to stimulate them to breathe .
she trained an amazing roster of viol@@ in virtu@@ os@@ os : Mid@@ ori , Sarah Chan@@ g , It@@ z@@ hak Per@@ l@@ man .
so then which view is right ?
they 're breaking your actions down and then helping you build them back up again .
you can imagine the whole job category that could reach out in the world and that millions of people could fulfill .
she broke her water in the tri@@ age area , so they brought her directly to the labor and delivery room , and then they ran through their checks .
she dried that baby with a clean to@@ wel .
and she got back a green , thick liquid , and within a minute of being able to do that and suc@@ tioning out over and over , that baby started to breathe .
I saw a team transformed because of coaching .
and I saw at least one life saved because of it .
it never occurred to me that that was new , different or we@@ ir@@ d .
so I think the interesting thing that happens is that when you look at the world through another lens , when you 're not the person normally in charge of things , it just comes out a different way .
I think it 's kind of exciting .
the idea that there 's sort of an equ@@ al@@ izer happening , that sort of means that anybody can make something , is wonderful .
because if you have one tiny show over here on AM@@ C and one tiny show over here over there , finding where they are becomes much harder .
but it 's going to be harder to find , and at some point that will collapse .
how it gets distributed is getting harder and harder .
but part of me also gets it completely .
so maybe it 'll over@@ correct , maybe it 'll all explo@@ de , or maybe we 'll all just become -- I hate to be negative about it , but maybe we 'll all just become more idi@@ otic .
so where else in US or elsewhere in the world do you look ?
who is doing interesting stor@@ yt@@ elling right now ?
obviously British television is always amazing and always does interesting things .
the possibilities feel endless and exciting right now , which is what exc@@ ites me .

wa@@ king up with Abraham Lin@@ col@@ n in the morning , thinking of Frank@@ lin Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t when I went to bed at night .
and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other , is to open oneself to ultimate sad@@ ness in older age .
as a result he became obs@@ essed with the thought that when we die our life is swe@@ pt away -- dust to dust .
" everyone is broken by life , " Er@@ nest Hem@@ ing@@ way once said , " but some people are stronger in the broken places . "
he shared credit with ease , assumed responsibility for the failure of his sub@@ ordinates , constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes .
not as great a general as Napol@@ eon , not as great a states@@ man as Freder@@ ick the Great . "
that ambition that had allowed him to labor@@ iously educate himself by himself , to go through that string of political failures and the dar@@ k@@ est days of the war .
he was a great stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er .
( la@@ ughter ) So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales .
so I constantly chat@@ ted to him about boy@@ friends , even when I did@@ n 't have any at all .
( la@@ ughter ) It was pretty embar@@ ras@@ sing , given what was going on in my mind .
as his spirits s@@ ag@@ ged , his body deteriorated until , I believe , he slowly brought about his own death .
in those last years , he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and for@@ getting him .
one of his favorite stories , for example , had to do with the Revolutionary War hero , E@@ than Al@@ len .
and as Lin@@ col@@ n told the story , Mr. Al@@ len went to Britain after the war .
they fig@@ ured he 'd be upset about the indign@@ ity of George Washington being in an ou@@ thouse .
I must say , so fer@@ vent was my love of the old Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n D@@ od@@ gers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to bas@@ eball .
when you are brought up as a Catholic , you think that if you ever set foot in a Prote@@ stant Church , you 'll be struck dead at the threshold .
he said , " No problem . it was@@ n 't a religious service . "
I thought , " This is@@ n 't fair , I 'm an intro@@ vert , and all of the offline campaigning seems to be fav@@ oring ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts . "
and also , I did@@ n 't think it was particularly cle@@ ver , but I could see that a lot of the activis@@ m that worked was@@ n 't only ex@@ tro@@ vert activis@@ m .
by doing repeti@@ tive actions , like handic@@ raft , you can 't do it fast , you have to do it slowly .
so that was that intimate form of activis@@ m .
thanks .
did you have any political ambitions at that time ?
so here I am .
AG@@ F : absolutely not .
I think the journey started immediately after TED , actually .
she said , " No , it 's serious .
so , OK , you 'll come ? "
a very small interrogation mark -- and people don 't see the interrogation mark , they just see my name and they see my picture .
we 've seen that whenever there was diversity , whenever there was openness , whenever there was dialogue , this was the time when societies have been most productive .
even the Pope has agreed that evolution exists .
but there 's always the question : what came first ?
and you 've always been passionate about science .
did that make you even more determined to study science and to succeed in that field ?
" well , you shou@@ ld@@ n 't study chemistry because this is for boys .
I said , " This is what he said ... " He said , " What are you going to do ? "

the new thing now is that computers can find their own rules .
we 're really shifting over from precision sensors like rad@@ ars and l@@ asers into very cheap , commodi@@ tized sensors .
it 's called a ne@@ ural network .
this one was actually done at Stan@@ ford by one of our collaborators .
and then he was confused .
so I think this might be the first time that we actually found , in the practice of using deep learning , an actual person whose mel@@ an@@ oma would have gone un@@ classified , had it not been for deep learning .
my take is , we need more testing .
they show up to work and I don 't even know .

it 's a bit sc@@ ary , I know .
and what exactly are you waiting for ?
sometimes , the cur@@ l might completely enclose part of the wave , forming a moving tube of water known as the barrel .
because of irregularities in the seaf@@ lo@@ or and the s@@ well itself , few barrels last as long as the legendary 27 @@@ -@@ @ second ride off the coast of Namibia .
and the waves we surf , created by wind , are just one visible part of the continuous oscill@@ ation of energy that has shaped our universe since its very beginning .
after months of strategic planning and controversy , thousands of women gathered in Washington D.C.
as a dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised group , women had no voice in the laws that affected the@@ ir@@ - or anyone else '@@ s@@ - lives .

as a member of the National American Women Su@@ ff@@ rage Association , Paul proposed a massive p@@ age@@ ant to whi@@ p up support and rejuven@@ ate the movement .
however , in planning the parade , Paul mainly focused on appealing to white women from all backgrounds , including those who were racist .
in this way , the march initiated a surge of support for women 's voting rights that endured in the coming years .

how can we make sense in a world that do@@ es@@ n 't ?
I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours , a tool that you might not expect : abstract mathematics .
I don 't solve quad@@ ratic equations to help me with my daily life , but I do use mathematical thinking to help me understand arguments and to em@@ path@@ ize with other people .
but before I talk about the entire human world , I need to talk about something that you might think of as irrelevant schools ma@@ ths : factors of numbers .
maybe you can remember them . we 'll work them out .
we can see something more here . there 's a hierarchy going on .
and then at the top , we have 30 , which is a product of three prime numbers -- two times three times five .
now maybe it can be clear that it do@@ es@@ n 't really matter what those numbers are .
so we could replace them with something like A , B and C instead , and we get the same picture .
for example , they could be three types of privilege : rich , white and male .
so here we have rich , white non @@@ -@@ @ male people , to remind us that there are non@@ binary people we need to include .
and there are many things we can learn from this diagram , I think .
in our original diagram , rich white men were at the top , but if we restricted our attention to non @@@ -@@ @ men , we would see that they are here , and now the rich , white non @@@ -@@ @ men are at the top .
we can all use these abstract structures to help us pivo@@ t between situations in which we are more privileged and less privileged .
my wish is that everybody would try to understand other people more and work with them together , rather than competing with them and trying to show that they 're wrong .
rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades .

this is the cycle of self @@@ -@@ @ defeat .

socially prescribed perfec@@ tion@@ ists feel a un@@ rel@@ enting need to meet the expectations of other people .
but is there hope ?
parents can help their children by supporting them unconditionally when they 've tried but failed .
and what I quickly and collectively learned with my staff was that this situation was more extreme than anything we had ever been trained for .
and how am I going to stop him from impeding the learning of all the other students ?
and as we began to learn more about D , we learned other strategies that helped him calm down .
and our kids benef@@ itted from this , too .
or " How can I help you ? " instead of " Get out . "
I 'm happy to say that when D got to fourth grade , he rarely got into trouble .
I recently reviewed some of their hi@@ stories .
and what I discovered was that many of them exhibit the same behavi@@ ors that I saw in six @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old D.
thank you .
the problem was , there we@@ ren 't any better ideas .
people really liked that part of the model .
and by making a mental space where I could try out ou@@ trage@@ ous ideas and then bring them back into the real world to test them , I could learn .
a planet is a body whose self @@@ -@@ @ gravity is strong enough to give it its rounded shape .
the informal sector is growing jobs at four times the rate of the traditional formal economy , or " modern " economy , as many call it .

so she 's trapped in the middle .
these are the ones who fit neither the policy stereo@@ type of the low @@@ -@@ @ skilled and the marginalized , nor the white @@@ -@@ @ coll@@ ar , sal@@ ari@@ ed office worker or civil servant with a pension that the middle classes are allegedly composed of .
( TIC ) And these were only some of my symptoms .
I could no longer go to school , see my friends or even eat out , because my tics would attract the attention of everyone in the room .
in search for a cure , we flew to New York to meet with the best pedi@@ atric neuro@@ psych@@ ologist my parents could find .

it was just something I did by default .
but in reality , I 've realized it was the music that composed me .
thank you .
I build AI for a living so , full disclosure , I 'm kind of a ner@@ d .
we see this everywhere .
we could blame Hollywood for that .
or you 've sc@@ rolled past adverts of fertility clinics on your Facebook feed .
" a person called John makes a better program@@ mer than a person called Mary . "
you 're probably thinking , " W@@ ow , that sounds like a pretty sex@@ ist , racist person , " right ?
this kind of gender discrimination is not OK .
that 's not it .
how often do you use a voice assistant like S@@ iri , Alex@@ a or even Cor@@ tana ?
they all have two things in common : one , they can never get my name right , and second , they are all female .
so they 're doing some research for a school project and they Google images of CEO .
so there are three things we can do .
here 's just one example .
and I chose a name that did not reveal my gender .
you can probably guess where this is going , right ?
so this is not about the talent .
because , when people from diverse backgrounds come together , when we build things in the right way , the possibilities are lim@@ it@@ less .
so , yes , some of the energy in the world of AI , in the world of technology is going to be about what ads you see on your stream .
what if she could get diagnosis on her phone , instead ?
so , I 'm sure in the next couple of days there will be yet another news story about the exi@@ st@@ ential risk , robots taking over and coming for your jobs .
we need women to be the makers and not just the machines who do the makers ' bidding .
so I hope I leave you thinking about two things .
first , I hope you leave thinking about bias today .
the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .
I 'll just mention two gener@@ al@@ izations in this area .
instead , there are a dozen things , any one of which could do us in .
he talked about how the man@@ dal@@ as of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war .
this is a typical result that many people have presented , and there are many variations on it .
but this little excer@@ pt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview .
and that sounds like a kind of a romantic exagg@@ eration .
for instance , a poet describes it in this form .
for instance , this is another student of mine , Sus@@ an Jackson from Australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world .
and like all of these successful and responsible CE@@ Os say , you can 't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job .
it 's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you 're working .
( la@@ ughter ) As a trans activist , I get this question a lot .
according to a recent G@@ LA@@ AD survey , about 16 percent of non @@@ -@@ @ trans Americans claim to know a trans person in real life .
this brings us to the riots at Co@@ op@@ er Do @@@ -@@ @ nuts in 1959 , Comp@@ ton 's Ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia in 1966 and the famous St@@ one@@ wall Inn in 1969 .

the stories around food are sc@@ ary and somewhat overwhelming , and I told myself it 's time to bring a mindful patience into the imp@@ ati@@ ence .
but that 's not true -- that 's not even the goal of science .
the ultimate goal of science is to understand objective reality the best way we know how , and that 's based on evidence .
and so ba@@ ked into this process is a way of minimizing our own bias .
so sort of bo@@ iled down more than is probably useful , here 's how this works .
another good idea is to talk to other people .
now , part of this process is ad@@ mitting when you 're wrong .
I had to give up .
and I had to tell this other scientist , " The data 's too mess@@ y .
it was a background star or gal@@ axy , something like that .
but that 's part of it .
there 's going to be a time when you have to let go of your idea if you want to understand the bigger picture .
the price of doing science is ad@@ mitting when you 're wrong , but the pay@@ off is the best there is : knowledge and understanding .
and I can give you a thousand examples of this in science , but there 's one I really like .
it 's not that special .
it 's bl@@ asting out radiation .
this is the last place in the universe you would expect to find a planet , but they had very meth@@ odic@@ ally looked at this pul@@ sar , and they detected the gra@@ vit@@ ational tu@@ g of this planet as it orb@@ ited the pul@@ sar .

reporting sexual harassment can be , in many cases , career @@@ -@@ @ ending .
I thought he was helping me throughout the day , making a lot of phone calls .
( la@@ ughter ) I was working so hard to prove that bl@@ on@@ des have a lot of bra@@ ins .
and shortly thereafter , I , too , was sexually harassed in the workplace .
because of all the my@@ ths that are still associated with sexual harassment .
by the clothes that we wear and the make@@ up that we put on .
ye@@ ah , I guess those ho@@ o@@ dies that U@@ ber engineers wear in Sil@@ icon Valley are just so provocative .
( appl@@ ause ) So how do we go about getting our power back ?
in many cases , the company pic@@ ks the arbitrator for you .
and here 's what I tell the Sen@@ ators : sexual harassment is apol@@ itical .
and it 's just getting worse : after a few minutes of conversation , the person you 've been speaking to leaves , and you feel utterly defeated .
or imagine every time you go out , and you 're in crowded places , you feel this panic starting to arise .
it works , and it 's simpler than you may think .

and last but not least , having a purpose and meaning in life is a very important coping mechanism .
it 's not that we need other people 's good words to keep going in life , but if we don 't do something with someone else in mind , then we 're at much higher risk for poor mental health .
thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) When we detected that people were in deep sleep , we played the deep @@@ -@@ @ sleep stimulating sounds that were shown to make them have deeper sleep .
when we asked participants the next day about the sounds , they were completely unaware that we played the sounds , yet their bra@@ ins responded with more of these del@@ ta waves .
we learned that we could accurately track sleep without ho@@ oking people up to electro@@ des and make people sleep deeper .
( audience ) Yes .
this actually used to be a cor@@ n@@ field nine months ago , and with the Rwandan government , we level@@ ed it and built this center in a couple weeks .
so when a patient is having an emergency , a doctor or a nurse at that hospital can send us a Wh@@ at@@ s@@ App , telling us what they need .
and then our team will immediately spring into action .
and from the moment it leaves the end of the laun@@ cher , it 's completely autonomous .
because doctors can get what they need instantly , they actually stock less blood at the hospitals .
that 's more blood than you have in your entire body .
we 're always reminded : when we can help a doctor save a mom 's life , it 's not just her life that you 're saving .
that 's also a baby boy or a baby girl who has a mother while they 're growing up .
maternal health is a challenge everywhere .
Africa can be the disrup@@ ter .
and yet , no one anticipated how fast those networks were going to connect and empower people .
today , 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya flows through M @@@ -@@ @ P@@ esa , their mobile payment platform .
so innovation leads to more innovation leads to more innovation .
and the jobs that these kids may have gotten 10 years ago are largely being automated or are being changed dramatically by technology .
they 're looking for start @@@ -@@ @ ups .
the reason is that investors and entrepreneurs are totally blind to the opportunity .
Wikipedia , on the other hand , begins with a very radical idea , and that 's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .
and the way that we 're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine .
or " Who does that ? "
we could actually do without the employee .
well , it 's pretty good .
time magazine recently reported that " Ex@@ tre@@ me action sometimes has to be taken , and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004 . "
what 's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see , " OK , I understand now . "
and in the particular example we have here , it 's a film , " T@@ wi@@ sted Issues , " and the first person says , " Now this is supposedly a film . it fails the Google test mis@@ er@@ ably . "
this is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue .
so if you look at most of the major free software projects , they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the ben@@ evol@@ ent dict@@ ator .

( la@@ ughter ) But I think there 's going to be huge impacts .
we don 't mean we 're going to S@@ pa@@ m them with A@@ OL @@@ -@@ @ style CDs .
and I think that we 're going to see -- it may not even come from us ; there 's all kinds of innovation going on .

in this machine , a beam of pro@@ tons and anti@@ pro@@ tons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision , producing a burst of pure energy .
quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized .
finally , there 's the force of gravity , which inter@@ acts with matter via its mass and spin .
if we spread out the hyper@@ charge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two @@@ -@@ @ dimensional charge space , the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
a phy@@ sic@@ ist looks for larger , more sym@@ metric patterns that include the established pattern as a sub@@ set .
this unification model predic@@ ts the existence of these two new force particles , which should act a lot like the weak force , only weaker .
now , the only way to maintain san@@ ity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life .
and you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar , but in slightly different places .
living a nomadic existence has been hard at times , but it 's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I 've been happy with .

she had cy@@ stic fi@@ bro@@ sis , a genetic disease that made her lun@@ gs susceptible to bacterial infections .
this sample was transferred for bacterial analysis at the central laboratory so the doctors could act quickly if they discovered an infection .

but the girl was now diagnosed with a severe infection of deadly bacteria .
the world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology .

I 'm showing to you different sections of the show right now , just to give you a taste of it .
in this case too , you have a mixture of scientists and designers .
one of the assignments for a year was to work with in @@@ -@@ @ vit@@ ro meat .
so , we 'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future .
one of the most important topics of the show -- you know , as anything in our life today , we can look at it from many , many different viewpoints , and at different levels .
it takes seven days today to manufacture a chair , but you know what ? one day it will take seven hours .

it 's quite amazing how these things can make you smile , can make you laugh , can make you cry sometimes .
pol@@ lin@@ ator decline is a grand challenge in the modern world .
and yet we know that this indicator species is dying off .

( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Im@@ ag@@ ine getting such a degree in a good economy -- and it was 2009 : the Great Rec@@ ession .
and I was onto something .
and so the community on Cape C@@ od here in Provin@@ ce@@ town was ripe for citizen science , people looking for ways to get involved and to help .
meanwhile , back in my apartment here , I was a bit nervous about my land@@ lord .
and in the back alley of this image , what you see here , this hidden be@@ e@@ hi@@ ve -- that be@@ e@@ hi@@ ve produced more honey that first year than we have ever experienced in any be@@ e@@ hi@@ ve we had managed .
he came back to his office .
so in order to explain what 's actually been saving be@@ es , where they 're thri@@ ving , I need to first tell you what 's been killing them .
the top three kill@@ ers of be@@ es are agricultural chemicals such as pesticides , her@@ bic@@ ides , fun@@ g@@ icides ; diseases of be@@ es , of which there are many ; and habitat loss .
that was our question .
we shared our data with them .
we looked at pesticide levels .
in fact , there were more diseases of be@@ es in cities .
this was from R@@ ale@@ igh , North Carolina .
so I had a really interesting meeting .
( la@@ ughter ) I know we 're getting c@@ run@@ chy and it 's controversial , so before you throw your tomatoes , we 'll move to the summer honey , which is water l@@ ily honey .
if you have honey from Provin@@ ce@@ town right here in the summer , you 're eating water l@@ ily juice ; in the fall , suma@@ c honey .
we 're learning about our food for the first time ever .
but what 's more interesting is 85 different plant species in one te@@ as@@ po@@ on of honey .
that 's the measure we want , the big data .
we 're finding out now that in rural areas , there are 150 plants on average in a sample of honey .
you might think on my tom@@ b@@ stone , it 'll say , " Here lies No@@ ah . plant a flower . " right ?
when we take this information to governments , we can do amazing things .
we can plant those things on top of roof@@ tops worldwide to start restoring habitat and securing food systems .
we now have a baseline measure of honey , honey DNA from before and after the storm .
I know it sounds crazy , but think about this : a new Provin@@ ce@@ town , a new home@@ town , a place that might be familiar that 's also good for pol@@ lin@@ ators for a stable food system , when we 're thinking about the future .
and we can 't rely on the others -- the government , the engineers -- to make positive changes .
where the green chlor@@ ophy@@ l conver@@ ts light into sugar for plants , these cells convert light into electricity .
the best thing is , they even work indo@@ ors .
so I 'm giving extra functions to objects .

I want to build houses where all the windows , cur@@ tains , walls , even floors are harvesting electricity .
when she 's in my arms asleep ?
I was merely a con@@ nois@@ se@@ ur of movies featuring desert planets , as I still am .

five : all of which is to say , they made a movie out of the book , " Comm@@ union , " and it star@@ red Christop@@ her Wal@@ ken .
something odd ? something off ? something wrong with this picture ?
and to this day , I have no answer for you .
make of that what you will .
she was smil@@ ing .
and so I sat down to wait .
two hours , they gave me a message .
( la@@ ughter ) And even now , a decade and a half later , even now that we are married , I look for her still , whenever she is not in the room .
Sal@@ is@@ bury is a city that 's been dominated for hundreds of years by the Church , the Con@@ servative Party and the army .
it 's a place where people really love to observe the rules .
I 'm always late .
it 's a wonder I 've even turned up today .
I backed away .
curi@@ osity had trium@@ ph@@ ed over suspicion , and delight had ban@@ ished anxiety .
like all our cities , it 's dedicated to to@@ il , trade and traffic .
nobody was being asked to take responsibility .
it was our first show .
for generations , it 's been a place of conflict , the largely Catholic republic in the south and the largely Prote@@ stant loy@@ alist community -- hundreds of years of conflict , British troops on the streets for over 30 years .
( music ) Than@@ k you .
it was both dis@@ hear@@ tening and di@@ stressing .
and so we mapped out this process , what we call dialogue journalism , for going to the heart of social and political divides , and then , once there , building journalism @@@ -@@ @ supported conversations between people on opposite sides of pol@@ ar@@ izing issues .
and they said this : " that we 're crazy , liberal Califor@@ n@@ ians . "
they say things like , " How can you believe X ? "

this is a sal@@ ve that our democracy so@@ rely needs .
thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) People love to invite me out all the time .

I 've also never said " me@@ zh@@ ure , " I 've never once said it that way .
so , when I say , " Oh , Aaron is ... "
when you watch him f@@ ade from the healthy person he was the night you met to nothing , that stays with you .

there is a book out in the book@@ store -- it 's called " Sym@@ phony In Steel , " and it 's about the stuff that 's hidden under the skin of the Dis@@ ney Center .
and this imagery has really come to define TB@@ I in the public consciousness .
the other is a letter to the in@@ mate with specific suggestions for how to manage themselves .
now , most importantly , is that I pause here to be really clear about one point .
closer to home , we have thousands of stories like this , and smart stories , stories that have a great outcome .
I just have to work a lot harder at it . " ( laugh@@ s ) And here 's Thomas .
he proved that with Navy veteran Mike .
and this with those supports , Mike 's back to work for the first time since his injury while he was in the service .
your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself , and much more quickly than people had once realized , if you simply stop doing what 's causing the problem .
what we found was , instead of getting worse and worse , in many cases , it could get better and better , and much more quickly than people had once realized .
there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and num@@ bing and by@@ passing pain , but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem .
and yet , look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold .
and fat has nine cal@@ ories per gram , whereas protein and car@@ bs only have four .
it 's a half @@@ -@@ @ truth .
so the percentage is lower , but the actual amount is higher , so the goal is to reduce both .
so the goal is not to go to pork rin@@ ds , bac@@ on and sa@@ us@@ ages -- these are not health foods -- but to go from " bad car@@ bs " to " good car@@ bs . "
and you get all the disease @@@ -@@ @ protective substances .
they come in one @@@ -@@ @ gram cap@@ sul@@ es ; more than that just gives you extra fat you don 't need .
( la@@ ughter ) Now what happens to your heart when you go on an At@@ kins diet ?
one group met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group .
now , one of the things we were very interested in was the surface area of the cere@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x , or the thin , wr@@ ink@@ ly layer on the outer surface of the brain that does most of the cognitive heavy lifting .
now , here , every point you see in color is a point where higher family income was associated with a larger cor@@ tical surface area in that spot .
now , at birth , we find absolutely no differences in how their bra@@ ins work .
and it can be labor @@@ -@@ @ intensive , it 's sometimes costly .
so one tant@@ alizing possibility is that we should be teaching parents not just to talk a lot , but to actually have more conversations with their children .
but again , just like school @@@ -@@ @ based initiatives , this is hard work .
after this heart attack , D@@ onn@@ a was never quite the same .
D@@ onn@@ a was my mother .
what makes this disease so deadly ?
since the heart can 't grow back new muscle , it he@@ als by scar formation .
this leaves the patient with a deficit in the amount of heart muscle that they have .
if you look at them under the micro@@ scope , there 's not much going on .
our bone mar@@ row , for example , c@@ ranks out billions of blood cells every day .
pl@@ uri@@ potent stem cells are so named because they can turn into any of the 240 @@@ -@@ @ some cell types that make up the human body .
and our first experiments worked , sort of .
OK , so now we were finally ready to begin animal experiments .
so if we could do eight points in the clinic , I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact on human health .
little do they know it , but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death .
the sun@@ dew 's tiny leaves are equipped with a visc@@ ous sec@@ re@@ tion called m@@ uc@@ il@@ age .
trapped half in and half out , she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside the plant gets di@@ ge@@ sted .
but in that case , if the mat@@ uring brain is to blame , then why are te@@ ens more vulnerable than children , even though their bra@@ ins are more developed than those of children ?
in short , I wanted to conduct a research study to answer one big question : why do te@@ ens keep making ou@@ trage@@ ous choices that are harmful to their health and well @@@ -@@ @ being ?
but , you see , I attended a high school in South Dakota with limited opportunity for scientific exploration .
simply put , I did@@ n 't exactly have the ingredients to make a ch@@ ef @@@ -@@ @ worthy dish .
and the results showed that habit@@ uation to risk @@@ -@@ @ taking could actually change a teen 's brain by altering their emotional levels , causing greater risk @@@ -@@ @ taking .
however , the more they were exposed to the risks through the simul@@ ator , the less fear@@ ful , guilty and stressed they became .
they lacked self @@@ -@@ @ control for logical decision @@@ -@@ @ making , took greater risks and made more harmful choices .
the process of habit@@ uation also plays a key role in risk @@@ -@@ @ taking and risk escalation .
I really had won first place in the category " Be@@ ha@@ vi@@ oral and Social Sciences . "
can positive risk @@@ -@@ @ taking escalate with repeated exposures ?
then someone pulled and gra@@ bbed me , trying to remove my hij@@ ab from off of my head .
I turned around to a tall , broad @@@ -@@ @ shoul@@ dered man , pure hate in his eyes .
hate crimes against Muslims in the US increased by 1,600 percent post @@@ -@@ @ 9 / 11 , and one in every four women in the US will suffer some form of gender violence .
and it may not seem like it , but Islam@@ ophobia and anti @@@ -@@ @ Muslim violence is a form of gender violence , given the visibility of Muslim women in our hij@@ ab@@ s .
and I began to think about what I could potentially offer to build safety and power for women .
so lesson number one : start with what you know .
but very early on I learned that , as este@@ emed phil@@ os@@ op@@ her K@@ end@@ ric@@ k Lam@@ ar once said , it 's really important to be humble and to sit down .
so , basically , at 15 years old , the only community that I had any business doing work with were the 14 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girls in my neighborhood , and that 's because I was friends with them .
even though I was a self @@@ -@@ @ defense instructor , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't come into a community and define safety for any other woman who was not part of my own community .
it 's actually really emotional work .
I mean , we would do a 60 @@@ -@@ @ minute self @@@ -@@ @ defense class , and then we 'd have 30 minutes reserved for just talking and healing .
all right , for lesson number three -- and this was the hardest thing for me -- the most important thing about this work is to start with the joy .
I was really afraid .
and we mean those words .
however , when I took a step to reflect on what brought me to this work to begin with , I began to realize it was actually the love that I had for women in my community .
and for that to happen , we need all hands on deck .
so I 've given you my secret recipe , and now it 's up to you .
to start with what you know , to start with who you know and to start with joy . but just start .
Bry@@ n Fre@@ ed@@ man : so you keep talking about leadership as a real crisis of conformity .
we have Yellow Jac@@ kets not just in the streets of France , but all over the world , and yet we continue to see examples of businesses and other leaders fu@@ eling that anger .
and to us , that has to be to solve these imminent crises : the climate crisis , the crisis of inequality and the crisis of trust .
and just to give one example , Em@@ manuel Fab@@ er , who 's one of the newest members of The B Team , he 's the CEO of Dan@@ one , the world 's largest y@@ og@@ urt @@@ -@@ @ maker and major food company -- a real global company .
so I really think that when we think about leadership today , it can 't be defined to those in positions of power though they have disproportionately greater responsibility .
B@@ F : but we have such hierarchical leadership .
B@@ F : and you 've actually called that the hu@@ bris syndrome .
B@@ F : do you see that kind of leadership coming from the bottom @@@ -@@ @ up or the top @@@ -@@ @ down , or do you think a crisis is going to force us into a re@@ examination of all of this ?
but I do see that we can 't choose one or the other .
the only thing that 's missing is will .
how do you change minds when you have no influence ?
H@@ T : well , thank you very much for that fantastic question .
so don 't ever think you don 't have power if you don 't sit in a position of power .
and Marc , for example , was convinced to close the gender pay gap by two women who worked inside of his organization , who told him , " We have a gender pay gap . "
they did , and he was smart enough to know he needed to do something about it , and was one the first tech leaders to step up and do so voluntarily .
when Galileo turned his new teles@@ cope to the heavens and to the Moon in particular , he discovered something incredible .
and that 's to say nothing of his idea of a go@@ ose machine that could go to the Moon .
that idea in itself would have been a powerful incentive for people thinking about how to build machines that could go there .
and these gave people the tools to think about how they could build a cap@@ su@@ le that could resist the vacuum of space .
but I also think that these stories remind us of the cultural processes driving spac@@ ef@@ light and even technological innovation more broadly .
and the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age -- and I think that 's -- in other words , the next generation . I think that 's a goal that we probably all share .
with that preamble , let 's show the first two @@@ -@@ @ minute vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ e , which shows a little air@@ plane for surveillance and moving to a giant air@@ plane .
they are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere -- an atmosphere nature sti@@ rs up by solar energy .
in 1981 , it flew 163 miles from Paris to England , solely on the power of sun@@ beams , and established a basis for the P@@ ath@@ fin@@ der .
( music ) R@@ ay M@@ organ 's voice will come in here .
MK : can you bring up the house lights ?
( appl@@ ause ) PM : the video worked right for the first few and I don 't know why it -- there it goes .
we get to do the classic .
if this hits you , it will not hurt you .
OK .
( appl@@ ause ) PM : if you can pass it down when you 're done . ye@@ ah , I think -- I lost a little orientation ; I looked up into this light .
it never makes a mistake . because if you make a mistake , you don 't leave any pro@@ geny .
in concluding , I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective .
the first I 'll just read . at last , I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted .
sort of a timeline , very non @@@ -@@ @ linear scale , nature rates and tril@@ ob@@ ites and din@@ osa@@ urs , and eventually we saw some humans with ca@@ ves ... Bir@@ ds were flying overhead , after p@@ ter@@ osa@@ urs .
this is a warning , and we have to think seriously about it .
( appl@@ ause ) And you wonder , is it practical ? and it turns out if I had not been -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Un@@ fortunately , we have some light bulb changes .
here , HU@@ B@@ O is trying to get out of a car , and keep in mind , the video is sp@@ ed up three times .
( la@@ ughter ) HU@@ B@@ O , from team KA@@ IS@@ T out of Korea , is a state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art robot with impressive capabilities , but this body do@@ es@@ n 't look all that different from robots we 've seen a few decades ago .
I 'm also Austrian , and I know that I sound a bit like Ar@@ ni@@ e , the Termin@@ ator .
actu@@ ators are for robots what muscles are for animals : key components of the body that enable movement and interaction with the world .
not surprisingly , people have tried for many decades to replicate the aston@@ ishing capabilities of muscle , but it 's been really hard .
about 10 years ago , when I did my PhD back in Austria , my colleagues and I re@@ discovered what is likely one of the very first publications on artificial muscle , published in 18@@ 80 .
they can also be scaled up to deliver large forces .
when subm@@ er@@ ged in oil , Has@@ el artificial muscles can be made invisible .
and with a large weight , you get a large contraction .
to create something that looks more like a muscle fiber , you can connect a few pou@@ ches together and attached a weight on one side .
( la@@ ughter ) Overall , H@@ AS@@ EL@@ s show promise to become the first technology that matches or exceeds the performance of biological muscle while being compatible with large @@@ -@@ @ scale manufacturing .
but when I think about my grand@@ parents and the way they become more dependent on others to perform simple everyday tasks such as using the rest@@ room alone , they often feel like they 're becoming a burden .
well , it 's great to be here .
it 's kind of taken on a life of its own .
so we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems .
if you put different communication technologies on this log@@ arith@@ mic graph , television , radio , telephone were adopted in decades .
so the Cam@@ bri@@ an Explo@@ sion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . it was 200 times faster .
and we 've had a continual acceleration of this process .
we 'll have those ready well before Mo@@ ore 's Law runs out of steam .
you would think it would be a very er@@ ratic process , and you have a very smooth outcome of this cha@@ otic process .
the Internet has been doubling in power and continues to , measured many different ways .
the most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions .
and this is less fu@@ tur@@ istic than it may sound .
these things have already been done in animals .
so let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
but they 'll also go inside our brain , interact with our biological ne@@ ur@@ ons .
my main message is that progress in technology is expon@@ ential , not linear .
the vertical axis is the number of deaths times the remaining life span , so higher is much worse impact .
I 'm not a neuro@@ log@@ ist .
this is a signal of skin conduc@@ tance that 's known to go up when you get nervous , but it turns out it also goes up with a lot of other interesting conditions .
we also saw things that were exactly what we expected .
how can you be stressed on one side of your body and not the other ?
and he said , " I don 't know , I 'll check the diary . "
so I waited and he came back .
" hi , Dr. Mad@@ sen , my name 's Ros@@ al@@ ind Pic@@ ard .
we 've had people whose hair stands on end on one arm 20 minutes before a seizure . "
and I 'm like , " On one arm ? "
he explained how this could happen in the brain , and he got interested . I showed him the data .
( appl@@ ause ) Now , the next slide is what made my skin conduc@@ tance go up .
the Bluetooth could break , the battery could die .
you 're lifting weights .
this launches the company onto the official public market , where any company or individual who believes the business could be profitable might buy a stock .
their investment helps the company to grow , and as it becomes more successful , more buyers may see potential and start buying stocks .
and as more people educate themselves about this complex system they too can trade stocks , support the businesses they believe in , and pursue their financial goals .
the first step is getting invested .

I told each k@@ id that they were in a group , like the green group , and I even gave them a green T @@@ -@@ @ shirt to wear .
and in fact , we 're sometimes most likely to turn away from things precisely because of the threat that they represent to us , in business , life and the world .
so after things cal@@ med down a little bit , Green@@ span and many others came out with a post@@ mor@@ tem and said , " No@@ body could have predicted that crisis . "
so how come the conversations are so different ?
( la@@ ughter ) My grand@@ parents did .
but then you have the grand@@ parents on the other side , who don 't put their final affairs in order , who don 't get rid of all the jun@@ k they 've been ho@@ arding for decades and decades and leave their kids to deal with it .
think of climate change , it can feel so big , that not a single one of us could make a difference .
no two of us are the same .

this is a really great thing , a really positive step .
she is , like , everything .
so our stories need to be told in a multitude of ways by a range of voices talking about diverse and nu@@ an@@ ced topics , and they really need to be listened to .
Columbia University psychology professor Ger@@ al@@ d@@ ine Dow@@ ney and Manhattan Assistant DA Luc@@ y Lan@@ g co @@@ -@@ @ taught the course , and it was the first of its kind .

stories that have trapped many of us within the vicious cycle of incarceration , that most haven 't been able to break free of .
they were sons and daughters , brothers and sisters .
instead , it was listening to the advice of elders -- men who have been sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison .
these men helped me re@@ frame my mind@@ set around man@@ hood .
he looked happy to see me .
this is possible if we do the work .
but that 's not real .
for instance , this is Her@@ bert with his grand@@ mother .
and I was last week walking on L@@ af@@ a@@ ye@@ t@@ te Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I did@@ n 't know , but she called to tell me that Jo@@ y@@ ce had passed away at the age of 23 .
and I was constantly reading the New York Times , and stun@@ ned by the statistics , the numbers .
it was just frigh@@ tening .
ca : that 's an amazing story , thank you .

and in fact , different areas of the world define these generations differently .
apparently , they 're stupid too .
so we prepare for hurricanes , right ?
yes .
now , sure , we see small differences in what people want .

all this time I 'd focused on the long @@@ -@@ @ term environmental risk when I should have been up in arms about the immediate health impact of pollutants in the air .
we simply lack the data to understand our exposure .
and that 's because the way we monitor air quality today is designed not to help people breathe but to help governments govern .
most major cities operate networks of air @@@ -@@ @ quality monitoring stations like this one in London , to decide when to cut traffic or when to shut down factories .
and these machines are like the computers from the ' 6@@ 0s that filled entire rooms .
but for the rest of us , air quality looks like this .
and even more from indoor to outdoor .
so what would environmental protection look like if it was designed for the age of the smartphone ?
flow is a personal air @@@ -@@ @ quality trac@@ ker that you can wear with you on a back@@ pack , a bike , a stro@@ l@@ ler .
we must reach the same ti@@ pping point for air quality and I believe we will .
and now mayors around the world are thinking of banning diesel outright by 2025 , 2030 , 20@@ 35 .
thank you very much .
this means " mouse . "
the start of the story , where this means guy , and that is a pon@@ y@@ tail on a pass@@ er @@@ -@@ @ by .
these are when .
" I want to give you a hu@@ g . "
he tells her , " I 'd like to hand @@@ -@@ @ paint your portrait on a coffee mu@@ g . "
( la@@ ughter ) Pu@@ t a cra@@ b inside it .
he means he 's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land , but just pan@@ handle at the ocean .
so , the guy replies , " Y@@ ea@@ h , I know , I know .
I 'm a mon@@ key -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- blowing kis@@ ses at a bu@@ tter@@ fly .
the blood moving through your ar@@ teries .
that makes it nearly impossible to predict what will happen , even with a lot of information about the current state of a system .
for example , the motion of the atmosphere is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the earth 's rotation .
Ke@@ ith Sch@@ ach@@ t : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
Z@@ K : now , it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are .
if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet s@@ lam@@ s shut it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't make a loud noise , and in addition the magne@@ ts would draw the cabinets closed .
when you get to the very bottom of the slide -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- the ri@@ der passes through an aluminum tube .
( la@@ ughter ) So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
so , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . go ahead .
( la@@ ughter ) Z@@ K : wait , wait , Ste@@ ven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends .
S@@ J : excellent , thank you .
KS : thanks for coming up . let 's give him a big round of appl@@ ause .
( appl@@ ause ) So what 's the significance of this dry liquid ?
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
we have a video to show you .
KS : so you see there , it did@@ n 't b@@ ounce back . now , this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing .
it 's technically called , " shape @@@ -@@ @ retaining property . "
now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil .
in a way , I feel like that .
so , we 'll go with the first piece .
my real m@@ um and d@@ ad dump@@ ed me and f@@ uc@@ ked off back to Nigeria .
woman : you don 't need me .
Mar@@ cus : simple . what do you rap about ?
boy : my f@@ uc@@ kin ' reality .
boy : Pan@@ thers ?
did you ever move your f@@ uc@@ kin ' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real ?
without food -- I was sick .
I take you are preparing a major attack ?
ask my sister , she is the wit@@ ch , she knows everything .
CC : yes , correct .
thank you .
and I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex @@@ -@@ @ combatants , as they like to be called .
if this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet , it just interfe@@ res with a lot of what humanity thinks .
this is the way we should be going into the oceans .
I 'm trying to do everything very gently .
this is the first flying machine . this was the first prototype .
it took 10 years to build .
I just had to go and build another machine .
Ah , you have that one at home as well .
how does one look into it ?
no , once we 're done with that , we wait a few days , and then , we an@@ esthe@@ tize those sp@@ id@@ ers .
now , that little spi@@ der happens to produce amaz@@ ingly powerful an@@ tim@@ icro@@ b@@ ial compounds .
every time I repeat this experiment , I just wonder : how is that possible ?
you see , she 's not so insignificant anymore now , is she ?
" it gets easier , right ? "
it gets different , but there 's always something to worry about as parents .
but the science on these devices has not been able to keep up with the rapid market growth , so regulations on the components of these devices and e @@@ -@@ @ liquids are lagging .
cloud ch@@ asing , also called vap@@ e tric@@ ks or smoke tric@@ ks , involves producing large vap@@ e clouds with qu@@ ir@@ ky shapes and names , like rings , dra@@ g@@ ons , gh@@ o@@ sts ...
and since the devices use lower temperatures and do not comb@@ ust or burn the m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana , they can do this very discre@@ e@@ tly , without the distinctive smell of burnt m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana .
now , many te@@ ens think that these devices produce water vap@@ or , and therefore , they are safe to use .
te@@ ens who use tobacco products are more likely to use m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety as a teen or as an adult .
that means we want the blue egg pile to be the opposite parity of the other two pil@@ es at the start as well .
the trick lies in a phenomenon known as total internal reflection .
but these are short @@@ -@@ @ range signals : they get absorbed by moisture in the air , or blocked by tall buildings .
with tiny wireless @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ fiber pho@@ t@@ onic transmit@@ ter chips distributed throughout cities , ter@@ a@@ her@@ tz signals can be rela@@ yed over long @@@ -@@ @ range distances .
now the thing is , I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .
like , for example , making up these ridic@@ ulous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .
they 're what I 'm calling here the " ger@@ ont@@ ology approach " and the " ger@@ i@@ at@@ rics approach . "
so I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , is@@ n 't a step at all .
and the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
we do exactly nothing to them until they 're already two years old .
and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it 's extremely hard to answer .
so they 'll probably think it 's five years away .
so we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
and that 's good because it means that it 's not a losing battle , and it 's something that we are within range of being able to do , because it do@@ es@@ n 't involve improving on evolution .
if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging , we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another .
cell loss , mu@@ tations in chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , mu@@ tations in the mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ a and so on .
of course one can make a biological argument .
we 're made of cells and stuff between cells .
this is what 's going to take a bit of money .
AG : that 's right .
the standard numbers are that lifes@@ p@@ ans have been growing at between one and two years per decade .
audience : I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embry@@ o , and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
and it 's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road .
and the premise of " The Wis@@ dom of Cro@@ w@@ ds " is that , under the right conditions , groups can be remarkably intelligent .
it is , as Ste@@ ven Johnson has talked about , an emer@@ gent phenomenon .
on these sites , nam@@ eless , fac@@ eless sexual pre@@ dat@@ ors had published highly explicit sexual commentary about me and what they 'd like to do to me .
but things got worse .
perpetrators ejac@@ ulated on images of me , took photos of their sperm and pen@@ ises on these images and posted them onto por@@ n sites .
now , you might be won@@ dering , what sorts of images I posted on social media .
but I then contacted my state and federal MPs .
and it was a big thing in my little community of Point Re@@ yes Station in In@@ ver@@ ness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter - this was back in ' 71 now .
and I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening -- in a long time .
" Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
but something happened -- Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez .
how could that be , how could that be ?
I got on a sail@@ boat and I sa@@ iled down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
what possessed me to say this thing ?
and so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
he was a creativity researcher in the ' 6@@ 0s and ' 7@@ 0s , and also led the Stan@@ ford Design Program .
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neighbor , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
you all have a piece of card@@ board and a piece of paper .
I need you to turn that piece of paper over ; you should find that it 's blank on the other side .
and there should be a pen@@ cil .
and I want you to pick somebody that 's seated next to you , and when I say , go , you 've got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor , OK ?
OK ? stop . all right , now .
now , that was@@ n 't just self @@@ -@@ @ indul@@ gence .
and so , that decision to work with his friends -- now he has 550 of them -- was what got ID@@ EO started .
Don 't know the reason for the pink flam@@ ing@@ os , but anyway , they 're there in the garden .
so all of these places have these symbols .
now , our big symbol at ID@@ EO is actually not so much the place , it 's a thing .
but before we start , I need just to put these on .
( la@@ ughter ) There we go .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you , thank you , thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) All right , good .
helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
now , an adult en@@ countering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categor@@ ize it just as quickly as we can , you know .
and there 's a reason for that : we want to settle on an answer .
I suspect , actually , that the evolutionary bi@@ ologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categor@@ ize new things very , very quickly .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stri@@ py thing : is that a ti@@ ger just about to jump out and kill us ?
well , not necessarily .
of course they will . but they 'll also ask , " What can I do with it ? "
and you know , the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example .
any parents of young kids in the audience ? there must be some .
we 've all told stories about how , on Christmas morning , our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them .
so for example , you could turn one into a football , or another one into a sun . all I 'm interested in is quantity .
we self @@@ -@@ @ edit as we 're having ideas .
so now , Bob Mc@@ Kim did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s .
he gave each of them some m@@ escal@@ ine , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
and then he did what 's called the Pur@@ due Cre@@ ativity Test .
and they 'd come up with a bun@@ ch of interesting solutions -- and actually , quite valid solutions -- to the things that they 'd been working on .
e@@ dic@@ ts like , " Def@@ er judgment , " or " Go for quantity . "
now , of course , many designers , many individual designers , achieve this is in a much more organic way .
I think the E@@ am@@ eses are wonderful examples of experi@@ mentation .
and of course , they used experi@@ mentation in all aspects of their work , from films to buildings , from games to graphics .
so , they 're great examples , I think , of exploration and experi@@ mentation in design .
so the average Western first @@@ -@@ @ gra@@ der spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what 's called " construction play . "
now , that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lis@@ a and the Mac@@ int@@ os@@ h .
and the surge@@ ons gra@@ bbed hold of it and said , well , I want to hold it like this , or like that .
but what about designing something that is@@ n 't physical ?
and this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care .
this is one of our designers , K@@ ris@@ tian Sim@@ s@@ arian , and he 's putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient .
the kind of little face , the portrait you did ?
so I put it through a G.@@ C. , a Gas Ch@@ ro@@ mat@@ o@@ graph that I have in my office , and it 's about 400 .
and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations .
like , at no concentration , even pure , you know , if you smel@@ t pure ethanol , it do@@ es@@ n 't smell of ro@@ tten eggs .
if you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
so I went searching when I started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of pl@@ au@@ sibility to this whole crazy story .
if it did@@ n 't , the whole idea was to@@ ast , and I might as well move on to other things .
the bad news is they 're rocket fuels .
OK , great , we smell vibrations . how ? all right ?
in other words , no mirrors , no l@@ asers , no pris@@ ms , no non@@ sense , just a tiny device , and he built this device . and this device uses electr@@ on tun@@ n@@ eling .
and every single part of this mechanism is actually pl@@ au@@ sible in biology .
in other words , I 've taken off @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ shelf components , and I 've made a spec@@ tro@@ scope .
now , cou@@ mar@@ in is a very common thing , a material , in fra@@ gr@@ ance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America .
and we actually , in this case , I 'm sorry to say , it happened -- it was se@@ ren@@ di@@ pit@@ ous .
and this is our new baby , called ton@@ k@@ ene .
you 're right , and I don 't care how you do it , in a sense ; you bring me the molecules , you know .
when I got there , I was just a bit taken ab@@ ack , because the last time I went to E@@ bb@@ w V@@ ale , it looked like this .
this is a new 33 @@@ -@@ @ million @@@ -@@ @ pound college of further education that was mostly funded by the European Union .
and it came to a head when I met this young man in front of the sports center .
and he told me that he had voted to leave , because the European Union had done nothing for him .
he was fed up with it .
I met one Polish woman who told me she was practically the only foreigner in town .
and she was from E@@ bb@@ w V@@ ale , and she told me about all this stuff that she 'd seen on Facebook .
so I tried to find it .
but there was nothing there .
and this entire referendum took place in darkness , because it took place on Facebook .
in a once @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ generation vote that hing@@ ed upon just one percent of the electorate .
this is what they were posting on Facebook .
it took an entire year 's work to get Christop@@ her on the record .
not from Cambridge Analy@@ tica this time , but from Facebook .
to address you directly , the gods of Sil@@ icon Valley .
because to have any hope of stopping this from happening again , we have to know the truth .
it 's sub@@ version , and you are accessories to it .
( appl@@ ause ) Our parliament has been the first in the world to try to hold you to account , and it 's failed .
you are literally beyond the reach of British law -- not just British laws , this is nine parliaments , nine countries are represented here , who Mark Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg refused to come and give evidence to .
democracy is not guaranteed , and it is not inevitable , and we have to fight and we have to win and we CA@@ N@@ NOT let these tech companies have this un@@ checked power .
so , about three years ago I was in London , and somebody called How@@ ard Bur@@ ton came to me and said , I represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
we have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well .
we want to be in the forefront fields , and we want to do it differently .
it took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea .
( la@@ ughter ) But in any case , what I 'm going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about .
on the other hand , somehow we manage to reason together as a community , from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about .
and this is , by the way , something that a democratic society also has to do .
so how does it work ?
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
( la@@ ughter ) But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe .
the first science of cos@@ m@@ ology that was anything like science was A@@ rist@@ ot@@ el@@ ian science , and that was hierarchical .
now , in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of New@@ ton .
their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand , and a society on the other hand , were closely related .
of who else there is , of the history and so forth .
at the same time , we physi@@ ci@@ sts have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and rel@@ ativity .
I believe Twitter is best as an interest @@@ -@@ @ based network .
no matter what any one nation @@@ -@@ @ state does , they will not be able to solve the problem alone .
the second thing is that Twitter , right now , when you go to it , you don 't necessarily walk away feeling like you learned something .
so you can 't just optimize around one metric .
and we say , " Please do something . "
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I mean -- ( Appl@@ ause ) It 's democracy at stake .
one , when I came back to the company , we were in a pretty dire state in terms of our future , and not just from how people were using the platform , but from a corporate narrative as well .
on April 21 , in the New York Times , the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people had already been killed in the genocide .
Rwanda itself was not seen as news@@ worthy , and amaz@@ ingly , genocide itself was not seen as news@@ worthy .
what 's going on in the U.S. government ?
two to 300,000 people have just been ex@@ terminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda .
why no hearings , no den@@ unci@@ ations , no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House ? what 's the deal ?
evangel@@ icals have joined it . Jewish groups have joined it .
to call it a movement , as with all movements , perhaps , is a little misleading .
but it has been amaz@@ ingly successful in one regard , in that it has become , it has con@@ ge@@ aled into this endangered people 's movement that was missing in the 20th century .
now because it 's student @@@ -@@ @ driven , there 's some amazing things that the movement has done .
and that 's all the Bush administration 's leadership , and it 's all because of this bottom @@@ -@@ @ up pressure and the fact that the phones haven 't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis .
he was the victim of the first @@@ -@@ @ ever suicide bomb in Iraq .
he was in Mozambique for the War of Independence .
well , I 'd like to separate the sheep from the wol@@ ves .
let me go door @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation .
so then you have to make the decision .
he 's the vic@@ ero@@ y . he has to decide on tax policy , on currency , on border patrol , on policing . he has to make all these judgments .
and this was the pul@@ ley system . this was what we were able to mu@@ ster for Sergio .
but it was too late for Sergio .
I will never use it . I will try to make it such , but I will never use that word again .
fourth and final point : he somehow , because he was working in all the world 's worst places and all lesser ev@@ ils , had a hum@@ ility , of course , and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him .
you 're almost seeing a black hole punc@@ ture through space @@@ -@@ @ time , and when it goes so deeply in , then there 's a point at which light orb@@ its the black hole .
this is not an image , this is a computer simulation of what we always thought , like , the event horizon around the black hole .
the best we could do were simul@@ ations like this in super@@ computers , but even here you see this ring of light , which is the orbit of pho@@ tons .
ca : fifty @@@ -@@ @ five million .
and at its heart , there 's a six @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half @@@ -@@ @ bil@@ lion@@ - solar @@@ -@@ @ mass black hole .
six and a half billion su@@ ns compressed into a single point .
it 's emitting all the time .
ca : and that 's exactly what you did .
and sometimes , it 's better to be lucky than good .
but light had to come from the black hole .
ca : so you started capturing huge amounts of data .
all this data was shipped to one place and the massive computer effort began to try and analyze it .
that was it .
it turns out , that orbit is the square root of 27 times just a handful of fundamental con@@ stants .
ca : when ...
in my head , initially , when I thought of black holes , I 'm thinking that is the event horizon , there 's lots of matter and light whir@@ ling around in that shape .
well , talk us through this animation , because it 's light being len@@ sed around it .
and you see the definition of this ring begin to come into shape .
ca : ye@@ ah , that is amazing .
so tell us more about what we 're actually looking at here .
SD : so what 's happening is that the black hole is sp@@ inning .
ca : and so when we think of a black hole , you think of these huge rays j@@ et@@ ting out of it , which are pointed directly in our direction .
now , we 're too close to really see all the jet structure , but it 's the base of those j@@ ets that are illuminating the space @@@ -@@ @ time .
this black hole is so big that you 're not going to become a sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti no@@ od@@ le .
you 're just going to drift right through that event horizon .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : Oh , my God .
( appl@@ ause ) It 's the red circle , that 's terri@@ fying .
what 's inside is a sing@@ ul@@ arity .
ca : finally , I guess , a no@@ d to a remarkable group of people .
if you want to build a global teles@@ cope you need a global team .
but beneath the surface of this seemingly similar reality lie dark masters , for whom Earth 's inhabitants are mere play@@ things .
today , this shared universe is called the C@@ th@@ ul@@ hu My@@ th@@ os , named after L@@ ov@@ ecraft 's in@@ famous blend of dra@@ gon and oc@@ top@@ us .
unfortunately , L@@ ov@@ ecraft 's fear of the unknown found a less sav@@ ory expression in his personal views .
I came here to give you a science lesson about animal m@@ ating systems and why defining mon@@ og@@ amy has been a challenge for scientists .
all you 'll simply need to do is revisit the song " OP@@ P " by N@@ augh@@ ty by Nature .
( la@@ ughter ) It was released in 1991 .
now , " OP@@ P " is a call @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ response song .
now , in the song , the MC h@@ ints that it 's a five @@@ -@@ @ letter word , but to keep it rated PG , he simply refers to it as " property . "
now , around the time that this song was in heavy rotation , bi@@ ologists were in deep discussion about whether bird species , notably s@@ ong@@ birds and water@@ fo@@ wl were actually mon@@ og@@ am@@ ous or not .
now , before that technique , we were never ever certain about , 100 percent , who the parents of baby birds were .
we now call this " serial mon@@ og@@ amy . "
we call that " genetic mon@@ og@@ amy . "
" it 's OP@@ P , time for other people 's what you get it there 's no room for relationship , there 's just room to ... "
( la@@ ughter ) Now , we define extra @@@ -@@ @ pair cop@@ ulation as the m@@ ating outside of a pair bond .
now , I first learned about EP@@ Cs years later , after all the science news broke while I was in graduate school .
you down with E@@ PC ?
( la@@ ughter ) But when I would share this with people from communities like mine , or other colleagues -- so , diverse communities -- this hip @@@ -@@ @ hop science re@@ mix was a hit .
and with that l@@ exic@@ on , I was able to bring new science terms to them , and together , we were sharing a new comprehen@@ sion of science for the culture .
I lie awa@@ ke . I think thoughts . I walk aim@@ lessly sometimes .
because I feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clothes out there .
and often , I 'm driving in a taxi , and I see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I 'd never seen happen before .
and so I 'd make the car stop , and I 'd get out of the car and walk and see that , in fact , there was@@ n 't a hole , but it was a trick of my eye ; it was a shadow , you know .
I don 't know where inspiration comes from .
I read " Peter and the Wol@@ f " with this beautiful band from Ju@@ illi@@ ard , and I did , like , you know , the narr@@ ator , and I read it .
if I 'm commissioned to do the costum@@ es for an 18th @@@ -@@ @ century opera or something like that , I will do a lot of research , because it 's interesting , not because it 's what I 'm supposed to do .
I go back to color all the time .
how can I ever make anything as beautiful as G@@ ret@@ a Gar@@ bo ?
and so that 's what makes me lie awa@@ ke at night , I guess .
people say , " Do that " -- an astro@@ log@@ er tells me to do something , so I do it .
so actually , check this out .
the name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you , about my mother .
so you 'll have to go check it out and come see me or something , because it 's mor@@ ti@@ fying .
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing . you know ?
I just say that I do a lot of things , that 's all .
except , I guess that 's what staying up every night is about -- like , looking back and thinking , " What a fo@@ ol you made of yourself . "
I work with Tw@@ yl@@ a T@@ har@@ p a lot and I work with Mark Mor@@ ris a lot , who is one of my best friends .
and I designed three oper@@ as with him -- the most recent one , " King Arthur . "
again , I don 't know where inspiration comes from .
( la@@ ughter ) And then performing arts high school .
there I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
and somehow , from there , I got interested in design .
that 's just that .
and if you 're not , you have to pre@@ tend to be slightly bo@@ red with everything .
and I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
my God , this is the shortest I 've ever had !
( la@@ ughter ) IM : by the way , of all the most un@@ b@@ oring things in the world , right ?
it 's , like , this website with a lot of different things on it .
again , I don 't say it 's good , I just think it 's not b@@ oring , right ?
SM : here 's the deal : in the old days , when they used to make butter -- You know how you make butter ?
IM : ye@@ ah , exactly .
IM : ye@@ ah , it is . exactly .
the most common kind of change in DNA is the simple swap of one letter , or base , such as C , with a different letter , such as T , G or A.
in any day , the cells in your body will collectively accumulate billions of these single @@@ -@@ @ letter sw@@ aps , which are also called " point mu@@ tations . "
griev@@ ous genetic diseases caused by point mu@@ tations are especially frustr@@ ating , because we often know the exact single @@@ -@@ @ letter change that causes the disease and , in theory , could cure the disease .
and the war@@ head in CR@@ IS@@ PR is this purple protein that acts like molecular sc@@ iss@@ ors to cut DNA , breaking the double hel@@ ix into two pieces .
but we quickly encountered an incredible problem ; namely , there is no protein that 's known to convert A into G or T into C in DNA .
base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe .
two companies I co@@ founded , Be@@ am Ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tics and pa@@ ir@@ wise Plants , are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases and to improve agriculture .
all of these applications of base editing have taken place in less than the past three years : on the historical tim@@ esc@@ ale of science , the bl@@ ink of an eye .
I tried to come like him this morning , but as I walked out , then it was too cold , and I said , I 'd better put my shirt back on .
as you can see , one of our parties , you know , a few years ago .
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
but then also , just to celebrate that , we started an event at J@@ PL for " M@@ iss Gu@@ ided Missile . "
video : M@@ organ H@@ end@@ ry : be@@ ware of Safety is an instrumental rock band .
but somehow what strikes everybody 's imagination -- or lots of people 's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Ban@@ g we have this beautiful world that we live in today .
is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars ?
so it 's about the size , you know , of the United States .
so , that was taken from orbit ; we had the camera zoom on the surface , and we actually saw the R@@ over on the surface .
and now we designed them reasonably well , but that 's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data .
video : ok@@ ay , we have par@@ ach@@ ute aligned .
video : now , if there is life , the Dutch will find it .
what is he doing ?
so anyway , let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet .
E@@ B : looks kind of like an ice cream con@@ e , more or less .
LC : after the heat shield has been j@@ et@@ tis@@ oned and the legs are deployed , the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Pho@@ eni@@ x really is from the ground .
BC : we 've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity .
it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product .
first we start by we want to have our employees to be as imagin@@ ative as they can .
and then we back off , you know , from that point .
unfortunately this R@@ over is , like , ten times the size of the , you know , mass @@@ -@@ @ wise , of the other R@@ over , or three times the mass .
but there was something b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re about it .
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
and over the next few years , as we keep or@@ biting , you know , Satur@@ n , we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements .
now , methane gets people all excited , because it 's organic material , so immediately people start thinking , could life have evolved in that location , when you have a lot of organic material .
it looks like there are rivers on it , there are oceans or lakes , we know there are clouds . we think it 's ra@@ ining also on it .
so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth , but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material .
you just drive to the nearest lake , stick your hose in it , and you 've got your car filled up .
I also have some urgency I want to tell you about .
but I also ...
( la@@ ughter ) OK , al@@ right . but enough about me .
and the other thing that is really important for what I 'm going to tell you today is that plants and other pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thetic micro@@ bes have a great capacity for doing this -- twenty@@ fold or more than the amount of CO2 that we put up because of our human activities .
and where you see those few red do@@ ts , those are oxy@@ gens .
why is now a good time to do a biological solution to this problem ?
what began then is that we now know the function of many of the genes that are in a plant that tell a plant to grow .
and then the third thing is , we want the plants to have deeper roots .
OK , so I think this is the science behind the whole thing .
and now I want to tell you that , you know , we still have a lot of challenges , actually , when we get to this problem , because it takes ...
and they also retain water in the soil as well .
but we know now that , you know , no one can really deny -- the climate is changing , everyone knows that .
( appl@@ ause ) I finally got it out .
JC : yes , thank you for saying that .
but it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the tough@@ est problems we 're facing .
my own l@@ ack@@ lu@@ ster emotional response to giving was especially pu@@ zz@@ ling because my follow @@@ -@@ @ up studies revealed that even to@@ dd@@ lers exhibited joy from giving to others .
researcher : but , you know , I don 't see any more treats .
it looked like giving to charity made about the same difference for happiness as having twice as much income .
the Canadian government allows any five Canad@@ ians to privately sponsor a family of refugees .
you have to raise enough money to support the family for their first year in Canada , and then they literally get on a plane to your city .
one of the things that I think is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone .
and instead of a Group of Five , we ended up partnering with a community organization and forming a group of 25 .
it was a little overwhelming for everyone , especially the four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old .
for example , in one experiment , we gave participants an opportunity to don@@ ate a bit of money to either UNICEF or S@@ pread the Net .
we saw that the more money people gave to S@@ pread the Net , the hap@@ pier they reported feeling after@@ ward .
so this suggests that just giving money to a worthwhile charity is@@ n 't always enough .
you try without training wheels , I 'll buy you ice cream .
( audience ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Video ) ED : good job !
( appl@@ ause ) It 's pretty great .
my friend E@@ van told me that when he was a k@@ id and his parents drove through this neighborhood , he would duc@@ k down in the back seat .
each night , a local business sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal .
instead , it matters how we do it .
if any of you work for a charity , don 't reward your donors with pen@@ s or cal@@ end@@ ars .
thank you .
we need to inspire them , because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future .
I 'm particularly troubled that what NASA 's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot , I scre@@ wed up .
let 's take a snap@@ shot at aviation .
well , what did I do when I was a k@@ id ?
and then I went in and I had a lot of fun building air@@ planes that people could build in their gar@@ ages .
stayed in service till it was too ru@@ sty to fly , taken out of service .
keep that in mind . I put down innovation -- I 've looked for innovation cycles in space ; I found none .
and I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .
and then we flew Al@@ an She@@ pher@@ d weeks after Gag@@ ar@@ in , not months or decades , or whatever . so we had the capability .
but anyway , I think we need to beat them again .
going down there was like entering a time cap@@ su@@ le , and I came out with a different sense of myself in time .
our journey starts in space , where matter conden@@ ses into spheres over time ...
sol@@ idi@@ fying into surface , mol@@ ded by fire .
meteor@@ ites delivered chemistry , and perhaps membran@@ es , too .
tropical rain@@ forests arose , spar@@ king new layers of interdependence .
fun@@ gi multiplied . or@@ ch@@ ids emerged , gen@@ it@@ alia shaped to l@@ ure insects ...
I 'm from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
( la@@ ughter ) I am fine . after this presentation here at TED , I can simply go back to Switzerland , and you have to go on talking like this all the time .
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h . and I think he looks now less mis@@ erable .
we can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
if my room back home had looked like this , my mother would have grounded me for three days .
so I 'd like to -- I wanted to re@@ introduce some structure into that picture .
( la@@ ughter ) And this is my -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space .
it 's more economical and also more efficient .
I would like to do a short test with you .
this is a painting by the artist , Nik@@ i de Saint P@@ hal@@ le .
you see , that 's the wonderful thing about the ti@@ dy up art idea : it 's new . so there is no existing tradition in it .
( la@@ ughter ) I just pil@@ ed them up .
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h , that was a hard one . I cou@@ ld@@ n 't find a way to ti@@ dy that up properly , so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler .
this afforded viewers multiple and often impossible perspectives on the same object ; a technique considered shoc@@ king even in Pic@@ as@@ so 's domestic scenes .
some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a gh@@ o@@ stly woman reaching out her window .
does the scre@@ aming horse embody the threat of Fran@@ co 's military nationalism ; or does the spi@@ ke running through its body convey its victim@@ hood ?
and additional elements hidden throughout the frame offer even more secrets for close observers .
here 's a third thing you can know about me : I don 't think I 'm qualified to speak my own mind .
( la@@ ughter ) What would they know ?
and then the third thing -- ba@@ m ! -- Kay@@ ak . what ?
a smart crowd , by all accounts , so I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be surprised at all .
and it took me a long time to understand that what is at the heart of that contradiction is also at the heart of the contradiction as to why I can be so good at something I am so bad at .
our core project is a rather ambitious fol@@ ly -- I suppose , a my@@ thic undertaking : to build a 10,000 @@@ -@@ @ year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period .
so we got to thinking , if you can 't put things safely in a building , where can you safely put them ? we thought , OK , underground .
how about underground with a view ?
underground in a place that 's really solid .
it 's right on the eastern border of Nev@@ ada .
it 's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet .
this place is remote . it 's over 200 miles from any major city .
that 's a 2,000 @@@ -@@ @ foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
it would be a pilgri@@ mage to get to it ; it would be a serious hi@@ ke to get up to where the clock is .
in this case it might well be an image of the clock .
and then D@@ anny says a really great journey will have a secret pay@@ off .
there 's possibilities . the borders are important .
here 's D@@ anny H@@ ill@@ is in the midst of a bri@@ st@@ lec@@ one pine forest on Long Now land . I should say that the age of bri@@ st@@ lec@@ ones was discovered , led by a theory .
you may recognize a couple of the miners there .
wo@@ ke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow .
we want a temporary use permit for the clock , eventually -- 10,000 @@@ -@@ @ year temporary use permit .
so you can scratch Lin@@ col@@ n Canyon as an approach .
we gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this .
and if you go out to that line of trees at the far end , you 'll see what the valley used to look like .
you excav@@ ated from somewhere , came up from inside and deepened it .
we thought this was a good story .
( video ) Man : action .
it 's the block@@ bu@@ ster com@@ edy .
he influences you really good , you know .
for a young man to really make it out here , you got to think of some negative things and all that , or some kind of vices .
and I think they 're breathing .
it 's technology . I 'm very interested in it and I really think that the digital non @@@ -@@ @ linear editing has sl@@ ashed , you know , the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be .
and I think this is really the theme of this session .
nothing .
it 's not an added sequence , just some voices from N@@ ol@@ lywood .
we have diverse cultures , diverse cultures , there are so many , that in the natal life@@ times , I don 't see us exhaus@@ ting the stories we have .
thank you very much .
there is scientific data on this .
there is no life without stories .
so one of the things I look at is , how did the universe begin and shape ?
this is only 1,000 gal@@ ax@@ ies .
put the Earth at the center of the ne@@ sted spheres , just because that 's where we 're making observations .
you 'd like to have a little advance warning .
but if you look out to the nearest set of stars , to the nearest 40 or 50 stars , it 's about 10 years .
so if you take a picture of what 's going on , it 's 10 years ago .
but you can see the edge of the Sun , and the universe gets that way , and you can see that .
the universe is almost a perfect sphere , but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exagg@@ eration .
and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular gal@@ ax@@ ies and first stars to these more advanced gal@@ ax@@ ies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
so it 's a big design job , but we 'll see about how things are going on .
and then in 2000 , the MAP satellite was launched -- the W@@ MAP -- and it made somewhat better pictures .
and it 's mat@@ uring up to the present time .
they go out and point a teles@@ cope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the gal@@ ax@@ ies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up .
what happens is , you take pictures as the Earth rot@@ ates , you get a fan across the sky .
so the next picture shows you the three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional version of this rotating around .
do you see the fan @@@ -@@ @ like scans made across the sky ?
so we 're keeping , like , a million balls in the air but , what 's going on ?
so we 're going to go out and swing around and look back at this .
and you 'll see , first , the structure of the survey , and then you 'll start seeing the structure of the gal@@ ax@@ ies that we see out there .
how are you going to put gal@@ ax@@ ies out there in a pattern like that ?
and so now we 're in for some serious play .
and that is , you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules , but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated .
and then you put in some random@@ ness , some fluctuations and some random@@ ness , and realize a whole bun@@ ch of different representations .
so what I 'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales .
that is matter that do@@ es@@ n 't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does , the way the light 's sh@@ ining on me or on the stage .
so I 'll show you the next movie .
and so I for@@ got to tell you the scale .
that 's the distance between us and Andro@@ med@@ a , right ?
these little spec@@ ks that you 're seeing in here , they 're gal@@ ax@@ ies .
so here 's that same end result .
and it 's grown up in some kind of way .
so you start out with teen@@ y fluctuations when the universe was at this point , now four times smaller , and so forth .
and you start seeing these networks , this cosmic web of structure forming .
at the beginning it 's very uniform .
and at that point , the universe myster@@ iously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger @@@ -@@ @ scale structure .
but what we 're hoping when we get to Plan@@ ck , we 'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth .
geology has these effects , which is moving the plates around and so forth .
if you think about it , in history , a long , long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual ab@@ using another individual .
that 's a , kind of a one @@@ -@@ @ on @@@ -@@ @ one thing .
but now we have a new situation , really what people call an asym@@ metric situation , where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation @@@ -@@ @ state .
the bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asym@@ metric advantage .
and then I was there on September 11th , and I stood in the streets with everyone .
and it was quite an experience to be there .
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the sanitation trucks were par@@ ked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rub@@ ble away .
and I walked down the middle , up to the train station , and everything below 14th Street was closed .
it was quite a compelling experience , but not really , I suppose , a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books .
so we can 't fight the thing with a million @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one cost , one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ million cost @@@ -@@ @ benefit ratio .
things where , you know , a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome .
now , just imagine what that $ 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education .
I 'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers , but we don 't have very good software for them .
so given that we know and should believe -- because Mo@@ ore 's Law 's been , like , a constant , I mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 .
we 'll hear a lot more about that from Al G@@ ore very shortly .
we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
if we take carbon nano@@ tubes , you know , I@@ ij@@ ima discovered them in 1991 , they just have incredible properties .
they 're very , very sti@@ ff . they stretch very , very little .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that 's a property of carbon fiber also .
the inside of the nano@@ tubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nan@@ ometers -- that it 's basically a quantum world .
and so we begin to see , and we 've seen business plans already , where the kind of things Lis@@ a R@@ and@@ all 's talking about are in there .
I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about Wit@@ ten 's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nan@@ om@@ ater@@ ial .
new materials that can make water , new materials that can make fuel cells work better , new materials that cataly@@ ze chemical reactions , that cut pollution and so on .
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .
the third area that we 're working on , and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York .
but Tam@@ if@@ lu -- the virus is resistant . it is resistant to Tam@@ if@@ lu .
we need networks that can find out what 's going on .
we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly .
vaccines that we can manufacture quickly .
we can 't fight at a million @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one disadvantage .
our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes .
Vice President G@@ ore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
thank you .
from the ab@@ ac@@ us , to room @@@ -@@ @ sized machines , to des@@ k@@ tops , to computers in our pockets .
and are now designing artificial intelligence to automate tasks that would require human intelligence .
what I want to do is I want to we@@ ave computing , AI and internet as part of us .
as part of human cogn@@ ition , freeing us to interact with the world around us .
we have a new prototype that we 're showing here , for the first time at TED , and here 's how it works .
one of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks that we do as human beings .
people don 't want to be read , they want to write .
what I 'm going to do is , I 'm going to ask Eric a question .
everything lives on the device .
so , Eric , what 's the weather in Vancouver like , right now ?
what could the implications of something like this be ?
perhaps a greeting , like , " Hello , how are you ? "
( la@@ ughter ) We never could have predicted that .
my hope is to be able to help them express their thoughts and ideas .
I want to ask you a couple of questions , they 're going to clear the stage .
I feel like this is amazing , it 's innovative , it 's cre@@ ep@@ y , it 's terri@@ fying .
I think there are some uncomfortable feelings around this .
so right now it sits just right here ?
you don 't want technology on your face , you want it in the background , to augment you in the background .
he do@@ es@@ n 't look like a guy who 's paying off French judges for his fo@@ ie gr@@ as .
there 's no force feeding .
and he said to me , really from the first moment , my life 's work is to give the ge@@ ese what they want .
right up to us , like right up to here .
right along the fence line .
he electri@@ fies only the outside .
I mean , his farm is incredible .
the L@@ up@@ in bush , it 's all around Ex@@ tre@@ mad@@ ura .
radioactive yellow .
bright yellow .
" Sh@@ ush , watch this . "
( la@@ ughter ) No way .
he was right .
the history of fo@@ ie gr@@ as .
Jews invented fo@@ ie gr@@ as .
the Pharaoh got -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I s@@ wear to God .
mega @@@ -@@ @ farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long @@@ -@@ @ distance travel , food processing .
( la@@ ughter ) The shapes of these letters talk .
we see them on the front of the bus , on the bak@@ ery 's facade , on the keyboard we write on , on our cell phones -- everywhere .
since the beginning of history , people have felt the need to give language an image .
and rightly so , because language is the most important communication tool we have .
now , dealing with an un@@ familiar language was at times very frustr@@ ating and uncomfortable .
not only did I not understand the conversations , but the streets were full of signs and text that I cou@@ ld@@ n 't read .
[ no t@@ res@@ passing ! ] I could also tell when something was made to last forever .
after a few days in the city , I was on the loo@@ k@@ out for something tasty to take back home .
so I walked and walked and walked until I found the perfect bak@@ ery .
the sign said it all .
I can see the bread , with just the right ingredients , being k@@ ne@@ aded sof@@ tly and carefully , in the same way the craf@@ ts@@ man drew the ends of the letters with smooth and precise curves .
I see the master ba@@ ker placing the bun@@ s over a thin layer of flour so the bott@@ oms don 't burn .
the love for detail that the master ba@@ ker has is reflected in the attention that went into creating this sign .
it 's not the same to say , ( In a flat tone of voice ) " TE@@ D@@ x@@ R@@ í@@ o@@ del@@ a@@ Pl@@ ata 's audience is huge , " as it is to say ( In an animated voice ) , " TE@@ D@@ x@@ R@@ í@@ o@@ del@@ a@@ Pl@@ ata 's audience is huge ! "
that 's why I combine colors , tex@@ tures and of course , letters , which are the heart .
telling stories by drawing letters -- that 's my job .
it seems around the world , in developed countries , people are having fewer babies .
now , my friends who don 't want kids , all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies .
and yet , despite all this chaos , I still think we should have babies .
I believe we can and should fight for the earth and humanity , side by side .
( la@@ ughter ) Here 's a photo of me after having kids .
a broken , defeated hus@@ k of a man .
where there was once hope , now there is convenient space , and good mile@@ age , good mile@@ age .
according to the World Health Organization , we need to average about 2.1 children per woman today just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation .
it seems every generation is indeed connected .
but how the hec@@ k did we get here in the first place ?
in 1980 , China decided to implement the one @@@ -@@ @ child policy , largely limiting most parents to having just one k@@ id to combat over@@ population .
even after ending its one @@@ -@@ @ child policy in 2015 , China 's birth rates have largely declined .
in fact , the falling population in China is removing one of its biggest drivers of growth -- people .
and unlike other countries , it has not been able to replace its population numbers through immigrant workers .
there will be labor shortages and not enough money to fund the safety @@@ -@@ @ net programs .
he said families where the women have four or more kids will no longer pay income tax .
I have one , I do not need 10 .
we had to take my baby daughter N@@ us@@ ay@@ ba , who was named after a warri@@ or prin@@ cess , to the hospital , because she found a b@@ ump on the stomach .
( audience gas@@ ps ) It has been a challenging week .
it has been a challenging week .
but that 's not the reason you have babies .
and if we in developed countries , as a whole , opt out , and don 't invest in present and future generations , then what the hell 's the point ?
so it is disappointing that the way we use computers , the way we interact with them , h@@ as@@ n 't really changed in the last 50 years .
we still use a mouse and key@@ boards . we 're clicking on screens and buttons .
Mobile phones are the same .
we 're going to be stuck in the screens with our faces not seeing the world around us ?
he loves his motorcycle . right ?
and to realize this idea , I need to solve three big challenges .
anything can become interactive .
so plants are interesting , because with plants , they can know where you 're touching .
so every thing can be different , and every thing can represent what it feels .
so everything can be h@@ acked , and research is important , but the second challenge we have is how can we go from R and D , and proto@@ types , to real products ?
instead , we need to create technology which changes makers of things , people who make your chairs and clothes and everything else , into makers of smart things , enable them to do that .
in our case , we have to go to the mountains of Tokyo to a small factory which was making k@@ imon@@ o garments for generations .
we worked with my collaborators , who were not engineers .
they use hands and they cut .
they know how to use technology .
and of course , I can do more things .
I can now control my navigation , control my music , but most importantly , it stays a jacket , it stays a thing , which makes me look great .
how can we go from one product to many products ?
let me tell you how we 're going to do this .
I 'm not talking about creating another gad@@ get you get bo@@ red with and throw in the back of your draw@@ er and forget about .
I am talking about the found@@ ational , important principle which guides my work : " technology has to make existing things better . "
we have to avoid different interfaces for different people for different things .
so let me show , for the first time , the real device which we 've built .
that 's what it looks like , and it 's a small device which will be connected to things we want to make smart and connected and interactive .
how is it going to work ?
what I realized is that me and my team , we 're building a new kind of computer , an ambient computer .
science is cle@@ ver , but great creativity is something less know@@ able , more magical . and now we need that magic .
to temp@@ t us to act differently with del@@ ight@@ ful creative sc@@ ra@@ ps .
here is one such scrap from an initiative I 'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be green@@ er .
narr@@ ator : and so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
in fact , she had aged a lot .
and they lived together happ@@ ily ever after .
( appl@@ ause ) An@@ dy H@@ obs@@ ba@@ w@@ m : we 've got the science , we 've had the debate .
the moral imperative is on the table .
to make it connect . to make it make people want to act .
but as soon as the bow@@ l entered their home , it flew to Ba@@ i S@@ u Zh@@ en 's head and trapped her inside .
these chips will also include a cle@@ ver variation on the mod@@ ulator to help do away with moving parts and scan at rapid speeds .
the experience left him with a far more p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic view of social reform , and his focus shifted toward spiritual concerns .
and yet , I remain hopeful .
I believe we are at a moment of moral awak@@ ening , the kind that comes when old certain@@ ties collapse .
afterwards , we form up in circles to organize rallies , register voters , join new clubs , make new friends .
in the community of Athens , Tennessee , a fe@@ i@@ sty leader named Wh@@ it@@ ney Kim@@ ball Co@@ e leads h@@ ers in an art and fra@@ ming shop with a youth cho@@ ir and lots of little flags .
it is not .
I want to offer two reasons .
we are realizing now that a free @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ all is not the same as freedom for all .
binding ourselves this way actually liber@@ ates us .
we talk about identity politics today as if it were something new , but it 's not .
the " them " is those who don 't .
I know civic religion is not enough to remedy the radical inequities of our age .
we need power for that .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT un@@ pollu@@ te our politics if we clean only downstream .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Make sure those values are pro@@ social .
I mean , what 's not to love about an animal that 's born with a fixed gr@@ in on its face ?
well , I 'm here to tell you that we 've got this animal all wrong -- and how understanding the truth about the slo@@ th may help save us and this planet we both call home .
the che@@ e@@ tah is speedy , but at the expense of strength .
they don 't really have so many of the exten@@ sor muscles that are the weight @@@ -@@ @ bearing muscles ; instead , they rely on re@@ tractor muscles to pull themselves along .

I 've spent many happy hours mes@@ mer@@ ized by moving slo@@ ths .
( la@@ ughter ) But you 're probably won@@ dering : how does a dan@@ gling bag of dig@@ esting leaves avoid being eaten ?
it 's the har@@ py eag@@ le .
no , they survive by wearing an in@@ visibility clo@@ ak worthy of Harry Pot@@ ter .
it m@@ im@@ ics the sound of the kis@@ k@@ ade@@ e fl@@ y@@ cat@@ cher .
so the female remains co@@ vert , even when yo@@ del@@ ing for sex at the top of her lun@@ gs .
I 've seen them do it in the wild , and it 's over and done with in a matter of seconds .
( la@@ ughter ) Un@@ like other mammals , slo@@ ths don 't also waste time maintaining a constant warm body temperature .
and we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction .
I 'm a pretty speedy character .
I 'm sure you 've gu@@ essed .
but for them to have a world to live in , another god had to leap into the great bon@@ fire and become the fifth sun .

and this is why that 's not entirely a good thing : because over the age of 65 , your risk of getting Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's or Par@@ kin@@ son 's disease will increase expon@@ entially .
that would keep it from forming the t@@ angles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
there 's also a fascinating connection to cancer here , because people with neuro@@ logic diseases have a very low incidence of most can@@ cers .
and this is a connection that most people are@@ n 't pursuing right now , but which we 're fasc@@ inated by .
and there 's tremendous scope for additional private help here , because the government has dropped the ball on much of this , I 'm afraid .
and the A@@ vian Fl@@ u is also not a good idea .
you can see the range of the Coast Red@@ woods . it 's here , in red .
unfortunately , this tape is@@ n 't long enough -- it 's only a 25 @@@ -@@ @ foot tape .
and when Mar@@ wood made the jump , he was covered with was@@ ps stin@@ ging him in the face and eyes . he nearly let go .
he would have fallen to his death , being 75 feet above the ground .
all other pri@@ mates , when they 're sca@@ red , they run up a tree , where they feel safe .
when Ste@@ ve Sil@@ let@@ t gets up into a big Red@@ wood , he fires an arrow , which trails a fishing line , which gets over a branch in the tree , and then you asc@@ end up a rope which has been dra@@ gged into the tree by the line .
there is a small person right down there on the ground .
you 're wor@@ ming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don 't occur near the ground .
Maria 's sitting on one of them .
this butt@@ ress is less than half@@ way up the tree .
this three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional map of the crown structure of a Red@@ wood named I@@ lu@@ v@@ atar , made by Ste@@ ve Sil@@ let@@ t , Marie An@@ to@@ ine and their colleagues , gives you an idea .
and if we were able to reiterate , then the fingers of our hand would be people who looked like us , and they would have people on their hands and so on .
these are mill@@ ennial structures -- portions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
there are four humans in this shot -- one , two , three , four .
G@@ aya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old , no one really knows , but its top has broken off and it 's been ro@@ tting back now .
well , I think they can tell us something about human time .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
and while we were climbing Hy@@ peri@@ on , Marie An@@ to@@ ine spo@@ tted an unknown species of golden @@@ -@@ @ brown ant about half@@ way up the trunk .
and I was lon@@ ely .
and we all know people who are broken .
rich and successful people don 't have more of this than less successful people .
( appl@@ ause ) Because it talks about the peace that 's at the deep of our@@ self , our in@@ expl@@ icable care for one another .
I started something at the As@@ pen Institute called " We@@ ave : the Social Fab@@ ric . "
this is our logo here .
we find people like Asi@@ a@@ ha But@@ ler , who grew up in -- who lived in Chicago , in Eng@@ le@@ wood , in a tough neighborhood .
but one thing is , they have an intensity to them .
but it was really through teaching .
so with those as the principles -- some of you may know Se@@ ym@@ our Pap@@ ert .
now at the time , I think it 's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were -- let me say , ap@@ prehensive .
screw you . go to the back of the line and someone else will do it , and then when you figure out that this works , you can join as well .
and this is what we 're doing .
and we 're doing it without a sales @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ marketing team .
we have partners .
so that piece dis@@ appears .
it 's the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating , because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself .
and somebody -- to remain nam@@ eless -- called our laptop a " gad@@ get " recently .
and I said , " God , our laptop 's going to go like a bat out of hell .
and one of the reasons you can 't see it is because it 's back@@ lighting most of the time , most cell phones .
now , what we 're doing is , we 're doing one that will be both front@@ lit and back@@ lit .
and in about 30 days , we 'll know for sure whether this works .
this is more the direction that we 're going to go .
it 's really hard . and so it 's certainly the hard road .
so we 're targeting 50 dollars in 2010 .
are we dre@@ aming ? is this real ?
technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible .
one is that if you went into space you 'd be able to begin again .
so that 's kind of the idea -- we as humans cra@@ ve the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible .
we 're very sensitive to that as humans .
you know , you know when you see it . you know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can 't .
gener@@ ically , what we use the Web for is to organize , exchange , create and consume information .
you can do tests that show that you 'll remember that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better .
and I think that 's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know , that 3D , that lif@@ eli@@ ke environments are really important in some magical way to us .
you are always there with other people .
is a virtual world likely to be a u@@ top@@ ia , would be one way I 'd say it .
the answer is no , and I think the reason why is because the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bott@@ oms @@@ -@@ @ up .
those top @@@ -@@ @ down schemes are alien@@ ating to just about everybody , even if you mean well when you build them .
one of my favor@@ ites . I had this feature that I built into Second Life -- I was really passionate about it .
but more generally , you know , one other example I think about this , which is great relative to the u@@ top@@ ian idea .
so average age : 32 . I mentioned 65 percent of the users are not in the United States .
if I had to just sort of paint a broad picture , I 'd say , remember the people who were really getting into e@@ Bay in the first few years of e@@ Bay ?
they tend to be creative . they tend to be entrepreneurial .
that 's a frigh@@ tening change , frigh@@ tening disruption .
I guess , and you 're asking , what do I think about that ? how do I -- J@@ H : what 's your response to the people who would say , that 's horri@@ fying ?
so this change , I believe , is a huge disrup@@ tive change .
we must learn things and , you know , be more tolerant , and be s@@ mar@@ ter and learn faster and be more creative , perhaps , than we are typically in our real lives .
but I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this , other than me , have said , you know , fast@@ en your seat belts because the change is coming . there are going to be big changes .
you don 't have to be an astronom@@ er to know that you 're looking at the Moon phases or the Sun in ec@@ lip@@ se .
and that little group of seven stars , that 's the Ple@@ i@@ ades , the Seven Si@@ sters .
so let 's go through the m@@ ap@@ pers .
because they are literally just math incar@@ n@@ ate , in a physical form , that we barely understand .
what 's really interesting about black holes is that we can learn a lot about them by studying the material just as it passes through that point of no information return .
and at SD@@ SS , we 're going to the bel@@ lies of the beast and zo@@ oming way in , to look at these processes where they are occurring in order to understand how S@@ id Vic@@ ious grows up into W@@ ard C@@ lea@@ ver .
( la@@ ughter ) So I 'm going to show them to you , but they 're fierce and terri@@ fying , and I want you all to just take a breath .
and this is how they move on the sky .
so these are our objects and a star field , so you 've got stars , gal@@ ax@@ ies , black holes .
there is a new sky every night .
you just have to be curious .
and this brings me to the most important point about SD@@ SS .
you can see SD@@ SS kick in around Y@@ 2@@ K .
now , we 've made great progress with automobile technology over the last 100 years .
cars are dramatically cleaner , dramatically safer , more efficient and radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago .
but the fact remains : the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same .
it 's produced to get sul@@ fur out of gasoline -- which I find is somewhat ir@@ onic .
so we 're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen .
we talked about s@@ warm networks earlier .
I think this should be concerning , considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now .
and there 's a structure that sits on the left and the right side of your brain , called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus .
so that 's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you , but let me just come back to that control group for a second .
unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging , for example changes in the physical structure of the brain , that 's fi@@ en@@ dish@@ ly difficult to treat .
you insert a small amount of voltage into the brain , so small you typically don 't feel it , but it has a measurable impact .
and you see exactly the same profile for car crashes , road traffic accidents , even suicide rates .
and it 's not small -- it 's not 10 percent , it 's not 20 percent .
the other half were decreased .
the first is regul@@ arity .
David Bi@@ ello : no , no , no . stay there for a second .
MW : and I make that point because it means that Mother Nature , throughout the course of evolution , has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation .
this is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May .
he was in such agon@@ izing pain that even the smallest movement was un@@ be@@ arable .
there are actually two phenomena at play : the experience of pain , and a biological process called no@@ c@@ ic@@ eption .
typically , pain helps the body avoid further injury or damage .
we 're only beginning to un@@ cover the mechanisms behind the experience of pain , but there are some promising areas of research .
we had to first figure out what my face actually looked like .
this let us build a model of my face that , quite frankly , is just amazing .
it 's got an unfortunate level of detail , unfortunately .
( la@@ ughter ) You can see every por@@ e , every wr@@ ink@@ le .
this let us build a model of my face that looked like me .
and machine learning needs a ton of data .
but also , now that we 've built it , it 's clear that this is going to go way beyond film .

and new forms of communication are coming .
there were 55 of them .

and then see to it that our actions lead to our best intentions .

but what I can tell you for certain is that this brain is capable of some amazing things .
all of a sudden , it changes dramatically -- that 's sign@@ aling , not cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age .
and even though that 's interesting , what 's really odd is that the skin of this animal has many more ne@@ ur@@ ons , as illustrated here , especially in the yellow .
that brain has to outw@@ it other big , smart bra@@ ins that are trying to eat it , and that includes por@@ po@@ ises and seals and bar@@ rac@@ ud@@ as and shar@@ ks and even us humans .
they 're also fig@@ uring out where to go and how to get back home .
so it 's a decision @@@ -@@ @ making thing .

that is surprisingly common , by the way .
we get angry in situations that are unpleasant , that feel unfair , where our goals are blocked , that could have been avoided , and that leave us feeling power@@ less .
we can feel angry at the same time that we 're sca@@ red or sad , or feeling a host of other emotions .
that 's primary appraisal .

so I have a really cool day j@@ ob@@ -- I get to do some really amazing stuff .
particularly Mars , but also Europa , the small , ic@@ y moon around J@@ up@@ iter .
because in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1950s , when I was a tiny child , they had the aud@@ acity to launch a very primitive little satellite called S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik , which sent the Western world into a hy@@ ster@@ ical tail@@ spin .
and I 'm a product of that generation , like so many other of my peers .
and so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach .
but what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes , not just as our home .
and all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history .
so , back to Mars .
it 's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .
so the game 's a@@ foot , and this is the game that we play in astr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ biology .
so , perspective is everything and , because of the history that I 've just briefly talked to you about , I have learned to think about Earth as an extrater@@ re@@ strial planet .
so , this is part of the ability that we have , to try to stretch our imagination , in terms of what we may find in the future .
but one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call S@@ not@@ ti@@ tes , for obvious reasons .
and when they hol@@ low out , then they become habitats for organisms .
and these little guys -- you could lose many of them .
now , to wrap this up , I want to talk for two seconds about ca@@ ves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural out@@ growth of the work that we do in ca@@ ves .
thank you .
it extends from the sub@@ atomic scale to the far@@ thest reaches of the cos@@ mos .
they 're chore@@ ograph@@ ing themselves .
and only today is science starting to figure out how it works .
each is scat@@ tering away at random to try to save its scales or fea@@ thers .
a computer is , in a way , just another experiment .
there is one case that we have begun to understand better , and it 's the case of fi@@ ref@@ lies .
no one believed them .
well , you don 't have to be a whole creature .
now comes the very risky part of my talk , which is to demonstrate that in@@ anim@@ ate things can synchron@@ ize .
hold your breath for me .
I also want to wind this one up a bit . how can they communicate ?
inter@@ viewer : so just show me how you walk normally . right .
so you had to deliberately push your feet out side@@ ways and -- oh , and short steps ?
think of the bridge as being like this platform .
engineer : absolutely . inter@@ viewer : you thought , " Oh , b@@ other . "
am : it do@@ es@@ n 't have to be a real dang@@ le . just walk . it starts to go .
it 's really intri@@ gu@@ ing because none of these people is trying to drive it .
deep in our solar system , a new era of space exploration is unfolding .
tant@@ al@@ iz@@ ingly , the same could be true in other parts of our solar system , like these three ic@@ y mo@@ ons .
Europa , which is a moon of J@@ up@@ iter , is probably the most intri@@ gu@@ ing ocean world .
beneath a surface layer of ice thick@@ er than Mount E@@ ve@@ rest , there exists a liquid ocean as much as 100 kilometers deep .
for instan@@ ce@@ - En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us is a tiny ball of ice that 's small enough to ne@@ stle within the surface area of the Gulf of Mexico .
they hope to send a probe to test whether the ge@@ y@@ sers " plum@@ es of vap@@ or contain life @@@ -@@ @ enabling material from that hidden sea .
the nutri@@ tionist said I should eat root vegetables Said if I could get down 13 tur@@ ni@@ ps a day I would be grounded , rooted .
and I don 't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don 't go .
we have half a million laptops today in the hands of children .
in Colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .
and this is such an in@@ version , and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change .
and by being a zero @@@ -@@ @ dollar laptop , we can go to countries that can 't afford it at all .
NASA , for example , serves thermo@@ stabilized sweet @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ s@@ our pork on its shuttle menu for its astr@@ onau@@ ts .
the interesting question is : how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese ?
another dish , one of my favor@@ ites : beef with bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
I guarantee you , General T@@ so never saw a stal@@ k of bro@@ c@@ col@@ i in his life .
this is a bil@@ l@@ board that says : " welcome to the birth@@ place of General T@@ so . "
this guy is now five generations removed from the General ; this guy is about seven .
let 's go back to the mid @@@ -@@ @ 18@@ 00@@ s , when the Chinese first came to America .
who came up with the idea of cho@@ p Su@@ ey ?
there 's a lot of different myster@@ ies and leg@@ ends , but of the ones I 've found , the most interesting is this article from 1904 .
and as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically , the American man has become very rich .
so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights .
for example , there is French Chinese food , where they serve salt and pepper fro@@ g legs .
my neighbor , Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ra , was shocked when I told her , " D@@ ude , fri@@ ed gel@@ ato is not Chinese . "
( la@@ ughter ) And they have things like ris@@ ot@@ to cho@@ p Su@@ ey .
my personal favorite of all the restaurants I 've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil , called " K@@ ung Food . "
they looked at " The Young and The Re@@ st@@ less . " it was@@ n 't that , either .
but at some point , all these people had a very similar experience that conver@@ ged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant .
a good contrast is Ch@@ ick@@ en Mc@@ N@@ ug@@ gets .
Mc@@ Donald 's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken @@@ -@@ @ like product .
in contrast is General T@@ so 's Ch@@ ick@@ en , which actually started in New York City in the early 1970s , as I was also started in this universe in New York City in the early 1970s .
but that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a restaurant in New York City .
we can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux , sort of an open @@@ -@@ @ source thing , right ?
what had happened was , a Chinese family had moved from Philadelphia to Atlanta , and brought that with them .
now , you could say , sure , somebody 's birthday party is@@ n 't going to live up to a race dialogue , but that 's not what I was responding to .
and I want to share with you some of what I learned today about the new rules of gathering .
birthday party ? cake and cand@@ les .
( la@@ ughter ) As@@ suming the purpose is obvious , we ski@@ p too quickly to form .
an expec@@ tant mother I know was dre@@ ading her baby shower .
it 's dispu@@ table .
you may have learned , as I did , never to talk about sex , politics or religion at the dinner table .
the norm of pol@@ it@@ eness was blocking their progress .
what about a hypo@@ the@@ tical tense Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving dinner ?
rules are powerful , because they allow us to temporarily change and harmonize our behavior .
when I was a child , I navi@@ gated my two worlds by becoming a cha@@ m@@ ele@@ on .
and I realized that gatherings for me , at their best , allow us to be among others , to be seen for who we are , and to see .
the way we gather matters because how we gather is how we live .
I certainly was@@ n 't .
I was 35 and finally living the life I wanted .
and having a Z@@ ach suited me perfectly .
no one could tell me .
and then , out of the blue , some physician 's assistant called me at work to tell me that I had stage IV cancer , and that I was going to need to come to the hospital right away .
I said , " I have loved you forever , I have loved you forever .
( la@@ ughter ) I am a histor@@ ian and an expert in the idea that good things happen to good people .
if you 're good and faithful , God will give you health and wealth and bound@@ less happiness .
I held hands with people in wheel@@ chairs , praying to be cured .
I earned my reputation as destro@@ yer of family vac@@ ations for always insi@@ sting on being dropped off at the fan@@ ci@@ est meg@@ ach@@ urch in town .
it de@@ ifies and rit@@ u@@ alizes their hung@@ ers , their hard work and moral fiber .
( la@@ ughter ) I believed that hardships were only de@@ tours on what I was certain would be my long , long life .
anything I thought was good or special about me could not save me -- my hard work , my personality , my hum@@ or , my perspective .
I had to face the fact that my life is built with paper walls , and so is everyone else 's .
( la@@ ughter ) I got thousands of letters and emails .
it was one of the most sur@@ real things I have experienced .
it was a feeling of being more connected , somehow , with other people , experiencing the same situation .
and there will be no formula for how to get it back . "
but they offered me this little piece of reas@@ surance , and I cl@@ ung to it .
it was just a gift .
so I can 't respond to the thousands of emails I get with my own five @@@ -@@ @ step plan to divine health and magical floating feelings .
I can 't reconcile the contradiction , except that I am beginning to believe that these op@@ pos@@ ites do not cancel each other out .
my name is Saf@@ ia El@@ h@@ illo , and this po@@ em is called " to make use of water . "
but the Danish word for design is " form@@ gi@@ v@@ ning , " which literally means to give form to that which has not yet been given form .
so this is the first test run we did a few months ago .
you probably know the High Line -- it 's this amazing new park in New York .
( appl@@ ause ) It 's scheduled to break ground on the first East River portion at the end of this year .
but it has essentially been co@@ designed with the citizens of Lower Manhattan to take all of the necessary infrastructure for resilience and give it positive social and environmental side effects .
we have to grow all of our food locally , it has to be fish@@ - and plant @@@ -@@ @ based , because you won 't have the space or the resources for a dairy diet .
we 're designing these kind of coastal additions , so that even if it 's modular and rational , each island can be unique with its own coastal landscape .
so think of this small island for 300 people .
our world is always changing , and right now , our climate is changing .
no matter how critical the crisis is , and it is , this is also our collective human super@@ power .
and I moved down to La J@@ ol@@ la and learned how to surf .
and I started living down there on the beach for a long time .
they usually talk about the 17th century .
one day , somebody suggested I read this book .
you know , it was -- like it happened in England , and Germany , and Italy sort of all at the same time .
they did@@ n 't have TV screens , and they did@@ n 't have any football games to watch .
now you call it a vacuum pump ; he called it a vacuum .
and there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society , they called it . you had to be dressed up pretty well .
the actual nature of reality was not at issue .
you 're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything .
you were not supposed to talk about anything that you cou@@ ld@@ n 't demonstrate .
it 's not clear ; actually spar@@ k@@ lers will , but they did@@ n 't know that .
I mean , reality is what you can see .
and the mathematics part and the experimental science part was pulling away from philosophy .
but in that 350 years , the place has just undergone a lot of changes .
and we did@@ n 't have -- like , my mother presided over the back yard from an up@@ stairs window , where she would be ironing or something like that .
and I said , that might do the same thing , whatever it is .
it burned kind of slow , but it made a nice smell , compared to other rocket fuels I had tried , that all had sul@@ fur in them .
( la@@ ughter ) So I started developing -- you know , George 's d@@ ad had a lot of help . I just had my brother .
but at any rate , we finally did have a device that would re@@ produc@@ eably put a fro@@ g out of sight and get him back alive .
but I was@@ n 't worried , by the way , about , you know , the explosion causing the destruction of the planet .
but if you go to authority , and you always don 't -- you don 't always get the right answer , see .
I mean , you can 't make up results , and then do another experiment based on that one .
OK . all scientists are@@ n 't like that .
you know -- and there is a lot -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since Isaac New@@ ton and all that stuff happened .
scientists , you know , made World War II as we know it quite possible .
and they we@@ ren 't the curious little boys that liked to put fro@@ gs up in the air .
but a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel .
and most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that .
so the temperature has been , sort of , in@@ ching up .
he was thinking of the earth as , kind of like , you know , like a completely insulated thing with no stuff in it , really , just energy coming down , energy leaving .
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
so if you just average that and the daytime temperature , it looks like it went up about .@@ 7 degrees in this century .
so -- and Ar@@ r@@ hen@@ ius ' theory -- and all the global war@@ mers think -- they would say , ye@@ ah , it should go up in the daytime , too , if it 's the greenhouse effect .
it 's a paper that came out in February , and most of you probably had@@ n 't heard about it .
" evidence for Large Dec@@ ad@@ al Vari@@ ability in the Tropical Me@@ an Radi@@ ative Energy Budget . "
so you still get heated , but you don 't dissip@@ ate any .
so the planet should get war@@ mer .
these papers should have been called , " The End to the Global W@@ arming Fi@@ as@@ co , " you know .
there is@@ n 't a problem with global warming any longer , so we can -- you know , they 're funding .
so the planet is a pretty amazing thing , you know , it 's big and horri@@ ble -- and big and wonderful , and it does all kinds of things we don 't know anything about .
so I mean , the reason I put those things all together , OK , here 's the way you 're supposed to do science -- some science is done for other reasons , and just curi@@ osity .
remember the 10 things that are going to get you . the -- one of them -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) And the aster@@ oids is the one I really agree with there .
it may seem like we 're all standing on solid earth right now , but we 're not .
the rocks and the dirt under@@ ne@@ ath us are c@@ ris@@ sc@@ ro@@ s@@ sed by tiny little frac@@ tures and empty spaces .
the deepest that we found micro@@ bes so far into the earth is five kilometers down .
collectively , these weigh about two billion tons .
so the possibilities for what life is like down there , or what it might do for humans , are lim@@ it@@ less .
relative to a fic@@ us plant or the measles or my k@@ id 's gu@@ ine@@ a pigs , these micro@@ bes probably are@@ n 't doing much of anything at all .
we know that they have to be slow , because there 's so many of them .
if you only lived for a day .
but in the sub@@ surface , the problem is finding enough energy .
and they can do this with a ton of different elements .
they can do this with sulphur , iron , man@@ ganese , nitrogen , carbon , some of them can use pure electr@@ ons , straight up .
so in this way , sub@@ duction zones are like portals into the deep earth , where materials are exchanged between the surface and the sub@@ surface world .
( la@@ ughter ) And it may sound like he was being overly dramatic , but 54 days after I was standing next to that lake , this happened .
audience : Oh !
f@@ rea@@ king terri@@ fying , right ?
but the fact that it erupted illustrates perfectly that if you want to look for where carbon dioxide gas is coming out of this oce@@ anic plate , then you should look no further than the volcan@@ oes themselves .
but in our case , this really paid off this one time .
everything is interconnected .
if people think they can 't do their work , there 's no chance of getting the local buy @@@ -@@ @ in you need for the area to be successful .
for example , if you re@@ finance your house to take advantage of a better interest rate , maybe you use the savings to insul@@ ate your at@@ tic .
step one : negotiate the deal .
T@@ NC establishes an independently run conservation trust fund .
it already has .
that 's 10 Ger@@ man@@ ies .
this was how computing began .
Don 't forget : a computer came out ; it had no software .
so , the first time I did that , I went , like , wh@@ oa ! like this .
this is the first sort of play thing I did , my own serious play .
it lasts forever . it 's a very strange medium .
and so in Japan , I began to experiment with people .
in the end , he drew a house . it was the most b@@ oring thing .
this is something I did for Sony in 1996 .
and so I never developed the ability to have a staff .
he was the first digital media producer in Tokyo .
and I 'll never forget how , like , but -- I 'll never forget how , like , he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an ane@@ ur@@ y@@ sm .
how do you take that time you have left and go after it ?
so , if you can see here , you know , that program you 're seeing in the corner , if you spread it out , it 's all these things all at once .
is this what we want , you know ?
I made -- I took my old Mac@@ int@@ os@@ hes and made different objects out of them from Tokyo .
they 're paintings I made and put a Pal@@ m@@ Pilot in the middle as a kind of display that 's sort of thinking , I 'm abstract art . what am I ? I 'm abstract .
so I took 16 iPod Nan@@ os and made a kind of a N@@ ano fish , basically .
so , I 'm going to R@@ ISD , actually .
who 's a R@@ ISD al@@ um out there ?
so , R@@ ISD is -- I was outside R@@ ISD , and some student wrote this on some block , and I thought , W@@ ow , R@@ ISD wants to know what itself is .
presumed athlete .
if you are successful it is because of affirmative action .
so we have a Mes@@ o@@ zo@@ ic period , an age of fragmentation , and a Cen@@ o@@ zo@@ ic period , an age of re@@ connection -- South America to North America , India to Asia .
the work immediately be@@ gs the question , " Why did@@ n 't they go into the waters ? "
within five , 10 million years of the bol@@ ide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water . why did@@ n 't they do that ?
in fact , I think that most of it has to do with body size -- the size you are when you inherit a vacant Eco@@ Space from whatever natural disaster .
fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size .
now , my work began at the beginning .
a pre@@ dat@@ or . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
that 's where din@@ osa@@ urs began . that 's where the radiation began .
most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents , because it was those continents that are least explored .
but one with an immense chal@@ k@@ board in the middle , with lots of little areas of din@@ os@@ au@@ r rock if you could survive an expedition .
there 's no roads into the Sahara . it 's an enormous place .
some of them -- the most important -- are mental .
they 're usually students who 've never seen a desert .
these are the Tu@@ are@@ g nom@@ ads , and they 're living their lives much as they have for centuries .
to do that , you 've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert .
that 's a 2,000 mile journey .
it looks nothing like what we would find if we du@@ g in contemporary beds in North America .
all the stuff from Ju@@ ras@@ sic Park that you know of -- all those small animals -- they all come from northern continents .
we had to try and re@@ construct this .
narr@@ ator : ... as long as their boat .
man : watch out ! watch out ! no , no , no , no . you 're going to have to get on the back legs .
man 2 : you have the back legs ? no , you have the front legs , my friend .
somebody get the front legs .
now , we normally think of Tibet as a high@@ land .
they did it within two or three degrees of the pole , to maintain simil@@ arity between continents .
it car@@ ves up the history of life , and gives us the differences that we see in the din@@ os@@ au@@ r world towards the end , right before the bol@@ ide impact .
the best way to test this is to actually create a model .
who 's pointing fingers ?
it 's gone through science as an inquiry , which was a big advance , and De@@ we@@ y back at Chicago -- you learn by doing .
I 've just opened the card that you made me , and it is beautiful .
and it 's been a great moti@@ vator .
as that disappeared we came in with highways .
so , I 'm not going to quote myself on this .
I mean to be able to take off from your home , you 'd have to be extremely quiet .
I was a professor at the U.@@ C. Dav@@ is System , and I got a lot of excitement around this , and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
and that has -- you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you 're doing , and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ three percent said , " As soon as it 's proven safe . "
if you don 't remember it , it 's because there 's a lot of this going on .
here 's an example .
the number of people with actual do@@ om@@ s@@ day buttons has stayed fairly stable since then .
but it is so un@@ contag@@ ious that it 's killed fewer than 50 people since 2015 .
so these researchers edited H@@ 5@@ N1 's gen@@ ome and made it every bit as deadly , but also wil@@ dly contag@@ ious .
and they 're all moving in these head@@ long rates .
and the keys to the kingdom are these tiny , tiny data files .
let 's say it 's 20@@ 26 , to pick an arbitrary year , and a brilliant vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ist , hoping to advance science and better understand pan@@ dem@@ ics , designs a new bug .
and of course , this is not science fiction .
and if not ?
give it a couple of decades .
so , a quick aside : remember this slide here ?
that 's 2,500 9 / 11@@ S .
OK , plot tw@@ ist : I think we can actually survive this one if we start focusing on it now .
I have come to fear their work , in case I haven 't gotten that out there yet -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) but more than that , to rever@@ e its potential .
they 're optional .
it may not be like yours , because I live my life as an art@@ work .
( la@@ ughter ) I was raised by my grand@@ parents , and they were anti@@ ques dealers , so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things .
I find beautiful objects from all over the world , and I cur@@ ate them into 3 @@@ -@@ @ D tap@@ e@@ stries over a base layer that covers my whole body shape ...
the gold out@@ fit , for example -- it was the out@@ fit that I wore to the Houses of Parliament in London .
many people are fasc@@ inated and engaged .
some people are critical , others are abusive .
I 've lived as Daniel Lis@@ more , the art@@ work .
I 've been put on private j@@ ets and flown around the world .
but what hurt the most was being put on the " Worst D@@ ressed " list .
how many versions of you are there ?
we were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was .
I 'll play this until your eye@@ balls completely dissolve .
they said , OK , it 's not about systemic change .
I think my mother now thinks that I 'm some sort of interior decor@@ ator .
so , tiny , tiny , tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact .
Mal@@ col@@ m Mc@@ Le@@ an was moving from one country to another and was won@@ dering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship .
so , looking wide , using your peripheral vision , is a really interesting place to look for opportunity .
again , another medical example here .
so , the thing that we designed , much less sex@@ y but much more human and practical , was this .
so , it 's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination , but it has a thum@@ b @@@ -@@ @ sc@@ roll so you can do everything with one hand .
so , again , going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product .
we wrote a book recently , I think you might have received it , called " though@@ tless Acts ? "
it 's been all about these kind of though@@ tless things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity .
and we 're always saying to our clients : " you should look at this stuff .
it 's a completely em@@ path@@ ic solution -- apart from the fact that te@@ d@@ dy 's probably not loving it .
they 're now called k@@ ick@@ start .
so it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user .
and for us , it 's been great because it 's won loads of design awards .
we 've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kick start , no pu@@ n intended , their next project .
they saw this actually solving a problem : this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic .
so they have to also discriminate between these products .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible variation in the components .
and this is one of those examples of the sets .
and I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large @@@ -@@ @ scale construction .
we wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral around the foot@@ prints of the World Trade Center site .
that 's a bit lofty ; I 'm really more of something like a street wal@@ ker .
wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York .
he 's a Spanish architect and designer .
and going a little closer , you get a different perspective .
just a wonderful kind of break@@ up of architecture , and the way that the trees form vertical elements .
but I 'm convinced that it 's because you 're walking around the streets and seeing things .
and I use this -- this is , sort of , what I consider to be urban spam .
and it reminded me that -- to keep in the present , to look out for these kinds of things .
but it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind .
and I came outside , and the val@@ ets for this car service had created , you know , quite a nice little coll@@ age of these car keys , and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo .
but they 're real examples in urbanization and the change that 's occurred in the last number of years , and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
and it 's a welcoming area , I think , inclusive of diversity , reflective of diversity , and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S.
think of St@@ one@@ hen@@ ge , the Py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds , Mach@@ u Pic@@ ch@@ u and Easter Island .
they 're just really smart about getting material to work for them .
the stat@@ ues , known as mo@@ ai , were transported standing , pi@@ voting from side to side .
how can we shift our idea of construction to accommodate that my@@ th@@ ical side ?
decades later , it turned out that the source of their blind@@ ness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection .
and it 's that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves .
what 's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world , is , I think , only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeav@@ or .
these are four very different ways of looking at the world .
I started making com@@ ics , but I also started trying to understand them , almost immediately .
com@@ ics presents a kind of temporal map .
sexuality is about love and gender and family , not about sex .
in one of my earliest episodes about gender , I used the idea of pronoun@@ s to underscore the definition and introduce gender @@@ -@@ @ neutral pronoun@@ s like " they " and " them . "
that 's what we 're up against .
I choose rain@@ bo@@ ws and un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns and gl@@ it@@ ter , and I sing that it 's OK to be gay with my childhood stu@@ ffed te@@ d@@ dy bear .
given the appropriate conditions , cry@@ st@@ als will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement of their at@@ oms .
they are somehow not there .
so I made it my job to get him to come to school .
and the people who stay behind are the people who don 't have the chance to leave .
and he felt like he had let her down .
if you don 't come back now , you 'll never come back . "
he said that there are people in jail who , like slaves , don 't want to think about their condition , because it 's too painful .
but Patrick would never know how much he seemed like Dou@@ glass to me .
as I watched Patrick write , I thought to myself , and I now ask all of you , how many of you have written a letter to somebody you feel you have let down ?
let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question .
the world of plenty that Patrick and his parents and his grand@@ parents have been shut out of .
you 're probably won@@ dering now what happened to Patrick .
did reading save his life ?
so what can reading do ?
reading gave him a language for what he had lost .
the link between reading and writing is so powerful .
when we begin to read , we begin to find the words .
there is no way you can know what his favorite line will be .
and then you start to wonder , " Well , what is my inner life made of ?
what do I have that 's worthwhile to share with another ? "
you 've got br@@ an , which is probably the health@@ i@@ est part of the bread for us , or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber , for the br@@ an is fiber .
and -- and you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once , but they won 't eat it again if they don 't like it , right ?
there 's no glu@@ ten in flour . there 's only the potential for glu@@ ten .
here 's another kind of pre@@ fig@@ uring of epo@@ xy because we 've got glu@@ ten@@ in and g@@ li@@ ad@@ in , neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread .
we , after it 's fer@@ mented and it 's developed , started to develop flavor and character , we divide it into smaller units .
that 's called " ro@@ unding . "
and , like all gra@@ s@@ ses , at a certain point it puts out seeds .
it 's just a e@@ up@@ hem@@ ism for killing , right ?
O.@@ K. ? radical , not subtle .
it 's starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is d@@ ough , what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive , comes out dead .
third transformation . first transformation , alive to dead .
so now we not only have a high @@@ -@@ @ fiber bread , but now fiber on top of fiber .
thank you .
nine years ago , I was even younger , I was 20 years old , and I was an inter@@ n in the White House .
my mother 's loud .
I spent a year dealing with feelings of survi@@ vor 's guilt .
maybe I would be smart to take advantage of all the opportunities given to me and make as much money as possible , so I 'm comfortable , and my immediate family is comfortable .
Stock@@ ton is my home town , a city of 3@@ 20,000 people .
and instead of a short answer , Jesus replied with a par@@ able .
after the priest walked by , maybe a politician walked by .
a 28 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old politician , for example .
he saw his neighbor , he saw his common humanity .
he did@@ n 't just see it , he did something about it , my grand@@ mother said .
this Jericho Road is narrow , it 's conducive for am@@ bus@@ h@@ ing .
and in fact , it was something that was structured to happen , it was supposed to happen .
so my old council district , where I grew up , is 10 minutes away from a more aff@@ luent district .
ten minutes away , 4.5 miles , 10 years life expectancy difference , and not because of the choices people are making .
and we 're doing this for a couple of reasons .
meaning by our very language , we understand that the things we 're seeing in our world are by design .
a road like in this country has been rooted in things like mis@@ og@@ y@@ ny .
and one guy in particular , Bob Sing@@ let@@ on , asked me a question I 'm going to leave with us today .
and I think , TED , that 's the question before us today .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commodi@@ tized .
long @@@ -@@ @ distance telephone service sold on price , price , price ; fast @@@ -@@ @ food restaurants with all their value pricing ; and even the Internet is commodi@@ tizing not just goods , but services as well .
in fact , you can look at how each of these economies developed , that each one has their own business imperative , matched with a consumer sen@@ sibility .
we 're the agrarian economy , and we 're supplying commodities .
because there is a basic parad@@ ox : no one can have an in@@ authentic experience , but no business can supply one .
and of course , if you are both true to yourself , and are what you say you are , then you 're real real !
proteins dig@@ est your food , contract your muscles , fire your ne@@ ur@@ ons and power your immune system .
we seek to attract energetic , talented and diverse scientists from around the world , at all career stages , to join us .
making the world a better place through protein design is my life 's work .
adults , on the whole , are solemn .
it can be achieved out of innocence , or arrog@@ ance , or out of sel@@ fish@@ ness , sometimes out of ca@@ rel@@ essness .
serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view .
and I was suddenly a post @@@ -@@ @ modern@@ ist , and I began a career as -- in my own business .
there was no format .
this is Sym@@ phony Space on 90@@ th Street and Broad@@ way , and the type is inter@@ wo@@ ven into the stainless steel and back@@ lit with fiber op@@ tics .
we made idi@@ otic presentations showing how the C@@ iti logo made sense , and how it was really derived from an umbrella , and we made anim@@ ations of these things , and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth .
every single city of the United States is on here .
I keep that for evidence .
we began doing these big sil@@ k@@ screen prints , and they started selling , too .
this , as many of you have probably gu@@ essed , is a recently emp@@ tied beer can in Portugal .
I mean , how nice is that ?
these are a couple of garage doors painted identical , situated next to each other .
( la@@ ughter ) S@@ ame color , same message , same words .
the only thing that 's different is the expression that the individual door @@@ -@@ @ owner here put into the piece -- and , again , which is the psycho @@@ -@@ @ kill@@ er here ?
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ et it do@@ es@@ n 't say that ; it do@@ es@@ n 't need to say that .
( la@@ ughter ) He did@@ n 't over@@ power it like they have a tendency to do .
and hopefully you don 't stop and buy those aw@@ ful pec@@ an things -- St@@ uc@@ key 's .
( la@@ ughter ) When I first contacted William Bur@@ rough@@ s about being part of it , he said no ; he said he did@@ n 't believe it was the end of print .
people are just going to take pictures now .
so , this was the contents page originally .
and I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by , and he goes , " It 's something to do with the sewage system . "
and then the tiny line of copy says , If you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website .
got no way of tracking it , so I could be totally wrong .
it was a worldwide bran@@ ding campaign .
you know : thank God it 's Monday -- I get to go back to that little cu@@ bic@@ le , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else 's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
and the point of this magazine was to read the articles , listen to the music , and try to interpret it .
and I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we 'd already seen a million times , which was basically the moment of impact .
but when I got into this magazine , there 's something kind of disturbing , and this continued .
there were a lot of orphans made this day , and here 's a dead body being brought out .
and this one I think is possibly the worst : two ladies , both facing the same way , both wearing je@@ ans .
this I saw on the plane , flying in , for hot new products .
I 'm just not sure this is improvement .
as we get more technically driven , the importance of people becomes more than it 's ever been before .
this lady 's advertising for her lost pit bull .
I have visions of people going down alle@@ y@@ ways y@@ elling out for Her@@ cles , and you get charged by this thing and you go , oh , please be Her@@ cles ; please be the friendly one .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'm sure she never found the dog , because I took the sign .
( la@@ ughter ) But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sac@@ ra@@ men@@ to a few years back .
why not put some of yourself into the work ?
how could they send me here ?
in January of 2009 , I was informed that I had handled a fraudulent transaction un@@ knowingly at the bank where I worked .
you 're walking around ; your car has 12 micro@@ processors .
how 's your gen@@ ome today ? have you thought about it lately ?
DNA is a very elegant molec@@ ule .
really all you have to know about it is that there 's four letters : a , T , C , G ; they represent the name of a chemical .
and you would , you know , when you think about it , four letters , or the representation of four things , makes us work .
so , let 's talk about what that means .
it 's not really all that much data .
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .
a lot of very hand@@ some and pretty people here , sk@@ in@@ ny , ch@@ ub@@ by , different races , cultures . we are all 9@@ 9.9 % genetically equal .
all of these things could concei@@ v@@ ably be done , and I will tell you I 'd pretty much bet that it will be done .
in fact -- I 'm sorry to inform you -- that inside of your dig@@ estive tract is about 10 pounds of micro@@ bes which you 're circulating through your body quite a bit .
if you take a closer look at a root system , you will find there are many , many , many diverse micro@@ b@@ ial colonies .
you don 't necessarily know with gran@@ ul@@ arity exactly what organisms are providing what fla@@ vors and what characteristics .
( la@@ ughter ) ... and they would say , " Are , you know , are you playing God ? "
nature will not allow you to -- we could engineer a gra@@ pe plant , but guess what .
we can 't make the gra@@ pe plant produce babies .
and all I can tell you is , stay healthy for 20 years .
now what do I mean when I say the West chose to go to sleep ?
now as you can see I 'm overn@@ our@@ ished .
my generation and the generation of A@@ sians after me , believe that we can take charge and we can improve our lives .
and this may explain , for example , the spi@@ ke of entrepreneurship you see all throughout Asia today .
and if you travel through Asia today , you will also see the results of the third revolution : the revolution of good governance .
so partly , as a result of this , it led eventually to the election of Donald Trump in 2016 , who exploited the anger of the working classes , who are predominantly white .
instead , what you see in southeast Asia is one of the most peaceful and prosperous corners of planet earth with the second @@@ -@@ @ most successful regional multilateral organization , ASEAN .
there 's only one place : the United Nations .
while the second Iraq war , fought by his son , President George W. Bush , failed ?
so what is the M@@ achi@@ a@@ vel@@ li@@ an point ?
so a great future lies ahead for humanity .
a quantum computer uses something called a qu@@ bit , which can switch between zero , one , and what 's called a super@@ position .
but even though we can 't observe the qu@@ bit in its super@@ position , we can manipulate it to perform particular operations while in this state .
that 's why quantum computers need such an elaborate set up .
a trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manip@@ ulates them with l@@ asers .
so : the qu@@ bits come from either ions or electrical circuits , acted on by either l@@ asers or micro@@ waves .
ions can be manip@@ ulated very precisely , and they last a long time , but as more ions are added to a trap , it becomes increasingly difficult to control each with precision .
super@@ conducting circuits , meanwhile , make operations much faster than trapped ions , and it 's easier to scale up the number of circuits in a computer than the number of ions .
moreover , I 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success .
most importantly , we have the motive : we have a world that needs fixing , and nobody 's going to do it for us .
the annual death rate , then , becomes 56 million .
but this is the equivalent of three Li@@ br@@ aries of Congress -- burnt down , forever lost -- each year .
now , why do I say that this is a big problem ?
now , the exact figures here , we should take with a big grain of salt , but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial .
or when you understood something you had never done before .
so , in 2000 we wrote " R@@ are Earth . " in 2003 , we then asked , let 's not think about where Ear@@ ths are in space , but how long has Earth been Earth ?
I had a girl who came up who said , " My d@@ ad says you 're the devil . "
now , I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that , even if SE@@ TI does hear something , can we figure out what they said ?
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second micro@@ b@@ ial age .
so , after that we probably have seven billion years .
and what they found was something unexpected .
and the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plan@@ k@@ ton .
this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Per@@ m@@ ian , 250 million years ago , a com@@ et hit us .
in 1990 , working on the K @@@ -@@ @ T extinction for 10 years , I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Kar@@ o@@ o desert .
they are culturally invisible . we do not make movies about these .
well , it 's not the la@@ va that kills anything , it 's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it .
he ble@@ eds out pigs .
how many of us flew here ?
P@@ W : blessing and curse .
and this gives me enormous hope .
I was@@ n 't sure I heard it right , so I found him in one of the inter @@@ -@@ @ sessions .
and by the human spirit , I don 't mean anything divine , I don 't mean anything super@@ natural -- certainly not coming from this skep@@ tic .
some of you have felt it in laboratories ; some of you have felt it at the work@@ bench .
we feel it at concerts .
and I think that it 's going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we 've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days .
now , that was before cas@@ set@@ te tapes , C.@@ D.@@ s , DV@@ Ds -- any of the cool stuff we 've got now .
I call this hy@@ person@@ ic sound .
I usually show this hy@@ person@@ ic sound and people will say , That 's really cool , but what 's it good for ?
so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people , and there can be a public beach just off to the side , and they don 't even know it 's turned on .
that 's my invention . I sold that for seven million dollars .
let me give you , in the last minute , one more quick demo of this guy , for those of you that haven 't heard it .
I 'd like to tell you today about an or@@ ca named Tah@@ le@@ qu@@ ah .
and during those seven days , a parade of ele@@ ph@@ ants came from five different families .
you 're out at sea , at the mercy of ocean currents .
and we 've realized that their sound causes stress to all of the animals that experience it .
so here , are we talking about a story of the loss of a sen@@ sory cue that 's essential to close the loop of the life cycle ?
I was part of the ruling military government , and I served in several roles .
millions of fellow citizens were either displaced or fleeing the violence and pill@@ age of war .
so I engaged in a series of diplomatic activities right across the subregion and convinced the re@@ clu@@ sive rebel leader to initiate peace talks for the very first time .
I also called a national consultative conference of civil society organizations and stakeholders to advise on the best way forward .
I organized the first multi@@ party democratic elections in nearly 30 years .
more than 20 years later , in April 2018 , with a few more wr@@ ink@@ les and grey hair , I was again head of state .
we had collected foreign aid for 58 years , but we are still poor .
human capital development was the key to national development in Sierra Leone .
immediately after becoming president , I appointed some of Sierra Leone 's brigh@@ test young people as leaders , with responsibility to realize our shared vision of transforming Sierra Leone .
let me give you a few examples .
I appointed a young attorney as Commissioner for the Anti @@@ -@@ @ Corruption Commission .
in less than a year , he had a hundred percent conviction rate and recovered over 1.5 million dollars of stolen money .
women and girls , who constitute 51 percent of our population , were not given equal opportunity to be educated .
but the only problem is we had no money to start the program .
I argued that for Sierra Leone to produce a highly skilled , innovative and productive workforce fit for the 21st century global economy , we needed to invest heavily in human capital development in Sierra Leone .
( appl@@ ause ) Twenty @@@ -@@ @ one percent of the national budget supports free , quality education .
I want our children to become young men and women who can continue nour@@ ishing the trees that will grow from the seeds that we are planting today .
the second trick that I use to assess adap@@ tability in founders is to look for signs of un@@ learning .
it 's still a mystery how engineers floo@@ ded the arena to create this aquatic effect .
these chambers could 've been filled with water prior to the event and then opened to subm@@ erge the stage under more than a million gall@@ ons of water , to create a depth of five feet .
but even with all that water , the Romans had to construct mini@@ ature boats with special flat bott@@ oms that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't sc@@ rape the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um floor .
these boats ranged from 7 to 15 meters long , and were built to look like vessels from famous encounters .
these warri@@ ors would duel across ships ; boarding them , fighting , dro@@ w@@ ning , and in@@ capac@@ itating their fo@@ es until only one faction was left standing .
fortunately , not every water@@ y display told such a g@@ ru@@ es@@ ome story .
animals walked on water , my@@ ths were re @@@ -@@ @ enacted by condemned prisoners , and at night , n@@ ude synchronized sw@@ imm@@ ers would perform by tor@@ ch@@ light .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's wild , because in Paris , they have this saying , " le B@@ ron@@ x , " which means something is in dis@@ array or a problem .
Robert Moses , instead of par@@ ting the Red Sea , he par@@ ted the B@@ ron@@ x with a six @@@ -@@ @ lane highway and red@@ lined my community .
both of my brothers have done jail time , so escap@@ ing the clu@@ t@@ ches of the prison industrial system did@@ n 't seem realistic to me .
right now , one of my brothers is facing 20 years .
we decided the world needed some B@@ ron@@ x ste@@ as@@ oning on it , so we mo@@ bbed up and formed G@@ he@@ tto Ga@@ stro .
last year in Tokyo , we did a Caribbean pat@@ ty , we do jer@@ k wag@@ y@@ u beef , shi@@ o kom@@ b@@ u .
make sure you don 't slip on the dri@@ p .
( appl@@ ause ) At G@@ he@@ tto Ga@@ stro , we don 't run from the word " ghet@@ to , " and we don 't run from the ghet@@ to .
we can only track things as small as say , a smartphone .
everything else is garbage .
we send the satellite in orbit , it stops working , it runs out of fuel , and we send something else up ...
now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit .
w@@ ow .
what could possibly go wrong with that ?
it 's because information about things on orbit is not commonly shared either .
AS@@ TR@@ IA@@ Gra@@ ph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe -- government , industry and academia -- and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today .
but what do the Russians think ?
who 's right ? who 's wrong ?
what should I believe ?
what could I trust ?
am : I 'm a senior in Geor@@ ge@@ town in the Foreign Service program .
so , why don 't you tell that story ?
am : ye@@ ah . well , I guess I 've always been involved in sports .
that 's all I 'd ever known .
in fact , I 'd never even met another ampu@@ tee until I was 17 .
so he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break , his free time , and I would come up to the track and train with him .
and I said , " No , come on . "
you can run with our women 's track team . "
and he just sat there like this .
you pick it up , you put the dam@@ n thing back on , and finish the go@@ d@@ dam@@ n race ! "
am : no , a year .
SS : a year . and why don 't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race ?
am : ok@@ ay , well , Atlanta .
and so , here I am -- never lost .
then I 'm looking : the next lane , lane two , is 12.@@ 8 .
and , you know , I 'm just thinking , " Oh , my god , my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania . "
so they call us out and , you know -- " Lad@@ ies , you have one minute . "
all this training -- I had transformed my life .
and that was this collective glory -- that there was , you know , 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta .
that 's the achievement , I think . that 's the real achievement .
( la@@ ughter ) No , these are my cosmetic legs , actually , and they 're absolutely beautiful .
you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . "
it has a shock absor@@ ber in it so it , like , " Sh@@ h@@ h@@ h , " makes this ne@@ at sound when you jump around on it . all right .
so when I stand in these legs , my ham@@ string and my gl@@ utes are contracted , as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet .
and I was a gu@@ ine@@ a pig , as I hope to continue to be in every new form of pros@@ thetic lim@@ bs that come out .
but actually these , like I said , are still the actual prototype .
am : so , these are the s@@ print legs , and I can put my other ...
SS : can you tell about who designed your other legs ?
and this is just a silic@@ on piece of skin .
so , asking for help is basically the worst , right ?
in fact , not only is it very difficult to tell what your needs are , but even the people close to you often struggle to understand how they can support you .
now , he is more patient than I deserve and much more proactive , much more , about helping than any of us have any right to expect other people to be .
there 's no getting around it .
technically , I can 't help you with that last one because I 'm not that kind of doctor , but I could point you in the direction of someone who could .
this is really important : please avoid dis@@ claim@@ ers , ap@@ ologies and bribes .
if you introduce incentives or payments into that , what can happen is , it starts to feel like it is@@ n 't a relationship , it 's a transaction .
take time to tell your partner that the support they gave you really made it possible for you to get through a tough time .
now she had gotten a prol@@ ap@@ se from a cervical disc , giving her radi@@ ating pain of a tense kind , out into the right arm .
( la@@ ughter ) And you know what I realized , right there and then ?
so what made me do it this time ?
I have to admit it , I wanted to operate on her .
there should be no difference , but there is .
even though most indications for treatments in the world are standardized , there is a lot of unnecessary variation of treatment decisions , especially in the Western world .
and that is 30 percent .
the waiting list for an M@@ RI would quad@@ ru@@ ple , maybe even more .
" doctor , is this really necessary ? "
the patient is supposed to get advice from the doctor about what to do .
" doctor , are there other options ? "
are there other options ?
and what happens if I don 't do anything ?
they check in with their neighbors , sharing food , supplies , and wisdom gained over their long lives .
sugar 's journey starts high above the ground , in the leaves of the t@@ all@@ est trees above the can@@ op@@ y .
whatever the reasons , these fun@@ gi pass an incredible amount of information between trees .
through the my@@ cor@@ rh@@ iz@@ ae , trees can tell when nutrients or sign@@ aling molecules are coming from a member of their own species or not .
Pic@@ orna@@ viruses -- these are things that include the common cold and polio , things like this .
and if spots light up , we know there 's a certain virus in there .
and Kap@@ osi 's sar@@ com@@ a @@@ -@@ @ associated her@@ pes virus gives a nice signature down here .
you have no idea what someone 's going to c@@ ough into a cup , and it 's probably really complex , right ?
that 's me , getting a nas@@ al lav@@ age .
and basically we experi@@ mentally in@@ oc@@ ulate people with the common cold virus .
so , let 's start off with the positive control first , where we know the person was healthy .
actually , we thought the nas@@ al tract might be full of viruses even when you 're walking around healthy .
maybe they have kids . and then you can see , also , the family member that 's related : R@@ SV@@ B is showing up here .
now we 're using this chip . and what are we using it for ?
and so , this case report happened three weeks ago .
10 @@@ -@@ @ day history of fe@@ vers , night swe@@ ats , bloody s@@ pu@@ tum -- she 's cou@@ gh@@ ing up blood -- muscle pain .
it was " un@@ revealing " : that 's the path@@ ologist 's report .
no one would even consider it , because no one had a clu@@ e that it could cause respiratory failure .
and we know who 's got defects in R@@ NA@@ SE@@ L and who do@@ es@@ n 't .
we take sl@@ ices of these bi@@ op@@ sies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus , and we find cells here with viral particles in them .
is it a link to on@@ co@@ gene@@ sis ? I don 't know .
that 's where we 're at .
this is a collaboration between myself and Don .
to avoid the R@@ CP 8.5 scenario , we need rapid dec@@ ar@@ b@@ onization .
we have a three @@@ -@@ @ year window to cut emissions , three years .
it 's huge and slow @@@ -@@ @ moving -- think gig@@ at@@ ons and centuries .
there 's nothing I can do .
that makes us fear@@ ful .
thus , behavior drives attitudes .
so this is where it gets really exciting and where we find the five S 's , the five evidence @@@ -@@ @ based solutions for what does work .
this is the power of peer @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ peer creating the new normal .
and there are hundreds of smart n@@ ud@@ ges like this .
say you improved your transport footprint or cut energy waste in your buildings .
now , the UK and France , India and China have also announced plans for ending the sales of fossil cars .
inside this skin , we 're all closely connected .
J@@ om@@ ny is an alien who has been sent to earth with a mission to study humans .
J@@ om@@ ny is feeling lost and alone and far from home , and I think we 've all felt this way .
I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien .
it 's actually a Scottish piece I 've chosen .
( audience reaction ) D@@ L : you start . Nm : no , you have to start , because you 've got to do your thing .
D@@ L : how fast ?
( music ) ( Appl@@ ause )
bas@@ eb@@ alls .
so , imagine a robo@@ tic module in a poly@@ gon shape and using that simple poly@@ gon shape to re@@ construct multiple different forms to create a new form of robot for different tasks .
and we can do this now .
and this is quite important for the difficult and unique environments on the Earth as well as in space .
and don 't take my word for it , because the European Space Agency and Swiss Space Center are sponsoring this exact concept .
so you need robots to facilitate their experiments , assisting them with the communications and just doc@@ king onto surfaces to be their third arm holding different tools .
this is the world 's smallest hap@@ tic interface that can recre@@ ate a sensation of touch just under@@ ne@@ ath your fin@@ g@@ erti@@ p .
so what you see here is an at@@ las of an@@ atom@@ y and the robo@@ gam@@ i hap@@ tic interface .
instead , they will be whatever you want them to be .
TB 's outward symptoms even helped fuel the popular myth of v@@ am@@ pir@@ ism .
and even when properly identified , traditional treatments can take up to 9 months , requiring multiple drugs and a high potential for side effects .
you 're only 94 .
they did@@ n 't play that man down .
so they just don 't know their power , and I always tell them , just look at my mother , had 12 girls before she had a boy .
you don 't know what it does for me to see women in the position that you 're in today .
Oh God , that just mel@@ ted me , because I knew how hard it was to integrate that Navy .
you 're not going to see me out there w@@ aving .
no , I don 't do that .
that , I never learned to do .
how you act , they will act .
so you want that man to be a man , and do what he has to do .
( la@@ ughter ) So fill him up with cheap gas -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) and then , you got him .
and that lady reminded me .
I said , " If I would have just been like her , Do@@ ok@@ y would have really loved it . "
PM : to rememb@@ ering Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t and the person he did that favor for .
one of the things that it 's good to remember , always , is that when you opened that restaurant , wh@@ ites and bl@@ acks could not eat together in this city .
it was against the law .
PM : but you kept the restaurant open , though , even in those times of controversy , when people were pro@@ testing and almost boy@@ co@@ tting .
they could eat , they could plan .
they knew how to come together and talk , and you would disagree maybe .
Don 't off@@ end them . "
LC : and that 's what you have to tell young people today .
I like people with emotional and physical strength , and maybe that 's bad for me .
you know , that was@@ n 't too cool .
( appl@@ ause ) But that 's just what you have to do .
we can handle the rest .
but this man was from London .
( la@@ ughter ) No@@ body understands us , but we feed you well .
we are all trapped inside our own heads , and our beliefs and our understandings about the world are limited by that perspective , which means we tell ourselves stories .
that 's why I 'm dressed like this , in my most un @@@ -@@ @ TED @@@ -@@ @ like gar@@ b .
it 's a te@@ stament , I think , to the se@@ duc@@ tive appeal of some powerful figure offering you easy , simple answers to life 's complex and subtle questions and anx@@ ie@@ ties .
I will start with maybe this one .
al@@ right . so what did we ask ? what did Jes@@ sica ask about the future ?
just say , " I 'll take it " again .
Jes@@ sica : absolutely , that 's the question .
what was the actual question ? what did you put ?
Jes@@ sica : yes , I just got back from India .
man : I am standing . I 'm not that short .
put your weight on your left @@@ -@@ @ hand side and say " yes . "
and I 'm doing this now so I don 't have the clu@@ es as you stand up .
I can 't see where you put your hands .
so if you can just find a question in your head , make it clear and succ@@ inct , just send it to me , and I 'll try and do this now without anything written down .
OK , let me just ... Al@@ lan ?
have you got something , just yes or no , with a password in your head ?
have you got one ? Al@@ lan : ye@@ ah .
just keep saying it to yourself in your head .
your password , where are you ? where are you ? where is he ?
( cle@@ ars throat ) The viol@@ in is made of a wood box and four metal strings .
I looked at that giant mon@@ ster and said to myself -- " I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day ! "
and , you know what ?
now I know why I 'm here .
( la@@ ughter ) Li@@ ke the multi @@@ -@@ @ dimension stuff .
those shapes are par@@ abol@@ as .
we needed to beat solar cells .
we looked at a way to break up a par@@ abol@@ a into individual pe@@ tals that would track .
now that we have concentrated sunlight , what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity ?
so we looked at this engine , and this had some potential .
the internal combustion engine took off because weight mat@@ tered , because you were moving around .
we also discovered that efficiency do@@ es@@ n 't matter so much if your energy source is free .

since HP@@ V is often transmitted through sexual activity , this usually means the cells of the vag@@ ina , vul@@ va , penis , an@@ us , mouth and throat .
we can test for HP@@ V in cells from these areas , but while testing for the virus is scientifically possible , it is@@ n 't common .
so testing for HP@@ V would yield many , many posi@@ tives , and although most of them won 't be cause for concern , there is still no treatment plan for clearing the body of the virus .
the body 's immune system is able to eradicate most strains of HP@@ V before they cause any harm - and without people even knowing they 've been infected .
certain other stra@@ in@@ s@@ - like HP@@ V 6 and 11@@ - cause ab@@ norm@@ alities in the cells of the infected tissue , which can develop into genital war@@ ts .
this involves a doctor examining the cer@@ vi@@ x through a micro@@ scope , and possibly taking a small bi@@ op@@ sy of tissue for closer examination .
in some cases , the affected tissue may be removed .

in " The Garden of For@@ king Pa@@ ths , " as Y@@ u T@@ sun winds his way through country roads , he re@@ members a lost lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th built by one of his ancestors .
and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past .
five years ago , 135 million children were born -- so , more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five .
each one of those lives matters a lot .
one was killing the mosqu@@ it@@ os with DDT .
1990 , you 've gotten most of the northern areas .
now , bal@@ dness , it 's a terrible thing .
( la@@ ughter ) And rich men are afflicted .
and so that 's why that priority has been set .
so we 've come up with a few new things . we 've got bed nets .
and when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
and so you end up with two choices .
and that 's where we saw the malaria map shrinking .
so we 're going to have these new tools .
but that alone do@@ es@@ n 't give us the road map .
it involves social scientists , so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets , but 90 percent .
and so as these elements come together , I 'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria .
now let me turn to a second question , a fairly different question , but I 'd say equally important .
we all had a wonderful education .
I had great teachers .
and they 've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront .
but most of the drop@@ outs had taken place before that .
for minority kids , it 's over 50 percent .
so , how do you make education better ?
a top quar@@ tile teacher will increase the performance of their class -- based on test scores -- by over 10 percent in a single year .
that means that if the entire U.S. , for two years , had top quar@@ tile teachers , the entire difference between us and Asia would go away .
what are the characteristics of this top quar@@ tile ?
once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter .
the variation is very , very small .
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
for math teachers maj@@ oring in math there 's a measurable effect .
you might say , " Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher 's leave ? "
the answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system .
and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids we@@ ren 't paying attention , which kids were bo@@ red , and calling kids rapidly , putting things up on the board .
and so K@@ ip@@ p is doing it .
and that allows us to understand who 's doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
I 'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .

that means you can vent a cache of it from your fuel chamber , and then come back to pick it up again later .
with some strategic fuel c@@ aching along the way , you might be able to make it all 23 par@@ sec@@ s .
it 's possible to solve this rid@@ dle using as few as two cache points , and there are also valid solutions that use more .

now , some of you may be thinking , " did@@ n 't she have some other way of getting to that clinic appointment ? "
if you 're thinking that , it 's probably because you have resources .

maybe it 's for diabetes or depression .
obviously , these things also happen to middle @@@ -@@ @ class people .
the starting point has to be to meet patients where they are , provide services without obstacles and provide patients what they need -- not what we think they need .
in Los Angeles , we housed 4,@@ 700 chron@@ ically homeless persons suffering from medical illness , mental illness , addiction .
for non @@@ -@@ @ English @@@ -@@ @ speaking patients , translation is as important as a prescription pad .
what I remember most about that day was the father 's pi@@ er@@ cing cry .
we spend more on health care than any other country in the world .
or the fact that my parents were born in Jamaica , came to the United States and were able to realize the American Dre@@ am .
it 's estimated that somewhere between 1.5 and two percent of the four million deliveries that occur every year in this country are associated with one of these events .
there are some success stories .
a few years ago , the American College of Ob@@ ste@@ tr@@ icians and Gy@@ nec@@ ologists joined forces with other healthcare organizations , researchers like myself and community organizations .
yet the use of these bun@@ dles across the country is spo@@ tty or missing .
but Shal@@ on 's story highlights an additional underlying cause : quality of care .
quality of care in the setting of childbirth is an underlying cause of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in the United States , and it 's something we can address now .
in fact , differences in delivery hospital explain nearly one @@@ -@@ @ half of the black @@@ -@@ @ white disparity .
and finally , after pregnancy , it includes post@@ par@@ tum and inter @@@ -@@ @ pregnancy care so we can set m@@ oms up to have a healthy next baby and a healthy life .
they ho@@ oked her up to multiple different monitors and paid special attention to her blood pressure , the fe@@ tal heart rate tracing and gave her IV medication to prevent a seizure .
the question is : are we as a society ready to value pregnant women from every community ?

and she said , " What are you talking about ? "
( la@@ ughter ) I 'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster .
now , it do@@ es@@ n 't look terri@@ bly interesting , but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters .
Sil@@ as usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .
I am now exposing myself to my audience , right ?
and then I show you a little drawing -- you see , you remember that old thing I discarded ?
( la@@ ughter ) And that too is a relatively new idea .
and here 's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ?
it 's not folded , that 's a photograph and it 's cut on the diag@@ onal .
at times , it seems to be wider at the back than the front , and then it shifts .
but then I gave up and I said , " Well , art is whatever . "
a romantic and a revolutionary , N@@ er@@ uda was one of the most celebrated po@@ ets of the 20th century , but also one of the most accessible and controversial .
but in 1973 , Al@@ len@@ de was over@@ thrown in a military coup by General Aug@@ us@@ to Pin@@ och@@ et .
these gri@@ zz@@ ly fe@@ ats won him a position as surgeon to the city 's glad@@ i@@ ators .

O@@ don@@ to@@ ch@@ el@@ ys is an early ance@@ stor of the tur@@ tle .
its half @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ elled body illustrates an important point about the modern tur@@ tle : it actually has two shells that develop totally separately while the tur@@ tle is still an embry@@ o .
both are extensions of the animal 's sk@@ elet@@ on , and together they are made of almost 60 bones .
they then sec@@ re@@ te a sign@@ aling protein that conver@@ ts surrounding cells into bone @@@ -@@ @ forming cells .
O@@ don@@ to@@ ch@@ el@@ ys sem@@ ite@@ stac@@ ea illustrates another , later step in tur@@ tle evolution , with thick ribs like E@@ un@@ ot@@ osa@@ ur@@ us plus a bel@@ ly plate for protection .
police recruits had passed lengthy background checks , they had passed medical and psychological exams , they had quit their jobs .
and New Zealand is steadily mar@@ ching towards their goal of recruit gender parity by 2021 .
this results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing .
because recruiting is expensive .
you know what else the research finds ?
it 's so easy to get caught up in the number of steps we took today or the latest t@@ we@@ et from a high @@@ -@@ @ profile figure .
and Jackson knows that the way that most crops are grown around the world today is stri@@ pping the earth of the fertile top@@ soil we need to feed future generations .
( la@@ ughter ) This instrument is in my home today , but it do@@ es@@ n 't actually belong to me .
it 's my role to shepher@@ d it in time , and that feels more meaningful to me than just ow@@ ning it for today .
( la@@ ughter ) So , effectively , what he is telling me , and us , is that when it comes to my science , I 'm dead@@ wood .
well , luc@@ k@@ ily , I had my share of luck within my career .
this is a result from that .
but the way we actually started to explore , we realized that performance and success are very , very different animals when it comes to the mathematics of the problem .
what it means is that there are no huge variations in human performance .
this is not to say that we CA@@ N@@ NOT see the good from the best ones , but the best ones are very hard to distinguish .
one measure of success for writers is how many people read your work .
so let 's see what were the sales for Nicholas S@@ parks .
why ?
because there was Dan Brown , who sold 1.2 million copies that weekend .
and vertically , you see the impact of the paper , that is , how many c@@ itations , how many other papers have been written that cited that work .
( la@@ ughter ) That time , I was doing material science , and then I kind of discovered for myself networks and then started publishing in networks .
we 're not looking at real age .
and it happens to be so that most scientists buy most of their lottery tickets in the first 10 , 15 years of their career , and after that , their productivity decreases .
it is the productivity that changes .
so let me take another typical example : entrepreneurship .
( appl@@ ause ) So in the end , what is it that we see , actually ?
which is telling me that at the end of the day , if you keep trying -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) you could still succeed and succeed over and over .
most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and gra@@ sp@@ ing .
so if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
if we over@@ shoot , we can pour a little bit back .
video : the sun is rising .
DM : so by sha@@ king the S@@ if@@ tables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Video : wo@@ of !
DM : inven@@ ting his own narrative .
video : fly away , cat .
and you can in@@ ject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
and then , overall effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
video : ( music ) DM : we 'll start by putting a lead into two sequence S@@ if@@ tables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human @@@ -@@ @ computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our bra@@ ins and bodies work .
I asked her , " Do you remember how many babies you delivered throughout your career ? "
these were flags that were sent by families whom she helped treat their infertility problems .
it became clear to me she , too , was a victim of the policy .
and she did what she thought was right for her country .
the message se@@ ep@@ ed into our minds so much so that I grew up feeling embar@@ ras@@ sed for having a younger brother .
it h@@ ides in plain sight as news reports , TV commerci@@ als , political campaigning and in our social media feeds .
as previously we 've discussed , this is modern@@ ism in mini@@ ature .
if you look at the way in which the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft , you 'll notice that it tap@@ ers just every so slightly .
and this is one of hundreds of ways in which this ty@@ pe@@ face was designed to look geome@@ tr@@ ically perfect , even though it 's mathem@@ atically not .
and in many ways , there 's nothing wrong with this design .
there 's a photograph of an important person , in this case Frank@@ lin Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t , then @@@ -@@ @ governor of New York .
everything seems centered , everything seems sym@@ metrical .
but everything seems k@@ id of solid .
there 's even drop caps to help you get into the text .
but this all changed very quickly and in October of 1929 , a Berlin @@@ -@@ @ based designer came and re@@ designed " V@@ anity Fair . "
and this is what it looks like with Fu@@ tur@@ a .
in this case , illustrations by P@@ abl@@ o Pic@@ as@@ so , moving across the page and breaking the gu@@ tter of the two pages .
actually , in some ways , America 's the home of capitalization .
this has maybe had the same political force that we now argue over things like pronoun@@ s in our society today .
all low@@ er@@ case letters meant that this was an eg@@ al@@ itarian , complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field .
now this is still kind of a radical idea .
you actually had to have pieces of lead .
so for Americans who wanted to adopt this and make it part of their own system , something they could use in everyday ty@@ po@@ graphy , whether in ads or anything else , they actually had to have metal type .
use 20th Century , use S@@ part@@ an , use Vo@@ gue , use T@@ emp@@ o .
so America took this ty@@ pe@@ face in , conqu@@ ered it and made it its own .
so it 's in this context that when the US government was picking a ty@@ pe@@ face to use after World War II for new maps and new projects , they picked Fu@@ tur@@ a .
but in this case , it was used on some of the most important maps , so this one , an air force map in 1962 , or used for the maps in Vietnam in ' 66 .
now imagine if astr@@ onau@@ ts had to use different ty@@ pe@@ faces and different systems for each component they had in the space shu@@ tt@@ les .
this would have been impossible to navigate and there would have been a cognitive over@@ load every time they had to open up a new system .
so in this case , Fu@@ tur@@ a being used on the interface helped them navigate complexity and make it more clear .
in this case , Fu@@ tur@@ a helped make that system , which was already a very difficult and complex system , a little less complex .
this is a Hass@@ el@@ bl@@ ad that was made by the Swedish company .
and that is that Fu@@ tur@@ a tells a story .
thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) In fact , people will ask me , " is@@ n 't it de@@ pressing , working on ob@@ it@@ u@@ aries and thinking about death all the time ? "
since 18@@ 51 , the " New York Times " has published thousands of ob@@ it@@ u@@ aries .
for heads of state , famous celebrities , even the person who came up with the name on the S@@ link@@ y .
so I noticed we would get these emails , sometimes , from readers , saying , " He@@ y , why don 't you have more women and people of color in your ob@@ it@@ u@@ aries ? "
everything was sw@@ ir@@ ling in my mind , and I came across a website about Mary Ou@@ ter@@ bridge .
( la@@ ughter ) So then I wondered who else we missed .
AD@@ A Lo@@ vel@@ ace , a mathemati@@ cian now recognized as the first computer program@@ mer .
but I said , " Gu@@ ys , I really think this is worthwhile . "
and while I knew that the work my team was doing was powerful , I did@@ n 't expect the response to be equally powerful .
but when the police arrived , they arrested her , not him .
and she said , " You know what ? I 'm going to do it . "
it 's becoming a TV show now , on Net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I CA@@ N@@ NOT wait to see this thing come to life .
so next , I worked with a program@@ mer to build this tool , called the diversity analysis tool .
from the year of " Over@@ looked 's " launch , March of 2018 , to March of 2019 , I was hoping we could get to 30 percent of our ob@@ its on women .
again , it was a really powerful experience .
a lot of them had to make up stories about their past just to get ahead in life .
believe it or not , this brilliant man never got an ob@@ it@@ u@@ ary , even though his work dec@@ o@@ ding German messages during World War II helps end the war .
instead , he died a criminal for his sexual orientation , and he was forced to endure chemical ca@@ stration .
great things , like this ob@@ its project , do not come easily .
there are barriers that the solutions we 've come up with to date simply can 't overcome .
we develop early learning software designed to individu@@ alize instruction , so children can learn at their own pace .

Scot@@ t Simon , who told this story on NP@@ R , said , " Rules and procedures may be dum@@ b , but they spare you from thinking . "
what else , after all , is there ?
right ?
I 'll just give you one example because time is racing .
but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens .
the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .
they said , " If we paid you six weeks ' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? "
when incentives don 't work , when CE@@ Os ignore the long @@@ -@@ @ term health of their companies in pursuit of short @@@ -@@ @ term gains that will lead to massive bonuses , the response is always the same .
it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality .
one way not to do it : teach more ethics courses .
one : celebrate moral exempl@@ ars .
people are inspired by moral heroes .
be proud that you have them .
and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too .
one was R@@ ay An@@ derson , who turned -- ( Appl@@ ause ) -- turned , you know , a part of the evil empire into a zero @@@ -@@ @ footprint , or almost zero @@@ -@@ @ footprint business .
why ? because there happy to be doing something that 's the right thing to do .
yesterday we heard Wil@@ lie S@@ mits talk about re @@@ -@@ @ fo@@ resting in Indonesia .
so there 's a lot here at TED , and at other places , to celebrate .
even the wis@@ est and most well @@@ -@@ @ meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .
they need to learn to respect themselves .
that 's the principle objective .
Obama appealed to virtue .
this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention .
( la@@ ughter ) I failed .
but the thing is , Yemen , compared to , let 's say , Europe , was so under@@ studied that it was something ak@@ in to near vir@@ gin territory .
and that got me really excited , because look at So@@ co@@ tra 's proximity to Africa .
and most of our heroes were actually scientists and academics .
see , we don 't empower local academics , do we ?
I 'm telling you , research done in unstable places with local collaborators can lead to incredible discoveries , and that is what we are hoping upon hope to do in So@@ co@@ tra .
and now , now we just somehow need to get back for that really big expedition , because science , science has a geography problem .
thank you .

here 's where the soil comes in : there is about three thousand billion metric tons of carbon in the soil .
think about that for a second .
soil bio@@ geo@@ chem@@ ists like me study exactly how the soil system makes this possible , by locking away the carbon in physical association with minerals , inside aggregates of soil minerals , and formation of strong chemical bonds that bind the carbon to the surfaces of the minerals .
it can hold on to a lot of water and nutrients .
and if this effort 's fully successful , it can offset a third of the global emissions of fossil @@@ -@@ @ fuel @@@ -@@ @ derived carbon into the atmosphere .
the anxiety , grief and depression of climate scientists and activists have been reported on for years .
the UN just reported that we are pushing up to a million species to extinction , many within decades , and our emissions are still increasing , even after the Paris Agreement .

many activists will tell you that the best anti@@ do@@ te to grief is activis@@ m .

I was that child with her finger running beneath the words , until I was un@@ taught to do this ; told big kids don 't use their fingers .
and my job as the reader -- especially as the reader who wanted to one day become a writer -- was to respect that narrative .
and whether they told it through words or ge@@ stures or drawings , it was passed down ; remembered : hit a ham@@ mer and hear its story .
stone to ham@@ mer , man to m@@ um@@ my , idea to story -- and all of it , remembered .
imagine that : the danger of understanding how letters form words , the danger of words themselves , the danger of a literate people and their stories .
among these almost @@@ -@@ @ sil@@ enced people there were the ones who never learned to read .
and I read slowly to pay hom@@ age to my ancestors , who were not allowed to read at all .
thank you .
y@@ og@@ i B@@ erra was a world @@@ -@@ @ famous bas@@ eball player who said , " If you come to a for@@ k in the road , take it . "
our answer turned out to be synthetic immune systems that are designed to recognize and kill cancer cells .
so how do you do that ?
unlike normal drugs that you take -- they do their job and get metabol@@ ized , and then you have to take them again -- CAR T cells stay alive and on the job for years .
we have had CAR T cells stay in the bodies of our cancer patients now for more than eight years .
we had to learn to grow the patient 's own T cells .
and by 2010 , we began treating le@@ uk@@ emia patients .
we thought he would die , and , in fact , he was given last rites .
but then , another for@@ k in the road happened .
the CAR T cells had attacked the le@@ uk@@ emia in these patients and had dissolved between 2.9 and 7.7 pounds of tumor in each patient .
the CAR T cell and its daughter pro@@ geny cells can divide and divide and divide in the body until the last tumor cell is gone .
in fact , it had come back three times .
cancer had invaded her bone mar@@ row , her liver , her s@@ ple@@ en .
her fever was as high as 106 degrees F@@ ah@@ ren@@ he@@ it for three days .
this disease afflic@@ ts about 20,000 a year in the United States .
it was a normal Tuesday at the super@@ conductor , until a bug in the system created a small situation .
luc@@ k@@ ily for you , there 's a half @@@ -@@ @ finished experimental tele@@ portation robot that may be able to get you all home , if you can figure out how to work through the qu@@ ir@@ ks of its design .
the critical insight is that not everyone has to know when every pocket dimension has been visited .
it may take a wh@@ il@@ e@@ - most likely the robot will need to tele@@ port around 355 times ; but better that than leave anyone behind .
well ... mostly .
" He@@ y , I know why police chiefs like to share their deep , dark secrets with you .
I have no idea what your mother did to you , and I can 't help .
so , police chiefs like talking to me because I 'm an expert , but I doubt they 'd be lining up to lie down on Dr. P@@ hi@@ l 's cou@@ ch if I told them all their problems were hop@@ eless .
now the only problem with that definition is that it 's completely wrong -- both scientifically and otherwise .
and when you can measure a problem , you can tap into one of the only universal rules of organizational success .
it 's a process that , when you use it right , it identifies crime data , it tracks it and identifies patterns , and then it allows departments to hold themselves accountable to public safety goals .
so let me tell you how that works .
so right there 's the gap .
for the past quarter millennium , we 've defined the problems of race and policing in a way that 's func@@ tionally impossible to measure .
and as a gesture of good faith , I said I 'd wash the pots as well .
and they should all have an equal opportunity to contribute to the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process and influence the decisions that will affect their lives directly or indirectly .
politics is not only activis@@ m .
and even those who care don 't know how to participate .
and most importantly , most importantly , they will help others engage .
1.5 degrees Cel@@ sius . " no way , " I thought .
that 's why we are also called the " Third Pole . "
so after several sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess nights , I went to Nepal to visit IC@@ I@@ MO@@ D .
and , unlike snow@@ fall , rain mel@@ ts ice , which just hur@@ ts the health of our gl@@ aci@@ ers .
number four : pollution in the region has increased the amount of black carbon that 's deposited on our gl@@ aci@@ ers .
we know that we face drastic and dramatic change .
and while individual localized efforts will continue to be important , they CA@@ N@@ NOT stand up to the on@@ sla@@ ught of climate change .
to stand up to climate change , we must work together .
time is running out .
otherwise , the next time Nepal 's cabinet meets on Mount E@@ ve@@ rest , that spectacular backdrop ...
and while they can hold their cabinet meetings underwater to send an SOS to the world , their country can keep existing only if their islands keep existing .
now you might have imagined that the financial crisis of 2008 would have led to the collapse of ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ alism .
it 's the " Harry Pot@@ ter " story .
it 's that important .
Democrats and Re@@ public@@ ans , labor and conserv@@ atives , left and right all became , broadly , Key@@ ne@@ sian .
then , when Key@@ ne@@ si@@ anism ran into trouble in the 1970s , the ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ als , people like Fried@@ rich Ha@@ ye@@ k and Mil@@ ton Fried@@ man , came forward with their new restoration story , and it went something like this .
when we have no story that explains the present and describes the future , hope evapor@@ ates .
without a restoration story that can tell us where we need to go , nothing is going to change , but with such a restoration story , almost everything can change .
but something has gone horri@@ bly wrong .
disorder afflic@@ ts the land .
( appl@@ ause ) But it do@@ es@@ n 't have to be like this .
it really do@@ es@@ n 't , because we have this incredible capacity for to@@ ge@@ ther@@ ness and belonging , and by invoking that capacity , we can recover those amazing components of our humanity : our al@@ tru@@ ism and cooperation .
and we can create this economics around that great neglected sphere , the comm@@ ons .
we can use new rules and methods of elections to ensure that financial power never trum@@ ps democratic power again .
our task is to tell the story that lights the path to a better world .
thank you .
Hy@@ pati@@ a of Alexand@@ ria was a prominent mathemati@@ cian , phil@@ os@@ op@@ her , and advisor to the city 's leaders .
by adul@@ thood , she had surpassed her father in both mathematics and philosophy , becoming the city 's foremost schol@@ ar and taking over his position at the head of the Plat@@ onic school , similar to a modern university .
just over a mile away from here , in Edinburgh 's Old Town , is Pan@@ m@@ ure House .
Pan@@ m@@ ure House was the home of the world @@@ -@@ @ renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith .
and against that context , I think the limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country 's success are all too obvious .
and those indicators are as varied as income inequality , the happiness of children , access to green spaces , access to housing .
it 's worth noting , and I 'll leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or not , that all three of these countries are currently led by women .
I think that is a good founding principle for any group of countries focused on promoting well @@@ -@@ @ being .
I think we owe that to this generation .
it 's why experts and forec@@ asters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out .
what sort of talents must we be sure to defend ?
that 's inefficient , a waste of time , perhaps , but it 's robust .
countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions , multiple forms of renewable energy , not just one .
try some experiments .
so one of them , Jo@@ s de Blo@@ k , proposed an experiment .
so now this form of nursing has prolif@@ erated across the Netherlands and around the world .
of course , not all experiments work .
in England -- I was about to say in the UK , but in England -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) In England , the leading rug@@ by team , or one of the leading rug@@ by teams , is Sar@@ ac@@ ens .
it takes a huge amount of time and effort ; lots of people would call it distr@@ acting .
preparedness , coalition @@@ -@@ @ building , imagination , experiments , bra@@ very -- in an unpredictable age , these are tremendous sources of resilience and strength .
they are@@ n 't efficient , but they give us lim@@ it@@ less capacity for adaptation , variation and invention .
( appl@@ ause ) Our growing dependence on technology risks us becoming less skilled , more vulnerable to the deep and growing complexity of the real world .
" there 's no time . "
" they 're too busy . "
we have deep talents of inven@@ tiveness and exploration -- if we apply them .
but I honestly cou@@ ld@@ n 't tell you who 's won , because we change partners every five minutes .
and everybody is trying really hard to win points , but nobody is keeping track of who is winning games .
in Japan , it 's been said , they 've created a competitive spirit without competition .
( la@@ ughter ) No exagg@@ eration .
and Eastern Europeans grew so ade@@ pt at hitting back everything that was hit at them that they almost brought the whole sport to a standstill .
longer than a " M@@ ad Max " movie .
and according to one of the players , the um@@ p@@ ire had to retire with a s@@ ore neck before the point was concluded .
but in Japan , I 'm encouraged to believe that , really , the point of a game is to make as many people as possible around you feel that they are winners .
so you 're not care@@ ening up and down as an individual might , but you 're part of a regular , steady ch@@ orus .
and my friend who hits these high , lo@@ oping lob@@ s that smaller players fla@@ il at and miss -- well , he wins a lot of points , but I think he 's thought of as a los@@ er .
you 're learning how to play with somebody , rather than against her .
why ?
you remember that point I mentioned that was said to last for two hours and 12 minutes ?
well , one of the players from that game ended up , six years later , in the concentration camps of Aus@@ ch@@ witz and D@@ ac@@ ha@@ u .
I began this project in the year 2000 by documenting a group of day lab@@ ore@@ rs on Chicago 's Nor@@ thwest side .
they had to be .
so I agreed .
he was proud , defi@@ ant and vulnerable , all at once .
L@@ up@@ e brought me into the inner world of her family and showed me the true impact of migration .
their world was largely hidden from view .
over the years , I slowly piec@@ ed together the complicated puzzle that stretched from Central America through Mexico to my back@@ yard in Chicago .
I witnessed the rise of the Mexican drug war and the deepening levels of social violence in Central America .
ca@@ stor and Pollu@@ x , the twin tr@@ ick@@ sters hat@@ ched from an egg .
if J@@ ason retrieved the Fle@@ ece , P@@ eli@@ as promised to relinqu@@ ish the throne .
but the path ahead was marked with un@@ told terror@@ s@@ - enough to test even the fi@@ erc@@ est heroes .
in the temp@@ est , the D@@ oli@@ ones thought these new arrivals inv@@ aders .
the Ar@@ g@@ onau@@ ts were similarly unaware of their surroundings , and fought bl@@ under@@ ingly in the dark , sla@@ ying wave after wave of fo@@ e .
yet again , J@@ ason had allowed the crew to be distr@@ acted , this time at a terrible cost .
but he could not guess that this final task would have the most horri@@ ble price of all .
billions of years ago on the young planet Earth simple organic compounds assembled into more complex coalitions that could grow and reproduce .
Luc@@ a was@@ n 't the first life form , but it 's as far back as we can trace .
[ this talk contains mature content ] I 'm often asked what do I do .
and when I answer those questions , people tend to be shocked .
shocked at the scale of violence , shocked at the nature of violence .
there 's a nas@@ cent movement building around this .
Governments , national governments , city governments , provinces and others are joining that movement .
raped repeatedly by her step@@ father and threatened with violence if she tells anyone .
Fa@@ is@@ al , hit across the kn@@ uc@@ k@@ les at school with a cable , sha@@ med and called a don@@ key , made to stand outside in the cold when he gets the answers wrong .
twice the number the year before .
and many other countries , cities and states are joining them , all over the world .
it requires multiple agencies within and beyond government .
it requires faith groups , the private sector , media , academia , civil society organizations and others .
and it requires drawing on what the best practice and the best evidence globally tells us , but using national @@@ -@@ @ level data to shine a light on the often hidden story of violence in any given country .
but can we really do this on a global scale ?
look at what 's happened in the aid industry .
in 2016 , the Children Act made that illegal and set the minimum age of marriage at 18 .
I 'm here to talk to you about something important that may be new to you .
in fact , most emissions contain sul@@ f@@ ates that brigh@@ ten clouds : coal , diesel exhaust , forest fires .
this is a NASA simulation of earth 's atmosphere , showing clouds and particles moving over the planet .
today , there are no capabilities , and scientific knowledge is extremely limited .
even with the most optimistic assumptions , our exposure to risk in the next 10 to 30 years is un@@ accep@@ tably high , in my opinion .
could interventions like these provide fast @@@ -@@ @ acting medicine if we need it to reduce the earth 's fever while we address its underlying causes ?
but even so , could we ever learn enough about these interventions to manage the risk ?
what if some people are worse off , or they just think they are ?
I for one don 't want them to act without real information and much better options .
there is hope !
we could cle@@ ave the two hal@@ ves apart .
and this was important .
( la@@ ughter ) And I also felt like an assass@@ in who had her mark .
so when we 're on the t@@ read@@ mill , we would anticipate that our heart would beat and pound , and when we 're asleep , we would ask that that muscle slow .
and in one way , it felt like it was the same inventory of feelings that I 'd had at the outset .
( la@@ ughter ) Re@@ ally , someone had to teach me that he was fat .

see , this disease is progressive and ever @@@ -@@ @ changing .
that means it comes and goes .
you know what I mean ?
but there was a cold hard reality as well .
if I wanted change , the change had to start with me .
so I came up with a plan .
but over time , things started to go OK .
she 's like two or three .
and she says , " She thinks you have a bo@@ o @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ o . "
and with the touch of that little hand , she healed a grown man 's pain .

in 2016 , we all came together and celebrated World Vi@@ til@@ ig@@ o Day .
it was amazing .
so that 's how I ended up in the living room of a social media propag@@ an@@ dis@@ t in Southern California .
and t@@ we@@ et they did -- hundreds and hundreds of t@@ wee@@ ts , a lot of them featuring images like this one .
I should also mention that the guy in New York who planted that bomb , he was an American citizen .
so whatever else was going on there , immigration was not the main issue .
they seem to take comfort in anonymous , online spaces rather than connecting in the real world .
she found some of these spaces on the internet where people would post the most shoc@@ king , heinous things .
but a lot of the people I spoke to were not .
but this is TED , so let 's get practical .
everyone says racism is bad , you say , " I dun@@ no , I 'm skep@@ tical about that . "
great !
everyone clic@@ ks on it , everyone comments on it , whether they love it or they hate it .
maybe .
the arc do@@ es@@ n 't bend itself .
having made their home in the Wild Fi@@ elds north of the Black Sea , these cos@@ s@@ acks - derived from a Turk@@ ic word for " free man " - are renowned as one of Europe 's most formidable military forces .
yet this freedom has proven increasingly difficult to maintain .
thank@@ fully , the ten@@ uous peace is not broken before they reach the S@@ ich - the center of Coss@@ ack military life .
as the Russian pa@@ inter Il@@ ya Re@@ pin once said : " no people in the world held freedom , equality , and fr@@ aternity so deeply . "
on the other hand , by talking , a group could exchange knowledge , correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas .
so does talking to each other help or hinder collective decision @@@ -@@ @ making ?
and we 're going to give you 20 seconds for each of these dilem@@ mas to judge whether you think they 're acceptable or not .
this allows parents to select their child 's height , eye color , intelligence , social competence and other non @@@ -@@ @ health @@@ -@@ @ related features .
groups gave much less weight to the out@@ li@@ ers , and instead , the consensus turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers .
the most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous behavior of the group .
it seemed , at that time , to be a sea of E@@ den , but now we know , and now we are facing paradise lost .
in 1979 I had a chance to put my foot@@ prints on the ocean floor while using this personal subm@@ er@@ sible called J@@ im .
ninety @@@ -@@ @ seven percent of Earth 's water is ocean .
Mars comes to mind .
and we 've been tra@@ w@@ ling them down much faster than the natural systems can replen@@ ish them .
TIM Wor@@ th says the economy is a wholly @@@ -@@ @ owned subsidiary of the environment .
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what 's happening , showing us our impact on the Earth .
and fortunately , in our time , we 've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
and with knowing comes caring .
but I asked him : " when are you going to finish it ?
you did a great job with the land , the dirt .
to see -- wait a minute , we can go k@@ sh@@ h@@ pl@@ ash ! -- right there , ha -- under the ocean , see what the wh@@ ales see .
these are the gentle gi@@ ants that I 've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater .
one @@@ -@@ @ way trips are easy .
how about some X Pri@@ zes for ocean exploration ?
we need to see deep tren@@ ches , the under@@ sea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea .
we can now go to the Arctic .
that 's bad news for us too .
we 're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other tra@@ sh into the sea .
we 're still killing bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in tuna ; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .
we kill using long lines , with ba@@ ited ho@@ oks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
this chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000 .
ten percent of the big fish still remain .
there are a few oy@@ sters in Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ ea@@ ke Bay .
natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , water@@ sh@@ eds and wildlife .
and in 18@@ 72 , with Yel@@ low@@ stone National Park , the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had .
that 's another great idea .
in the last three years , for example , the U.S. protected 34@@ 0,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments .
we don 't consume 200 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old cows or chick@@ ens .
or the Antarctic , where the continent is protected , but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its kr@@ ill , wh@@ ales and fish .
the next 10 years may be the most important , and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life .
we need to do for the ocean what Al G@@ ore did for the sk@@ ies above .
whatever it is , a fraction of one percent is not enough .
here .
perspectives can change .
perspectives can be altered .
let me talk about a relatively small number .
we are residents of one small planet in a corner of the Mil@@ ky Way gal@@ axy .
and that C@@ oper@@ n@@ ican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and the@@ ology .
why ?
we 'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find f@@ aint , complex signals that our current algorithms miss .
I 'm here today representing a team of artists and techn@@ ologists and fil@@ m@@ makers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years .
so I want to show you a cli@@ p of the film now .
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the Holy G@@ rail of our industry .
we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character .
he believed that he could , in fact , catalog the human face .
we worked from dental mol@@ ds of Bra@@ d .
and so , what does that look like -- " typical ? "
the one physical system , the brain , contains an accurate working model of the other , the qu@@ as@@ ar .
this place , and not other places in the universe , is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality .
( la@@ ughter ) Because imagine a cu@@ be out there in inter@@ gal@@ actic space , the same size as our home , the solar system .
and he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century .
the danger is not at all unprecedented .
so let me now apply this to a current controversy , not because I want to advocate any particular solution , but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean .
hence , we need a stance of problem @@@ -@@ @ fixing , not just problem @@@ -@@ @ avoidance .
( la@@ ughter ) If medical science stopped seeking cu@@ res and concentrated on prevention only , then it would achieve very little of either .
only we humans make waste that nature can 't dig@@ est .
plastics are also hard to recycl@@ e .
it 's did@@ dly @@@ -@@ @ point @@@ -@@ @ squ@@ at .
here is the accumulation at Bi@@ ona C@@ ree@@ k next to the L.@@ A. airport .
after ten years , a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Gar@@ bage Pat@@ ch , while ours lit@@ ter the Philippines .
I got plenty of tak@@ ers .
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .
it turns out that particular one was the first of its kind ever taken alive .
I learned two really important things that day .
if you look at this diagram of a coral ree@@ f , we know a lot about that part up near the top .
the effect of that pressure is you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take .
the first limitation is the oxygen -- oxygen toxicity .
it 's nitrogen nar@@ co@@ sis .
there are three basic systems to a closed @@@ -@@ @ circuit re@@ brea@@ ther .
now , as we breathe , we produce carbon dioxide , and that carbon dioxide needs to be sc@@ rub@@ bed out of the system .
there 's a just un@@ beli@@ evable diversity .
it 's not just fish , either .
this is the second extraordinary photograph I 'm going to show you .
the first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet , which is to survive .
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism .
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .
this was taken in the Ri@@ viera Su@@ gar Factory in Red Ho@@ ok , Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n .
I was very f@@ ond of this space because it 's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned .
when you go into spaces like this , you 're directly accessing the past , because they sit un@@ touched for decades .
this particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Blo@@ om@@ ing@@ d@@ ale In@@ san@@ e Asylum , which was demolished in 18@@ 90 when Columbia moved in .
it 's full of history , and also full of underground bun@@ kers and ruins from the war .
I explored there extensively in the off @@@ -@@ @ limits areas and fell in love right away .
this is a German bun@@ ker .
I don 't recommend sitting on a gar@@ go@@ y@@ le in the middle of January , naked .
this was probably the tough@@ est place to explore .
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fum@@ es -- I guess , except for in this picture .
and the 16@@ mm black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white film gave a different feel to it .
but whenever I get a chance I still work on my series .
this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system .
probably the most important third @@@ -@@ @ party development came from a little company in Virginia called Sum@@ m@@ ize .
for instance , here 's what people are saying about TED .
this not only lets you view T@@ wit@@ ters in different ways , but it introduces new use cases as well .
one of my favor@@ ites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta .
it 's totally intim@@ idating .
" E@@ van Williams is just dying on stage here at TED .
we spent two and a half years conducting research ; we spent another year and a half in advance development .
Mik@@ o : did you hear about Nak@@ ilia 's big H@@ allo@@ ween party this weekend ?
R@@ oc@@ ket@@ t : it 's like I 'm just wa@@ king up , you know ?
that changed my life quite dramatically , and as of today , I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers .
the deforestation , especially for oil palm , to provide bio@@ fuel for Western countries is what 's causing these problems .
and those are the pe@@ at sw@@ amp forests on 20 meters of pe@@ at , the largest accumulation of organic material in the world .
this was like a biological desert .
so what happened here ? we created a huge economic failure in this forest .
still , in this place , in this grass@@ land where you can see our very first office there on that hill , four years later , there is this one green bl@@ op on the Earth 's surface ...
the ac@@ ac@@ ia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro @@@ -@@ @ climate , to protect the soil and to shake out the gra@@ s@@ ses .
it 's an old temple @@@ -@@ @ building technique from Japan but b@@ ambo@@ o is very fire @@@ -@@ @ susceptible .
not really , because if you looked at what happened in 1998 , the fire started .
this is an area of about 50 million hectares .
February .
April .
for three months , the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark .
you don 't need to harvest [ unclear ] or any other of the crops .
so this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the trop@@ ics , which is still un@@ exploited , and doing it in combination with technology .
and they become like nutrient pumps .
in this nursery , we 're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species .
and three years later , 137 species of birds are living here .
( appl@@ ause ) So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Cel@@ sius .
I 'll just run them very quickly through .
so to say it is hop@@ eless is not the right thing to do , because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies .
and it 's nice to have the science , but it still depends mostly upon the people , on your education .
all the seeds get eaten .
and it has two nice f@@ ences of tropical hard@@ wood trees -- you have the sh@@ ade trees planted in year one , then you under@@ planted with the sugar pal@@ ms , and you plant this thor@@ ny fence .
there is no simple one recipe for one place .
they get all these other benefits : environmentally , money , they get education -- it 's a great deal .
so if we want to help the oran@@ gu@@ t@@ ans -- what I actually set out to do -- we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit .
now I think the real key to doing it , to give a simple answer , is integration .
you might recognize me as " Male Es@@ cor@@ t # 1 . "
now -- right ?
right ? girls are weak , and boys are strong .
instead he taught me what he knew : that being a man was about sacrifice and doing whatever you can to take care of and provide for your family .
it was@@ n 't until the end of the third day that I finally found the strength to talk to them about what I was going through .
but when I did , something amazing happened .
the response has been incredible .
why are only women following me ?
so I wanted to figure out how I could reach more men , but of course none of them were following me .
and then , out of the blue , for the first time in my entire career , a male fitness magazine called me , and they said they wanted to honor me as one of their game @@@ -@@ @ chan@@ gers .
where are the men ?
are you brave enough to be vulnerable ?
it was un@@ conscious .
but I believe that as men , it 's time we start to see past our privilege and recognize that we are not just part of the problem .
because of the over@@ hanging leaves and branches , you 'll notice that the under@@ story is very dark , it 's very still .
but I 'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the ants .
so we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us .
and these mos@@ ses , generated by decom@@ posing , are like pe@@ at mos@@ s in your garden .
we 've done stri@@ pping experiments where we 've removed mat@@ s of epi@@ phy@@ tes and looked at the rates of rec@@ olonization .
we had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encro@@ aching from the side .
well , when we look out , you and I , over that can@@ op@@ y of the intact primary forest , what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon .
one of the challenges that can@@ op@@ y researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being seque@@ stered .
I 've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are dis@@ associated from trees in their lives .
this is a fantastic installation by Bru@@ ce Cha@@ o who is chair of the S@@ culp@@ ture and Glass B@@ lowing Department at Rho@@ de Island School of Design .
we brought musicians to the can@@ op@@ y , and they made their music -- and it 's fantastic music .
what can I , as an ec@@ ologist , do about that ?
well , my thought was that I could learn how to grow mos@@ ses , and that way we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have to take them out of the wild .
and I thought , if I had some partners that could help me with this , that would be great .
and they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mos@@ ses .
because the prison ward@@ ens were very enthusiastic about this as well , I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons .
I 'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community .
so , although it 's a little bit of a fantasy , I think it 's also a reality .
thank you very much .
and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
Mel@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b , one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
how did -- I mean -- how did I get here ?
I took them like this , and I yan@@ ked my head back .
and I 'm standing there with two tes@@ ticles on my chin .
when you start to look for peri@@ pe@@ te@@ ia , you find it everywhere .
( la@@ ughter ) And he says , " He@@ y Mike , look .
you 've worked in mining , you 've worked in fishing , you 've worked in steel , you 've worked in every major industry .
Bob Com@@ bs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the un@@ eaten sc@@ ra@@ ps of food from the cas@@ inos and feeds them to his sw@@ ine .
but what it all comes down to is this : I 've formed a theory , and I 'm going to share it now in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds .
we 're plug@@ ged in ; we 're connected .
and so you want that to to@@ w boats very fast .
and third of all , it 's so sharp , it just cuts .
and as you play ping @@@ -@@ @ pon@@ g , whenever the ball hits part of the table , the ri@@ p@@ ples spread out and the fish run away .
there 's something I call the vis@@ cer@@ al level of processing , and there will be vis@@ cer@@ al @@@ -@@ @ level design .
biology -- we have co @@@ -@@ @ adapted through biology to like bright colors .
vis@@ cer@@ al is sub@@ conscious , you 're unaware of it .
this is a Ko@@ h@@ ler shower , a water@@ fall shower , and actually , all those kno@@ bs beneath are also show@@ er@@ heads .
and the wa@@ iter can come by and say , " W@@ ould you like more water ? "
it 's that little voice in your head that 's watching and saying , " That 's good . that 's bad . "
so , it 's p@@ itting one against the other .
and what 's so ne@@ at about it is how you accept that story .
so for the last year , I 've been working with Dr. T@@ alia St@@ rou@@ d at the University of Texas , Austin .
because what G@@ el@@ f@@ and has found is that , when things are too loose , people cra@@ ve order and structure .
and that cra@@ ving for order and structure cor@@ relates really strongly with support for people like these guys .
( la@@ ughter ) A great , fun , hall@@ uc@@ in@@ atory place to visit has become our home .
but because of this history of decay and renewal and segregation and integration , cities are the source of some of our best ideas about how to build functional , thri@@ ving communities .
when did neighbors become friends ?
and we need it urgently , because political scientists tell us that healthy democracies need healthy public spaces .
if online digital spaces are going to be our new home , let 's make them a comfortable , beautiful place to live , a place we all feel not just included but actually some ownership of .
I did@@ n 't understand them and , to be honest , I was quite afraid to look into them .
my doctor said , " We know why people get like this .
and I felt much better , I got a real boost .
and I started asking myself , " What 's going on here ?
you need to feel that people see you and value you .
and one day , he stood on a land mine left over from the war with the United States , and he got his leg blown off .
the guy started to cry all day , he refused to get out of bed , he developed all the symptoms of classic depression .
and Dr. Sum@@ mer@@ field said , " What was it ? "
and 39 percent of people said that described them .
and like me , he 's not opposed to chemical anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants , he thinks they give some relief to some people .
the underlying problem .
one day , Sam decided to pioneer a different approach .
" why don 't we make this into a garden ? "
so everyone knows jun@@ k food has taken over our di@@ ets and made us physically sick .
that 's not an exact quote from Sch@@ open@@ ha@@ u@@ er , but that is the g@@ ist of what he said .
but I kept talking to professor K@@ asser and saying , " Why am I feeling this strange dou@@ bl@@ eness ? "
at some level , we already know these things .
I think there 's many reasons .
it 's a signal .
the cows that are waiting all around us .
and girls are out of school because of , obviously poverty , social , cultural factors .
but the way we do it is a little different and high @@@ -@@ @ tech , at least in my view .
each of our front@@ line staff have a smartphone .
but all of this would be useless if our children we@@ ren 't learning .
you know , how am I even thinking about doing that , because India is not a small place , it 's a huge country .
how is it that I 'm standing here , saying that one small organization is going to solve a full 40 percent of the problem ?
and that 's because we have a key insight .
and there 's been a lot of talk about how life @@@ -@@ @ changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees , and I am no exception .
three months after that , I did my first run@@ way show for Alexander Mc@@ Queen on a pair of hand @@@ -@@ @ car@@ ved wooden legs made from solid ash .
the artist Matthew Bar@@ ney , in his film op@@ us called the " The Cre@@ master Cycle . "
her mouth dropped open when she saw me , and she went , " But you 're so tall ! "
it 's a conversation about potential .
their call to action ri@@ p@@ pled through homes and businesses - and news of their message even reached concentration camps and prisons .
but how could they spread them , when it was impossible to know who to trust ?
while the Ge@@ st@@ ap@@ o searched for leads , the White Rose were constantly on guard .
they gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ed buildings and bra@@ ved trains s@@ warming with Ge@@ st@@ ap@@ o .
when Hans and S@@ op@@ hi@@ e confessed , they were immediately led to court and sentenced to death by guil@@ lo@@ tine .
and the two had never met before .
and if you answered all these questions , we asked one more question : " He@@ y , would you like to meet a neighbor who totally dis@@ agrees with you ? "
this is me talking to Mir@@ ko . Mir@@ ko did@@ n 't want to be in the picture .
ninety percent said that they enjoyed their discussion .
thank you .
while our earliest records of chess are in the 7th century , legend tells that the game 's origins lie a century earlier .
in China , chess pieces were placed at inter@@ sections of board squares rather than inside them , as in the native strategy game Go .
and in Japanese Sho@@ gi , captured pieces could be used by the opposing player .
and perhaps that same ing@@ en@@ uity will guide us out of this apparent check@@ mate .
now , she is a resident Dru@@ id of the Ven@@ et@@ i tribe in a small farming village near the western coast of G@@ aul , in what is now France .
although the dru@@ ids are forbidden from recording their knowledge , she and many other young dru@@ ids can read Latin .
you see any adults ?
well , lets go back to the 15th century .
and Nor@@ bert Ros@@ ing , a German photographer , is there on scene , making a series of photos of these hus@@ k@@ ies , who are te@@ thered .
and something very unusual happens .
and that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times , at Virginia Tech .
and I 'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans .
this is a mountain go@@ at .
and there 's a whole other type of play , which is object play .
and -- they don 't throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being play@@ ful .
and I love this one , because it 's also what we 're about .
well , a lot .
I walked into the Car@@ ne@@ gie asking for a grant .
and that 's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about .
now , the program says that the opposite of play is not work , it 's depression .
and we begin to lose those signals , culturally and otherwise , as adults .
that 's a shame .
so part of the sign@@ aling system of play has to do with vocal , facial , body , ge@@ st@@ ural .
because ne@@ o@@ ten@@ y means the retention of im@@ mature qualities into adul@@ thood .
so it 's not just something you do in your spare time .
it had underground all the data OK , data is brown and bo@@ xy and b@@ oring , and that 's how we think of it , is@@ n 't it ?
third rule is that when I get back that information it 's not just got somebody 's height and weight and when they were born , it 's got relationships .
inte@@ res@@ tingly , data is relationships .
so he wrote a program to take the data , extract it from Wikipedia , and put it into a blo@@ b of linked data on the web , which he called db@@ pe@@ dia .
and the exciting thing is it 's starting to grow .
let 's think about data for a bit .
audience : now !
and it 's not just America . it 's all over the world .
and it 's not just governments , of course -- it 's enterprises as well .
so I could go into edit mode , I could select the theater , I could add down at the bottom the name , and I could save it back .
I did that to the map . I just did that !
I put that up on there . He@@ y , you know what ?
you get this really huge power out of it .
it turns out all you have to do is mention the word pornography .
I was just losing my audience .
maybe tell them about that . "
I think there were some loud ho@@ oting no@@ ises .
at that point , I 'd been working for more than a decade on this seemingly in@@ tractable problem of dating violence .
but solutions were proving elusive .
it 's a rare person who do@@ es@@ n 't see some pornography in their youth .
or missing root causes of dating and sexual violence , which are the true public health crises .
and that is , keep the conversation true to science .
here 's why , and most importantly , how .
I 'm not going to get into details here , but let me tell you so much : we are in a point of history that the most destructive force on the planet is humanity itself .
except ...
I did@@ n 't know what to expect , but I expected the worst .
usually .
yes , we are great , we are going to keep going , and we are going to go to places no one ever expected us , yes .
it 's an incredibly complex thing , after all .
does your best friend know about this ?
two , five , ten , one hundred people asking for in@@ convenient change are hard to ignore .
but this also means , if we want to , we can have a say in this .
so let 's give it a try , let 's rock and roll , let 's flood the world with climate activists .
this is sea@@ weed .
but it does have some remarkable qualities .
for one , it grows really fast .
and to do that , we need a carbon price .
but that 's what the scientists tell us we need to do .
there are also chemical pathways .
the biological pathways offer us a lot more hope , I think , in the short term .
you 've probably heard about reforestation , planting trees , as a solution to the climate problem .
you know , it 's a fair question : can we plant our way out of this problem by using trees ?
but if we look offshore , we@@ e see a solution where there 's already an existing industry , and where there 's a clearer way forward .
they play a really big role in regulating our climate , and if we can enhance the growth of sea@@ weed in them , we can use them , I think , to develop a climate @@@ -@@ @ altering crop .
but you can also use sea@@ weed to take a sea@@ weed bath , it 's supposed to be good for your skin ; I can 't testify to that , but you can do it .
and how close are we to that at the moment ?
again , it 's very different from on land .
whereas if you plant a forest , you 've got to worry about forest fires , bugs , etc . , releasing that carbon .
one of the things that really worries me , when I talk about this , is the fate of biodiversity in the deep ocean .
these sea@@ weed farms off South Korea -- you can see them from space , they are huge .
it provides an ideal environment for growing marine protein .
we 'll be investing many , many billions of dollars into these solutions , and they will take decades to get to the gig@@ aton scale .
it will flood our cities , it will deprive us of food , it will cause all sorts of civil unrest .
and that do@@ es@@ n 't seem like very long .
and if you doubt how much can be done over 30 years , just cast your mind back a century , to 1919 , compare it with 1950 .
now , in 1919 , here in Edinburgh , you might have seen a canvas and wood bi@@ plane .
but if I were , I 'll tell you , my money would be on that stuff , it would be on sea@@ weed .
I remember the sun streaming through the window .
we had nothing that could help them stop this abuse .
and today , as she struggles to recover , she lives with the fact that thousands around the world continue to watch her abuse .
I have come to learn in the last five years that this case is far from unique .
it 's clear that abusers have been quick to leverage new technologies , but our response as a society has not .
let 's talk for a minute -- ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .
and so , most companies or law enforcement agencies that have this content can translate every file into a unique string of numbers .
in a sil@@ o , it might work for the one agency that has control over it , but not connecting this data means we don 't know how many are unique .
the first is with law enforcement : helping them identify new victims faster , stopping abuse and stopping those producing this content .
the second is with companies : using it as clu@@ es to identify the hundreds of millions of files in circulation today , pulling it down and then stopping the upload of new material before it ever goes viral .
four years ago , when that case ended , our team sat there , and we just felt this , um ...
so , I told you -- 45 million images and videos in the US alone last year .
these come from those companies that have the money to build the infrastructure that it takes to pull this content down .
so we went ahead and built it for them , and this system now gets s@@ mar@@ ter with the more companies that participate .
within 20 minutes of going live on our system , someone tried to upload a known piece of abuse material .
the Canadian Centre for Child Protection just did a recent study of these young adults to understand the unique trauma they try to recover from , knowing that their abuse lives on .
guys go for girls like this because they are sex@@ y .
and , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ kes because they are funny .
so if you think first there was swe@@ et@@ ness , and then we evolved to like swe@@ et@@ ness , you 've got it back@@ wards ; that 's just wrong . it 's the other way round .
now you might think , ah , there 's a solution : hall@@ uc@@ inations .
our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinc@@ tual preference for high @@@ -@@ @ energy food .
chocolate cake is a super@@ normal stimulus .
it was a hyper@@ stimulus for them , and they loved it .
what we see with , say , chocolate cake is it 's a super@@ normal stimulus to t@@ weak our design wiring .
and , by the way , a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty di@@ ap@@ ers of their own baby .
but unfortunately , thousands upon thousands of people would believe it was her .
all of her online accounts were floo@@ ded with screen@@ shots of the video , with graphic rape and death threats and with sl@@ urs about her Muslim faith .
online posts suggested that she was " available " for sex .
although the technology is still developing in its sophistic@@ ation , it is widely available .
we tend to believe and to share information that 's negative and novel .
and you might say to me , " Come on , Dani@@ elle , that 's far @@@ -@@ @ fet@@ ched . "
there 's a deep@@ fake showing one of the major party candidates gravely sick .
the deep@@ fake could tip the election and shake our sense that elections are legitimate .
we 've heard politicians say of audio of their disturbing comments , " Come on , that 's fake news .
and it 's that risk that professor Robert Ch@@ es@@ ney and I call the " li@@ ar 's dividend " : the risk that li@@ ars will invoke deep@@ f@@ akes to escape accountability for their wrongdoing .
so we 've got our work cut out for us , there 's no doubt about it .
but we need human beings to look at the content and context of a deep@@ fake to figure out if it is a harmful im@@ person@@ ation or instead , if it 's valuable s@@ ati@@ re , art or education .
so we have a legal vacuum that needs to be filled .
we need far better radar for f@@ ak@@ ery .
everything we know about the universe , from the big ban@@ g that originated space and time , to the formation and evolution of stars and gal@@ ax@@ ies , to the structure of our own solar system , we fig@@ ured out studying images of the sky .
and to study a system as complex as the entire universe , astro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts are experts at ex@@ tracting simple models and solutions from large and complex data sets .
these collabor@@ ations between domain experts and astro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts created transform@@ ational solutions to help improve people 's quality of life .
I think there 's a study that says 91 percent of women , and likely those of all gender identities , are un@@ happy with the way they look .
but we 're still in@@ un@@ dated with unrealistic expectations .
so who are these designers designing for ?
I did@@ n 't start designing 10 years ago with the mission to change the entire industry .
but it actually was@@ n 't until recently that we were able to expand our size range in a major way .
nobody was interested .
having that investment helped us to change and real@@ ign our entire design process .
A@@ ha , is it in fact a real rock ? "
but when we hear information , this is what happens .
now , there are generally only two emotional states that a neuro@@ diverse brain can tab@@ ulate and keep count of at any given time , thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be emo@@ tionally , sometimes , att@@ un@@ ed to the present situation .
( la@@ ughter ) But of course , what is the ne@@ ural network that is helping to bridge and build these different discrepancies ?
( la@@ ughter ) Fear .
well yes , ice is a big part of it .
insights , compassion and em@@ pa@@ thy : I , C , E.
( appl@@ ause ) And when we start using this ice method , well , the possibilities become much bigger than us .
( la@@ ughter ) Will it meet all of us at the same time , I think , is the variable we are inqu@@ iring .
so that 's what I did .
( la@@ ughter ) And I would c@@ run@@ ch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain .
and when I finished hur@@ ting people a little bit , I would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ?
( la@@ ughter ) I kept on doing this for a while .
here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predic@@ tably all the time .
it turns out that because we don 't en@@ code duration in the way that we en@@ code intensity , I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower .
and from that point on I started thinking , are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision , or is it a more general case ?
people did this . I would pay people four dollars for their task -- on average people would solve four problems .
you would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases , people would che@@ at more , but in fact it was@@ n 't the case .
at one hand , we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves , so we don 't want to che@@ at .
we call this like a personal f@@ udge factor .
initially we said , what can we do to shr@@ ink the f@@ udge factor ?
now , this is not a good social science experiment , so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before .
a third of the people , when they finished sh@@ red@@ ding the piece of paper , they came to us and said , " Mr experi@@ men@@ ter , I solved X problems . give me X tok@@ ens . "
how bad would you feel about taking a pen@@ cil from work home , compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box ?
people see each other be@@ having .
we got a big group of students to be in the experiment , and we pre@@ paid them .
they che@@ at just by a little bit , all the same .
and the experi@@ men@@ ter said , " If you 've finished everything , go home .
that 's it . the task is finished . "
nobody knew it was an actor .
but when he actually had a University of Pit@@ ts@@ burgh swe@@ at@@ shirt , che@@ ating went down .
what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
of course they would .
so I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing band@@ ages .
she said , " Of course , you know , it was very painful for you .
and she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her .
thank you very much .
a lot of times people think that we 're fear@@ less , the people who do this , we 're fear@@ less .
I was like , " I 'm going to be a doctor ! "
and that same sem@@ ester , I started blog@@ ging .
and I was like , " You know what ?
I 'm not going to let fear dictate what I do . "
and for some odd reason , I had on business casual .
( la@@ ughter ) " What is wrong with me ? ! "
but then I looked down at the beauty , and I was like , " This is the best thing I could have done .
and I feel like every day that I 'm speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me , I feel like I 'm falling out of that plane .
my integrity is something I hold dear .
and I knew that if I spoke up about this publicly , I could face financial loss .
I 've got to sit at the edge of this plane , " maybe for two hours .
and it 's made millions of women join in and say , " Me To@@ o . "
thank you .
I had saved a few hundred photos of do@@ do sk@@ elet@@ ons into my " Creative Projects " folder -- it 's a repository for my brain , everything that I could possibly be interested in .
it 's exactly how I made my living for 15 years .
and again , I kept on going , looking for more reference , every bit of reference I could find -- drawings , beautiful photos .
as I moved through , I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Fal@@ con .
terri@@ fying guy -- agreed by many to be the kill@@ er of the Black Dah@@ lia .
but there 's a problem .
TV and V@@ HS brought sports and drama into our living rooms .
but with this amazing access , we allowed for a separation between creator and consumer , and the relationship between the two became much more one @@@ -@@ @ way .
so , Vienna in the 19@@ 00@@ s , was famous for its café culture .
and one of the big drivers of that café culture was expensive newspapers that were hard to get , and as a result , people would go to the café and read the shared copy there .
instead you 'd go to the local bar and che@@ er along with your fellow sports fans there .
but as the price of media continues to fall over time thanks to technology , this shared necessity that used to bring our communities together falls away .
they 're deeply complex , they 're more intellec@@ tually stimulating , and most of all , they 're intrin@@ sically social .
so it 's kind of like a " Pass the snack ! " situation , you know ?
can you explain that a little bit to us ?
what you 're seeing is a spam of " Hello , TED " good @@@ -@@ @ vi@@ be E@@ mo@@ tes , love E@@ mo@@ tes , " this is awesome , " " H@@ i , guys , " " H@@ i , everyone . "
( la@@ ughter ) " They get us through the rough patches in life . "
so I actually think that if you look out into the future -- only hundreds of people today get to be sports announ@@ cers .
but a week after the funeral , she looked at his picture and became te@@ ar@@ ful .
heart syn@@ dro@@ mes , including sudden death , have long been reported in individuals experiencing intense emotional disturbance or turmoil in their met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical hearts .

He@@ y , we have seen a lot of things happen in those 20 years .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) You know , people come to us and they say , " It 's too easy for you carto@@ onists . I mean -- with people like Trump ? "
these guys seem to be coming straight out of Carto@@ on Network .
and thanks to Facebook , we have a lot of friends all over the world .
they were jail@@ ed , they were fined , but they prevailed .
take this blank space on the front page of Turkish opposition newspaper " Cum@@ hu@@ ri@@ yet . "
for doing political carto@@ ons in Erdo@@ ğ@@ an 's Turkey .
then something happened .
in April 2019 , a cartoon by a famous Portuguese carto@@ on@@ ist , which was first published in a newspaper " El Ex@@ pres@@ so " in Lisbon , was picked by an editor at the " New York Times " and re@@ printed in the international editions .
it was denounced as anti @@@ -@@ @ Semitic , triggered widespread outra@@ ge , ap@@ ologies and a lot of damage control by the Times .
under attack , they took the easiest path : in order to not have problems with political carto@@ ons in the future , let 's not have any at all .
I think this is bigger than carto@@ ons .
even quality newspapers m@@ im@@ ic the codes of social networks on their websites .
but before all , they are meant to be thought @@@ -@@ @ provo@@ king .
just let it go .
and we need hum@@ or .
by the mid @@@ -@@ @ 20th century , the original four ca@@ stes associated with specific occupations had been divided into some 3000 sub @@@ -@@ @ ca@@ stes .

they also need nutrients from the soil .
and this is very important for how we think about food security going forward .
it 's associated with fatigue , short@@ ness of breath and some fairly serious consequences as well .
and when you have higher carbon in a plant , you have less nitrogen , and you have less B vitamins .
how do we know that this is a problem ?

Africans deserve this , and with one of every four people in the world projected to be African by the year 2100 , the planet needs it .
it 's a process that takes ration@@ ality almost to an absurd level , and it trans@@ cen@@ ds all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call , sort of a rational conclusion to something .
the second -- the second is that this process does not have a signature .

with high modern@@ ist flexibility , that do@@ es@@ n 't really work .

it 's literally built in a very inexpensive way -- it is a parking garage for books .
( la@@ ughter ) And so this was the final operation , which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kil@@ ter , and to hold onto them with a skin .
so now I 'm going to take you on a tour of the building .
this is actually a program that we invented with the library .
there are plenty of shopping m@@ alls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle , but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain .
so this was an un@@ programmed area where people could pretty much do anything , including eat , y@@ ell , play chess and so forth .
but let 's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral , because I think it 's , as I said , the most -- this is the main reading room -- the most unique part of the building .
now this is the D@@ all@@ as Theater .
it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere , wherever you place it , the area under it is charged for theat@@ rical performances .
and it allowed us to go back to first principles , and re@@ define fly tower , acoustic enclosure , light enclosure and so forth .
and then it also provides them , in the off @@@ -@@ @ season , the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things .

formal lingu@@ istics is a relatively young field , more or less .
and if you speak a language , that means you have just as much right to talk about its function as anybody else .
" studying foreign languages in school is a waste of time , compared to other things that you could be doing in school . "
but the implication is that language is only a tool , and this is absolutely false .
now , here 's that same picture with a lot fewer pixels .
and losing even one language makes that picture a lot less clear .
this is a guy who got all bent out of shape that there was a con@@ lan@@ g in James Cam@@ eron 's " Av@@ atar . "
and what we do with literature , authors create new , entire beings and hi@@ stories .
( la@@ ughter ) Ess@@ entially , this is just a pu@@ ff piece , but whatever .
here 's a sentence that they will probably never use for communication in their entire lives : " V@@ ala ā@@ bre Ur@@ nes . "
the little middle line is the gl@@ oss , so it 's word for word , that 's what it says .
when I get into court , the cler@@ ks who were assigned to my sister 's case informed her that they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be able to process the paper@@ work unless she paid a bri@@ be .
you know , most people who engage in corruption know they shou@@ ld@@ n 't .
when you looked at South Korea 's institutions , even as late as the 1980s , they were on par with some of the poorest and most corrupt African countries at the time .
we need to build a weather service for water .
the first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED , eight years ago .
and , like too many 20 @@@ -@@ @ som@@ eth@@ ings , I expected to solve the world 's problems -- more specifically , the world 's water problems -- with my technology .
now , that 's faster than most nations tab@@ ulate their national water data , including the US .
so this is how most countries are managing pollution .
what you might not be aware of is that the US Department of Defense is the world 's largest consumer of jet fuel .
so are we doomed ?
aside from venture capital , there are also lots of promising government programs that encourage economic development through tax incentives .
you can assign the perpe@@ tual right to a local land trust to conserve your land and set specific water quality goals .
during that time , I worked at Los Al@@ am@@ os National La@@ b in the theoretical biology and bi@@ ophy@@ sics group .
and I wanted this to be my career path .
c@@ assa@@ va is a plant whose leaves and roots feed 800 million people globally .
and 500 million in East Africa .
they cost upwards of a million dollars ; they require constant power and specialized human capacity .
the crop is already gone , which results in further poverty and more hunger .
this person even went so far as to bet us two of the best bottles of champ@@ agne that we would never get that to work .
well , first of all , we gave ourselves a team name -- it 's called the C@@ assa@@ va Vir@@ us Action Project .
we fig@@ ured if we could get the data closer to the problem , and closer to the farmer , the quicker we could tell her what was wrong with her plant .
but with this machine , we 've been able to do it in 20 minutes , at a fraction of the cost .
analyzing the data quickly can also be a problem .
she had enough to feed her family and she was selling it at the market , and she 's now building a house for her family .
so , artificial intelligence is known for disrup@@ ting all kinds of industries .
or it will figure out how to move faster by gl@@ it@@ ching repeatedly into the floor .
so here 's an experiment I did , where I wanted the AI to copy paint colors , to inv@@ ent new paint colors , given the list like the ones here on the left .
yes , those are human fingers .
so in other words , we have to be prepared to work with AI that 's not the super @@@ -@@ @ competent , all @@@ -@@ @ knowing AI of science fiction .
none of these varieties are indigenous .
in fact , almost all of our fruit trees were brought here , including apples and pe@@ aches and cher@@ ries .
it 's a b@@ oun@@ ty or a multitude .
they produce fruit from June through September .
the Defense Advanced Research Project Administration invited me to come talk about innovation and creativity , and it 's a conversation that quickly shifted to a discussion of food security .
and finding out how rare they were , I became obs@@ essed with trying to preserve them , and the vehicle for this became art .
I would go into old , vin@@ tage or@@ ch@@ ards before they were torn out and I would save the bow@@ l or the trunk section that possessed the original gra@@ ft union .
and you realize that there is incredible power in the wind , and it can do amazing things .
but k@@ ites are@@ n 't just toys like this .
so cut to now . we still have an energy crisis , and now we have a climate crisis as well . you know , so humans generate about 12 trillion wat@@ ts , or 12 ter@@ aw@@ at@@ ts , from fossil fuels .
this is our test site on Mau@@ i , flying across the sky .
as you can tell , you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours .
so we 're beyond the 12 @@@ -@@ @ second steps .
when it comes to detailing family history , in every family , we have this person that is obs@@ essed with gene@@ alog@@ y .
in the middle of this tree , you see the ancestors .
Alexander was the first US Secretary of the Treasury , but mostly known today due to a popular Broad@@ way musical .
previous studies analyzed the correlation of longevity between tw@@ ins to address this question .
large family trees give us the opportunity to analyze both close relatives , such as tw@@ ins , all the way to distant relatives , even fourth cou@@ sins .
they did that , and they found a third cous@@ in of the Golden State K@@ iller .
and you 've probably already mu@@ ted them on Facebook for sharing social posts like this one .
and the social share message above it simply says , " Please forward to save lives . "
and besides , many of these companies , their business model is attached to attention , which means these algorithms will always be ske@@ wed towards emo@@ tion .
and my concern is that we 're seeing governments right around the world rolling out ha@@ sty policy decisions that might actually trigger much more serious consequences when it comes to our speech .
every second , millions of pieces of content are uploaded by people right around the world in different languages , drawing on thousands of different cultural contexts .
I know we 're all looking for an easy fix .
so yes , these companies have to play a really important role in this process , but they can 't control it .
they could provide feedback when platforms decide they want to roll out new changes .
so could we imagine developing some kind of centralized open repository for anonym@@ ized data , with privacy and ethical concerns built in ?
and what we do know , most of that has been carried out in the US , despite the fact that this is a global problem .
but there are very smart people right around the world working on these challenges , from news@@ rooms , civil society , academia , activist groups .
all of these efforts are wonderful , but they 're working in si@@ los , and many of them are wo@@ efully under@@ funded .
though the journey was far from easy , the b@@ ard finally made it back to Kal@@ eval@@ a .

you have a good time at the party .
( la@@ ughter ) And I was like , " OK , so , there 's your problem . "
if the difficulty is just a lack of spontaneous desire for party , you know what to do : you put on your party clothes and show up for the party .
so I bring together the materials I find around me , I gather them to try and create experiences , immer@@ sive experiences that occupy rooms , that occupy walls , landscapes , buildings .
so I brought my desk and I put it in the room , and it actually worked in this kind of very surprising way to me , in that it was this kind of fl@@ ick@@ ering , because of the video screens , from af@@ ar .
how can an installation use the camera 's lens to frame a landscape ?
when my doctor asked what I do and I told him , he thought I meant organizing , like , Marie Kon@@ do @@@ -@@ @ style .

now , that surprised me at first .
we all need to be shaping and participating in the future of work .

I was with my friend Sus@@ an Me@@ is@@ el@@ as , the photographer , in the Ma@@ th@@ are Valley slums .
four sleep in one twin bed , and three sleep on the mud and lin@@ ol@@ eum floor .
and I would see kids on the street corners , and they 'd say " Obama , he 's our brother ! "
and it was here that I met J@@ ane .
she started off by telling me her dream . she said , " I had two .
she would go into the city at night with about 20 girls , look for work , and sometimes come back with a few sh@@ ill@@ ings , or sometimes with nothing .
and so she can 't move out .
Jam@@ ii Bor@@ a understands that and understands that when we 're talking about poverty , we 've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum .
and then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little sh@@ an@@ ty .
and she said , " What would I miss ?
but maybe me , I give out something better because I give them hope . "
it 's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings , so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves .
we 're so lucky to have you here with us .
I actually think we should be increasing it .
I believe the first thing -- we should have done this months ago -- is select a special representative for the Northern Tri@@ angle .
we don 't know of a pat@@ ron or a family member in the United States , and we should make sure that they 're in facilities where they 're able to go to school and have proper food and health care .
that 's the other issue here .
Wh : I would agree with your premise .
when you have -- let 's start with the economic benefits .
when it comes to the drug issue you 're talking about , yes , it 's in our ports of entry , but it 's also coming in to our shores .
and one of the things I 've seen you say repeatedly is to talk about how we are all united .
he@@ dge needs specific instructions though .
so what instructions will allow H@@ edge to efficiently open any door ?
the lock has 100 positions , so Eth@@ ic could say " Check the dial 's color , then spin the dial forward once , for 100 repeti@@ tions .
so why care about the history of our planet when the distant past seems so in@@ consequential to everyday life ?
here again is that ancient volcanic landscape in the Pil@@ bara .
it took six months before we inspected this rock under a micro@@ scope , when one of my ment@@ ors at the time , Mal@@ col@@ m Walter , suggested the rock resem@@ bled ge@@ y@@ ser@@ ite .
but 100 years after Dar@@ win 's letter , deep @@@ -@@ @ sea hydro@@ thermal ven@@ ts , or hot ven@@ ts , were discovered in the ocean .
and this is for good reason : deep @@@ -@@ @ sea ven@@ ts are well @@@ -@@ @ known in the ancient rock record , and it 's thought that the early Earth had a global ocean and very little land surface .
at about 2.5 billion years ago , there is evidence that bacteria had begun to produce oxygen , kind of like plants do today .
you see , life needs oxygen to get big and complex .
today , we humans di@@ g up f@@ os@@ sil@@ ized complex life and burn it for fuel .
that was the case for me with C@@ ec@@ il the lion , having known him and studied him for three years in H@@ wan@@ ge National Park .
what if I had met C@@ ec@@ il when I was 10 years old , instead of 29 ?
could I or my class@@ mates have changed his fate ?
but the communities that live with the lions are the ones best positioned to help lions the most .
sometimes , change can only come when the people most affected and impacted take charge .
local communities play an important role in fighting po@@ aching and illegal wildlife trade , which are major threats affecting lions and other wildlife .
I felt like I had found my passion and my purpose in life .
I think of my childhood school days in Zimbabwe and the other kids I was in school with .
as local conserv@@ ation@@ ists , we face many hur@@ dles , from outright discrimination to barriers because of cultural norms .
compl@@ icating matters further , there are countless variables that contribute to an economy 's health , making it difficult to pin@@ point specific causes .
I also feared that this investment would be in vain .
no , this taste difference was a product of my husband 's own mind .
molecules in the liquid are detected by recep@@ tors in my mouth , and categorized as one of five basic tastes .
( la@@ ughter ) And ye@@ ah , we can even be biased about the bi@@ ases that we 're biased about .
why ?
so taste and smell and other sen@@ sory information is inextricably ent@@ ang@@ led in our conscious mind .
the key is to remove the barrier of the conscious mind and instead target the information in the brain directly .
and it turns out our brain holds a lot of fascinating secrets .
and my brain will also act on all this sen@@ sory information .
this is what college kids are more likely to have . it 's the most popular VO@@ IP service in the world : it 's Skype .
but nonetheless , if you 're a college k@@ id and you have no money , believe me , this is better than trying to use your cell phone .
ever since that J@@ ay@@ son Bla@@ ir jer@@ k ru@@ ined it for all of us .
" hi , we have an announcement to -- W@@ ah ! ! ! "
and when you 're out of the hot@@ spot , you 're on the regular cellular network .
they don 't have that kind of money . instead they give each of us a seven @@@ -@@ @ dollar @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ 95 @@@ -@@ @ cent box . they 're like a ste@@ alth tower installation program .
this is me with a cam@@ c@@ order on a phone going like this .
it just changed to the cellular tower in mid @@@ -@@ @ call .
on the Internet nobody knows you 're a dog , right ? nobody knows you 're in Pakistan .
excuse me one second .
Oh . where are you calling from ?
all right . r@@ inger off . everyone wants in on the action .
and then your wife calls , and , " H@@ i honey , leave me a message . "
they 're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method .
anyway , so lets say you need a dru@@ g@@ store near Chicago .
Google : say the business and the city and state .
( la@@ ughter ) So I thought I 'd see how that goes .
I 'm going to have a sand@@ wich for lunch .
these programs can use all the components of the iPhone -- the touch screen .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , for seven bl@@ iss@@ ful hours it was the number one video on YouTube .
I 'm sick to death of this old cell phone .
I want an iPhone .
I want to touch its precious screen .
and since then , drug @@@ -@@ @ resistant bacteria have continued to emerge , and so we 've been forced to develop newer and newer drugs to fight these new bacteria .
10 million .
just to put that in context , that 's actually more than the number of people that died of cancer worldwide last year .
so it seems pretty clear that we 're not on a good road , and the drugs @@@ -@@ @ based approach to this problem is not working .
we 've actually known this for more than 100 years .
so what you 're seeing now is that again , far @@@ -@@ @ U@@ VC light 's perfectly fine at killing bacteria , but what far @@@ -@@ @ U@@ VC light can 't do is penetrate into our skin .
what about in practice ?
yes , it does work , but yes , it is safe .
so those studies are pretty well done at this point .
but what I find really special is -- and this often shocks a lot of people -- is that the average age of a gam@@ er , like , have a guess , think about it .
something changed in the way that this medium is organized .
I 'll put that in perspective for a moment .
you know , individual , as was said earlier today , cam@@ p@@ fires or cou@@ ches .
well it 's more that you 've played on a t@@ read@@ mill .
every single object you see here is simulated in some way .
this is a group of people , pione@@ ers in Berlin , a group called K@@ lan@@ g Games , and they 're completely in@@ san@@ e , and they 'll love me for saying that .
I love her to bits , but every story she has begins in 1940 and ends some@@ time in 1950 .
a sense of , I think , how we need to face this new opportunity a little differently to some we have in the past .
and the reality is , this is going to have down@@ sides .
so , my final plea is really to those engineers , those scientists , those artists in the audience today .
maybe some of you dre@@ amed of working on space travel .
there are still huge technological frontiers that need to be overcome here , ak@@ in to those we faced when building the early internet .
thank you .
the subsequent power struggle led to a Civil War , which split the country in two .
he even built a massive Cit@@ ade@@ l in case the French tried to inv@@ ade again .

but they we@@ ren 't satisfied when their own -- it would make the teacher feel that they had failed , or the youn@@ g@@ ster had failed .
I thought that might help .
and that gives you a great deal of pleasure , to see them go on .
that 's my job . I 'm paid to do it . pi@@ ti@@ fully poor , but I am paid to do it .
I believe that we must believe , truly believe .
Cer@@ van@@ tes said , " The journey is better than the end . "
sometimes when you get there , there 's almost a let down .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'd want them to be able to re@@ bound well at both ends , too .
and certainly , this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it , HIV .
OK , so this is a picture , and I 'm going to show you some pictures now from the field .
needless to say , different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact .
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible a@@ we for us .
it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves .
I 'm going tell you right now : please don 't despair .
( la@@ ughter ) You just saw a baptism , yes ?
I was sk@@ in@@ ny ...
it was our mission to serve people .
we call it outreach now , but it 's always been a part of who we were and still are , 60 years later , to this day .
being inclusive of our audiences -- it 's always been an important part of the company .
( la@@ ughter ) But it was our African Americ@@ ann@@ ess that they were interested in , and the culture that we had developed over the last 400 years .
we did@@ n 't have to talk about things so much , because we understood implicitly our shared responsibilities .
she 's exhausted , she 's a que@@ en , and in this section , you 're going to see she is trium@@ phant .
well , they reproduce it , but the origin@@ als are all done by hand .
and they put that same kind of tension into the sculp@@ ting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum .
that was 100 years right there -- did you catch that ?
and it 's done by men and women working just like this , making cars .
now , now I get to the point . I want to talk about cars as art .
art , in the Plat@@ onic sense , is truth ; it 's beauty , and love .
we don 't really have a problem talking about love .
and we 're kind of the female side to that . that 's OK , that 's cool . you go off and be man@@ ly . we 're going to be a little bit more female .
I think this one here , there 's a pop song that really describes Philippe Star@@ ck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like pu@@ pp@@ y love , you know , this is cool right ?
the idea of people @@@ -@@ @ work is what we work with here , and I have to make a bond with my designers when we 're creating B@@ MW@@ s .
you 've got to do cars in the rain ; you 've got to do cars in the snow .
this is one of my favorite paintings , it really describes our relationship with cars .
I heard today about Joseph 's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .
we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for B@@ MW .
we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it , that I only had a phone number that connected me to them .
so , what we did was : instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wr@@ ist , we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what 's the successor to the SU@@ V phenomenon in America .
hopefully , really understand the customer at its heart , where the customer is , live with them in America . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
and one of the young women in the project , she was a fantastic lady , she actually built her room in the bathroom .
the bathroom was so big , she built the bed over the bathtub -- it 's quite fascinating .
so my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I was@@ n 't up to speed on where these guys were .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in Ti@@ bur@@ on , which is just up the road from here -- you know Ti@@ bur@@ on ?
the engineers flew over , and designers got together with them , and they put their presentation together .
and the engineers told the designers , " If you go in with all your stuff , we 'll walk out , we 'll walk right out of the project . "
so I did@@ n 't know any of this , and we got a presentation that had an agenda , looked like this .
I scre@@ amed at them , I y@@ elled at them , " What the hell are you doing ?
you 're letting me down , you 're my designers , you 're supposed to be the creative ones , what the hell is going on around here ? "
so we went to lunch -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) And I 've got to tell you , this was one seriously quiet lunch .
and I recalled that when Catherine and I were married , the priest gave a very nice ser@@ mon , and he said something very important .
there 's a lot to be said about trust and love , if you know that those two words are synony@@ mous for design .
and , very surprisingly , over half of them had , actually , something to do with design .
it 's a happy David By@@ r@@ ne and an angry David By@@ r@@ ne .
you know , that 's not a big deal to accomplish .
this is at P.@@ S. 1 -- a sculpture that 's basically a square room by James Tur@@ rel@@ l , that has a re@@ tractable ceiling .
you don 't see the horizon .
he 's from Korea originally .
( la@@ ughter ) And other people go and fill them in .
this is , you know , related to it : getting out of the studio .
so I just picked another one .
then it 's : " gu@@ ts . "
I thought I would read po@@ ems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age .
I know now her life was hard ; she lost three children as babies , then her husband died too , leaving young sons , and no money .
the street she lived on was un@@ paved , her flat , two cra@@ mp@@ ed rooms and a fe@@ ti@@ d kitchen where she stal@@ ked and caught me .
" you have mal@@ igned a great woman . "
it 's a longer po@@ em .
my seeing her , it was@@ n 't her , at the mailbox .
" thir@@ st . "
but I 'm afraid that R@@ ick@@ y will come out here and shake his f@@ ist at me .
God knows though , there are worse t@@ wi@@ sts your ob@@ sessions can take .
because in the long run , I think there is no reason , no practical reason for newspapers to survive .
my approach was very eg@@ oti@@ stic .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
you can work for a small company , in a b@@ oring branch .
par@@ ag@@ li@@ ding is taking off from mountains with a par@@ ag@@ li@@ der , with the possibility to fly cross @@@ -@@ @ country , distance , just with the use of therm@@ als to so@@ ar .
so for 2009 , I 'm training hard for my two new projects .
so now , on the following movie you will see that I 'm much better in flying a w@@ ing@@ suit than speaking in English .
enjoy , and thank you very much .
I think we all might have some questions .
JC : all right . well we will watch this space . but I have two more questions .
do people come to you with projects and say , " We want you to do this ! "
in that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight , modern , fu@@ tur@@ istic , high @@@ -@@ @ tech po@@ d for hur@@ t@@ ling down the free@@ way , and the inter@@ iors were completely out of syn@@ c with that .
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer , moc@@ ked it up in card@@ board , we 'd come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
that 's the trailer , pretty much finished .
I thought , " Fin@@ ally , oh ye@@ ah great , big company , I 'm g@@ onn@@ a work with somebody with money for to@@ oling and mol@@ ding . "
they did@@ n 't want to go to a compon@@ enti@@ zed system .
that soldier had been on top of the bomb .
and he apolog@@ ized for not being able to bring them home .
what we 're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage .
we now have 5,@@ 300 .
we went in with zero unmanned ground systems . we now have 12,000 .
that 's where we 're at right now .
and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like Com@@ ic @@@ -@@ @ C@@ on have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the Pent@@ agon .
a robots revolution is upon us .
and this raises a bigger worry for me .
or another way of thinking about this is , what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India ?
that raises another wr@@ ink@@ le when it comes to war and conflict . good guys might play around and work on these as hob@@ by kits , but so might bad guys .
we don 't have a draft . we don 't have declarations of war anymore .
they also record everything that they see .
now , this could be a good thing .
but we have to remember , these are just the clips .
what is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message .
as anyone who 's played Grand The@@ ft Auto knows , we do things in the video world that we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't do face to face .
and so you have this question : what does this lead to issues like war crimes ? robots are emo@@ tion@@ less , so they don 't get upset if their bud@@ dy is killed .
are we going to face the reality of 21st century war ?
and so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil , but for me it points to the fact that there 's a du@@ ality of humans as well .
and now , we 're using our creativity in a certain direction , to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities , maybe even one day an entirely new species .
I am not a " scientist , " I don 't have " facts . "
you could order it -- come in the mail .
and I was in charge of the video camera every time we went on vac@@ ations , so I would collect all these videos and had nothing to do with it .
thus , the Sim@@ a Video E@@ d / it 2 .
they cried .
and cried .
I remember as the youngest of these five kids feeling heard for the first time .
I was like , " Y@@ ea@@ h right , guys . "
( la@@ ughter ) Al@@ ways listen to your parents .
( la@@ ughter ) I wanted to be Z@@ em@@ ec@@ k@@ is , Luc@@ as and Spi@@ el@@ berg .
the last thing I wanted to talk about was my own cultural identity , my ethnicity .
cut to 15 years later , I made it in Hollywood .
I even came to the TED stage to present my dance company L@@ X@@ D , and it was great .
the engine was going down a little bit , and I got a sign ...
I heard from voices from the sky ...
OK , fine , it was Twitter .
I thought these things but never really registered -- I was really focused on -- and I felt lucky to be working , and so then I realized -- ye@@ ah , what is wrong with Hollywood ?
and then I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I am Hollywood .
also , some tech founders out here started to post stuff on social media , write stuff about us in articles in the " LA Times , " in " The Hollywood Re@@ porter " and " Entertainment Week@@ ly . "
what an amazing thing to witness .
and this conversation stream became an infrastructure .
it took all these different groups that were trying to achieve the same thing and put us all together in this connec@@ tive tissue .
and again , not perfect , but the start of how we determine our own representation on the big screen .
it became more physical when I went to the movie theater .
they just h@@ ug@@ ged each other , high @@@ -@@ @ fi@@ ved each other , took sel@@ fies , they debated it , they laugh@@ ed about it .
film was a gift given to me , and through the years I 've learned a lot of things .
love is the only thing that can stop a speeding bullet before it even exits the chamber .
so I have a challenge for myself and for anyone here .
thank you .
my phone was ringing , I picked it up .
Re@@ bec@@ ca was 31 years old when she died .
she had an eight @@@ -@@ @ year struggle with breast cancer .
the scientific community failed her .
so we need a change because , clearly , what we 've been doing so far has not been working .
over 99 percent of cancer drugs never make it to the tumor because they lack transportation and tools to take them to the location they 're aiming for .
( la@@ ughter ) So we need a fire truck to get to the right location .
now , I have very thin hair , so my hair is approximately 40,000 nan@@ ometers in diameter .
cancer drugs without nan@@ op@@ articles are quickly washed out of the body through the kid@@ neys because they 're so small .
they 're circulating in the blood , but they 're quickly washed out of the body and they don 't really end up inside the tumor .
but if we put these cancer drugs inside nan@@ op@@ articles , they will not get washed out by the body because the nan@@ op@@ articles are too big .
there are certain very important but sensitive drugs that are easily degraded by enzy@@ mes in the blood .
and here we see an illustration where the kidney is no longer a problem , but these fire trucks , the nan@@ op@@ articles , get stuck in the liver and , actually , less of them end up reaching the tumor .
and here we see the illustration of blocking the liver .
and we can collect them from the body and use them as fire trucks for cancer drugs .
and in this case , the immune cells in the liver are less likely to eat the biological nan@@ op@@ articles .
and in the future , we want to exploit nature 's own nan@@ op@@ articles for cancer drug delivery , to reduce side effects and save lives by preventing the cancer drugs from being in the wrong location .
however , a major problem has been : how do we isolate these biological nan@@ op@@ articles in large quantities without damaging them ?
and these nan@@ op@@ articles are not yet in clinical use , because it takes an average of 12 years to get something from the lab to your medicine cabinet .
and we keep going , thanks to inspiration from patients .
they don 't come back several times , so it really chron@@ ic@@ les a journey .
and that ends with a little cli@@ p of my father , of L@@ ou , talking about something that is very dear to him , which is the accidents of life .
he built the capital over there .
we were the first film crew in there .
it is the capital of the country , and it took 23 years to build , which is something they seem to be very proud of over there .
it took as long as the Ta@@ j Mah@@ al .
think about that when you see that building , that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished .
roll that tape .
you know he 'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nom@@ ad in him .
Louis Ka@@ hn : how accidental our exi@@ st@@ ences are really and how full of influence by circumstance .
man : yes , it is the national image of Bangladesh .
man : very pleased to welcome you back .
NK : thank you .
no , he never saw this .
he is not a political man , but in this gu@@ ise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
you see , only that way you can be able to understand him .
there is no other short@@ cut , no other way to really understand him .
he had an enormous amount of love , he loved everybody .
in 2003 , when we sequ@@ enced the human gen@@ ome , we thought we would have the answer to treat many diseases .
so sequ@@ encing DNA alone do@@ es@@ n 't give us enough information to find effective therap@@ eu@@ tics .
on the bright side , there are many other molecules in our body .
despite that , 15 years ago , I left medical school , as I missed mathematics .
since then , I 've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data .
for some metabol@@ ites , we can measure their molecular mass using mass spec@@ tro@@ metry instruments .
it then mined that me@@ gan@@ et@@ work to find how those metabol@@ ic masses are connected to each other that result in disease .
in fact , every two minutes , a child under the age of two dies from malaria .
OK , now I want you to do it again , but this time , I want you to do it just through your nose , and I want you to really sense the environment around you .
even if you don 't know them , I don 't care .
now we 'd need to develop good sensors that would allow us to do this , but it turns out that the world 's best sensors actually already exist , and they 're called animals .
it would be really nice if there was just one chemical that they detected , but it 's not that simple .
well , smell is the same .
it 's made up of a suite of chemicals in the right combination .
( la@@ ughter ) But what we also do is connect them to individual cells within the anten@@ na@@ e , which is incredible .
so I 'm going to show you what this looks like .
but there is an animal that we can do that with .
now , they do say never work with children or animals live , but we 're going to break that rule today .
( appl@@ ause ) and her trainers Mark and Sarah .
she 's having a good look at you guys now .
now three of the s@@ ocks have been worn by children who were un@@ infected , and just one of the s@@ ocks was worn by a child who was infected with malaria .
this was a blind test , genuinely . Sarah , was that correct ?
and this is a tough test .
fantastic .
I 'm so glad that it worked .
or something a little more technical , perhaps : a s@@ mar@@ tw@@ at@@ ch that would alert you when you 're infected with malaria .
you know where it 's going .
( appl@@ ause ) I was told the story that Moz@@ art , just before he 'd go to bed , he 'd go to the piano and go , " da @@@ -@@ @ da @@@ -@@ @ da @@@ -@@ @ da @@@ -@@ @ da . "
his father , who was already in bed , would think , " Ar@@ gh . "
he 'd have to get up and hit the final note to the ch@@ ord before he could go back to sleep .
we hate uncertainty .
think about horror films .
horror films are always shot in the dark , in the forest , at night , in the depths of the sea , the black@@ ness of space .
and if you cou@@ ld@@ n 't predict , you died .
there is no bird there .
and what 's true for objects is true for other people .
we often go from fear to anger , almost too often .
you become morally judg@@ mental .
because you go to a place of famili@@ arity .
the problem is that the world changes .
and we have to adapt or die .
right ?
it 's becoming asym@@ metrical in its activity , biased towards the right , which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world , as opposed to step back .
so what does this brain state do ?
they 're more comfortable with uncertainty without having closure .
you 're trying to prove that I 'm wrong and shift me towards you .
one , to give us the hum@@ ility and courage to not know .
to enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty .
so where can we find a@@ we , given how important it is ?
a suggestion : that a@@ we is not just to be found in the gran@@ de@@ ur .
( appl@@ ause ) Please , come up .
I know what it 's like to leave a country on six hours ' notice and land on someone 's cou@@ ch .
because of that , I wrote a book on why countries do well and why they don 't .
that those people are nasty , those people are criminals , those people are ra@@ pi@@ sts .
part of the problem from creating us versus them is it 's hard to do .
these kids , these parents , they don 't get lawyers .
the judge is up there , Judge M@@ uc@@ ke@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ m@@ uck , with his black rob@@ es , and he 's questioning the defendant from up there .
this is happening to the guy who washed the dishes in the fancy restaurant you went to last week .
this is@@ n 't about kids and borders .
so next time you 're with a cab driver who may be one of " Th@@ em , " according to certain people , give that person an extra five buc@@ ks .
thank you .
in order to look out for what 's best for them or what they think is best for them , people have values -- they identify what they want , and what they don 't want .
mother The@@ res@@ a , she was rational .
pretty much everybody is rational .
now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests , we have to think about who has influence in the world .
unfortunately , a lot of times we don 't do that .
imagine a problem with just five decision @@@ -@@ @ makers .
with five decision @@@ -@@ @ makers there are a lot of linkages -- 120 , as a matter of fact , if you remember your fac@@ tor@@ ials .
five fac@@ torial is 120 .
does that mean we 've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know , from 120 to 240 ?
to 1,200 ? no .
we 've increased it to 3.6 million .
they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information .
that 's not my claim , that 's a CIA claim -- you can read it , it was decl@@ assi@@ fied a while ago . you can read it in a volume edited by H. Bra@@ d@@ ford We@@ ster@@ field , Y@@ ale University Press .
we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision .
so where are we going to get this information ?
and everybody 's best friend , Ahmad@@ ine@@ jad . how are things going for him ?
the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions , under its own domestic political pressures .
but in any event , by the end of this year , beginning of next year , we get to a stable equilibrium outcome .
these guys are all shrinking , the power is all dri@@ fting out here , so the outcome is going to be the weapons @@@ -@@ @ grade fuel .
these fol@@ ks are the mone@@ yed interests in Iran , the bankers , the oil people , the ba@@ z@@ a@@ aries .
OK , so I 'd like you to take a little away from this .
it would ha@@ sten how quickly people arrive at an agreement , and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time .
so De@@ tro@@ it has this -- open land , fertile soil , proximity to water , willing labor and a desperate demand for healthy , fresh food .
in De@@ tro@@ it , we have over 1,500 , yes , 1,500 gardens and farms located all across the city today .
O@@ ak@@ land Avenue F@@ arms is located in De@@ tro@@ it 's North End neighborhood .
and then afterwards , they 're treated to a farm @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ table meal prepared by a ch@@ ef who show@@ cases all the produce on the farm right at the peak of its fres@@ hness .
now , what was a no@@ torious , unsafe , under@@ served community has transformed into a welcoming , beautiful , safe F@@ arm@@ way , l@@ ush with parks and gardens and farms and green@@ houses .
and when their product is sold all over the city of De@@ tro@@ it in local markets , they get a hundred percent of the proceeds from the sale .
my city is a long way from succeeding .
and yes , I know , these stories are small , these stories are neighborhood @@@ -@@ @ based stories , but these stories are powerful .
they held on to hope .
they never gave up .
they always kept fighting .
when I was little , my sister and I would have contests to see who could spell " M @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ p @@@ -@@ @ p @@@ -@@ @ i " the fastest .
during that five @@@ -@@ @ year period , I got to know the Mississippi River .
let 's take a look .
what was more surprising is that the ones with the highest increases were found on the east part of the United States , and not the arid southwest .
these membran@@ es are based under the principle of reverse os@@ mo@@ sis .
and separating the two chambers is the sem@@ i@@ perme@@ able membrane .
and under the natural os@@ mo@@ sis process , what happens is the water naturally transports across that membrane from the area of low salt concentration to the area of high salt concentration , until an equilibrium is met .
now , this five percent concentrated sal@@ ty mixture is not waste .
now , I 've introduced this to a number of industrial @@@ -@@ @ water users , and the common response is , " Y@@ ea@@ h , but who is going to use my salt ? "
so who are these salt consumers ?
that 's one million tons of salt mined from the earth , applied to our roads , and then it wash@@ es off into the environment and into our rivers .
so that 's five million tons of salt mined from the earth converted through the ch@@ lor @@@ -@@ @ alk@@ ali process into prop@@ ylene oxide , and then during that process , five million tons of salt that ends up in wastewater streams .
you can ask the residents of Cape Town , South Africa , who experienced a year @@@ -@@ @ over @@@ -@@ @ year drought drying up their water reserves , and then being asked not to fl@@ ush their toilets .
this pes@@ sim@@ ism fam@@ ously appears in the Bible , in one of the few bi@@ blical passages with a named author .
he wrote , " What has been is what will be , and what has been done is what will be done ; there is nothing new under the sun .
because stati@@ city is@@ n 't just frustr@@ ating .
but it was@@ n 't true .
presumably , there are some more in lif@@ eless locations , but on Earth , evolution created billions of different chemicals .
well , the universe at large is relatively simple .
if one can speak of a cosmic war , it 's not the one portra@@ yed in those p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic stories .
frankly , it do@@ es@@ n 't matter to me whether you 're a Republican or a Democ@@ rat , liberal or conservative .
it should be protecting them , no matter whose children they are : your children , my grand@@ children and the children of families just looking for asylum .
( la@@ ughter ) " And they drink beer . "
I could tell you story after story , but I haven 't forgotten Fernan@@ do .
so I 'm going to get clinical with you for a moment , and I 'm going to be the professor that I am .
what should our government do ?
parents are given work permits so they can earn some money , they 're given food vouchers so they can go to the local stores and shop .
that virus , like the one from Peru , was eventually traced back to b@@ ats , which have probably har@@ bo@@ red it , un@@ detected , for centuries .
so can we anticipate pan@@ dem@@ ics ?
can we stop them ?
and rab@@ ies is not just a problem of the past either .
but then , you multiply it by four , and that 's what happens with rab@@ ies every single year .
but it also means that those jum@@ ps between species , which are so important to understand , but so rare for most viruses , for rab@@ ies , they 're actually happening by the thousands .
so if we could somehow anticipate when and where the next outbreak would be , that would be a real opportunity , meaning we could vacc@@ inate people ahead of time , before anybody starts dying .
so with that , we solved one key part of the rab@@ ies transmission challenge .
well , the obvious short @@@ -@@ @ term thing we can do is tell people : you need to vacc@@ inate yourselves , vacc@@ inate your animals ; rab@@ ies is coming .
so , can we vacc@@ inate b@@ ats ?
it might sound like a crazy question , but the good news is that we actually already have edi@@ ble rab@@ ies vaccines that are specially designed for b@@ ats .
now we have a whole laundry list of questions .
since the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , or ISIS , this group has systematically attacked and tortured many religious minorities and ethn@@ icities , such as the Christians , the Sh@@ ia Turkmen , Sh@@ ia Muslims , Sh@@ ia Shaba@@ ks and the Y@@ az@@ id@@ is .
they divided up the women and girls , raped them and sold them into sexual and domestic slavery .
their belief system incorporates aspects of Judaism , Christianity , Islam and Z@@ or@@ o@@ a@@ stri@@ anism .
an im@@ am was present who made it clear that their religion was wrong , and the only good path was to accept Islam and marry a Muslim man .
both were telling the other girls that the two girls should enjoy the experience instead of scre@@ aming .
she was beaten and raped every two days .
she was willing to speak to me because she had heard from other victims that there was a woman from the UN who understood her complicated culture .
I looked into her eyes and listened deeply to the stories of her dar@@ k@@ est hours .
these women and girls are healing .
when I think about the survivors I work with , I remember the words of an Egyptian doctor , writer and human rights activist , N@@ aw@@ al El Sa@@ ad@@ awi .
in her book , " Woman at Point Zero , " she wrote , " Life is very hard , and the only people who really live are those who are harder than life itself . "
because I share their sorrow , their language and their culture , we connect on the deepest human level .
this itself is an act of healing : to be heard , to be seen , to be given compassion instead of condemnation .
when I meet the survivors of these mass atrocities , when I hold their hands and look in their eyes , it does not er@@ ase my own pain , but it does make it almost worthwhile .
" dear Ther@@ ap@@ ist , I 've been married for 10 years and things were good until a couple of years ago .
( la@@ ughter ) " Well , last night I discovered that for the past few months , he 's been secret@@ ly having long , late @@@ -@@ @ night phone calls with a woman at his office .
my father had an affair with a co@@ worker when I was young and it broke our family apart .
well , what do you think she should do ?
" is the pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist moving forward or going in circles , are the supporting characters important or are they a distr@@ action ? "
and what I 've noticed is that most people 's stories tend to circle around two key themes .
the first is freedom , and the second is change .
now , there 's a cartoon that I think is a perfect example of what 's really going on in these stories .
the prisoner is@@ n 't in jail .
those stories sound like this : a person says , " I want to change . "
and as any writer will tell you , there 's nothing more terri@@ fying than a blank page .
and that 's how we walk around those bars .
she asked me what she should do .
so what I want to do is I want to edit this woman 's letter together , right here , as a way to show how we can all revise our stories .
it might be about a circumstance you 're experiencing , it might be about a person in your life , it might even be about yourself .
and I want you to look at the supporting characters .
how can I get my wife back ? "
so , what you probably picked up on is that this is the same story I read you earlier , just told from another narr@@ ator 's point of view .
that 's the hardest step in the editing process , but it 's also where change begins .
I wrote the husband 's version of the letter I read you .
we call them help @@@ -@@ @ rejecting complain@@ ers .
I 'm sure you know people like this .
they 're the people who , when you try to offer them a suggestion , they reject it with , " Y@@ ea@@ h , no , that will never work , because ... "
and so , with these people , I usually take a different approach .
and that it 's worth the effort to go through a revision because there 's nothing more important to the quality of our lives than the stories we tell ourselves about them .
I say that when it comes to the stories of our lives , we should be aiming for our own personal Pul@@ it@@ zer Prize .
here , in a place that was like Dis@@ ney World , the Olympics , car@@ ni@@ vals , museums , all in one , there were three conflicting displays of what it meant to be black in the United States .
M@@ J : " the dominant race in this country insists upon judging the Neg@@ ro by his lowest and most vicious representatives . "
we must , we are unanimous .
something must change .
just as the name of Sam H@@ ose filled newspapers back then , today 's media carries the names of : J@@ M@@ R : O@@ scar Grant .
so they have very few genes and genetic information to en@@ code all of the traits that they carry out .
so , 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being .
and so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do .
and so it seemed to us that they 're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals .
and the clu@@ e to this came from another marine bacter@@ ium , and it 's a bacter@@ ium called " Vi@@ bri@@ o f@@ is@@ cher@@ i . "
but when they grew to a certain cell number , all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .
but what it does do is to make and sec@@ re@@ te small molecules that you can think of like hormones , and these are the red tri@@ angles .
but when the bacteria grow and double and they 're all participating in making these molecules , the molec@@ ule , the extrac@@ ell@@ ular amount of that molec@@ ule , increases in proportion to cell number .
so it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter @@@ -@@ @ illumin@@ ate itself in an anti@@ pre@@ dation device , so pre@@ dat@@ ors can 't see its shadow , calculate its trajectory and eat it .
so this is like the ste@@ alth bom@@ ber of the ocean .
and as the day goes by , the bacteria double , they release the molec@@ ule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squ@@ id wants it .
this is your skin .
what I hope you can see is that there 's all kinds of bacteria there .
it 's used by all different bacteria , and it 's the language of inter@@ species communication .
and they take that information inside , and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who 's in the minority and who 's in the majority of any given population .
cou@@ ld@@ n 't these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
the hope is that these will be used as broad @@@ -@@ @ spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria .
it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies .
so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing , but they 're a little different , which I 've depicted on this slide .
so science is done by that demographic .
and I want to thank you for inviting me here , it 's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
invest in clinical innovation ?
and at least 40 patients are expected to go to a PH@@ C every day .
so she decides to take the day off .
and finally , we worked with elected representatives to launch these revived P@@ HC@@ s , who shared the citizen promises with the community with a lot of fan@@ fare .
now , the promise was out there in the open .
the system had to start delivering .
the public health system was getting back into business .
and there were a group of passionate doctors who were discussing ideas on how to better support their teams .
another doctor was using Wh@@ at@@ s@@ App in creative ways to share information and ideas with his front@@ line workers .
Raj@@ as@@ than was ranked 20th out of 21 large states .
and a great way to trigger the motivation is to increase transparency to the citizen .
and politicians on the basis of a sco@@ rec@@ ard of how exactly they 're improving citizen lives .
we need to bring back their motivation .
the second half of the last century was completely defined by a technological revolution : the software revolution .
and we developed a tool to do just this .
we could use this program to predict what this cell might do in conditions we had@@ n 't yet tested .
it needs us to bridge the physical and the life sciences , and scientists from each of these disciplines need to be able to work together with common languages and to have shared scientific questions .
so as part of this , research in bio@@ ethics will have to be a priority .
there are teams and scientists working on the fundamentals of this right now , so perhaps if it got the right attention and the right investment , it could be realized in 10 or 15 years .
understanding this ancient type of biological computation is the critical first step .
but mortal guards and ordinary weapons w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't suffice , so the vi@@ sionary god devised an in@@ dom@@ itable new defender .
three times a day , the bronze guardian mar@@ ched around the island 's perimeter searching for inter@@ l@@ op@@ ers .

their adventure had taken many dark turns , and the we@@ ary sail@@ ors were desperate to rest in a safe harb@@ or .

none of these cre@@ ations were as famous as TA@@ LOS , who appeared on Greek coins , v@@ ase paintings , public fres@@ co@@ es , and in theat@@ rical performances .
even 2,500 years ago , Greeks had already begun to investigate the uncertain line between human and machine .
illustrating the demise of TA@@ LOS on a v@@ ase of the fifth century B@@ CE , one pa@@ inter captured the dying autom@@ aton 's despair with a tear rolling down his bronze che@@ ek .
in my work I harness pop culture and emerging technology to shift cultural norms .
( la@@ ughter ) But then I began to wonder whether a game or an app can really change attitudes and behavi@@ ors , and if so , can I measure that change ?
what 's the science behind that process ?
the web , mobile devices , virtual and augmented reality were res@@ crip@@ ting our nervous systems .
and they were literally changing the structure of our brain .
the lim@@ bic La@@ b consists of two components : a narrative engine and a media machine .
it 's like personalized medicine based on our DNA .
but I am grap@@ pling with an ethical dilemma .
however , this is not enough .
the new story about climate protection is that it 's not costly , but profitable .
this thesis is set out in a book called " W@@ inning the Oil En@@ d@@ game " that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at O@@ il@@ end@@ ga@@ me@@ .com -- about 17@@ 0,000 downloads so far .
we 've been spending the last few decades accum@@ ulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substitu@@ ting for oil , and no one had bo@@ thered to add them up before .
how long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new W@@ ally @@@ -@@ @ bad@@ ged Shanghai automotive super @@@ -@@ @ efficient car ?
that seems to make more sense .
the more we keep on using the oil , particularly the imported oil , the more we face a very obvious array of problems .
and we 'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
so that 's a very hand@@ some return .
and these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
so you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return .
in the air@@ plane business , it 's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free , as Bo@@ eing is now demonstrating in its new Dre@@ am@@ liner .
the same for the modern semi @@@ -@@ @ conductor industry .
ours is on the demand side .
and they got very upset .
I read a book by a woman named A@@ my Rich@@ lin , who is the chair of the Classi@@ cs department at US@@ C .

she do@@ es@@ n 't want to be like , " You 're too old to drive . "
and the mother goes through a second red light .
it 's an actual thing .
and they put the fish in this cubic fish tank .
so I have this question for myself .
by looking into this Chinese traditional painting , I found that they often mixed the nature and the artificial , man @@@ -@@ @ made , in a very dramatic way , so they create this emotional scenery .
and this is how this building is situated in the city .
but what we 're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature , so we can extend the nature from the park into the city .
a Chinese art cri@@ tic drew this painting .
that looks very fit into this painting .
in the very northern part of China , we also built this opera house .
it 's a museum created by George Luc@@ as , the creator of the " Star Wars " movies .
it 's nature .
and you see from this photo , you can hardly tell where there 's building and where there 's landscape .
this is actually a swimming pool with natural light coming from above .
it can 't distinguish s@@ ati@@ re from propaganda or ir@@ ony from hatred , and so on and so forth .

Mr : but unlike the wounds of the sca@@ ven@@ gers , those of the content moder@@ ators remain invisible .
in our film , we tell the story of a young man who had to monitor li@@ vest@@ re@@ ams of self @@@ -@@ @ mu@@ til@@ ations and suicide attempts , again and again , and who eventually committed suicide himself .
never before in the history of mankind has it been easier to reach millions of people around the globe in a few seconds .
the content moder@@ ators often decide on such cases at the same speed as the [ clear ] cases .

H@@ B : and others motivate themselves by comparing themselves with their president , Rodri@@ go Du@@ ter@@ te .
and what that means is eliminating all kinds of problems by literally killing people on the streets who are supposed to be criminals , whatever that means .
and his reaction was always the same : " we will fix that , and I will follow up on that with my team . "
and while it may seem impossible to consider the values of users worldwide , it 's worth believing that there 's more that connects us than separ@@ ates us .
Mr : ye@@ ah , at a time when popul@@ ism is gaining strength , it becomes popular to justify the symptoms , to eradicate them , to make them invisible .
H@@ B : delete .
what I wanted to talk to you about today is two things : one , the rise of a culture of availability ; and two , a request .
( la@@ ughter ) No@@ thing says " I love you " like " Let me find somebody else I give a dam@@ n about . "
or , this one , coming to us from India .
that is actually the device .
there might be somebody on one right now , participating in multi @@@ -@@ @ dimensional engagement .
( la@@ ughter ) Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we 're going to tell about it later .
people are@@ n 't simply projec@@ ting identity , they 're creating it .
except now , my friends and I could text or talk to each other wherever we were , instead of pre@@ tending , when we were running around each other 's back@@ yards .
OK , let 's start simple , and take a look inside these in@@ san@@ ely addic@@ tive devices .
because without chemistry , what is an information super@@ highway that we love , would just be a really expensive , sh@@ in@@ y paper@@ weight .
what if we move down to the battery ?
they 're really small .
could it be that we go to the hardware store , pick up a spo@@ ol of copper wire , get some wire cut@@ ters , a little cli@@ p @@@ -@@ @ cli@@ p , saw it all up and then , ba@@ m -- we have our printed circuit board ?
and we feed those positively charged spheres negatively charged electr@@ ons by adding form@@ al@@ de@@ hy@@ de to the mix .
well it turns out it can do a lot more than just that .
and as a human , I always want more .
but once true 5@@ G is here , it 's going to be a lot more than how many movies we can put on our device .
it 's pretty easy to answer .
well it 's the same thing in our 5@@ G devices .
but hold on .
I really don 't know another way of saying it , except chemistry is just cool .

if you buy our car it 's about 20,000 Euros .
here is the problem : at 147 dollars a barrel , which we were in six months ago , the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil .
now we actually looked at what the answer would be .
we don 't have the industry set right .
now where is the car industry on that ?
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
in Israel , we 've asked to put a solar farm in the south of Israel .
and we said , " What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? "
and when we go to CO@@ P@@ 15 at the end of this year we can 't stop thinking of p@@ adding CO2 .
and actually 700 and change million cars today em@@ it 2.8 billion tons of CO2 .
( la@@ ughter ) He actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
and there was an argument . should we stop using slaves ?
and what would it do to our economy ?
let 's not do it immediately . maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves .
we have to make the right moral decision .
they analyze the environment around them and react to everything I do .
and time to land .
thank you .
what do you do with it ?
and what we do is get people to track variables -- blood pressure , blood sugar -- and then report it back to them in a color @@@ -@@ @ coded format .
I mean we 're essentially using technology to just j@@ am evolution into fast @@@ -@@ @ forward .
to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
it 's a total media cir@@ cus .
the way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es and extra chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , so we go from 46 to 47 or 48 .
those kinds of loose analog@@ ies with ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) computers , and with programming , are actually much deeper than that .
they touch us too deeply .
and they depend too much upon history , upon philosophy , upon religion , upon culture , upon politics .
they are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives , of their society , of their future .
it will always be remembered .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
I think that our choice in the choice of life , is not whether we 're going to go down this path .
it 's here , right now , under our feet .
so follow one of these fun@@ gi , and it connects multiple plants simultaneously .
you can think of it as an underground subway system , where each root is a station , where resources are loaded and un@@ loaded .
for the root , what they need is phosph@@ orus and nitrogen , so by exchanging their carbon they get access to all of the nutrients collected by that fun@@ gal network .
it 's a simple market , but it 's a market nonetheless , where the better trading partner is consistently fav@@ ored .
but is it a fair market ?
there 's also evidence that the fun@@ gi are good at infl@@ ating the price of nutrients .
so rather than pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ sizing , tap into the network , steal the carbon and give nothing in return .
there 's no trade fav@@ ors .
so our group helped pioneer a method , a technology , whereby we could tag nutrients with nan@@ op@@ articles , fluo@@ res@@ cing nan@@ op@@ articles called quantum do@@ ts .
this is important , because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources .
second , we found that , exposed to inequality , the fun@@ gu@@ s would move resources from the rich patch of the network , actively transport them to the poor side of the network .
now this stimulated us to really di@@ g deeper into how information is shared .
how is it that a fun@@ gu@@ s can sense market conditions across its network and then make calculations of where and when to trade ?
so we wanted to look about information and how it 's shared across this network , how the fun@@ gu@@ s integrates cu@@ es .
thank you .
our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .
you 're flying through the cor@@ te@@ x of my colleague 's brain .
the world of seas he and his brothers had created when they dropped the gour@@ d became the world of humans , where the car@@ ac@@ ar@@ ac@@ ols who followed Dem@@ in@@ an maintained the delicate balance between people and gods .
you 've got to give your consumer exactly what they want when they still want it .
a couple of months ago , I was shopping with a friend in Tokyo .
clic@@ ked it , bought it .
but there are really no simple answers to these questions .
I just did the song to re@@ connect us to the spirit of the rain@@ forest .
but everything is always a challenge .
but now it 's under threat .
and we have been trying to scream to the world that we need to protect our territory , our nature .
you know , back in the late ' 8@@ 0s , this Big Mac clam@@ shell was the symbol of a garbage crisis .
the last 10 years , I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers .
then out of nowhere , my b@@ oss comes to me and says , " He@@ y , we want you to save this clam@@ shell for the company and lead the effort to reduce waste within Mc@@ Donald 's . "
me and my team thought , re@@ us@@ ables ?
but we did@@ n 't reject the idea .
the kitchen area is dirty and gri@@ my .
their behavior .
but they did have a lot of ideas that did work .
my favorite was switching from the white carry @@@ -@@ @ out bag to the brown bag .
it 's made from recycled content , mostly recycled shipping cor@@ ru@@ gated boxes .
another idea they had was that we could reduce our n@@ ap@@ kin by one inch .
and make it from recycled office paper .
and we made that look , you know , in tune , in vo@@ gue with customers .
they care , they have passion , we 're just not different .
so , we had a six @@@ -@@ @ month partnership that ended up producing a 42 @@@ -@@ @ point waste reduction action plan .
we measured it during the decade of the ' 9@@ 0s , and over 10 years we reduced 300 million pounds of waste .
now , animal rights , obviously they don 't want animals used for meat .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'm just going to stick to the pa@@ stries .
and it never did .
and that is , they said , " You should work with Dr. Temple Gran@@ din . "
so I end up meeting her , and she 's the very best type of cri@@ tic , in a sense that she just loves the animals , wants to protect them , but she also understands the reality of the meat business .
so this very unlikely collaboration produced outstanding results .
and Green@@ peace themselves declared it as a spectacular drop in deforestation and it 's been in effect ever since .
you 'll become better , your organization will become better , and you might make some good friends along the way .
my inability to swim has been one of my greatest humili@@ ations and embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ments .
so what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body , much like a small car behind a big car on the highway .
but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left , maintaining that f@@ us@@ el@@ age position as long as possible .
and so his entire body really is underwater .
incorrect , above , which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you .
I 'll be doing a swimming lesson later , for myself , if anyone wants to join me .
and I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't even catch the response . a sad state of affairs .
and that 's pretty much my response .
and this became my Holy G@@ rail , my Ros@@ e@@ tta Stone .
we can talk about that if anyone in interested .
and so I ended up walking like this .
I found myself in Argentina in 2005 , decided to watch a tan@@ go class -- had no intention of participating .
gor@@ geous assistant instructor .
and then I took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
these seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete if I wanted to comp@@ te@@ te against people who 'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years .
this is the instructor that Al@@ ic@@ ia and I chose for the male lead .
apply them to very big dreams .
number one : Don 't let go -- very sure success method .
number two : hes@@ itation is bad .
this is a friction climb , up in Tu@@ ol@@ um@@ ne Me@@ ad@@ ows , in the Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite high country .
you 've got to keep going .
rule number five : know how to rest .
with this , typically crack clim@@ bers would put their hands in and their to@@ es in and just start climbing .
they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it 's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long .
so don 't hang on till the bitter end .
thank you very much .
I 'm here today , as June said , to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years .
we 're cro@@ che@@ ting a coral ree@@ f .
and it 's a project that we 've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
it 's a project that now reaches across three continents , and its roots go into the fields of mathematics , marine biology , femin@@ ine handic@@ raft and environmental activis@@ m .
it causes these vast ble@@ aching events that are the first signs of cor@@ als of being sick .
and if the ble@@ aching do@@ es@@ n 't go away -- if the temperatures don 't go down -- reefs start to die .
so I said yes to this proposition .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
one . great . ok@@ ay .
but there is another possibility that you all know of : s@@ pher@@ ical space .
what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a cur@@ ved surface ?
there is , there 's a third alternative .
there 's a straight line , and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line .
what did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this ?
and someone that comes along and says , " Lo@@ ok here 's a ball . "
I 've sti@@ t@@ ched Eu@@ cl@@ id 's parallel post@@ ulate on to the surface .
so here , in wool , through a domestic femin@@ ine art , is the proof that the most famous post@@ ulate in mathematics is wrong .
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
we started out , Chris@@ sy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathem@@ atically perfect models .
we want to propose , Chris@@ sy and I , through The Institute for Fig@@ uring , another alternative way of doing things , which is the play tank .
and the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
now , the highest possible average would occur if every person gu@@ essed 100 .
so it would seem sensible to guess the lowest number possible .
for our audience , the average was 3@@ 1.3 .
for instance , what would happen if people played the 2 / 3 game after understanding the difference between the most logical approach and the most common ?
here 's what they said : " Don 't take away immigrant rights to public education , to medical services , to the social safety net .
they 're law @@@ -@@ @ abiding .
and , un@@ wit@@ tingly , the han@@ dou@@ ts my friends and I were handing out and the versions of these arguments that we hear today were actually playing the anti @@@ -@@ @ immigrants game .
are they willing to assimil@@ ate ?
in fact , many policymakers and employers worked hard to recruit immigrants to build up industry and to serve as settlers , to seize the continent .
first , we need to be asking about workers ' rights .
what role have rich , powerful countries like the United States played in making it hard or impossible for immigrants to stay in their home countries ?
where might these new questions about worker rights , about responsibility and about equality take us ?
it 's no small challenge to take on and broaden the borders of us .
what looks to us an un@@ conqu@@ erable sea , to our next speaker is an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble stage she was born to perform on .
and so I have given over 25 years of my life to this sport , during which I have sw@@ um in all five oceans of the world , crossed the English Channel -- which is also known as the Mount E@@ ve@@ rest of swimming -- and set a world record in the freezing Antarctic ocean .
and that shows who you really are .
in an open water mar@@ athon held in Switzerland , when I won my first gold medal for India -- ( Appl@@ ause ) I witnessed a proud Indian in me .
when you find yourself alone in an ocean , with your thoughts , the dangers that you face are not just external , like wh@@ ales , shar@@ ks , j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish or even demo@@ ti@@ vating people .
what if you fail ? what will people think ?
on some days , it means not giving up , continuing to swim in freezing water and setting a world record .
and I found that in doing the model air@@ planes the appearance drawings were not enough .
you had to learn about aer@@ onau@@ tics .
I 'd w@@ ile away my time drawing air@@ planes in the class .
studied painting ; did@@ n 't do very well at that .
and I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them .
she said , " Oh I love it . "
( la@@ ughter ) I had one for a wri@@ st@@ watch once . 20 pages .
just reli@@ eving your arms with arm@@ rests takes 20 percent of that load off .
so that 's where a head@@ rest comes in .
so that part of it took a long time to work out .
while reg@@ aling you with d@@ aring stories from her youth , it might be hard to believe your grand@@ mother used to be a tra@@ pe@@ ze artist .
even the most common type , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ritis , is tr@@ ick@@ ier to prevent than one might think .
it 's a general mis@@ conception that ar@@ th@@ ritis is confined to old age .
this leads to the flood of enzy@@ mes and degradation seen in o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ritis , but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cy@@ tok@@ ines .
this process sometimes leads to out@@ grow@@ ths called bone spur@@ s , which also cause intense sti@@ ff@@ ness and joint pain .
with so many factors causing ar@@ th@@ ritis , our current treatments are tailored to tackle specific symptoms rather than underlying causes .
to a technique called micro@@ frac@@ ture , where surge@@ ons create small holes in the bone , allowing bone mar@@ row stem cells to leak out and form new car@@ til@@ age .
as a last resort , people with wi@@ thered car@@ til@@ age can even undergo full joint replac@@ ements .
but even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition , not the cause .
three , two , one ... lif@@ to@@ ff !
we went faster and faster and faster , until , after eight and a half minutes , on purpose , those engines stop -- k@@ ab@@ un@@ k ! -- and we are weigh@@ tless .
it was like being Peter Pan .
a typical day in space starts with the perfect comm@@ ute .
we load our dirty clothes into an empty supply ship and send it off into space .
well , in real life it does .
( la@@ ughter ) Rec@@ ycl@@ ing ? of course .
so we take our urine , we store it , we filter it and then we drink it .
and it 's actually delicious .
but it 's the gathering around the table that 's important , I think both in space and on Earth , because that 's what cements a crew together .
for me , music was a way to stay connected to the rest of the world .
the black hole is the Customs and Border Protection , or CB@@ P facility , at the San Y@@ sid@@ ro port of entry , right next to a luxury outlet m@@ all .
so we prepared her for the process of turning herself over to CB@@ P to ask for asylum .
and once again , this news filled me with the sense of panic and fore@@ bo@@ ding that has unfortunately become a hall@@ mark of my daily work .
still , immigration officials held her for three more months , until we could win her release and help her re@@ un@@ ify with her son .
CB@@ P officials held her for three more weeks before they sent her back to Mexico , where she is being forced to wait months for an asylum hearing in the United States .
seeing these hor@@ rors day in and day out has changed me .
of course , we meet Central American families who are fleeing gang violence .
these refugees , many of whom are families , are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world , where they 're being raped , kidnapped and extor@@ ted by criminal groups .
I meet plenty of economic migrants .
for example , people who want to go to the United States to work , to pay medical bills for a parent or school fees for a child back home .
they 've created parallel , fascist @@@ -@@ @ style legal systems in which migrants have none of the rights that form the basis of a democracy , the alleged foundation of the countries in which they 're seeking refuge .
and since then , I haven 't traveled to any other countries , because I 'm afraid I 'll be detained and deported from those countries as well .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT allow ourselves to become num@@ b or look away .
we need to call our elected representatives and demand these changes .
so imagine that we have a person and we know a person is making a choice about a product or service , and from this person , I can know their gender , of course , other demo@@ graphics , where they live , their income , other things .
so let 's let that sink in for a second .
there 's probably something very important you need to know about them , and you 're getting distr@@ acted because you 're doing everything based on gender .
and that 's why I say you 're leaving money on the table .
gender is easy . it 's easy to design advertising based on gender , it 's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender .
all of those things are actually significantly more powerful and useful than knowing if a person is a man or a woman .
so these soccer @@@ -@@ @ playing women have a lot in common with their counterparts .
are we kind of stig@@ mati@@ zing people from Ark@@ ansas , and this part of the country ?
they asked this question .
in deciding your vote for President today , was the race of the candidate a factor ?
you see , comparing the map to ' 96 , you see an overlap here .
and you see the relationship there with the racially @@@ -@@ @ based voting patterns .
the other variable that 's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in .
and the thing about states like Ark@@ ansas and Tennessee is that they 're both very rural , and they are educ@@ ation@@ ally impoverished .
we 're going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the General Social Survey .
this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
in 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
one simple question they asked is , " Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood ? "
this was eight years ago , some people were more Republican back then .
racism is predictable . and it 's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you , people of other races .
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
so , in 2016 , I was commissioned to produce a photo ess@@ ay about the water crisis in F@@ lin@@ t , Michigan .
and I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis .
as a school bus driver , She@@ a C@@ ob@@ b became the central figure of the photo ess@@ ay , along with her mother , Ms. Ren@@ é@@ e , and her eight @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter , Z@@ ion .
from the Mon@@ ong@@ a@@ hel@@ a River to the F@@ lin@@ t River , in the words of W.@@ E.@@ B. D@@ u Bo@@ is , " The town , the whole valley , has turned its back upon the river .
General Mo@@ tors has been cited for dumping chemicals in the F@@ lin@@ t River for decades .
and , of course , I knew it was going to take more than a series of photographs on my part to bring relief to the people in Vehicle City .
the 30 @@@ -@@ @ foot bil@@ l@@ board is made of three large color neg@@ atives with the message " Water Is Life , " spelled out in Ne@@ stle water bottles by The Si@@ ster Tour .
justice has been delayed , and justice has been denied .
I asked A@@ mber , " What can I do ? "
amber took Moses to elected officials in the city of F@@ lin@@ t .
amber needed to get the machine from a military base in Texas all the way to F@@ lin@@ t .
but I see something completely different .
Moses , an officer , R@@ anger , veteran , was very clear about his water rescue mission : bring relief of free , clean water to the people in F@@ lin@@ t .
this technology pul@@ ls air through a high @@@ -@@ @ volume air filter .
it mechanically creates conden@@ sation , which produces 2,000 gall@@ ons of water per day .
I 've been at the machine , inter@@ viewing people , asking them , " What does it mean to see Moses and his machine in [ your ] community ? "
and , " What has it been like living without access to clean water ? "
no matter how dark a situation may be , a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive .
thank you .
I teach at Lin@@ col@@ n High School in Lin@@ col@@ n , Ne@@ bra@@ ska , and we are one of the oldest and most diverse high schools in our state .
it can be something that they love , something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity .
they go to the car that their family is sleeping in right now .
they come to school with trauma , and when I go home every day , that goes home with me .
the tough part about teaching is all the things you can 't control for your kids , all the things you can 't change for them once they walk out your door .
I think back to my under@@ graduate training at the University of Georgia , where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed .
we 're not developing learners who are going to go out into a workforce where they 'll stand on a line in a factory .
I think back to my second year teaching .
I had a student who I 'll call " David . "
and it was on the last day of school , I told David to have a great summer .
I built in plenty of opportunities for my students to talk to me and to talk to each other , to share their writing and to ver@@ bal@@ ize their learning .
I had David in class again that next year , and I learned that his father was undocumented and had been deported .
and after a while , our souls become weighed down by the heav@@ iness of it all .
so what are we missing ?
I work in an amazing school with great leadership .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
the chain that han@@ gs in my classroom is more than just a decoration .
those links hang over our heads for the entire four years that our students walk our halls .
and every year , I have sen@@ iors come back to my classroom , room 340 , and they can still point out where their link han@@ gs .
and they have hope .
somebody to reach out and make sure that we 're OK .
every now and then , we all just need a little help holding the sta@@ pl@@ er .
thank you .
embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ingly enough , I finished up with " If not this , what ?
if not us , who ?
and if not now , when ? "
not because they did@@ n 't like me or the message .
the problem was that no one knew what they were expected to do .
and most importantly , they did@@ n 't know that I needed them .
there 's a tough certification with about 250 questions about your social and environmental performance .
you must legally declare your intention to serve the community as well as your shareholders and you must sign the declaration of interdependence .
interdependent leaders , on the other hand , start with a goal that 's really important , but is actually impossible to achieve by one company or one person alone .
I want to give you an example from the clothing industry , which produces 92 million tons of waste a year .
while these two companies are competitive in some ways , they work together and with others in the industry to solve shared problems .
a group of companies got together with a not @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ profit called N@@ est to create a set of standards that 's now been adopted by the whole industry .
the second big difference for collaborators is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan .
at the North American division of the French food company Dan@@ one , I announced that we wanted to become a B Cor@@ p.
and unlike pink @@@ -@@ @ suit day , I had no plan to get there .
I remember the day really clearly .
heroes don 't want input , because they want to control everything because they want the credit .
heroes like making speeches .
people lean back in their chairs , maybe impressed but not engaged .
interdependent leaders , on the other hand , understand that they need other people .
they know that meetings are not just min@@ dless calendar f@@ ill@@ ers .
we kept on launching new products that failed .
first of all , language went back to Chinese .
the second thing is we asked every single person in the meeting their opinion .
hero culture s@@ ne@@ aks in everywhere .
but when you put a person in business gear up in front of a group of people with PowerPoint , they have the urge to become sort of heroic .
I 'm originally South African , and I 'm deeply passionate about wildlife conservation , most particularly r@@ hin@@ os .
every day , three r@@ hin@@ os are killed , because there are people who think that those hor@@ ns are valuable , even though they 're just made of the same stuff as hair and finger@@ nails .
and after today , there may be more .
it requires us to be open and transparent and vulnerable , and that 's not what traditional leaders have been trained to do .
I thought being a hero would keep me safe .
this is an illusion .
and if we 're going to solve the challenges that the world is facing today , we have no alternative , so we had better start getting good at it .
I 'm talking about micro@@ bes and designing with life .
bacteria , algae , fun@@ gi , ye@@ ast : our latest design tools include those of biotechnology .
my own journey in bi@@ of@@ ab@@ rication started with a project called " Bi@@ oc@@ ou@@ ture . "
the provocation was that instead of growing a plant , like cotton , in a field over several months , we could use micro@@ bes to grow a similar cell@@ ul@@ ose material in a lab in a few days .
using a certain species of bacteria in a nutrient @@@ -@@ @ rich liquid , we fer@@ mented threads of cell@@ ul@@ ose that self @@@ -@@ @ organized into a sheet of fabric .
I dried the fabric I had grown and cut and se@@ wed it into a range of garments , shoes and bags .
all of that can take months .
so these proto@@ types indicated a field offering significant resource efficiencies .
here was biology , with no intervention from me other than designing initial conditions for growth , efficiently producing a useful , sustainable material .
so now I can 't help but see all materials through the lens of bi@@ of@@ ab@@ rication .
in fact , there 's a growing global community of inno@@ v@@ ators re@@ thinking materials with biology .
it 's a process that 's been described as " nature 's glue . "
they 're naturally hydro@@ pho@@ bic , meaning they won 't absorb water .
and once we start growing materials with living organisms , it starts to make previous methods of manufacture seem il@@ logical .
the bacteria produce cry@@ st@@ als that form around each grain of sand , locking together all the loose particles to form a solid brick .
but not as a cosmetic green layer .
these surface structures are designed to invite life in .
I 'm excited that we 're starting to design and bi@@ of@@ ab@@ ric@@ ate a new material world .
over a billion dollars has already been invested in start @@@ -@@ @ ups bi@@ of@@ ab@@ ric@@ ating consumer products .
thank you .
we 've also heard company leaders worried about aggressive competition from global platforms eating up their local businesses .
if , in any market , you dramatically increase supply , you should expect prices , profitability and growth to go down for existing players .
online market@@ places will continue to grow .
as a strategy consultant , I study businesses for a living .
so , I went back to fundamentals , and I asked the question : what do online market@@ places really do ?
for drivers and passengers , you get U@@ ber , Gra@@ b in Southeast Asia or D@@ idi in China .
what all these examples have in common is that they transition this basic functionality of matching sellers and buyers from the physical world to the digital world .
this is the same car becoming 40 percent more productive .
and the same has been proven true for other online market@@ places .
you can give it to the drivers -- more passengers , more income .
what usually happens is that all three of them would somehow split it .
this is what economists would call a " negative extern@@ ality . "
I profoundly believe this is avoidable .
and one of the reasons for that is because they have decided to actively invest in African entrepreneurs , to grow them into the digital age .
but look at them today .
I am a management consultant , so naturally , I was keen to understand the reasons behind those delicious dum@@ plings .
in the past 2,000 years , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ anism has been dominant in China , which values sen@@ iority and authority .
in the program , each employee chooses an av@@ atar character that pop@@ s up alongside digital communication channels .
some common ideas include Cap@@ tain Ho@@ ok , Harry Pot@@ ter and many well @@@ -@@ @ known characters in Chinese literature .
they 're definitely not Con@@ fu@@ cian .
there is even some from the U.S.
we are realizing that this is true .
if it works in Africa then it will work anywhere .
it 's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
how do you decide what is important ?
you can 't understand what is actually happening .
it 's coming from places that you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't expect .
that means , for every square kilome@@ ter , there were four k@@ ab@@ adi@@ wal@@ as or informal recycl@@ ers .
( appl@@ ause ) On@@ ce we had the data , the rest was fairly straightforward .
the only home we have .
( appl@@ ause ) SR@@ K : when I see a youn@@ g@@ ster do what he has done and achieved , I want that part to also be a source of encouragement for people to take over .
so tell me , are you making a lot of money ?
and we 're very fortunate to have signed a really big , multi@@ million @@@ -@@ @ dollar contract with some of the top FM@@ C@@ G companies .
M@@ V : ( laugh@@ s ) SR@@ K : give the figure , it will encourage people , it 's not for gre@@ ed , it 's not for any of the reasons ...
they tend to be people who are willing to bend the rules -- actually even break them sometimes -- and challenge the status quo to stand beside someone who is going against societal norms .
I 'm actually going to describe an experience that I had that first crystall@@ ized the idea of co @@@ -@@ @ conspir@@ ators in my mind .
the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate .
the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood , which we seek , in vain , as adults , to employ .
( la@@ ughter ) un@@ suspec@@ ting guests were served ste@@ wed turn @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ century Turkish fig@@ s for breakfast .
a shoe made of ap@@ ric@@ ot leather for the daughter of a cz@@ ar .
we need to begin asking questions of ourselves and of our elected officials , and I 'd like to share three with you today .
so this leads me to my third question : " what do your elected officials know about nuclear weapons , and what types of decisions are they likely to take on your behalf ? "
ask them , " How would you choose to spend US national treasure ?
after all , this is " national security . "
and if that do@@ es@@ n 't work , find others , who are able to represent your views .
and the answer can 't be " Because they 're super rich and they live in your zi@@ p code . "
Oh , that 's a great school , are you guys very involved there ?
Oh , at Santa Clar@@ a , that 's awesome .
right ?
and I should be thinking about ways to help them partner with us and invest in a more meaningful way .
but here 's what I want to tell you , because this is the part that all my clients always want to ski@@ p , because they think it 's the flu@@ ff and it 's not important .
right ?
it 's really awesome , it 's meaningful , and remember , it 's a conversation , it 's not a cross examination , it 's not an interview .
you don 't get extra points for knowing how to use Google .
now , when you do this , don 't get too deep into the wee@@ ds , or you 'll lose them .

will you commit to build relationships ?
just be yourself .
once you 've made the ask -- " W@@ ould you consider supporting us at the 10,000 @@@ -@@ @ dollar level ?

thank you .
let 's explore what these new medicines are made of , how they 're different and what 's causing this incoming ti@@ dal wave of new and exciting medicines .
constrained pep@@ ti@@ des are very small proteins .
thank you .
great .
so what could we do to ensure that also those babies who are not breast@@ fed could restore their micro@@ biota development after en@@ countering those disrup@@ tive early life events that might disrupt their gu@@ t micro@@ biota development ?
in the spring , I 'd smell the head@@ y fra@@ gr@@ ance of l@@ il@@ acs .

and that 's the control , so nothing should happen in that tube .
some pharmaceutical companies now have teams that are dedicated to designing enzy@@ mes to make drugs more efficiently and with fewer toxic cataly@@ sts .
for example , J@@ anu@@ via , which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes , is made partially with enzy@@ mes .
and this is also going to be the thing that allows you to do the wash in cold water , reduce your carbon footprint and save you some money .
I thought I should probably turn up to those .
so we rented some suits , I invited a girl that I had just met -- we 'll get to her in a second -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) and off we went to the big black @@@ -@@ @ tie g@@ ala .
when the shock had worn off , we got a lot of champ@@ agne to the table and the party began , and the night was surely over .
now , in another rented suit , I was at one of the din@@ ners and sitting next to a lovely man called Bel@@ mir@@ o de Az@@ e@@ ve@@ do , who was the winner from Portugal .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , this was a pretty big light bulb moment for me for two reasons .
( la@@ ughter ) But rather than freeze as I would have historically done or chi@@ val@@ ro@@ us@@ ly maybe informed her of her error , I just tried to keep the conversation going .
so I spent a week trying to learn everything I could about industrial @@@ -@@ @ scale batteries and the electricity grid and rene@@ wa@@ bles and the economics of all of this and whether this was even a feasible proposal .
I talked to the chief scientist , I talked to the CS@@ IR@@ O , had multiple ministers and premi@@ ers trying to give me their side of the story from both sides of the a@@ is@@ le .
I managed to exchange t@@ wee@@ ts with the prime minister .
I 've since returned , after that first journey , several times a year to visit S@@ ian K@@ a 'an , to the country of my birth , to work with this tra@@ sh .
this guy is so cu@@ te .
and it 's so important for us to really see those and to take those in .
I 'm really excited about this new work .
right now , as I speak , there 's literally an oil spill of plastic happening .
I call the project " Wash@@ ed Up : transforming a tra@@ shed Land@@ scape , " but it 's actually transformed me and made me re@@ think my own behavi@@ ors and consumption .
so China , I 've already mentioned , beginning around 1978 , around the time of the death of Ma@@ o , growth -- ten percent a year .
India , starting a little bit later , but in 1990 , be@@ getting tremendous growth .
and by that I mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
this is practically the model of TED .
it costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats 1,000 people , 100,000 people , or a million people .
in fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ first century could easily be 3.3 , even higher percent .
well let 's take a look . let 's take a look at the Great De@@ pression .
and it 's this machine .
because what we 've done in our personal ev@@ olutions is build up a large reper@@ toire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual hi@@ stories .
and so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited , as a consequence , in their language abilities at an older age .
in the next great epo@@ ch of life , which applies for most of life , the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide reper@@ toire of skills and abilities .
and that 's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain .
it 's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior .
it 's a very simple experiment where a mon@@ key has been trained in a task that involves it manip@@ ulating a tool that 's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spo@@ on .
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries .
those tries were elaborate .
and 700 or so tries later the mon@@ key is performing it f@@ law@@ lessly -- never fails .
we can look down in the brain of the mon@@ key .
we can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behavi@@ ors across time .
we 've actually distorted the map by the exercise .
and that is indicated in the pink . we have a couple fin@@ g@@ erti@@ p surfaces that are larger .
if we look at the selectivity of responses in the cor@@ te@@ x of the mon@@ key , we see that the mon@@ key has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps that are engaged .
in other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps in this most organized of cor@@ tical areas of the surface of the skin of the body .
now actually we 've looked in several different cor@@ tical areas in the mon@@ key learning this task .
there are 15 or 20 cor@@ tical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this .
this is constructed by physical change .
think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general .
you are constructed , your self is constructed from these billions of events .
and the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby 's brain 's life the machine process is nois@@ y .
and there are a lot of things that contribute to that .
that 's disappeared . that no longer applies .
that inherited weakness , that inherited condition has evapor@@ ated .
it 's not Japanese .
it 's mu@@ ff@@ led English . it 's degraded Japanese .
and then the child is stuck with it .
of course they will . because as a receiver of language , they are receiving it and representing it , and in information it 's representing cra@@ p .
and they are going to have poor reading skills .
because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orth@@ ographic or visual represent@@ ational form .
if you don 't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense .
the point is is that you can train the brain out of this .
a way to think about this is you can actually re @@@ -@@ @ refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it .
actually , probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak .
this is a substantially large impact .
the overall neuro@@ psychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations .
it means that most people who are at risk for sen@@ ility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position .
my main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other mal@@ ad@@ ies .
I 'm specifically interested in things like au@@ tism , and cere@@ br@@ al pal@@ sy , these great childhood catastro@@ ph@@ es .
and of course , a well @@@ -@@ @ ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key .
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here , I thought to myself that well , it 's TED .
and these TE@@ D@@ sters are -- you know , as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthro@@ pi@@ sts and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .
and then I thought no , no . I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because , after all , this is the great unve@@ iling .
although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen 's English because I am from Que@@ ens , New York .
( la@@ ughter ) But the theme of this session , of course , is invention .
we 're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits , unique developmental experiences , geographical and historical contexts .
but then what ?
how do we self @@@ -@@ @ identify and how mu@@ table is that identity ?
what I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they 've each prepared their own little TED talks .
good evening everybody .
Oh my ! there 's so many of you .
( la@@ ughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I am here because of a young girl , Sarah Jones .
well you know , she calls herself black -- she 's really more like a car@@ amel color if you look at her .
but I don 't mind .
frankly , I 'm k@@ vel@@ ling just to be here with all the lumin@@ aries you have attending something like this , you know .
really , it 's amazing .
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful gi@@ ants of the industries but the celebrities .
is@@ n 't that ad@@ orable ?
but anyway , I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel .
it 's such an eye @@@ -@@ @ opening experience to be here .
you 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today .
what are you allowed to say or not say ?
so , happy continued success .
congratulations . Maz@@ el tov .
I am Dominican @@@ -@@ @ American .
so then I 'm like , should I be nervous , you know , because maybe it 's better .
ok@@ ay . sorry . so anyway , what I was trying to say is that I really love TED .
like , it 's -- I can 't get over this right now .
and , like , people would not believe , seriously , where I 'm from , that this even exists .
so , basically like DA BO@@ MB -- what Dominican @@@ -@@ @ American Ben@@ evol@@ ent Organization for Mo@@ thers and Bab@@ ies does is , basically , we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me .
I mean , I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different , whatever .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because I 'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that 's my new title .
so , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
so , I 'm very happy that you 're , you know , doing this kind of thing , making the talks available online .
thank you very much .
well , you know , it was beg@@ inner French , that I am taking with her , you know .
the teacher , Her@@ r Sch@@ top@@ f , he never discriminated .
never . he always , always treated each of us , you know , equally un@@ be@@ ar@@ ably during the class .
for example , a friend of mine .
well , I just wanted to quickly say good evening .
of course , TED , the reputation prece@@ des itself all over the world .
but that 's where we had some problems .
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
and then at college , it 's like she never came home .
and she do@@ es@@ n 't want me to come and visit .
so , I accused my daughter to have like a secret boy@@ friend .
she said , " No M@@ om . I mean , I don 't like boys . I like girls .
( la@@ ughter ) So , these are the words I am waiting to hear , but from my son , not my daughter .
I am originally from Jordan .
but I feel a bit like a fish out of water .
so you will get the extra credit I promised you .
on the radio [ unclear ] , they were very popular .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you very , very much . I love you .
( appl@@ ause ) Well , you have to let me say this .
Bou@@ v@@ ard knew that his predictions were perfect .
( la@@ ughter ) But in 18@@ 46 , another French astronom@@ er , Ur@@ ba@@ in Le Ver@@ rier , worked through the math and fig@@ ured out how to predict the location of the planet .
and those yellow circles at the edge are these ic@@ y bodies out beyond the planets .
and the answer is no .
I was so excited by this idea , by the idea that we could look at the fossil history of the birth of the Sun , that I spent the next decade looking for more objects with orb@@ its like S@@ ed@@ na .
I have no idea .
it 's very difficult to think of any reason that that would happen .
this is a phenomenon known as the conjunction fall@@ acy .
on its own , Luc@@ y being an artist do@@ es@@ n 't match the expectations formed by the preceding information .
a few days later , when the summit had ended , the factories were hum@@ ming again , the sky had again turned light grey .
at CE@@ E@@ W , my colleagues find that 80 percent of Indians can breathe clean air if we adopted stringent pollution controls .
how much does it take to keep a night guard warm rather than force them to burn rub@@ b@@ ish to stay warm in winter ?
thank you .
we 're concerned in the national security community , and of course in the biology community and the public health community .
but we 're now up to 55 countries in the world , have had this virus emerge , in either birds , or people or both .
so it turns out that shu@@ tting down the airports is counterproductive .
al@@ right , so I 've got you nervous .
and the bottom line , major thing that has come through in every single drill : nobody knows who 's in charge .
so here 's where the decisions come in .
let 's see , should we order that all pets be kept indo@@ ors ?
should you take Tam@@ if@@ lu for a long period of time , well , one of the side effects is su@@ ic@@ idal ide@@ ations .
and put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put .
but we don 't really know how and why that happens .
you might be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children , doing such a thing .
LG : right . so I have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic .
it tells you if you have H@@ 5@@ N1 .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than I 'd anticipated .
we feel the problems right now , and have for some time .
this comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits .
well , first of all , we 're all incredibly good @@@ -@@ @ looking .
[ green is the new black ... ] ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I like that , too .
because on top of that , the world 's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ru@@ th Built by destroying two well @@@ -@@ @ loved community parks .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day lives , incredible things happened .
help me make sustainability sex@@ y .
( la@@ ughter ) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process .
by working together , we can become one of those small , rapidly @@@ -@@ @ growing groups of individuals who actually have the aud@@ acity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world .
I call this the " human @@@ -@@ @ zero mind@@ set . "
" had the same situation with my mother 's burial ur@@ n . "

our team trained a model in a few weeks , on past sales data , and the competition was organized with human buyers .
there started our 70 percent .
I CA@@ N@@ NOT find any good compar@@ ables in the past for them . "
but profits and benefits were in excess of 100 million of savings per year for that retail@@ er .
more than 75 percent expressed real concerns on the impact of AI on the workforce , on privacy , on the risk of a de@@ human@@ ized society .
these words are often used to silence girls right from childhood , well into adul@@ thood and deep into old age .
I 'm sure you 've heard the word .
no matter what happens , just adjust . "
so I started asking a very simple question : what does it mean to you to be a good woman or a good man today ?
we must change .
a habit is just a habit .
we don 't need elastic women , we need elastic definitions , for men too , and this big societal change CA@@ N@@ NOT happen without men 's involvement .
we can do this together .
D@@ N : very depressed .
so then I went to another college and another college .
SR@@ K : do you girls all agree with what De@@ ep@@ a is saying ?
you , boy , you adjust . we are not adjusting anymore , OK ?
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you so much . have a good evening . thank you .
its job is to recre@@ ate the conditions that were present less than a bil@@ lion@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it 's nothing if not ambitious .
this is the one I work on . it 's called the AT@@ LAS detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
thank you .
we look around the media , as we see on the news from Iraq , Afghanistan , Sierra Leone , and the conflict seems in@@ comprehensible to us .
but as a phy@@ sic@@ ist , I thought , well if you give me some data , I could maybe understand this . you know , give us a go .
can you get me some information ?
( la@@ ughter ) No . so I had to think a little harder .
that database contained the timing of attacks , the location , the size and the weapons used .
it 's all in the streams of information we consume daily , we just have to know how to pull it out .
what if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks ?
and we did@@ n 't know , for Iraq what we were going to find .
we did@@ n 't really understand that .
we looked at Colombia , we looked at Afghanistan , and we looked at Senegal .
taking it forward , how do we change it ?
the opposite happened .
they fear that if they were to slow down , they might run the risk of becoming obsolete .
they say they 'd rather burn out than r@@ ust out .
interactions that could be seen as ple@@ as@@ antly b@@ risk and convenient in some cultures could be seen as horri@@ bly r@@ ude in others .
sometimes that saves our lives , right ?
but sometimes , it leads us a@@ stra@@ y in the long run .
sometimes , we 'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster .
if you 're lucky enough to decide the pace that you want to travel through life , it 's a privilege .

I 'm kind of a walking clic@@ h@@ é .
and to do this , I had to brave not only the darkness , but also s@@ war@@ ms of mosqu@@ it@@ oes , and my sleeping bag really did@@ n 't smell very good .
and it turns out that when you 're trying to unlock the secrets of the cos@@ mos , it 's really helpful to be able to see the cos@@ mos .
instead , I want to talk about these quietly un@@ assuming dog whel@@ ks .
not only are they one of the most dominant in@@ vertebr@@ ate pre@@ dat@@ ors , but other animals , like cra@@ bs and birds , think they 're pretty tasty .
and so these -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) And the other issue is because they literally move at a s@@ nail 's pace .
and it gets worse .
for people who are subjected to significant amounts of artificial light at night they 're about 50 percent more likely to get breast cancer .
but maybe you don 't care about your health .
that means that within the next decade virtually the entire eastern half of the United States will be perpe@@ tually brigh@@ ter than tw@@ il@@ ight .
some problems in the world , like we 've heard about today and you 'll hear more about , are overwhelming and they seem in@@ tractable .
this is actually stup@@ idly simple , OK ?
because if you don 't , you don 't know what you 're missing , and you don 't know what humanity is losing .
and basically , these three quotes tell what 's going on .
it 's po@@ king and pr@@ ying with a purpose . "
I think our mission is to reconcile , to reintegrate science and the arts , because right now , there 's a sch@@ ism that exists in popular culture .
they 're ing@@ en@@ ious , perhaps , but not analytical . "
and when these concepts under@@ lie our teaching and what we think about the world , then we have a problem , because we sty@@ mi@@ e support for everything .
talent would run from either of these fields if you said you had to choose either .
I loved dance : L@@ ola Fal@@ ana , Al@@ vin A@@ il@@ ey , Jer@@ ome Rob@@ b@@ ins .
and I had to do the lighting and the design work , and I was trying to figure out : do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dan@@ cer , or to go to medical school ?
and that 's what we have to reconcile in our minds , how these things fit together .
E@@ in@@ stein said , in fact , " The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious .

the arts and sciences are av@@ at@@ ars of human creativity .
that 's a fool@@ ish choice .
I did a project called S.@@ E.@@ E.@@ ing the Future : science , Engineering and Education .
we got a bun@@ ch of scientists in all stages of their careers .
infrastructure , museums , theat@@ ers , movie houses across the country are dis@@ appearing .
so we have to really stop and think : what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts ?
I just want to tell you quickly what I 'm doing -- ( Appl@@ ause ) I want to tell you what I 've been doing a little bit since ...
and as a dan@@ cer , I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body , just as I knew how to sense colors .
we know that patients know and understand their bodies better , but these days we 're trying to divorce them from that idea .
we have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by , and that 's what we have to do .
this is a bronze ball , an aluminum arm here , and then this wooden disk .
and then there was a second level to this object , which is that it -- I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in , which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other .
I was exploring , really early on , wanting to make things float in the air .
the thing is , is that it 's slightly dangerous .
normally it 's sort of c@@ ord@@ oned off when it 's in a museum .
this is a little stone ball , floating .
and then this is the first part of -- this is 109 spheres , since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth .
and then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun .
so you can see it rotating here .
this is another species of work that I do .
these are these ar@@ rays . these spheres are all suspended , but they have magne@@ ts horizontally in them that make them all like comp@@ asses .
it was the idea of isol@@ ating the t@@ acti@@ le component of sculpture , and then putting it into a communication system .
so it 's a floating island with water , fresh water , that can fly from place to place .
so if we could roll the next film here .
but this the current version of it , is a flying air@@ ship that is about 35 meters in diameter , about 110 feet in diameter .
it has on @@@ -@@ @ board generators .
the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show .
so it could land in a park , for example .
the ar@@ ctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
the so @@@ -@@ @ called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ illing out of the body here .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
but we 're beginning to see a sea change .

for the first time , I identified as somebody living with depression , and I felt good about it -- like I was@@ n 't a bad person for it .

( la@@ ughter ) You 're much more likely to catch the joy of human bon@@ ding .
it 's not hard science , but I worked with a lot people I know who 've lived with depression to refine these suggestions .
I have a friend who , a while back , when I was having a de@@ pressive episode , reached out and said , " He@@ y , I want to check in with you .

so that 's a lot of dos and don '@@ ts and may@@ bes , and it 's not by any means a definitive list .
the thing to remember is that they 're all grounded in one guiding principle .
and these at@@ oms are extremely durable .
not only is the vast majority of our bodies made of oxygen , but oxygen is the one element fighting to protect life on earth .
and for a brilliant month , one super@@ no@@ va explosion can be brigh@@ ter than an entire gal@@ axy containing billions of stars .
so , sadly , from the perspective of an astro@@ phy@@ sic@@ ist , the conditions in the centers of these explo@@ ding stars CA@@ N@@ NOT be recre@@ ated in a laboratory .
these simul@@ ations can be used to really understand how gas beha@@ ves under such extreme conditions .
this implies that somewhere in the universe , there 's a super@@ no@@ va explosion every second or so .
the most famous of all of them is probably the super@@ no@@ va explosion that gave rise to the Cra@@ b Ne@@ bul@@ a .
a few of them were able to be assembled in a cloud .

the problem is that vaccines are delicate organisms really , and they need to be stored between two degrees and eight degrees .

a recent study by Oxford University showed that in the recent Swedish elections , one third of all of the information spreading on social media about the election was fake or mis@@ information .
and what we did in this paper was we compared the spread of true news to the spread of false news .
when we saw this , we were at once worried but also curious .
so we looked at this too -- we used multiple sophisticated bot @@@ -@@ @ detection algorithms to find the bo@@ ts in our data and to pull them out .
fake video , fake audio that is very convincing to the human eye .
there are about five different paths that I can think of that we can follow to try and address some of these very difficult problems today .
the first one is lab@@ eling .
think about it this way : when you go to the gro@@ cery store to buy food to consume , it 's extensively lab@@ eled .
you know how many cal@@ ories it has , how much fat it contains -- and yet when we consume information , we have no labels whatsoever .
and if we want to know social media 's effect on society , we need scientists , researchers and others to have access to this kind of information .
so , Facebook and the other social media platforms are facing what I call a transparency parad@@ ox .
technology devised to root out and understand fake news , how it spreads , and to try and dam@@ pen its flow .
and that 's potentially incredibly dangerous .
thank you very much .
and the governments don 't trust them back .
the identity is doubled with a strong digital signature that is accepted , used and legally binding both in Estonia and the European Union .
a second principle , and one of the most transformative , is called " On@@ ce only . "
this distributed approach also avo@@ ids the problem of the single point of failure .
and secondly , every time they 're making requests , this is saved in a log file .
if everything is location @@@ -@@ @ independent and I can access all of the services from anywhere in the world , why CA@@ N@@ NOT others tap into some of these services , even if they don 't reside within Estonian borders ?
thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) But even though it was a just a tiny step , it was a giant leap from what I 'd achieved when I was all in one piece .
now , don 't look so surprised .
we 've stopped actually asking really tough questions about what is the difference between value creation and value extraction , productive and un@@ productive activities .
so what I want to do is bring you back 300 years in economic thinking , when , actually , the term was contested .
they then really worried about what was happening to that value when it was produced .
what the T@@ abl@@ eau Econom@@ ique does -- and I 've tried to make it a bit simpler here for you -- is it broke down the classes in society into three .
the farmers , creating value , were called the " productive class . "
and their focus , as the focus of the physi@@ oc@@ rats , was , in fact , on these objective conditions of production .
consumers are maximizing their so @@@ -@@ @ called utility , which is a proxy for happiness , and firms are maximizing their profits .
it affects how we measure growth .
I mentioned it affects how we think about output .
they called it the " banking problem , " like , " Oh my God , this thing is huge , and we 're not even including it . "
well , mechan@@ ization has for centuries , actually , taken jobs , but as long as profits were being rein@@ vested back into production , then it did@@ n 't matter : new jobs appeared .
the price of their labor is revealing their value .
but this becomes ta@@ ut@@ ological , of course .
this required the public sector , the private sector , to invest and inno@@ vate in all sorts of ways , not just around aer@@ onau@@ tics .
and I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form .
as I will show to you , it is actually the main@@ stay of modern life .
so I 'm going to ba@@ ke bread for you .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre @@@ -@@ @ packaged , which I 'm told is called a Won@@ der@@ bread .
here we go . I want to see a show of hands .
it brought us power . it brought us mechan@@ ization , fertilizers .
now you may prefer this lo@@ af of bread .
and that is the result , directly , of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production .
and as it became cheaper , bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things .
and that 's not only true in this country , it is true all over the world .
the costs have been tremendous -- water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habitats .
and this is where I have to query all of you .
how many of you actually can make a bread in this way , without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor ?
this is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread .
let 's go back to small @@@ -@@ @ scale , to farmers ' markets , small bak@@ eries and all that . " wonderful .
and meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular is what drives the prices of cereals .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
that 's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years .
and let me just do one simple conceptual thing : if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale .
we 've moved towards large @@@ -@@ @ scale and very high control .
that 's where we should move .
that is not necessary .
we need more science and not less . and we need good science .
we do not need to spill the water if we don 't want to .
and we also need to re @@@ -@@ @ examine livestock .
I want to see fish pon@@ ds in parking lots and bas@@ ements .
but there is something you must do . it 's not enough for me to say , " Let 's get more bold science into agriculture . "
and above all , to me , food is about respect .
never before , as I said , has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few .
it 's about sharing . it 's about honesty . it 's about identity .
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
eat it , and feel privileged .
thank you very much .
and within just a couple years , San Francisco became the first no @@@ -@@ @ kill city , running no deficit , completely supported by the community .
and he went to Ren@@ o and he did it again .
( la@@ ughter ) So we shift gears for a minute , and say , " I know : television ; advertising . push push .
I have a better mou@@ se@@ trap .
the quick little diagram of it is , you 're up here , and you are pushing it out to the world .
this method -- mass marketing -- requires average ideas , because you 're going to the masses , and plenty of ads .
what we 've done as sp@@ amm@@ ers is tried to hy@@ p@@ no@@ tize everyone into buying our idea , hy@@ p@@ no@@ tize everyone into don@@ ating to our cause , hy@@ p@@ no@@ tize everyone into voting for our candidate .
you 've got the red @@@ -@@ @ hat tri@@ athletes over there .
that people on the fr@@ ing@@ es can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking .
and that what fire@@ men do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down , and they burn it down instead , and practice putting it out .
( la@@ ughter ) You know the pir@@ ate tribe is a fascinating one .
so when Al G@@ ore set out to change the world again , he did@@ n 't do it by himself .
he did it by creating a movement .
it 's easy to look at what I 've said so far , and say , " Wa@@ it a minute , I don 't have what it takes to be that kind of leader . "
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
when Di@@ ane Hat@@ z worked on " The Me@@ atri@@ x , " her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated , she did@@ n 't inv@@ ent the idea of being a ve@@ gan .
that here@@ tics look at the status quo and say , " This will not stand . I can 't abide this status quo .
I see what the status quo is ; I don 't like it . "
being a leader gives you char@@ is@@ ma .
but when I went to architecture school , it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family .
and I did@@ n 't know what I was doing -- like I said , mid @@@ -@@ @ 20@@ s -- and I 'm the Internet generation , so we started a website .
this is a shipping container .
and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10 , 15 kilometers to see doctors , you get the doctors to the people .
this is a ken@@ af clinic .
so you can see ideas .
and we 're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV / AIDS rate .
and we met , literally , a couple of months ago .
and what that means is we actually live and work with the community , and they 're part of the design process .
we hear about them all the time .
ca : let 's just leave it up for a sec .
they went upwards like this .
it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa .
the difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent , and it is even bigger among women .
see the difference within one African country -- it goes from very low level to very high level , and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest .
but , there is one part of Africa -- and the difficult thing is , at the same time , not to make a uniform statement about Africa , not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this , on one hand .
it could be con@@ currency .
vod@@ ka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
they just wanted to live in their country safely .
the criminal prosecutions for crossing illegally .
of course , some people will still need to seek asylum at the border .
he said , even though he had@@ n 't received a visa this year , he w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't risk all of his future chances by crossing illegally .
picking fruit , cleaning cra@@ bs , landscap@@ ing in a 100 @@@ -@@ @ degree heat .
the expansion of guest worker visas to Mexic@@ ans has been among the most significant humane changes in US immigration policy ever .
the US issued just one guest worker visa to a Central American for every 78 who crossed the border illegally in 2019 .
it needs to create new guest worker visas specifically for Central Americans .
how much would a low @@@ -@@ @ wage job help a Hondur@@ an , like Juan or Cin@@ tia ?
of course , a new guest worker program will not resolve 100 percent of this complex phenomenon .
while unloading , the train frequently moves back and forth , so a typical sequence might look like this .
the members of the resistance have positioned a crane over the train tracks that can pl@@ uck the arti@@ fact once it 's exposed .
but the only way H@@ edge can determine the train 's position and know when to lower the force field is by analyzing the unloading procedure , because he 'll be inside the w@@ indow@@ less engine car .
the second is to hit the button when the train is in just the right position .
fortunately , we now live in a time when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem .
this feedback really excited me , because too few students do see themselves as scientists .
in addition , academic research has shown that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention .
when we were creating Bio@@ Di@@ ve , again , we really wanted to focus on access , so we designed it to require only one phone for every four students .
" the students were totally engaged . "
" I liked how it felt like I was there . "
eventually we began asking what they wished they could do .
we focused on science , because we know we need scientists to help us solve our current and future challenges .
thank you .
what is the most beautiful place you have ever been ?
I could go on and on here m@@ using about the intr@@ ic@@ acies of this planet and the way that it makes me feel .
when you 're communicating through an image , every creative choice matters .
as a photographer , I 've really had to check myself on this .
is@@ n 't that what we should be doing anyway ?
but what I 'm trying to show you is that the phone or camera do@@ es@@ n 't have to stay out all the time .
would it feel like a limitation ?
well , the next time you feel the impulse to take out your camera or phone , or , in my case , once you realize you have already pulled it out -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) First : stop .
we have everything we need except political will to meet the challenge , and it 's an enormous challenge .
PM : so J@@ ane , we should also explain , because many people who are here are thinking , what can they do ?
J@@ F : first of all , you want to try not do anything as a l@@ one individual .
you know , it 's by our powers combined .
my grand@@ kids just got arrested last weekend .
and in order for everybody to be involved , they have to see something in it for themselves , and that 's what a Green New De@@ al does .
so I feel very hopeful .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you very much , my friend .
stay safe .
thank you for all that you have done for the planet and so much else .
the third set of ideas are what I call as " ideas that we argue about " -- those are ideas where we have a fight , an ideological battle about how to do things .
India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next 30 years .
so we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment , and really has changed the way Indians think of technology .
and then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization .
but today , as Indian companies go abroad , as Indians come and work all over the world , Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in .
but today democracy has become a bottom @@@ -@@ @ up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice , the benefits of being in an open society .
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society , but you are not able to implement those things .
unfortunately the government schools don 't function , so children are going to private schools today .
but today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
and that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see .
the final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you did@@ n 't think of India as a market , you did@@ n 't really b@@ other about a single market , because it did@@ n 't really matter .
what are those ideas ? one is , I think , are ideological issues .
this policy is causing grid@@ lock .
it 's very difficult to start a private university .
a billion people , 1 / 6th of the world population .
and then you take a mouse , and you put the mouse in the jar , OK ?
and so you can do that in m@@ ice and you can do it in mon@@ keys , because you can physically put things into their brain but for some reason we still can 't do that in humans , OK ?
so instead , we 've invented all these pro@@ x@@ ies .
the other thing that you can do is you can do this -- electro@@ ence@@ ph@@ alo@@ graphy -- you can put these electro@@ des on your head , OK ?
but actually , in the year 2100 most things are surprisingly recogn@@ izable .
and the risk , whenever you put something into the brain tissue , is essentially that of stroke .
but we we@@ ren 't quite there yet .
I mean , who wants to ho@@ ok their brain up to their computers ?
and that 's what really opened the way to major insights from medicine .
and some of it is .
I don 't actually know if we 're going to be drilling hundreds or thousands of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic holes in our heads in 30 years .
that is the future of neuro@@ science .
it 's a strain of bacteria that 's found in the soil where it lives in a community with other organisms , decom@@ posing organic matter .
that it produces these pig@@ ment molecules spar@@ ked my curi@@ osity and led me to collaborate closely with co@@ el@@ ic@@ ol@@ or .
we 're living in a world where the denial of this dependence has become deadly .
they mu@@ st@@ n 't perpetuate the destructive leg@@ acies of the oil age .
well in nature , these transformations are part of a complex network -- a continuous cycle that re@@ distribu@@ tes energy .
fer@@ mentation gives rise to multi@@ species interactions of bacteria and fun@@ gi , plants , insects , animals and humans : in other words , whole ecosystems .
you can see how through the fer@@ mentation of grains , vege@@ tal matter and animal products , all peoples and cultures of the world have domes@@ tic@@ ated micro@@ organisms to make the ine@@ di@@ ble edi@@ ble .
the sk@@ ele@@ tal remains of some Sudanese Nu@@ bian were found to contain significant deposits of te@@ trac@@ ycl@@ ine .
and since the oil age completely transformed the textile industry , many of the materials and the chemicals used to process them are petroleum based .
if a bacteria produces a pig@@ ment , how do we work with it to dy@@ e textiles ?
now , if you add many , many cells , they generate enough d@@ ye@@ stuff to sat@@ ur@@ ate the entire cloth .
and you can see how this process generates very little run@@ off and produces a color@@ fast pig@@ ment without the use of any chemicals .
it 's actually connected to a suite of automated hardware and software that read in real time and feed back to a design team the growth conditions of the micro@@ be .
so in this case -- in the last week actually , I 've just designed a pe@@ tr@@ i dish that is engineered to produce a bes@@ po@@ ke print on a whole garment .
there are others who are building capacity in this field , like My@@ co@@ Works .
it is living ; it is digital ; it is designed , and it can be craf@@ ted .
but while Ball@@ an@@ ty@@ ne 's book promised readers " pleasure ... profit ... and un@@ b@@ ounded am@@ us@@ ement , " Gol@@ ding 's had dar@@ ker things in store .
" Lord of the F@@ lies " opens with the boys already on the island , but sn@@ ip@@ pets of conversation h@@ int at their terri@@ fying journey - their plane had been shot down in the midst of an unspecified nuclear war .
just as in Ball@@ an@@ ty@@ ne 's " Cor@@ al Island , " the boy 's new home appears to be a paradise - with fresh water , shelter , and abundant food sources .
while island adventure stories often support colonialism , " Lord of the F@@ lies " turns this tro@@ pe on its head .
take nothing : do no harm .
from pl@@ unde@@ rer to recovering pl@@ unde@@ rer , to America 's green@@ est CEO in five years -- that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CE@@ Os in 1999 .
so the equation is conceptual .
now , the mathem@@ atically @@@ -@@ @ minded will see immediately that T in the numer@@ ator increases impact -- a bad thing -- but T in the denomin@@ ator decreases impact .
so I ask , " What would move T , technology , from the numer@@ ator -- call it T@@ 1 -- where it increases impact , to the denomin@@ ator -- call it T@@ 2 -- where it reduces impact ?

and so I brought a water vessel up with me today , because I want it to hold the memories of our conversation today .
we have to start to think about how do we connect to water .
usually , someone might ask you , " What is water ? "
we often imagine that the world is filled with infinite water .
we can start to honor the original treaties between Indigenous peoples and non @@@ -@@ @ Indigenous peoples for water protection .
you can advocate for granting legal person@@ hood to water .
and most of all , you can connect to water .
and to the extent you believe I did@@ n 't shr@@ ink the lines , which I did@@ n 't , I 've proven to you that your eyes were decei@@ ving you .
( la@@ ughter ) You can 't look at this and say , " Now I see reality as it is . "
there is no way for us not to see this illusion .
I guess maybe if you 're color@@ blind , I don 't think you can see that .
we 're ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily designed to use vision .
these are different countries in Europe .
you know the expression , " Beg@@ ging only gets you so far . "
so what are they doing ?
now , you might say , " These are decisions we don 't care about . "
they said , " Here is a patient . he is a 67 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old farmer .
he 's been suffering from right hip pain for a while . "
and then , they said to the physicians , " You decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient .
then they said to half of the physicians , " Ye@@ sterday , you reviewed the patient 's case , and you realized that you for@@ got to try one medication .
the majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement .
now , weekend in Paris , weekend in Rome -- these are different things .
this was an ad in The Econom@@ ist a few years ago that gave us three choices : an online subscription for 59 dollars , a print subscription for 125 dollars , or you could get both for 125 .
the next thing I know , the ad is gone , no explanation .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don 't know our preferences that well .

and these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we 're faced with today .
and what I 'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film ?
it 's endless what you can imagine , in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience .

and it 's not about the blood , as Fre@@ ud would have you say , because if it were , there would be an ear , nose and throat surgeon up here right now , talking about the tabo@@ os of nose ble@@ eds , right ?
and then when religion came along , purity my@@ ths only made that worse .

and I 'm not going to stand for it .
this story starts at the very beginning , when din@@ osa@@ urs were just getting their start .

you 'd think that would be impossible , that violence at this level would be un@@ be@@ arable , but it 's actually quite be@@ arable to people like you and me .
violence is so concentrated that we 're shocked when the pattern devi@@ ates .

we have 120 partner institutions all over the world , in all those countries colored orange .
and they collect the seeds . all over the world .
you kind of sho@@ vel them all in to bags and dry them off .
so all around the world people are doing the same thing .
so in habitats that have already been damaged , like the tall grass pra@@ i@@ rie here in the USA , or in mined land in various countries , restoration is already happening because of these species -- and because of this collection .
the future research is " How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds , without having to plant them every 10 years ? "
since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology , they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women .
for , in truth , we had moved light years from the pas@@ sions that animated them .
and within that one , to continually narrow the focus , learning more and more about less and less ; this , despite the evidence all around us of the inter@@ connec@@ tedness of things .
as one moves up the lad@@ der , values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion .
but the balances red@@ ressed , our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance .
the challenge : to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .
in the language of my students , " De@@ ep thought matters when you 're contempl@@ ating what to do about things that matter . "
social activists , business leaders , lawyers , politicians , professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good .
it under@@ cuts self @@@ -@@ @ righteousness , radically al@@ ters the tone and character of controversy , and enrich@@ es dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground .
we persist also in being sidel@@ ined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers , despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
the problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts , ze@@ alo@@ ts , politicians and spectators .
but this single @@@ -@@ @ min@@ de@@ dness will not yield the flexi@@ bilities of mind , the multiplicity of perspectives , the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs .
so what do you do when you feel overwhel@@ med ?
well , you have two things .
and what would you do ? it 's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important , and really reflect on the world around us .

this is a need for power , and they 're willing to go through this massive transformation , on this scale , to get that power .
this is one of the biggest shoe factories , the Yu@@ yuan shoe factory near Shen@@ zh@@ en . it has 9@@ 0,000 employees making shoes .
in fact , even Shen@@ zh@@ en , the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people , and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million .
so they 'll put 20 or 40 up at a time , and they just go up in the same way as a single @@@ -@@ @ family dwelling would go up here in an area .
and you can see in the foreg@@ round of this picture , it 's still one of the last areas that was being held up .
it was@@ n 't too bad , but they 're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .
so you have about 12 people running this , and they 're just inspec@@ ting it -- and they 're just walking the lines .
here 's something that 's far more labor @@@ -@@ @ intensive , which is the making of shoes .
this is a high @@@ -@@ @ tech mobile phone : bird mobile phone , one of the largest mobile makers in China .
they make co@@ ffe@@ em@@ akers here , the biggest co@@ ffe@@ em@@ aker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world .
these are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago , so you 're the first ones to be seeing these , these new factory pictures I 've taken .
that 's cu@@ bed metal . this is ar@@ mat@@ ures , electrical ar@@ mat@@ ures , where they 're getting the copper and the high @@@ -@@ @ end steel from electrical motors out , and recycling them .
wish one : world @@@ -@@ @ changing . I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability .
whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements , about how to change our world in a better way , quickly .
and so for me , one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the World@@ chan@@ g@@ ing.com website .
and to teach them , to me , would be a fantastic wish , and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into .
that 's a billion @@@ -@@ @ fold increase in capability per dollar that we 've actually experienced since I was a student .
I mean this went through thick and thin , through war and peace , through boom times and rec@@ essions .
we 'll see the same thing in the economic recession we 're having now .
so we 're very appreci@@ ative of the support we 've gotten from both the intellectual leaders , the high @@@ -@@ @ tech leaders , particularly Google and NASA .
they produce oxygen , they consume CO2 , and they form the base of the food web on which every other form of ocean life is reliant .

and this is a program that for 31 years has made this monthly pilgri@@ mage to a spot called Station A@@ lo@@ ha .

CO2 rises in the atmosphere , CO2 rises in the ocean .
this is genuinely one of the most remote places on our planet , and we 've impacted the top 500 meters of the water column .
we just CA@@ N@@ NOT go too far down this path .
it involves a portfolio of solutions , local change , but all the way up to voting for people who will protect our environment on a global scale .

Mr. Lev@@ ine was kind and pol@@ ite to me .
and then Mr. Lev@@ ine turned to me and offered me the deck , and said , " P@@ ick a card . "
and the words got burned into my brain .
I just kept on practicing .
and then I bought some magic books , and I bought some more magic books .
there 's a very , very thin line between a hob@@ by and in@@ san@@ ity .
so if you ever know somebody who needs help , if you know somebody who is sca@@ red , be kind to them .

so my hope is that when you leave TED , you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it .
and one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity .
so what about circuit break@@ ers ?
now , every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network .
hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location , or even a cell phone .
there are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone .
and there began to be a pattern in all of these stories I was being told .
they established a boundary of production in drawing up these rules .
so on one side of the boundary , everything where there was a market exchange was counted .
so I thought , let 's see how many non@@ primary producers we have here today .
how many of you have done a bit of cleaning , a bit of vacu@@ um@@ ing , a bit of sweeping , a bit of ti@@ dying up the kitchen ?
preparing food ? cleaning up afterwards ?
yes .
it do@@ es@@ n 't count at all .
when we 're mining it , when we 're de@@ fo@@ resting , when we 're deleting our environment , when we 're fishing out our marine resources , legal or illegal , as long as market is exchanged , it 's all good for growth .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " Rel@@ ying on per capita GDP , relying on these growth figures , " they said , " do@@ es@@ n 't appear to be the best way to proceed to make public policy . "
you see , to measure GDP , you have to assume that some kind of production or service delivery or consumption occurs inside a nation @@@ -@@ @ state , and you know where that is .
you can 't locate time poverty .
and no , we 're not supposed to use assets from the unpaid sector to make money in the market sector .
this is confusing !
you 'll immediately start recognizing what it means .
you look at the trade @@@ -@@ @ offs .
economists want to turn everything into a monetary exchange , even time use data , so that they can carry on trying to decide whether GDP is up or down .
but even for successful males who manage to avoid w@@ ing@@ ed pre@@ dat@@ ors , this m@@ ating f@@ ren@@ zy will prove lethal .
then , she starts dig@@ ging a des@@ cending tunnel ending in a chamber .

I was there to see Nelson Mandela released from prison , and I watched an entire country begin a major transformation .
I make sculp@@ tures like " FO@@ RE@@ V@@ ER " as a way of giving physical , tangible forms to language and time .
so you look up and you see this .
but after we imagine it , we actually have to believe it 's possible .
and then we have to find common ground with people we would maybe otherwise disagree with and work together towards that mutual goal .
what do you want to see change or happen for everyone , for the planet ?
I am the proud father of two beautiful children , Eli@@ jah , 15 , and Oc@@ ta@@ via , 12 .
it had been a long day , and she was tired of oppression , and she did@@ n 't give up her seat .
she was thinking about her grand@@ father , a gun @@@ -@@ @ to@@ ting , take @@@ -@@ @ no @@@ -@@ @ m@@ ess grand@@ father .
and Eli@@ jah said , " D@@ ad , I have a better idea . "
I 'm sitting around amongst intellectuals , and I read the draft of the book .
and little F@@ red says , " It 'll be OK , Ma@@ bel . it 'll be OK . it 'll be OK . "
and yet , you were calling her by her first name every single day that she worked , and you never thought about it . "
this story is about you . "
and she 'd found herself y@@ elling at you .
well , what I would say to you is , there was a time in which , if you were Jewish , you were not white , if you were Italian , you were not white , if you were Irish , you were not white in this country .
it took a while before the Irish , the Jews and the It@@ alians became white .
T@@ oni Mor@@ rison said , " If , in order for you to be tall , I have to be on my knees , you have a serious problem . "
that , ladies and gent@@ lemen , is a heart attack .
but we had a little bit over an hour where we could 've saved this pig 's life .
and what we tried was this ; here is a device called the Cad@@ well Model ME@@ S@@ 10 .
this is what an a@@ ura looks like .
the z@@ ap@@ per creates a magnetic field to counteract that .
I also put in here the stress response .
but unfortunately , we need this system in part .
we really have two command posts .
and of course we know this intu@@ i@@ tively , that happiness is not just the absence of misery .
we use this word " happy , " and it 's this very large umbrella of a term .
we are very sensitive to the negative , but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a posi@@ tivity .
we 're also born pleasure @@@ -@@ @ seekers .
they like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces .
there was once a statement made by a psych@@ ologist that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes , and it 's as difficult to become hap@@ pier as it is to become t@@ all@@ er .
there is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes -- about 50 percent -- but there is still that 50 percent that is un@@ accounted for .
it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't eat . it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't sleep . it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have sex .
ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts use it more than intro@@ ver@@ ts .
so to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so .
they abandoned the log boat base for a ke@@ el plan@@ k , and the boats became higher and more sea@@ worthy .
those are the only responses that govern democratic thinking on the internet .
creating a good cartoon involves repeated failures , draft after draft .
and I knew that I cou@@ ld@@ n 't allow my happiness to see@@ p into my work , that I should take the higher road and respect people 's grief .
it was in the middle of the night that the idea came to me .
narr@@ ator : Lyn@@ n Ver@@ insky , a professional clim@@ ber , who appeared to be bri@@ m@@ ming with confidence .
Lyn@@ n Ver@@ insky : honestly , it 's going to be perfectly safe . it will be perfectly safe .
and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stan@@ ford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot .
you see something on it . it 's not just to look like a g@@ ec@@ ko .
the engineers told us , for the climbing robots , that , if they don 't have a tail , they fall off the wall .
well we know that tails store fat , for example .
and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance .
( la@@ ughter ) It can also act as a counter@@ balance .
so we then went back and looked at the animal .
and watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it sli@@ ps . this is slowed down 10 times .
and watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
this is incredible .
the engineers had a really good idea .
and they get to the top and let 's say there 's some leaves there .
and we 're going to attempt the first air @@@ -@@ @ righ@@ ting response in a tail , with a robot .
ok@@ ay , there it goes .
so the wind is coming from the bottom . this is slowed down 10 times .
and it 's better than that , it -- just in the slide -- maneu@@ vers in mid @@@ -@@ @ air .
it 's un@@ beli@@ evable .
so to conclude , I think we need to build biom@@ u@@ tu@@ al@@ isms , like I showed , that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application .
we professionals love to make choices for others , especially for the poor .
let me share an experience .
now this was a personal un@@ learning moment for me , where I realized that poverty only changes affordability -- it does not change aspirations .
( la@@ ughter ) And everybody loved this option that had a lo@@ ft in it , simply because it did two things .
one is that it accommodated larger families to sleep in .
many come back from work to find out that their houses do not exist , because they have either been bull@@ do@@ zed , or they have been burned down .
and suddenly I was on the phone to my stock@@ broker and my real estate agent , when I should have been talking to my clients .
and reaching success , I always did what I loved .
and that was great .
I 've also lived in Bi@@ osphere 2 .
here in Bi@@ osphere 1 , well it takes me about two minutes , because I pick up the phone and I call and say , " He@@ y , can you deliver the piz@@ za ? "
back in the mid@@ - ' 8@@ 0s when we were designing Bi@@ osphere 2 , we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions .
( la@@ ughter ) And this is the world that we lived in .
and then also we had the human habitat of course , with the laboratories , and all of that .
when I breath@@ ed out , my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing .
people must have thought I was nuts .
in Bi@@ osphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my bi@@ osphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very vis@@ cer@@ ally , very literally .
and all of it was coming from this : shri@@ mp farms .
around the world today we 're seeing an incredible transformation , from what I would call a bio@@ cid@@ al species , one that -- whether we intentionally or un@@ intentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
and on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out , and I want to thro@@ ttle them .
this is what happens every spring . for six weeks , six to eight weeks , I have this fl@@ ush of green o@@ asis .
after a few days , the sides of the first layer , called the primary cell wall , sti@@ ff@@ en , pushing cell growth in one direction and causing the fiber to elong@@ ate .
I 'm talking about , like , those shri@@ e@@ ks and squ@@ e@@ als that f@@ ang@@ ir@@ ls let out at concerts .
why ?
( la@@ ughter ) But tell me , according to this research , when do you reck@@ on boys begin to perform and alter their voices ?
that those are not man@@ ly sounds .
we can all die tomorrow , so why not love things while we 're still breathing ?
can I get you all to stand up ?
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
it 's easy to feel totally overwhel@@ med .
not once .
really sca@@ red of any change , it 's so -- I can 't even think about it , it 's like , un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . "
and a double bind is when we feel sort of like , dam@@ ned if you do , and dam@@ ned if you don 't , and you 're just kind of stuck there .
and so a lot of fol@@ ks who are seeing the urgency of the situation are like , " We 've got to motivate you .
and we become cheer@@ leaders for solutions .
it 's like , what the hec@@ k is going on , right ?
so imagine that you go see a therap@@ ist , and you 've got a double bind .
you 're feeling really stuck , you know you 've got to change and the therap@@ ist starts shou@@ ting at you and saying , " Don 't you see what 's happening ?
what 's it going to take ? "
here 's some simple things you can do .
I love this concept so much .
and att@@ un@@ ement is when we 're feeling in syn@@ c , when we feel understood and we feel accepted for exactly where we are .
right ?
when the stakes are high , let me tell you , it 's very hard to want to att@@ une with anything , when we 're facing such urgent threats .
and so it starts with actually tuning in to " how am I feeling ? "
I know it 's easy to say but really being comp@@ assi@@ onate , it 's like , these are hard issues .
I don 't know what all the answers are . "
it 's like , " Here we are .
so here 's the thing , all of this work exists , we have the tools to create these conditions that can allow us to show up as our brilliant selves .
have compassion for ourselves and one another in this moment , time in history , so we collectively process these painful tru@@ ths , these difficult realities .
and I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation .
and so a plan came up to video the vote .
what matters here is@@ n 't technical capital , it 's social capital .
these tools don 't get socially interesting until they get technologically b@@ oring .
this is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century .
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to .
the media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups .
and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
if you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
whereas the phone gave us the one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one pattern , and television , radio , magazines , books , gave us the one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ many pattern , the Internet gives us the many @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ many pattern .
and finally the Chinese crac@@ ked down .
and so they began to arrest the protesters .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by am@@ ate@@ urs .
and in fact that is happening this week .
national message . targeted individuals .
but that 's not the really crazy change that we 're living in the middle of .
as recently at last decade , most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals .
they had understood that their role with my@@ BO@@ .com was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters .
and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media .
at any given moment , tril@@ lions of cells are traveling through your blood vessels , sometimes circl@@ ing the body in just one minute .
mar@@ row contains fat and other supportive tissue , but its most essential elements are blood stem cells .
through the cap@@ ill@@ aries , they reach larger blood vessels and exit the bone .
most commonly , blood stem cells are filtered out of the donor 's blood@@ stream by circulating the blood through a machine that separ@@ ates it into different components .
just a small population of blood stem cells can regener@@ ate a whole body 's worth of healthy mar@@ row .
but even if a patient avo@@ ids gra@@ ft @@@ -@@ @ versus @@@ -@@ @ host disease , their immune system may reject the donor cells .
but many patients who need a bone mar@@ row trans@@ plant don 't have a matched family member .
those patients turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone mar@@ row .
thirteen point eight billion years ago , the universe as we know it began with a big ban@@ g , and everything that we know and are and are made of was created .
others call it " The Great Le@@ ap Forward , " which I prefer .
it 's so much more poe@@ tic .
these symbols connected like @@@ -@@ @ minded people , and they are all extraordinary .
but why is the Sw@@ o@@ os@@ h so popular ?
if you went shopping for bott@@ led water , you 'd have over 80 options to choose from .
two months later , on January 21 , 2017 , millions of people all over the world wore hand@@ made pink p@@ us@@ sy@@ h@@ ats in support of the Women 's March all over the world .
this is the leg of a suicide bom@@ ber .
and how I 've come to view what happened to me is a viral , mem@@ e@@ tic infection .
now , much later , the Europeans are the ones who inno@@ vate and come up with the comp@@ ass rose .
you might know it as the Renaissance .
so you can go off and explore , and find out what is over that next hill or that next horizon , but you can also reliably find your way home .
now , to test these ideas , we were thinking about what we can do as the first scene to try it out .
there 's no possibility to hide a pun@@ ch or not show the action .
this obviously opens possibilities for an enormous amount of stor@@ yt@@ elling and methodologies of creation .
in order to [ create ] our explor@@ ations , we part@@ nered with Par@@ amount Pictures in order to explore immer@@ sive media in a Hollywood movie production .
we declared small@@ po@@ x eradicated in 1980 .
you should see it from the perspective of a mother , watching her child develop this disease and standing by helpl@@ essly .
this is confl@@ u@@ ent small@@ po@@ x , in which there is@@ n 't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by le@@ sions .
but the key to eradicating polio is early detection , early response .
in your TED packages there 's a DVD , " In@@ finite Vision , " about Dr. V and the Ara@@ v@@ ind E@@ ye Hospital .
it is a lit@@ any .
and let 's add satellite confirmation .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : an amazing presentation .
they reported this to WHO .
who took a little while taking action , because WHO will only receive a report from a government , because it 's the United Nations .
these bad viruses really don 't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French .
this is a tre@@ ph@@ inated sk@@ ull .
and Tre@@ ph@@ ination is simply just cutting a hole in the sk@@ ull .
now we 've got the dawn of interven@@ tional surgery here .
now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the B@@ ron@@ ze Age and beyond .
but surge@@ ons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold , tre@@ ph@@ inating ancestors .
because we were in the age before an@@ esthe@@ sia , the ag@@ ony of the patient is really as much of the public spectac@@ le as the surgery itself .
I mean who would put themselves through that ?
and infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery , which was as@@ ep@@ tic technique .
trans@@ plantation : you could take an organ out of one person , you could put it in another person , and it would work .
and during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher .
this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of la@@ par@@ os@@ cop@@ ic experience .
you 've got these long instruments , and you 're working off your c@@ enter@@ line .
and the reason why this becomes so much easier is -- you can see on the bottom -- the hands are making the motions , and the instruments are following those motions exactly .
you have a 3D camera , so you get a 3D view .
with all its bel@@ ls and whi@@ stles , one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon .
more useful than a solid gold surgeon , but , still , it 's a fairly big capital investment .
but once you 've got it , your procedure costs do come down .
but there are other barriers .
but if you need to reach more places than just one , you need to move the robot .
for the patient , however , it 's transparent . this is all they 're going to see .
and we can take special cameras , and we can look at it .
we can heal the disease .
these mal@@ ad@@ ies come for us all .
when you ask the question , " What does money mean to you , " most people will say things like , " I feel anxious . "
once you 've done that , then you get real .
[ 4 : ... and then really picture it . ] Vis@@ u@@ alize what you 're really trying to accomplish .
so if we break it down , go get a poster board .
take magazine pictures , cut it all out .
and when you make that mis@@ step , no judgment , no shame .
just get back at it .
" baby d@@ add@@ y , " for those not in the know , refers to an individual who helps to con@@ ceive a child but does little else .
for a lot of us in that hood , there was only one person you could already turn to for food , shelter , warmth , love , discipline : our mothers .
in an ideal world , both parents share the weight of the work appropriately .
L@@ il@@ ah 's mother and I have a schedule .
as a co @@@ -@@ @ parent , L@@ il@@ ah and I have built snow@@ men , we 've played with ac@@ or@@ ns , we 've rap@@ ped to the sound@@ track of " Mo@@ ana , " I know you have , too .
both of us , as co @@@ -@@ @ parents , have unique paren@@ ting styles .
right ?
Philip Zim@@ bar@@ do : let 's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam 's temptation .
" come on Adam , don 't be so w@@ ish@@ y @@@ -@@ @ wash@@ y . take a b@@ ite . " " I did . "

Walter Mis@@ ch@@ el , my colleague at Stan@@ ford , went back 14 years later , to try to discover what was different about those kids .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT .
their focus is always about anticipated consequences .
there is two ways to be past @@@ -@@ @ oriented , two ways to be future .
so I want to end by saying : many of life 's pu@@ zzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
so , I was fu@@ rious .
a form of leak that I saw was actually what we call account compromise .
so your G@@ mail account , your Twitter account , your In@@ st@@ agra@@ m account , your i@@ Cl@@ oud , your Apple ID , your Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , your T@@ ik@@ T@@ ok -- I had to figure out what a T@@ ik@@ T@@ ok was .
furthermore , people who are intimate , who know a lot about each other , can guess each other 's security questions .
I think that for one sample that I looked at I had something like a result of seven out of 60 of the platforms recognized the stal@@ ker@@ ware that I was testing .
well , the conventional approach to post @@@ -@@ @ conflict situations has rested on , on kind of , three principles .
and then the second step is to say , " The situation is admittedly dangerous , but only for a short time . "
you can only get positive , that mental shift , if the reality is that prosperity is being built .
but the objective of facing reality is to change reality .
and that needs to be recognized , first of all , that peacekeeping works .
it does increase security .
the second actor , different cast of guys , is the donors .
you can do that quite fast .
so this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy .
so the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside the tent .
if the Security Council do@@ es@@ n 't commit to security over the course of a decade , you don 't get the reas@@ surance which produces private investment .
one is improvements in basic services -- especially health , which is a disaster during conflict .
there is@@ n 't any construction going on . and so the sector shri@@ vels away .
neither of those approaches is sensible .
if we follow this , what would we hope to achieve ?
imagine -- it 's like more than the entire population of my dear Madrid will be wi@@ ped out in one year .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT stop breathing and , in addition , we need , every day , around 10,000 lit@@ ers of air .
so , almost everybody is exposed to air pollution .
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
take a look at Chan@@ ging the Pres@@ ent , started by a TE@@ D@@ ster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
this tack@@ les yet another assumption , that the gi@@ ver and the organization is at the center , as opposed to putting the problem at the center .
if we don 't develop the stam@@ ina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a f@@ ad .
and everywhere I go , including here at TED , I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing .
we don 't have a language for it yet .
the question is , is there a positive social sing@@ ul@@ arity ?
and , yes , they were great philanthro@@ pi@@ sts .
and I want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
and I stood there beside two very good friends of mine , Richard We@@ ber and K@@ ev@@ in V@@ all@@ ely .
the website worked brilli@@ antly as a two @@@ -@@ @ way street of communication .
young people in northern Canada , kids in an elementary school , dra@@ gging sle@@ ds across the school @@@ -@@ @ yard , pre@@ tending they were Richard , R@@ ay and K@@ ev@@ in . amazing .
I am a neuro@@ scientist , and I focus on the inside , especially on women 's bra@@ ins .
is it lifes@@ pan ?
that 's a 30 percent drop in brain energy levels .
what mat@@ tered most was that they were in men@@ op@@ ause .
so of course we need more research to confirm this , but it looks like women 's bra@@ ins in mid@@ life are more sensitive to horm@@ onal aging than just straight up chron@@ ological aging .
it 's important .
the point here is that we really need to better understand what happens to our bra@@ ins as we go through men@@ op@@ ause , natural or medical , and how to protect our bra@@ ins in the process .
meanwhile , there are other things that we can do today to support our hormones and their effects on the brain that do not require medications but do require taking a good look at our lifestyle .
women on this diet have a much lower risk of cognitive decline , of depression , of heart disease , of stroke and of cancer , and they also have fewer hot fl@@ ashes .
some phy@@ to@@ e@@ stro@@ gens have been linked to a possible risk of cancer , but not the ones in this diet , which are safe .
thank you .
nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
and sometimes we make real plans .
problems become pu@@ zzles and obstacles disappear .
video : Y@@ ay !
you see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
and I think that 's really what architecture is based on .
it 's based on wonder .
by the way , it is a story that is told through its hard materials .
anything that has been made can be made better .
there it is : the things that I really believe are of important architecture .
it 's been missing in much of the architecture , because we think architecture is the realm of the ne@@ u@@ tered , the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion , that has no value .
and yet , I believe it is the expression -- expression of the city , expression of our own space -- that gives meaning to architecture .
so again , radical versus conservative .
it 's not just a conservation in form@@ al@@ de@@ hy@@ de of dead forms .
it 's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending .
I think that is the progress of cities .
in@@ expl@@ icable versus understood . you know , too often we want to understand everything .
but the computer should not just be the g@@ love of the hand ; the hand should really be the driver of the computing power .
I think that 's part of what the complexity of architecture is .
listening to all of you , the complexity of thought , the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming .
space is something that fol@@ ds out of itself into completely new worlds .
of course that means that architecture is political .
and I 've always believed that the act of architecture , even a private house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
therefore it is important that it be real .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
so I believe that my main interest is to memory .
so again , I think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me .
and it is about the dirty word " compromise . " compromise is not bad .
this is America . this is liberty .
at this very moment , you are viewing my upper half .
and it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but I turned him down .
and deep down , if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out .
you see , it 's not as dramatic as the tsunami .
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon .
well , why are@@ n 't we ?
in turbul@@ ent times , is@@ n 't it cheaper , and s@@ mar@@ ter , to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later ?
the regional branch managers are getting nervous .
our values : do we have any ?
our credibility ?
brand USA could use some pol@@ ishing .
and I say that as a fan , you know ?
more anti @@@ -@@ @ retro@@ vir@@ als make sense .
well , much more than we think .
most of you started out wanting to change the world , did@@ n 't you ?
well , now , actually because of you , it is possible to change the physical world .
but I know tough@@ ness when I see it .
but ide@@ alism allied with prag@@ m@@ atism , with rolling up your sle@@ eves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . it 's very real . it 's very strong .
and it 's very present in a crowd like you .
we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the w@@ anton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable .
putting it in the cra@@ ss@@ est possible terms , the investment re@@ aps huge returns .
you know , there 's lots out there .
but you know , we want , we need some air@@ time for our ideas .
I really believe that old Tr@@ uman line , that if you give the American people the facts , they 'll do the right thing .
every three seconds one person dies .

and that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference .
( la@@ ughter ) We are going to focus on Charles today , because it is Charles ' 100th birthday .

it was that human connection that Charles and R@@ ay always found in everything .
they were always trying things out .
this is an unusual installation of airport seating .
and the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host , anticip@@ ating the needs of the guest .

the other thing that 's kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design , they actually mean style .

and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .
it 's the " what " detector .

so a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visu@@ alized on this screen .

she 'd led the team developing the pioneering in @@@ -@@ @ flight software , so she knew this mission had no room for error .
but when she heard that renowned engineer Charles Dra@@ per was looking for help sending mankind to the moon , she immediately joined his team .
the astr@@ on@@ aut could then communicate with Mission Control to determine the best path forward .
and her life @@@ -@@ @ saving work went far beyond A@@ pol@@ lo 11 - no bugs were ever found in the in @@@ -@@ @ flight software for any cre@@ wed A@@ pol@@ lo missions .
I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .

here 's what happened . see that line on the very top with the little do@@ ts ?
that 's a bun@@ ch of m@@ ice that had been pois@@ oned by our scientist friends down in Texas , at Bro@@ oks Air Base , with anth@@ ra@@ x .

( la@@ ughter ) Because in town -- this is the bu@@ st@@ ling squ@@ at@@ ter city of Ki@@ ber@@ a , near Nairobi -- they see action . they see opportunity .
it is not the case that slums undermine prosperity , not the working slums ; they help create prosperity .
it 's much more interactive .
we don 't understand how it works yet , but we have to .
we are learning about how dense proximity can be .
more than half .
now , for us environ@@ ment@@ alists , maybe the green@@ est thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb .
what you 're getting is a world which is old fol@@ ks , and old cities , going around doing things the old way , in the north .
shift of subject . quickly drop by climate .
bas@@ elo@@ ad electricity is what it takes to run a city , or a city planet .
because remember , this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities .
whereas a coal @@@ -@@ @ burning plant , a normal one gig@@ aw@@ att coal plant , burns 80 rail cars of coal a day , each car having 100 tons .

so I think micro@@ reactors is going to be important for the future .
in terms of proliferation , nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity .

in the studio we do a lot of experiments .
do you mind looking , with me , at that little cross in the center there ?

who is the consumer , if you want , and who has responsibility for what one sees ?

when baby humans are born today , their lar@@ yn@@ x is not des@@ cended yet .
and our voice is in@@ distingu@@ ishable from how other people see us .
your voice is also very linked with your hormone levels .
when you wear a mask , you actually don 't see the mask .
and then there is a third filter , it 's a biological filter .
so because of this , as your voice is the sound you hear the most in your life , you actually hear it less than other sounds .
neuro@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts found out recently that when you open your mouth to create a sound , your own aud@@ itory cor@@ te@@ x shu@@ ts down .
and in your dreams , you actually unle@@ ash the potential of this inner voice .
that 's another work we are doing in our lab : trying to access this inner voice in dreams .
so even if you can 't always control it , the inner voice -- you can always engage with it through dialogue , through inner dialogues .
and you can even see this inner voice as the missing link between thought and actions .
I 've been a journalist for more than 23 years , at the " Ark@@ ansas Democ@@ rat @@@ -@@ @ Gazette , " the " Pit@@ ts@@ burgh Tri@@ b@@ une Review " and most recently , " The Den@@ ver Post . "
at the time , I was in my 30s .
well , seven years passed , we were sold to a he@@ dge fund , Al@@ den Global Capital .
the rule of thum@@ b used to be that 80 percent of a newspaper 's revenue came from pric@@ y print ads and classi@@ fi@@ eds .
Al@@ den 's orders were to be digital first .
in 2013 , we won a Pul@@ it@@ zer Prize for covering the A@@ ur@@ ora theater shooting .

in all , he appeared more a woman than a man . "
well , any other ju@@ ic@@ y details in the colonial archives ?
but this was pure speculation .
now , there 's an ongoing debate in contemporary society about what constitutes gender and how it should be defined .
we can now do that same gen@@ ome project in the order of two to eight hours .
we just got a grant from the G@@ ordon and Bet@@ ty Mo@@ ore Foundation to sequence 130 gen@@ om@@ es this year , as a side project from environmental organisms .
( la@@ ughter ) We filter through some simple apparat@@ uses ; we collect on the order of a billion micro@@ bes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City .
and these vary tremend@@ ously from region to region .
and we think in a gene @@@ -@@ @ centric view -- maybe going back to Richard D@@ aw@@ kins ' ideas -- than in a gen@@ ome @@@ -@@ @ centric view , which are different construc@@ ts of these gene components .
and if they insert in the middle of the gene , they disrupt its function .
basically , any virus that 's been sequ@@ enced today -- that gen@@ ome can be made .
so we 're now making several dozen different construc@@ ts , because we can vary the cas@@ set@@ tes and the genes that go into this artificial chro@@ mos@@ ome .
this organism is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous on the planet , and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there .
after these gen@@ om@@ es are synthe@@ sized , the first step is just trans@@ planting them into a cell without a gen@@ ome .
also , there 's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabol@@ izing methane .
we delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half bio@@ ethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species .
these are complex issues .
I say , less and less the human touch .
so we got this voice on this train : con@@ course One : O@@ ma@@ ha , Lin@@ col@@ n .

" just then I see a baby , a little baby in the lap of a mother .
I mean , H@@ uck , of course , was tremendous .
remember that great scene on the raft , remember what H@@ uck did ?
you see , here 's H@@ uck ; he 's an illiterate k@@ id ; he 's had no schooling , but there 's something in him .
'@@ An@@ y@@ body up on that raft with you ? ' H@@ uck says , ' Y@@ ea@@ h . ' ' is he black or white ? ' ' white . ' and they go off .
and more and more , less and less awareness of the pain of the other .
and I title things because I think people speak in organic po@@ ems , and this is called " A Mir@@ ror to Her M@@ outh . "
" I began to learn how to cover it up , because I did@@ n 't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home .
and so he put her in the bathtub , and I was in the bedroom with the baby .
her face was bru@@ ised . she had a black eye .
my own child , I let that happen to . "
so that 's an investigation of the negative imagination .
everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four c@@ ops beat up a black man named Ro@@ dney King .
explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way .
and so this woman , Mrs. Young @@@ -@@ @ So@@ on H@@ an , I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race .
they have a lot of respect , as I do , for Dr. Martin King .
I was sw@@ allowing the bit@@ ter@@ ness , sitting here alone and watching them .
and I 've been going to the ro@@ de@@ os with him , and we 've bonded .
and this is called " T@@ ough@@ ness . "
it seems like he has so much bad luck , you know .
and they had to se@@ w me up and stra@@ igh@@ ten my nose out .
in fact , I 've never really thought of myself as a nature person .
now most people , if they were telling you about climate change , will tell you a story about the future .
if I was doing that , I would say , " According to the UN , if we don 't change course , by the end of the century , we 're likely to get about four degrees Cel@@ sius of warming . "
but the impacts are actually happening a lot faster than 2100 .
that may not sound like a lot , but it actually puts us entirely outside the window of temperatures that enclose all of human history .
we 've done more damage since then than in all the centuries , all the mill@@ enn@@ ia before .
the climate crisis is not the legacy of our ancestors .
it is the work of a single generation .
now that may seem too ro@@ sy to believe and the political obstacles are in fact enormous .
it 's the kind of story we used to recognize only in my@@ th@@ ology and the@@ ology .
we need planes that won 't produce carbon .
probably , we 'd have to do all of these things , because as with every aspect of this puzzle , the problem is simply too vast and complicated to solve in any single silver @@@ -@@ @ bullet way .
perhaps an industry twice or four times the size of today 's oil and gas business to undo the damage that was done by those businesses in past decades .
a new politics would make the matter of managing that burden , where it falls and how heavily , the top priority of our time .
thank you .
it 's a very serious infection in them , as they get a higher dose than normal people , and at the same time , they have no immunity .
how does this outbreak compare ? ] That 's the same problem with all new infections .
and this intensive agriculture of animals and this intensive increase in human populations living together on the same planet is really a melting pot where outbreaks can occur and do occur .
and bone mar@@ row is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients , most of whom have advanced mal@@ ign@@ ancies like le@@ uk@@ emia and lym@@ ph@@ oma and some other diseases .
Bob 's on the table , and we take this sort of small needle , you know , not too big .
and we found , to our surprise , that we not only got bone mar@@ row out , but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the mar@@ row from the Mar@@ row Min@@ er , compared to the normal device .
thanks .
hi , everyone , my name is Elizabeth , and I work on the trading floor .
but that 's not really why I decided to jump into finance .
so what narr@@ atives am I referring to ?
that probably explains why we have so many of our young people being trafficked in search of green@@ er pa@@ stures .
I was disappointed to learn that there was no room for mis@@ fits like me in these institutions .
and to identify your passion , you need to look inward .
and just in case you 're won@@ dering what your answers are to those two questions , I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it .
when I met Es@@ ther and I started to con@@ verse with her , I asked her a simple question .
or sometimes , if he was really broke and needed to make quick money , then he would come up with a design and sell it .
Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I 've ever seen , and over the last one year , Musa 's business has grown .
he thought the talent he had was nothing simply because he did not have an academic paper to define him .
in so doing , we cease to work and we start to live .
so next time class met , I apolog@@ ized , and I made an announcement .
they knew their listen@@ ers would hear the actual word in their heads .
it 's all over African American literature .
they want to learn about James Bal@@ d@@ win and William Fa@@ ul@@ k@@ ner and about the civil rights movement .
they hear it in loc@@ ker rooms , on In@@ st@@ agra@@ m , in the hall@@ ways at school , in the chat rooms of the video games they play .
we 're able to talk about it because it do@@ es@@ n 't come into the classroom .
another important condition is I don 't make my black students responsible for teaching their class@@ mates about this .
right ? that 's how the mirror ne@@ ur@@ on system works .
but then my mother said to me , " I hear you 've been going around talking about psych@@ op@@ ath@@ ic kill@@ ers .
( la@@ ughter ) So the moral of the story is : people in glass houses shou@@ ld@@ n 't throw stones .
so he had traveled all around .
what 's very , very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high @@@ -@@ @ UV environments , in equ@@ atorial Africa .
now what happened in our history ?
lightly pig@@ mented skin evolved not just once , not just twice , but probably three times .
because the problem there is just as severe , but it is more s@@ ini@@ ster , because vitamin D deficiency , from a lack of ultra@@ violet B radiation , is a major problem .
so we have , in skin pig@@ mentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
and the social consequences , as we know , are incredibly profound .
he , as one of many urban ad@@ mixed populations , is very embl@@ ematic of a mixed paren@@ tage , of a mixed pig@@ mentation .
so lets all wish for his great health , and his awareness of his own skin pig@@ mentation .
he would appreciate it .
from my experience and that of the women around me , I can tell you that it 's exhaus@@ ting .
and right now , we are all gathered here in the USA .
because how could the monthly cycle that ultimately gives rise to all creation be anything less than beautiful ?
and we did@@ n 't just stop at involving girls in our campaign .
we donated hundreds of p@@ ads that we had collected through a pad donation drive at school .
( la@@ ughter ) To sustain this effort , we 've installed 10 sanitary n@@ ap@@ kin dispens@@ ers in several schools .
a man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance .
what I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves .
before he arrived Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan said -- and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister -- " is@@ n 't this man a communist ? "
now look at what 's happened in the last 10 years .
my husband too has spent a long time in prison . "
so my argument today is basically this .
they said , " Let 's march . "
what is a sno@@ b ?
it 's a new way of looking at luxury goods .
we 've done away with the caste system , we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
but the point is , it do@@ es@@ n 't feel that way .
everybody , all politicians on Left and Right , agree that mer@@ it@@ oc@@ racy is a great thing , and we should all be trying to make our societies really , really mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic .
there are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dropping on people 's heads , illnesses , etc .
the number one organ of ridic@@ ule , nowadays , is the newspaper .
now , is there any alternative to this ?
anyone want to hazard a guess ?
so I 'll just add a couple more . bl@@ ink . bl@@ ink .
and it 's the Bic@@ en@@ ten@@ ary of Charles Dar@@ win .
if we changed so much , something must have happened .
everybody knew the answer .
Professor Tob@@ ias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London .
we 've got to go back to square one and start again . "
and the ir@@ ony of it is , that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we did@@ n 't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up .
and the ir@@ onic thing about it is that they are not sta@@ ving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own , which they 've all agreed on , and they love .
I 'm in the habit of saying I would like it if bu@@ tter@@ flies could talk , but I 've been recently re@@ considering that , because we already have a pretty loud world .
this is called " pra@@ e@@ dic@@ ta , " because Dar@@ win predicted that it must exist .
now this is a disaster .
in@@ sect life is at the very foundation of our life @@@ -@@ @ support systems .
Habitat loss is very serious , and that 's where we really have to get developing better , more mind@@ fully .
we have exactly what we need .
we have exactly the platform to save nature .
so someone showed Dar@@ win this Madagascar star or@@ ch@@ id , which as a spur that 's 12 inches long , and the spur is the part of a flower that the nec@@ tar is in .
so this person showed this to Dar@@ win and said , " This proves that evolution does not come about in a natural way .
God must reproduce it . "
this is a map of the mon@@ arch bu@@ tter@@ fly .
the next generation emerges as bu@@ tter@@ flies and takes the next leg of the journey .
the reason we know they do this kind of migration -- and we still have a lot of unanswered questions about the mon@@ arch migration -- is because of citizen science .
the heart of the problem for mon@@ archs is Mil@@ k@@ weed .
Mil@@ k@@ weed is toxic .
mon@@ arch bu@@ tter@@ flies will only lay their eggs on Mil@@ k@@ weed , and mon@@ arch c@@ ater@@ pillars will only eat Mil@@ k@@ weed , because they need that tox@@ in to actually create what they are as a species .
you need to have data and you need to show a picture , you need to point to a cause and then you need to have the surgical strike to help support whatever that problem is .
this is a X@@ er@@ ces blue bu@@ tter@@ fly , which went extin@@ c@@ t when it lost its habitat in Golden Gate Park .
it had a co@@ evolutionary relationship with an ant , and that 's another story .
maybe we co@@ evolved our souls with bu@@ tter@@ flies ?
take a look at this picture .
let 's just pick one -- for example , the one in the green shirt .
so it has neither the resources , nor the incentives , to ho@@ ok up many other users .
so he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win @@@ -@@ @ win solution help his country .
and Nelson is stuck studying under the stree@@ t@@ lights .
so if you give just to one side or the other , you 'll have tension or friction .
and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules , the ways that rules can keep people in the dark , look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night .
what Haiti war@@ ns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak .
so that if we want to create environments with good rules , we can 't just tear down .
now , China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules .
back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart , China was the world 's high @@@ -@@ @ technology leader .
this next chart looks at more recent data .
growth took off in China . the Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States .
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Den@@ g X@@ ia@@ oping could copy , when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model .
so they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong : zones where Chinese could come and work , and cities grew up very rapidly there ; also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things .
and we can scale this model .
we also need the choices for people .
you start from un@@ inhabited territory .
the final thing we need are choices for leaders .
the thing that was bad about colonialism , and the thing which is resi@@ du@@ ally bad in some of our aid programs , is that it involved elements of coercion and con@@ des@@ cension .
why don 't you , Canada , take over ?
allow many people to come in .
others will hold back . but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country . "
it 's a rule for changing rules .
there are immense stret@@ ches of land like this -- land where hundreds of millions of people could live .
if you move the do@@ ts down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth .
we 'd go from three percent of the arable land , to four percent .
they can get basic utilities like electricity .
so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities , scaling this so we build many more ?
it would help to have a manual .
so there are many other details like this .
my specialty is looking at populations and health systems , what happens when diseases move on the large level .
cor@@ on@@ a@@ viruses are a specific sub@@ set of virus , and they have some unique characteristics as viruses .
CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 is the seventh .
it 's new to us .
that 's why it 's novel .
cor@@ on@@ a@@ viruses are zo@@ on@@ otic , which means that they transmit from animals to people .
some cor@@ on@@ a@@ viruses , like CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 , also transmit person to person .
the person @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ person ones travel faster and travel far@@ ther , just like CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 .
one example is avian influenza , where we can abolish it in f@@ armed animals , in tur@@ keys , in duc@@ ks , but it keeps coming back every year because it 's brought to us by wild birds .
there 's going to be more outbreaks , and there 's going to be more epidemics .
that 's not a maybe . that 's a given .
part of that is about climate change and the way a warming climate makes the world more hosp@@ itable to viruses and bacteria .
but the fact is , it 's really hard to get a good quarantine in place .
it 's really hard to set up travel restrictions .
so people are walking around with this virus showing no signs .
we can get better at qu@@ aran@@ tines and travel restrictions , and we should , but they 're not our only option , and they 're not our best option for dealing with these situations .
China 's taken a lot of criticism for its response to CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 .
but the fact is , what if CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 had emerged in Chad , which has three and a half doctors for every hundred thousand people ?
the country only had 120 when the crisis started .
if a hospital -- or a country -- runs out of face masks or personal protective equipment , there 's no big warehouse full of boxes that we can go to to get more .
they would have shared honest information with citizens so that we did@@ n 't see these crazy rum@@ ors spreading on social media in China .
but even with all of that in place , we would still have outbreaks .
we 're seeing cases of human transmission that are@@ n 't from returning travel , that are just happening in the community , and we 're seeing people infected with CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 when we don 't even know where the infection came from .
we all hoped we 'd get off easy , but when experts talk about viral planning , this is the kind of situation and the way they expect the virus to move .
( la@@ ughter ) So san@@ i@@ tize your phone and consider not using it as often in public .
if you 're a regular healthy person wearing a face mask , it 's just making your face swe@@ at@@ y .
they just make us less prepared .
if a few slip through the net , potentially , you 're going to get an outbreak .
and of course , these measures , things like school closures , and other things that just attempt to reduce the social mixing of a population .
because if you imagine that 's where you can get a virus out and onto surfaces and onto hands and onto faces , and it 's really situations like that we 've got to think more about .
and of course , there 's the time limit .

they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial me@@ tropol@@ is with an Eliz@@ abe@@ than public infrastructure .
and they would just kind of throw the buc@@ kets down there and hope that it would somehow go away , and of course it never really would go away .
it 's a water@@ borne disease , not something that 's in the air .
he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source .
I thought , I need to retreat into something else .
my mother was like the woman in Tom and Jer@@ ry .
and then she just said , " You 're going back to school tomorrow . "
and then he said , " But I don 't believe that you can do this . " so I said , " OK . "
and I looked at it beneath the micro@@ scope . and some of it was flat .
so I decided to sl@@ ice these up with the tool that I make by -- I shar@@ pen the end of a needle into a blade .
and then I started rub@@ bing , very very gently , till some of the edges were quite square . and then I constructed it .
so I have to be very very careful .
I remember one time I was doing it , and the window was open .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the sym@@ metrical shape .
good morning everybody .
I , like most of you , was sitting down , the day after Christmas in 2004 , when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in , playing out on TV .
that 's when I decided I had to do something .
lifes@@ a@@ ver po@@ res are 15 nan@@ ometers .
would you like to see that ?
we 're in the fine city of Oxford .
that 's all that 's necessary .
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay . lifes@@ a@@ ver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world .
but by thinking differently , and shipping these , people can stay put .
they can get it from a source nearby .
to put that into context , The U.@@ K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid .
thank you .
there is lots of showing off .
and the organisms , I promise you , have all of their priorities in order .
they have asked themselves , " What if , every time I started to inv@@ ent something , I asked , ' How would nature solve this ? ' " and here is what they 're learning .
we 're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria .
it 's got bum@@ ps on the back of its wing covers .
and the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips .
there is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the United States called Cal@@ era .
none of these are using the organisms .
they 're really only using the blue@@ prints or the recipes from the organisms .
but then right after that , they em@@ it a protein that actually ga@@ thers and aggregates those nan@@ op@@ articles so that they fall out of solution .
s@@ warm technology . there is a company called Reg@@ en .
Amazon electric e@@ el -- incredibly endangered , some of these species -- create 600 vol@@ ts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body .
here 's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a wh@@ ale .
hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ale has sc@@ all@@ op@@ ed edges on its f@@ lip@@ pers .
and those sc@@ all@@ op@@ ed edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent .
how can we do what life has learned to do ?
I wanted to revenge for my village .
never give up . never give in .
it 's like I 'm living a dream .
so the music had been my therapy for me .
but I had this question .
because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa . they will die soon .
and she rescu@@ ed over 150 child soldiers .
one of them happened to be me now .
he created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavi@@ oral science .
and here 's how it works . suppose I 'm the experi@@ men@@ ter .
and eventually , after five or ten minutes , most people figure out the solution , which you can see here .
he said , " If you 're in the top 25 % of the fastest times , you get five dollars .
answer : it took them , on average , three and a half minutes longer .
it d@@ ul@@ ls thinking and blocks creativity .
but for a lot of tasks , they actually either don 't work or , often , they do harm .
because when the t@@ acks are out of the box , it 's pretty easy is@@ n 't it ?
so what really matters are the more right @@@ -@@ @ bra@@ ined creative , conceptual kinds of abilities .
this is not a philosophy .
what happened ?
then they said , " Let 's see if there 's any cultural bias here .
let 's go to Mad@@ u@@ ra@@ i , India and test it . "
that 's the American experience .
( la@@ ughter ) Last month , just last month , economists at L@@ SE looked at 51 studies of pay @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ performance plans , inside of companies .
the good news is that the scientists who 've been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
ma@@ stery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
how many of you have heard of the company At@@ l@@ assi@@ an ?
a few times a year they tell their engineers , " Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want , as long as it 's not part of your regular job .
they call them Fed@@ Ex Days .
it 's pretty ; not bad .
radical amounts of autonomy .
meetings in these kinds of environments are optional .
some of you might look at this and say , " H@@ mm , that sounds nice , but it 's U@@ top@@ ian . "
autonomy , ma@@ stery and purpose , versus car@@ rot and sticks , and who wins ?
one : those 20th century rewards , those moti@@ v@@ ators we think are a natural part of business , do work , but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances .
early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by Nik@@ ola T@@ es@@ la basically about 100 years ago .
and so , in fact , he actually set about doing a variety of things .
it 's a reson@@ ant phenomenon for which he actually received a Mac@@ Arthur Fellowship Award , which is nick@@ named the Gen@@ ius Award , last September , for his discovery .
imagine a co@@ il . for those of you that are engineers , there 's a capac@@ itor attached to it too .
I mean , people are worried about cell@@ phones being safe .
these electric cars are beautiful .
imagine driving into your garage -- we 've built a system to do this -- you drive into your garage , and the car charges itself , because there is a mat on the floor that 's plug@@ ged into the wall .
and it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently .
it will cause one to get created on the other side .
generally , you have to go over and hit the button . so I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that .
how many people want to hang them on the wall ?
it runs the Android operating system .
but they typically use it to light up the screen .
there are many , many problems out there .
to conflicts , it would be U.@@ N. ' s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
and I 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
if you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
we could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected every year .
this third best one was free trade .
the second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
but in a world where we don 't do either , or don 't do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
even if it do@@ es@@ n 't accord to the typical way we see this problem .
it 's not about making things that have the most media attention , but it 's about making places where we can actually do the most good .
you know , we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don 't we spend that on doing good in the world ?
and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
but if we don 't do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
and when they come back into the lecture room I ask them , " What do you mean with " we " and " them " ?
but then you know , I press them like this .
and now I have income per person on this axis .
and especially , it 's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years , because I have my oldest son now working for Google , after Google acquired this software .
so they come in with the two perspectives I have , you know ?
but this was 1963 .
so , how could we make better sense about this ?
well , one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution .
that 's why it 's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world .
I heard that your departments here were by regions .
and I can split the others . here is the South Asian , Arab world .
it 's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way , as we do .
and that 's the bottom billion , where we 've heard today about a completely new approach to do it .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
look at the provinces of Kenya . they are very different .
it will never affect a rich person .
so you have a very bad name , State Department . this is not the State Department .
it 's the World Department .
I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen .
so I began drawing the story that was moving in my head .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Bu@@ z@@ zing ) ( Click , click , ban@@ g ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .
so this is , relatively , a new show that we 're now beginning to tour .
zero became a person and not just a character in a play .
as a street perform@@ er , I have learned that everybody wants to connect .
and that usually , if you 're a bit extraordinary , if you 're not exactly of human appearance , then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .
it 's as though you made something res@@ onate within them .
zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow , tell various stories through different medi@@ ums .
com@@ ic books . quantum physics video games .
it 's a human and technological revolution .
it 's motion and emo@@ tion .
it 's happening .
he was social , and his character , The Tra@@ mp , spoke to millions .
we design our world . we inv@@ ent possibilities .
we teach , touch and move .
it is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent , meaningful and extraordinary work . it 's now .
I 've been fasc@@ inated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now , ever since I stum@@ bled across a fairly obsc@@ ure academic article by a guy named Jack Har@@ lan .
it 's a bit of a personal example , in fact .
and I said , " You know what ? these apples come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .
the good news is a third of you did@@ n 't hold up your hand . your apple 's still out there .
and the F@@ ow@@ ler apple is described in here -- I hope this do@@ es@@ n 't surprise you -- as , " a beautiful fruit . "
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ...
we worked with the Norwegian government and with the Nor@@ G@@ en , the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program , to design this facility .
( la@@ ughter ) Some of the hap@@ pi@@ est days of my life have been spent ...
I can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things , or the energy crisis , or world hunger , or peace in conflict .
because I challenge you to think of an effective , efficient , sustainable solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity .
because , quite literally , if agriculture do@@ es@@ n 't adapt to climate change , neither will we .
in An@@ u@@ rad@@ ha@@ pur@@ a , however , trees were sacred .
religious reve@@ rence slowed farmer 's axes and even led the city to plant additional trees in urban parks .
their city eventually grew to more than twice Uru@@ k 's population , and today , An@@ u@@ rad@@ ha@@ pur@@ a still ca@@ res for a tree planted over 2,000 years ago .
their por@@ ous leaves puri@@ fy the air by tra@@ pping carbon and other pollutants , making them essential in the fight against climate change .
humanity has been un@@ covering these ar@@ bo@@ real benefits for centuries .
but trees are@@ n 't just crucial to the health of a city 's infrastructure ; they play a vital role in the health of its citizens as well .
Portland 's Forest Park preserves the region 's natural biodiversity , making the city home to various local plants , 112 bird species , and 62 species of mammals .
I 'd like to start with a little experiment .
could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses , or you 've had laser ref@@ rac@@ tive surgery ?
the World Health Organization estimates -- well , they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people .
glasses are not very expensive . they 're quite pl@@ enti@@ ful .
what I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses .
so -- ok@@ ay , I can now see that man running out there , and I can see that guy running out there .
ok@@ ay , I 've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
I started working on it in 1985 , and it 's been evolving very slowly .
and that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020 .
to do that -- this is an early example of the technology .
the technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
this pair , in fact , these currently cost about 19 dollars .
it has to be brought down because we 're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day .
how do you distribute ? how do you work out how to fit the thing ?
what we 've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university .
I grew up in a family where my father managed all of the money .
we would sit at the kitchen table , and he 'd show me all the bank books .
now , that was back in the day before the internet , when we used to have little books that we used to keep our information in .
and he would show me how he saved in these accounts , and he 'd pay bills out of these .
and every time he would show me something about money , he would end by saying , " And don 't you tell your mother . "
right then , at 16 years old , I began managing my own money .
but what I failed to realize was what felt like freedom was really dependency .
and how many of us know someone that has an elderly parent or a relative that can no longer take care of themselves , and they 're left to rely on others , sometimes handing over their homes , their money and other assets .
victims are in a relationship , and the other person has power over them , because they don 't have access to money , information or the resources and support they need to leave .
after my divorce , I had to rebuild my life financially and emo@@ tionally .
when you become aware of your inner bru@@ ises and scars , you can begin to break free from financial dependency .
you can only make around a hundred to 200 percent selling drugs on the street .
and documents found during those raids found that they 'd been falsi@@ fying shipping documents so the customs officials would literally have no idea who had sent the products in the first place .
but these are@@ n 't just low @@@ -@@ @ level street thu@@ gs .
they 're business professionals , and they fly first class .
counterfe@@ iting is set to become a 2.3 @@@ -@@ @ trillion @@@ -@@ @ dollar underground economy , and the damage that can be done with that kind of money , it 's really frigh@@ tening ...
but would those same tourists have gone into a store called " I Love Gen@@ u@@ ine Fa@@ ke Vi@@ ag@@ ra P@@ ills " or " I Gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely Love Funding Terrorism " ?
I doubt it .
as the world 's most famous fic@@ tional detec@@ tive would say , " Wat@@ son , the game is a@@ foot . "
your brain does the work of intell@@ igently putting together the shar@@ pest parts from each eye 's view , but the two eyes see slightly different things , and that makes it harder to judge distances bin@@ oc@@ ularly .
using two of these , we can tri@@ ang@@ ulate your gaz@@ e direction to get a focus estimate .
our participants could see more clearly , they could focus more quickly and they thought it was an easier and better focusing experience than their current correction .
the effect , the pay@@ back , perhaps , for years of v@@ amp@@ ire pre@@ dat@@ ors like Ber@@ ni@@ e Mad@@ off , whom we saw earlier .
abuse of ster@@ oids , b@@ inging and so on .
now , since that time , we 've actually been through an extraordinary boom , the longest boom ever in the history of this country .
there will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year , thousands losing their jobs everyday in America .
and I think you can see around us now , some of the green sho@@ ots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow .
the biggest sector , by far , will be health -- already 18 percent of the American economy , predicted to grow to 30 , even 40 percent by mid @@@ -@@ @ century .
elder care , child care , already much bigger employers than cars .
and I think that what connects the challenge for civil society , the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is , in a way , a very simple one , but quite a difficult one .
now , I did@@ n 't really understand that until I met this guy who was then an 80 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old , slightly sha@@ mb@@ olic man who lived on tom@@ ato sou@@ p and thought ironing was very over@@ rated .
nothing like the resources of a CER@@ N or a DA@@ RPA or an IBM or a Du@@ pon@@ t .

I think when you take individual freedom versus collective safety , there has to be a balance somewhere there .
and the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
this is P@@ ink Flo@@ y@@ d 's " Machine " playing in real time through the cy@@ mas@@ cope .
then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming .
Cy@@ m@@ atics is accessible to everybody .
so let me explain that .
when faced with an enormous challenge that we don 't feel we have any agency or control over , our mind can do a little trick to protect us .
continents are on fire .
a deep , determined , stub@@ born form of optimism emerged , not avoiding or denying the darkness that was pressing in but refusing to be co@@ wed by it .
but it has also sha@@ ken our belief that we are power@@ less in the face of great change .
the truth is that future generations will look back at this precise moment with a@@ we as we stand at the crossroads between a regener@@ ative future and one where we have thrown it all away .
genuine success is possible in this transition , and genuine failure is possible , too , which makes this the most exciting time to be alive .
right now , all of these things are possible .
and looking at it took me back to some of the most transformative experiences of my life .
it is both the world we want to create and the way in which we can create that world .
and it is a choice for all of us .
let 's face it with stub@@ born and determined optimism .
yes , seeing the changes in the world right now can be painful .
I was a successful student , and I was president of the Oregon Association of Student Councils .
but it was around this time that I began to realize mental health was much a bigger problem than just for me personally .
because of@@ ten@@ times that day off is the difference between feeling a whole lot better and a whole lot worse -- kind of like those days my mom gave me when I was younger .
( appl@@ ause and che@@ ers ) This was a ground@@ breaking moment for Oregon students .
now students from multiple other states are also trying to pass these laws .
I 'm currently working with students in both California and Col@@ or@@ ado to do the same , because we believe that students everywhere deserve a chance to feel better .

it 's critical now that when a car crash happens it is@@ n 't just the st@@ unt person we make safe , it 's the crew .
in the old days of the silent movies -- Har@@ old L@@ loy@@ d here , hanging fam@@ ously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stun@@ ts . they were quite remarkable .
she really paved the way at a time when nobody was doing stun@@ ts , let alone women .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is Yak@@ ima C@@ anu@@ t@@ t .
there is no safety , no back support , no p@@ ads , no crash mat@@ s , no sand p@@ its in the ground .
we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do them without technology .
they did it by remote control .
( laugh@@ s ) I sort of forget how b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re some of those conversations are .
that 's a long way to fall , if you get it wrong . that was just about right .
in 1960 , Joseph Kit@@ ten@@ ger of the United States Air Force did the most spectacular thing .
so that 's the ballo@@ on , big gas ballo@@ on .
now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet -- it 's great , is@@ n 't it ? -- When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen .
it 's hundreds of feet high . it 's enormous .
I contacted a company in the States who make suits for NASA .
it 's a working prototype . I will use it for all the jum@@ ps .
thank you very much for your time .
to meet this demand , roughly 23 billion shoes are produced each year , mostly in factories across China and Southeast Asia .
the outer sol@@ es of most shoes are made of rubber that 's gone through a process called vul@@ can@@ ization .
this technique adds sul@@ fur to super@@ heated raw rubber to create a material that 's both elastic and stur@@ dy .
but the transportation required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant em@@ its even more CO2 .
the dispersion of factories fuels another problem as well : labor abuse .
when manufacturing is complete , the shoes are packaged and transported to stores around the globe .
for many , these shoes could last years .
so no matter what your style , we can all take steps towards a sustainable future .
over the next five years , we will train an additional 1,000 health workers to use Sen@@ tin@@ el detection tools and empower them to train their colleagues .
what does it feel like from your perspective ?
PS : I think that this pandemic has shown us how un@@ prepared we are everywhere in the world .
Christian and our partners together had diagnostics at our hospital sites in Nigeria , Sierra Leone and Senegal in early February .
we are away from family .
at least I have the privilege to see family today , and then I 'm sure tomorrow I 'm heading back in the tren@@ ches .
in my lab , we sequ@@ enced the first CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 gen@@ ome on the African continent , and that really was done within 48 hours .
this is revolutionary coming from Africa and then making this information available for the global health community to see what the virus within Africa looks like .
PS : the whole idea of Sen@@ tin@@ el is that we all stand guard over each other .
in my lab , we 're using the tools of artificial intelligence and synthetic biology to speed up the fight against this pandemic .
so how are we going to do it ?
well , we 're creating a compound training library and with collaborators applying these molecules to SA@@ RS @@@ -@@ @ Co@@ V @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ infected cells to see which of them exhibit effective activity .
importantly , B@@ C@@ G is m@@ assi@@ vely scal@@ able and has a safety profile that 's among the best of any reported vaccine .
with the tools of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence , we can win the fight against this novel cor@@ on@@ a@@ virus .
art , of course , looks at the world through the psych@@ e , the emotions -- the un@@ conscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic .
but ice has another meaning .
the changes are happening . they 're very visible .
95 percent of the gl@@ aci@@ ers in the world are ret@@ re@@ ating or shrinking .
and the great ir@@ ony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that .
in these images we see ice from enormous gl@@ aci@@ ers , ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into ch@@ un@@ ks , and ch@@ un@@ k by ch@@ un@@ k by ch@@ un@@ k , ic@@ e@@ berg by ic@@ e@@ berg , turning into global sea level rise .
so , having seen all of this in the course of a 30 @@@ -@@ @ year career , I was still a skep@@ tic about climate change until about 10 years ago , because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models .
when I realized that climate change was real , and it was not based on computer models , I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photograph@@ ically .
actually , there 's still a camera out there right now .
that 's only half our job .
we 've done films . we 've done books . we have more coming .
and several things are important .
right now , if you look at the top right part of that graph , we 're at 385 parts per million .
that 's the cru@@ x , and some@@ day I hope to embl@@ az@@ on that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places .
we 're now at the Columbia Gl@@ ac@@ ier in Alas@@ ka .
you see the gl@@ ac@@ ier flowing in from the right , dropping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour .
that means that gl@@ ac@@ ier 's floating and it 's unstable , and you 're about to see the consequences of that floating .
that 's the retreat of this gl@@ ac@@ ier .
a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these val@@ leys as it 's ret@@ re@@ ated and defl@@ ated , gone back up valley .
these changes in the alp@@ ine world are accelerating .
it 's not static .
these great ice islands break off -- and now watch this .
so that 's where we started three years ago , way out on the left , and that 's where we were a few months ago , the last time we went into Columbia .
you can see it defl@@ ating .
without the photographic process , you would never see this . this is invisible .
the smaller the ice mass , the faster it responds to climate .
it 's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left .
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs , many , many , many , many times the size of this building , are ro@@ aring out to sea .
this gl@@ ac@@ ier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years .
we have a problem of perception .
they were cu@@ ta@@ way sections of what kind of structure would be made out of , where the wires were , where the scre@@ ws were .
there 's only the A@@ pol@@ lo missions .
this is the Ari@@ ane 5 rocket .
the temperature difference on a Moon base could be anything up to 200 degrees .
well , we 're going to use a 3D printer .
there 's a big difference between Mars and the Moon , and let me explain it .
now -- we also want to try that out , so we went out on a road trip , and we created our own s@@ warm of robots .
and I really feel that there is a place for design and architecture in projects like inter@@ planetary habitation .
it 's impossible to prove your innocence .
to make matters worse , 16@@ 92 brought one of the col@@ dest w@@ inters on record .
four of the girls soon accused three local women of tor@@ menting them .
the authorities even reportedly told one accused wit@@ ch that she would be han@@ ged if she did not confess , and freed if she did .
the court accepted all kinds of du@@ bi@@ ous evidence , including so @@@ -@@ @ called " spectr@@ al evidence " in which the girls began ra@@ ving when supposedly touched by invisible gh@@ o@@ sts .
by this time , accusations were starting to spread beyond Sal@@ em to neighboring communities , and even the most powerful figures were targets .
but your friends are on their way , and if you can survive until they arrive , they should be able to help stop him .
let 's start by trying 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to see what happens .
Mol@@ dev@@ ort could escape those numbers in just three moves .
there 's another insight that will help .
so instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces on the outside of the board , we can reduce the problem to just three .
and the same works if he says 3 .
how many of us wonder ?
words are a strange thing .
this cat has nothing to do with the animal .
in these c@@ ris@@ s @@@ -@@ @ crossed lines , I filled a sound and into that sound , a meaning .
and then sounds were fit into some c@@ ris@@ s @@@ -@@ @ crossed lines that we call a script .
so three things that had nothing in common were joined by us to create a word .
a man is known by the company he keeps .
where did they hear it ? see it ?
a host of memories appear when you hear a word you remember .
and a good writer or or@@ ator is one who knows that when he uses a certain word , an average mind will associate it with a certain reference , specific memories will be ev@@ oked .
we would be right where we started .
so learn to respect words .
J@@ a : I was really young then .
is that what you want ? "
in fact the entire song , all the words , were thrown at us by Ja@@ ved Sa@@ hab in anger .
I wrote a song specially for this reason called " Ku@@ ch to hua hai , Ku@@ ch ho G@@ aya hai . "
and he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense , that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes .
I really , really wanted to go to the Arctic .
and I have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice .
and I wanted the world to know what was happening up there .
so I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world , in a place which should be frozen over , but which now is rapidly un@@ freezing .
and the message was very clear : climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it .
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
I had never sw@@ um in water of minus 1.7 degrees before , because it 's just impossible to train in those types of conditions .
I have never in my life felt anything like that moment .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
and I remember standing under@@ ne@@ ath the hot shower and trying to de@@ frost my fingers .
and I thought , in two days ' time , I was going to do this swim across the North Pole .
and for a sw@@ im@@ mer , you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you .
for those of you who don 't know him , he 's the great British explo@@ rer .
he accid@@ entally fell through the ice into the sea .
narr@@ ator ( Video ) : we 're just sailing out of harb@@ or now , and it 's at this stage when one can have a bit of a w@@ ob@@ ble mentally .
it was absolutely magical .
o@@ oh . in a couple of hours ' time I 'm going to get in here and do my swim .
you did it ! you did it man !
LP : how on earth did we do that ?
we 've come a long way . we 're doing good .
however some of its surface proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect of hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er .
Jo@@ an Bl@@ ades : do you have politically diverse friends ?
and I found myself won@@ dering why I saw things so differently than many people in other parts of the country .
and I found myself won@@ dering : how could vast numbers of people have the opportunity to really connect with people that have very different views ?
basically , I grew up in small @@@ -@@ @ town America , conservative at its heart .
now , Ste@@ ar@@ ns and Berk@@ ele@@ y -- they 're a little different .
now I also , 20 years ago , gave a speech saying it might not work out that way , that we might actually be trained to discriminate against each other in new ways .
first , we become more extreme in our beliefs .
and then I met Jo@@ an .
J@@ G : so , what are you curious about ?
today , we depend on wild caught fish to help feed over two billion people on the planet .
both of these things can result in fewer fish babies in the future .
what 's a girl to do ?
pollution from land can have similar impacts .
to survive , he has to find a female fast .
it 's really strange .
but if we don 't know that these kinds of strategies exist or how they work , we can 't know what kind of impacts we may be having , even in the deep sea .
and in the communities where we live , the places we work and the country in which we vote , we must take bold action on climate change now .
Special people , special places , think up special ideas , then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers , who are passive .
that 's the idea of creativity .
I think it 's always been wrong , because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative , and it 's probably been largely interactive .
the pay@@ offs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest .
they do it on their own tapes , with their own recording equipment ; they distribute it themselves .
and it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divided into two camps .
this is open ; this is closed .
the first is : imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying , " I 've got a fantastic idea .
and you 'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article .
those were the two places .
they want to be part of that flow of information .
if this is so critical , do we not need it funded , organized , supported in much more structured ways ?
it won 't be so clear @@@ -@@ @ cut ; it won 't be Microsoft versus Linux -- there 'll be all sorts of things in between .
I was in Shanghai , in an office block built on what was a rice p@@ add@@ y five years ago -- one of the 2,500 sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers they 've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years .
did@@ n 't go into the Internet , kept his money , decided to go into computer games .
he runs a company called Shan@@ da , which is the largest computer games company in China .
how many people does he employ to service that population ?
because basically , he do@@ es@@ n 't service them .
you 've got two options .
and the problem I 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy , which is , " How can we know whether other people have minds ? "
and that problem is , " How is it so easy to know other minds ? "
it takes children a long time to break into the system .
and Ivan puts his sand@@ wich over here , on top of the pir@@ ate chest .

so G@@ race and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory , and they take a break for coffee .
grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder , which is sugar .
and her friend drinks the coffee , and is fine .
some people think she should deserve more blame , and other people less .
and what I 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the bra@@ ins of people while they 're making that judgment .
it 's called Trans @@@ -@@ @ C@@ ran@@ ial Mag@@ ne@@ tic S@@ tim@@ ulation , or T@@ MS .
I 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine .
and in the case of the accident , where she thought that it was sugar , but it was really po@@ ison and so she caused a death , people say that it was less ok@@ ay , she deserves more blame .
we have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking .
and even in adul@@ thood , differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people .
so , there 's a couple of things to say about T@@ MS .
RS : it 's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing .
and after today , I hope you 'll stop using it , too .
here 's why you CA@@ N@@ NOT afford to use " crazy " to describe your busy .
here 's what happens .
here 's the thing .
( la@@ ughter ) E@@ ven on those days when you would s@@ wear you were being pun@@ ked , we 're not afraid of it .
that we 're ready .
we 've trained for it , and you can , too .
here 's how .
this is@@ n 't just a nice way to get your to @@@ -@@ @ do list done .
Red -- immediately life @@@ -@@ @ threatening .
yellow -- serious , but not immediately life @@@ -@@ @ threatening .
and we focus our efforts first on the re@@ ds .
remember , relent@@ lessly tri@@ age .
by the way , it is liber@@ ating with a green task to , every once in a while , be able to remind yourself , " That 's a green task . no one 's going to die . "
( la@@ ughter ) It 's OK if it 's not perfect .
that first feeling is@@ n 't the problem .
( la@@ ughter ) And for a moment , the strong cri@@ es of a newborn dro@@ wned out the be@@ eps and the si@@ ren@@ s that are the normal sounds of the ER .

I refer to organized crime .
it may come as a surprise , but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe .
it has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans .
this boat is worth one million Euros when it 's new .
well I can tell you , it 's quite a few of them .
and so instead , they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way , but above all , two sectors , and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime .
the key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering .
but over the past year or so , researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what 's happening is the mal@@ arial paras@@ ite is developing a resistance .
and they fear that the reason why it 's developing a resistance is because Cambo@@ dians can 't afford the drugs on the commercial market , and so they buy it from the Internet .
the reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives .
the public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contempl@@ ating the final result , the architectural object .
is the latest tower in London a gh@@ er@@ kin or a sa@@ usage or a sex tool ?
sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world .
recently , Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
in fact , I actually think that Dar@@ win is one of the people who best explains our design process .
his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work .
and through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design .
but Dar@@ win do@@ es@@ n 't only explain the evolution of a single idea .
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
and they chose this mas@@ cot because the theme of the expo is " Better City , Better Life . "
so just like with a bike , we don 't talk about it .
they tried to pass a law against moving the Mer@@ ma@@ id .
so for the first time , I got invited to speak at the National Parliament .
this is the view from my apartment , over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the Leon@@ ardo Di@@ Cap@@ ri@@ o balcony .
and what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert . it has no vegetation .
( appl@@ ause ) Yes , maybe just to round off .
everything , I would say . everything that matters except every thing and except matter .
as in this cryp@@ tic sentence I found in The Guardi@@ an recently : " the marriage suffered a setback in 1965 , when the husband was killed by the wife . "
we can 't see into the engine room .
electr@@ ons disappear in a kind of fu@@ z@@ z , and there is only energy . and you can 't see energy .
but we can 't read each other 's minds . I find that quite aston@@ ishing .
gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chem@@ ist called Van Hel@@ mont .
they don 't . nobody knows what it is .
( la@@ ughter ) Gal@@ ax@@ ies , 100 billion of them estimated in the universe .

and somebody said to him , " Well what 's the point of these , He@@ in@@ rich ?

and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
they don 't seem to be of our creation .
so I said , " What sort of things ? "
she said , " It 's got color . it 's got motion .
and she said it 's a rather b@@ oring movie .
but she was blind .
now this , for me , is a common situation .
now , with the original description in the 18th century , Charles Bon@@ net did not have them .
he 'd had cat@@ ar@@ act surgery .
they are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bon@@ net hall@@ uc@@ inations .
you 're at a particular road junction .
but in Africa , it 's generally been overlooked by car@@ makers , who are focused on larger , established markets and emerging economies like India and China .
joining the company at the time was a near @@@ -@@ @ vertical learning curve .
and then he says to me , " I 'm not a student in your class , Meg@@ an . your books are not going to save me . "
the following year , I decided to hire a trainer to try to figure the underlying issues behind his reactive behavior .
we like to individu@@ alize the problem and situ@@ ate it away from us .
the problem is that the presumption of danger@@ ousness is tightly bound to race for so many in this country .
last year , I was coming back from a trip , and I was singled out by the T@@ SA agent .
but he ushe@@ red me to a separate area , and then two more T@@ SA agents surrounded me , and I knew in my gu@@ t that something bad was about to go down .
the lead T@@ SA agent proceeds to ask - no , acc@@ use - me of bringing a weapon into the airport .
( la@@ ughter ) Right ?
and then he started to get very nervous .
I was only seated for a few minutes when I felt a tap on my shoulder .
we keep offering up education as a solution to all racial injustices in the United States .
it 's kind of what I call sometimes in my classes as the " Rob@@ it@@ us@@ sin of civil rights . "
( la@@ ughter ) But just like Rob@@ it@@ us@@ sin is not a cure @@@ -@@ @ all for all types of sic@@ k@@ nesses , education is not a cure @@@ -@@ @ all for all of America 's racial sins .
doing so does not mean that we necessarily dis@@ lodge education , but it means that if racism and white supremacy are a rock fortress , we assemble greater arsenal weapons to break the dam@@ n thing down .
in order to wage this big campaign against racial violence , the NA@@ ACP organized mass demonstrations in the streets .
it was this massive , extraordinary , in @@@ -@@ @ your @@@ -@@ @ face campaign that forced America to confront ly@@ n@@ ching and mob violence against African Americans .
as a result of this work in early 20th century , the rates of ly@@ n@@ ching and mob violence dramatically decreased .
we must confront the ways that our actions and our institutions lead to a differential treatment of bl@@ acks , even if done un@@ intentionally .
some of these groups are associated directly , and some indirectly , with the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
it 's about if we will stop making the mistakes of our past and confront our own complicity in this great American lie that somehow black people are more dangerous than others .
my books and my silence will not save these students , but their activis@@ m , their courage in challenging the status quo , and this movement just might .
it needed a context , a culture , a community of other vag@@ in@@ as .
she was busy ; she did@@ n 't have time .
but it really did@@ n 't begin there .
so I said to a friend casu@@ ally , " Well , what do you think about your vag@@ ina ? "
the second thing is that what talking about the vag@@ ina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better .
what could we do with this information that all these women are being violated ? "
she was 72 years old and she was planning to retire .
she started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women .
she opened a center called Casa A@@ mig@@ a , and in six years , she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world .
I met her three years ago in Kenya .
and she walked through the R@@ ift Valley , and she had vag@@ ina and vag@@ ina replacement parts , where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vag@@ ina looks like , and what a mu@@ til@@ ated vag@@ ina looks like .
when we met her three years ago , we said , " What could V @@@ -@@ @ Day do for you ? "
and she said , " Well , if you got me a je@@ ep , I could get around a lot faster . "
( la@@ ughter ) So we bought her a je@@ ep .
my name is Jonathan Z@@ it@@ train , and in my recent work I 've been a bit of a pes@@ sim@@ ist .
now , it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before .
no particular amount of capital to invest , of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight .
I 'm pleased to say that , thanks to massive government funding , about three years ago we finally fig@@ ured out how be@@ es fly .
no one pays you to do this .
and they came together to help find the problem and fix it .
and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project .
totally mor@@ ti@@ fying to him .
they just did@@ n 't think it was the right thing to do .
this one says , " bu@@ col@@ ic mead@@ ow with split @@@ -@@ @ rail fence .
and that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it .
it said , " Can you help me get there ? "
( la@@ ughter ) They 'll fund anything these days .
it 's a brilliant idea .
why are they engaging with cyber@@ space ?
so what happened is that a 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old man , a Chinese man , died in prison custody .
so they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments .
within days the entire incident was forgotten , which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content .
( la@@ ughter ) But I think the biggest conceptual pit@@ fall that cyber@@ top@@ ians made is when it comes to digital n@@ atives , people who have grown up online .
thank you .
before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
this is me with my d@@ ad when I was a little boy .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't read English that well .
I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
so I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
thank you .
and one of the art forms that el@@ ic@@ ited the interest of the agency , and had thus come under question , is abstract expres@@ sion@@ ism .
and for the men in these photographs , photography had been used to create a fantasy .
I traveled across the United States photograph@@ ing men and women who had been wrong@@ fully convicted of crimes they did not commit , violent crimes .
Tro@@ y Web@@ b is photograph@@ ed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia .
and by definition , every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul , a global citizen .
we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons .
do we live in a bor@@ der@@ less world ?
now , many of you will object .
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often viol@@ ently .
now here at TED , we 're solving some of the great rid@@ dles of science and myster@@ ies of the universe .
India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , South East Asian nations created .
and they share a lengthy land border .
they set up their own ba@@ z@@ a@@ ars and medical clinics .
because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography .
so , the history of East Asia in fact , people don 't think about nations and borders .
well it 's China 's turn again .
these vec@@ tors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that China has with every country in the region .
another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy .
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .
China exports business people , n@@ ann@@ ies , students , teachers to teach Chinese around the region , to inter@@ marry and to occupy ever greater comman@@ ding heights of the economies .
Chinese pride is resur@@ gent in the region as a result .
now it encourages it .
what 's emerging today is what you might call a greater Chinese co @@@ -@@ @ prosperity sphere .
is it really a border on the map ?
no . it 's the pipelines .
now remember Kurdistan is landlocked .
Palestine is something of a carto@@ graphic anom@@ aly because it 's two parts Palestinian , one part Israel .
that , I believe , is going to bring peace to this particular conflict .
now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders , when the in@@ securities might ab@@ ate ?
he purpos@@ ely did not want these countries to make sense .
then there is Turkmenistan , which most people think of as a frozen basket case .
it was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union .
now let 's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders , and how that has enhanced its strength .
so what is next ? what is the future of the European Union ?
let 's not neglect the insurgency just to the south , B@@ alo@@ ch@@ istan . two weeks ago , B@@ alo@@ chi rebels attacked a Pakistani military gar@@ rison , and this was the flag that they raised over it .
so Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
but I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent .
thank you .
Ban@@ sh@@ ir@@ ô is an ambitious sam@@ u@@ ra@@ i in training , and today he must im@@ press his teachers more than ever .
this year it 's Ban@@ sh@@ ir@@ ô " s father 's turn to go , and Ban@@ sh@@ ir@@ ô is desperate to go with him ; but given that he 's still in training , he 'll need permission from both his father and the domain .
next , Ban@@ sh@@ ir@@ ô practices arch@@ ery , hor@@ sem@@ anship , and swimming before his academic courses in the afternoon .
when the instructor calls on him , he has the response on the tip of his tongue , ensuring another supporter for his campaign .
his father believes the martial arts are more important than the literary arts , so Ban@@ sh@@ ir@@ ô do@@ es@@ n 't mention his artistic ambitions .
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do , something like 25 years ago .
important ? not so very .
but this was@@ n 't always the way .
now this gent@@ l@@ eman , Is@@ amb@@ ard Kingdom Brun@@ el , designed many great things in his career in the 19th century , including the C@@ lif@@ ton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Tha@@ mes tunnel at Ro@@ ther@@ hi@@ the .
now , this was back in the 19th century .
in the case of design , that means balancing desirability , what humans need , with technical feasibility , and economic viability .
what makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
now , in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids .
in places like India , those technicians simply don 't exist .
instead of starting with technology , the team started with people and culture .
because they brought the cost down from $ 200 a pair , down to just $ 4 a pair .
they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
and this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone .
in times of change we need new alternatives , new ideas .
and in these times of change , we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete .
so why design thinking ?
but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today ?
so I 'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest High Street products .
thank you very much .
for years I 've been feeling frustrated , because as a religious histor@@ ian , I 've become ac@@ utely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths .
sometimes it comes in a positive version -- " Al@@ ways treat all others as you 'd like to be treated yourself . "
something that goes beyond what we know in our ego @@@ -@@ @ bound existence .
but you know you 'd never know it a lot of the time , that this was so central to the religious life .
that is the Tor@@ ah and everything else is only commentary . "
in Singapore , we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have spr@@ ung up in Sing@@ ap@@ ore@@ an society , and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically .
throughout Europe , the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions , are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths .
and I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate comp@@ assi@@ onate thinking .
you also have to do it .
the same applies to educators .
but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a school@@ girl .
he said that he distinguished between ero@@ tic love , when two people gaz@@ e , sp@@ ell@@ bound , into each other 's eyes .
if we go back several hundred years , an understanding of micro@@ biology led to the development of anti@@ sep@@ tic techniques , which played a big role in making sure patients were able to stay alive post@@ surgery .
so what if I told you that you did@@ n 't really need a million @@@ -@@ @ dollar robot to provide remote surgery ?
that 's your AC@@ L there , that looks quite healthy , no problems there .
have a good day . b@@ ye .
doctor 2 : if you see here , that 's the upper part , the most outer part of your tumor .
I never deal with images .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'm not that far .
because they thought that if you are having a teles@@ cope , you are an astronom@@ er so what you are doing is actually looking in a teles@@ cope .
I 'm sure most of you know from school physics that it 's basically splitting a white light into colors .
in the core , we have ther@@ mon@@ uclear reactions going on , creating chemical elements .
but you know , everything is relative .
( la@@ ughter ) This is the spectrum of the Sun -- 24@@ ,000 spectr@@ al lines , and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified .
it is amazing . so we are in the 21st century , and we still CA@@ N@@ NOT properly understand the spectrum of the sun .
in one of the binary stars in our gal@@ axy called F@@ H Le@@ o , we discovered the super fl@@ are .
and we need nine centi@@ meters per second to detect an Earth @@@ -@@ @ like planet .
coming back to the most important question , " Is there anybody out there ? "
so it 's something which you can always refer to SE@@ TI and say , " Well , somebody must be doing this , somehow . "
they want to actually signal their presence through these spectr@@ al lines , in the spectrum of a star , in different ways .
and we have some interesting cases , candidates , so on , things which we can 't really explain .
if , one day , and I think it will be within 15 years from now , or 20 years .
and we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know , and for even more that you 've never heard of .
and I get , over time , bo@@ red by them .
and for sure , in our case , our work started to look the same .
Europe and the U.S. did@@ n 't really feel entic@@ ing because I knew them too well . so Asia it was .
and then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that sur@@ round my house , and attacked me during my morning walks .
and then just leave it all to them .
it 's not quite finished yet .
I also started med@@ itating for the first time in my life in Bali .
I think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sab@@ b@@ atic@@ al .
and I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sab@@ b@@ atic@@ al .
Scot@@ ch tape came out of this program , as well as Art F@@ ry developed stic@@ ky notes from during his personal time for 3@@ M .
sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that .
this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few str@@ and of companies , and not for everybody else .
and mostly also because I realized out of a R@@ em Ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as presentation to the city of Porto , where he talked about a con@@ gl@@ om@@ eration of various layers of meaning .
and I understood that the building itself was a logo .
you put any image in there , like that Be@@ eth@@ oven image .
it has a more transparent identity .
it says , " Self @@@ -@@ @ confidence produces fine results . "
this is after a week .
we used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece .
while we built all this up during that week , with the 100 volunteers , a good number of the neighbors surrounding the pl@@ az@@ a got very close to it and quite loved it .
and they swe@@ pt it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters .
( la@@ ughter ) I think you see , you see them sweeping . you see them sweeping right here .
they we@@ ren 't quite sl@@ ick enough .
and my studio is very close to the mon@@ key forest .
so it 's going to be a while .
H@@ ank W@@ ill@@ is Thomas : I 'm De@@ b 's son .
and really , it 's because everywhere we go , together or apart , we carry these mon@@ ik@@ ers .
love is a way of being , it 's a way of doing , it 's a way of listening and it 's a way of seeing .
d@@ w : and also , the idea about love , photographers , they 're looking for love when they make photographs .
so I spent most of my life searching for pictures that reflect on ideas about black love , black joy and about family life .
no offense to my father , but that 's what you get for calling me a " ham " wherever you go .
I remember whenever I 'd go to my grand@@ mother 's house , she would hide all the photo albums because she was afraid of me asking , " Well , who is that in that picture ? "
and I had you , and I sho@@ ok off that sex@@ ist language that he used against me and picked up my camera and made photographs daily , and made photographs of my pregnant bel@@ ly as I prepared for graduate school .
but I thought about also that black photographers were missing from the history books of photography , and I was looking for ways to tell a story .
( la@@ ughter ) I have my own timing .
( la@@ ughter ) D@@ id you see her po@@ ke me ?
I grew up in a house full of photographs .
and it 's ast@@ ounding to me to consider that in 18@@ 40 , African Americans were making photographs .
I thought about how I could use photography to talk about how what 's going on outside of the frame of the camera can affect what we see inside .
but through it all , one piece has affected me the most .
d@@ w : w@@ ow , so fascinating .
and we each have the capacity to love .
the longest journey that I have ever taken .
so when I got a scholarship to study in China , I left my life and my family behind and I moved to Shanghai .
it was an amazing time .
world @@@ -@@ @ class projects were built to convey a new image of development .
there , I found development patterns similar to what I saw in China .
how are we going to build all of this ?
I know Africans who are already doing it .
he works in the country where he comes from , Burkina Faso .
it 's a design firm that began in Rwanda .
this reduces the carbon footprint of this building , but first and foremost , it provides a safe and dignified space for these expec@@ tant mothers .
we all had one thing in common .
here , they are learning to tackle big challenges such as urban@@ ism and climate change , as Kun@@ l@@ é and his team have .
however , the approach I built here is actually high @@@ -@@ @ resolution , low @@@ -@@ @ cost , and probably most importantly , very scal@@ able .
you can imagine a new kind of sculp@@ ting tool , where I 'm kind of warming something up , making it m@@ alle@@ able , and then letting it cool down and sol@@ idi@@ fying in a certain state .
there 's no manual .
( appl@@ ause ) Now , of course , I can bring up a keyboard .
obviously , this is a standard keyboard , but of course I can resc@@ ale it to make it work well for my hands .
so , again , with a multi @@@ -@@ @ point interface , you can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to til@@ t around like that -- ( Sur@@ pris@@ ed la@@ ughter ) It 's not just simply re@@ leg@@ ated to a kind of 2@@ D pan@@ ning and motion .
( la@@ ughter ) And so the last thing I want to show you is -- I 'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing .
this technique of being able to manipulate a m@@ esh here , with multiple control points , is actually state of the art .
as more of us move into cities , more of us are eating meat , so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals .
and it 's an escalating problem too .
and it 's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed .
that 's a big problem . and actually if we carry on as we are , it 's a problem we 're very unlikely to be able to solve .
although at the same time we 're losing an equivalent amount of existing ar@@ ables to sal@@ in@@ ization and erosion .
a billion of us are ob@@ ese , while a further billion star@@ ve .
this is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . they need each other .
so , if you like , the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them .
so how did a city like this feed itself ?
so the grain markets were to the south of the city .
and then 10 years later everything changed .
this is an image of the Great Western in 18@@ 40 .
and as you can see , some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep .
they 're being sla@@ ugh@@ tered out of sight and mind , somewhere in the countryside .
and this changes everything .
now it 's anonymous .
same idea : series of semi @@@ -@@ @ independent city @@@ -@@ @ states , little bl@@ obs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around , joined to one another by railway .
it even got built , but nothing to do with this vision that How@@ ard had .
by the way , these can be men as well .
here , I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .
the trick is to join them up , to use food as a way of seeing .
if the city looks after the country , the country will look after the city .
we know we are what we eat .
now , the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes , studying these naturally occurring groups .
it 's not enough to simply write people off .
but let 's move on to Stage Two .
it will be des@@ pa@@ iring hostility .
now imagine having a whole room of people saying , in effect , " I 'm great and you 're not . "
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book .
it is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four .
it was not Christmas time . there was a Christmas tree .
now , what 's important to people at Z@@ ap@@ po@@ s , these may not be the things that are important to you .
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens .
this is a scene or sn@@ ip@@ pet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Des@@ mond Tut@@ u won the Nobel Prize .
in fact , South Africa has not gone down that road .
ok@@ ay , got it . I don 't want to talk Stage One .
but I should really talk Stage Five , right ? " life is great . "
and we have to du@@ ke it out every day , so we resort to politics .
only two percent , only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five .
if Gall@@ up releases a poll on the same day that N@@ BC releases a poll , people will pay attention to the Gall@@ up poll . ok@@ ay , we understand that .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria .
we did@@ n 't have snow , we ate man@@ goes , and we never talked about the weather , because there was no need to .
my characters also d@@ rank a lot of g@@ inger beer , because the characters in the British books I read d@@ rank g@@ inger beer .
what this demonstrates , I think , is how impres@@ sion@@ able and vulnerable we are in the face of a story , particularly as children .
my father was a professor .
my mother was an administrator .
the only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor .
it had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something .
she asked where I had learned to speak English so well , and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language .
I must say that before I went to the U.S. , I did@@ n 't consciously identify as African .
and , as often happens in America , immigration became synony@@ mous with Mexic@@ ans .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Now , obviously I said this in a fit of mild irrit@@ ation .
I 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
now , the conventional wisdom was that Nig@@ er@@ ians don 't read literature .
now , you must write a sequ@@ el , and this is what will happen ... "
( la@@ ughter ) And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequ@@ el .
she had not only read the book , but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequ@@ el .
show of hands : how many people think it 's the gray one ?
but first , we have to ask another question , which is , " What is color for ? "
now , can any of you see the pre@@ dat@@ or that 's about to jump out at you ?
let me show you what I mean .
and these are two projections from the world .
there 's no inherent meaning in information .
B@@ eau L@@ ot@@ to : " what are you reading ? " half the letters are missing , right ?
so , let me show you how quickly our bra@@ ins can re@@ define norm@@ ality , even at the simplest thing the brain does , which is color .
now I want you to look at that do@@ t between the green and the red .
( la@@ ughter ) But I really want you to learn .
I take it from your response they don 't look the same anymore , right ?
we have two identical tiles on the left , one in a dark sur@@ round , one in a light sur@@ round .
the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray .
and suddenly it will f@@ lip , and start sp@@ inning the opposite direction .
so depending on where it looks , it f@@ lips between the two possibilities .
now , they 're not born that way , right ?
( la@@ ughter ) And now , in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers .
and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue , but to go where the other be@@ es go .
so , illu@@ sions are often used , especially in art , in the words of a more contemporary artist , " to demonstrate the fragility of our senses . "
well , one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound , and we enable people to hear their visual world .
on the left is what his camera sees .
and this is a six @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child com@@ posing a piece of music for a 32 @@@ -@@ @ piece orchestra .
and this is what it sounds like .
what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature , ok@@ ay ?
so , if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain , I 'd like to do this one .
I 'm going to put the middle nine under a pur@@ pl@@ ish light .
do they look the same ?
no .
the question is , " Is that an illusion ? "
when Ford was about three years old , we shared a very small room together , in a very small space .
and you can imagine , if you 're a writer , that things would get really crowded around deadlines .
there was no more space in the house . so I went out to the back@@ yard , and without any previous building experience , and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials , I built this space .
there was enough space . and I had control , which was very important .
so I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
but on the inside , it 's anything but .
here 's another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
the guy did it all himself .
there were definitely hang @@@ -@@ @ out spots .
take this place for example .
on the outside it looks like a typical nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern garage .
the only thing that might tip you off is the round window .
( la@@ ughter ) And so there is a good reason for this .
and right off the garage he has his own tro@@ phy room where he can sort of b@@ ask in his accomplishments , which is another sort of important part about a man@@ space .
it 's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship .
it 's a collection of nautical anti@@ ques from the 17@@ 00@@ s and 18@@ 00@@ s .
and I realized that 's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did .
my colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to re@@ discover this lost world in a project we call The M@@ ann@@ ah@@ att@@ a Project .
and I 'd like to tell you the story in three acts , and if I have time still , an ep@@ il@@ o@@ gue .
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the mead@@ ow and the forest and the cli@@ ffs make habitats for plants and animals .
or this painting , from the 17@@ 4@@ 0s , from Green@@ wich Village .
and it 's a remarkable map . it 's in the National Archives here in Ke@@ w .
and it 's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide .
this is Rich@@ mond Hill , and M@@ ine@@ tta Water , which used to run its way through Green@@ wich Village .
or the sw@@ amp at Gra@@ mercy Park , right here .
or Mur@@ ray Hill . and this is the Mur@@ rays ' house on Mur@@ ray Hill , 200 years ago .
but I had another idea about this map .
so , the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan , places that are close to water , places that are near the harb@@ or to fish , places protected from the winter winds .
so , we built a model that explains where those fields might have been .
and we might think of these as abandoned .
but , in fact , they 're grass@@ land habitats for grass@@ land birds and plants .
and they have become succ@@ essional sh@@ rub lands , and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities .
where do they get their water ? where do they get their shelter ?
as if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the be@@ a@@ ver .
or the bo@@ g tur@@ tle , needing wet mead@@ ows and insects and sunny places .
or the Bob@@ cat , needing ra@@ bb@@ its and be@@ a@@ vers and den sites .
an asp@@ en needs fire and dry soils .
and it need be@@ a@@ vers to create the we@@ tlands , and maybe some other things .
and that you can put these on a grid that 's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way .
each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type .
they are the connections that actually make nature resilient .
and then we took this data .
this is the view from the East River , looking up Mur@@ ray Hill at where the United Nations is today .
this is the view over Times Square , with the be@@ a@@ ver pond there , looking out toward the east .
in fact , that I see them as reflections of each other , much as Le@@ wis Car@@ roll did in " Th@@ rough the Lo@@ oking Glass . "
so , how can we en@@ vision the city of the future ?
the next day , the farmer 's son ri@@ des one of the wild horses , is thrown off and breaks his leg .
when my daughter Fi@@ ona was born , she weighed 4 pounds , 12 oun@@ ces , or 2.@@ 15 kilograms .
one friend said , " She 's the most aware baby I 've ever seen . "
( la@@ ughter ) Two : I had a choice .
she would lead a rare life .
other babies her age were for sure pulling up to stand and to@@ dd@@ ling around , some of them .
then again , what I watched that afternoon was a baby yan@@ king on an electric cord , so you know , good or bad , hard to say .
it was beautiful , it was complicated , joy@@ ful , hard -- in other words : just another expression of the human experience .
inter@@ facing with the Internet , it gets s@@ mar@@ ter over the years .
the point is that education do@@ es@@ n 't actually work by teaching you things .
and also , 18th century Pr@@ us@@ sians ate very , very few vegetables -- rather like contemporary Scottish people .
you start with 12 and they take them away .
fish and chips in newspaper , the Corn@@ ish Past@@ y , the pi@@ e , the sand@@ wich .
it tastes great within the borders of that country , but absolute sh@@ ite if you take it anywhere else .
( la@@ ughter ) Un@@ ic@@ um in Hungary , for example .
I 'll give you one example .
( la@@ ughter ) Woman : have any of these diamond shapes gone out ?
it 's like a No@@ ah 's Ar@@ k . it 's like an archive .
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders .
so , this theory is that the brain creates , builds , a version of the universe , and projects this version of the universe , like a bubble , all around us .
they are confused , and you CA@@ N@@ NOT make a decision .
it is what you inf@@ er about that room .
" can the brain build such a perception ? "
it 's a sym@@ phony of your universe , your reality .
they are highly reactive , and they are super @@@ -@@ @ plastic , and so the au@@ ti@@ sts are probably capable of building and learning a sym@@ phony which is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able for us .
how many trees does it have ?
but as you do this , what you see is that the branches inter@@ sect actually in millions of locations , and at each of these inter@@ sections they can form a syn@@ ap@@ se .
and your ne@@ ur@@ ons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way .
and you may have more or less ne@@ ur@@ ons .
so it 's very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circu@@ itry .
we can use less or more of them .
so , let 's switch it on . but to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .
and in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one ne@@ ur@@ on .
through one of those sponsor @@@ -@@ @ an @@@ -@@ @ orph@@ an programs , I was sponsored and given an opportunity to acquire an education .
I started off in Uganda .
she hands me this warm to@@ wel -- warm , ste@@ amy , snow white .
( la@@ ughter ) I still have it .
the second is that it 's put us in a place where we have no idea what 's going to happen in terms of the future .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , " What do you do ? "
and we run our companies like this .
( la@@ ughter ) " M@@ ust try harder . "
( la@@ ughter ) Don 't they ?
and there 's a reason .
around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century .
it 's a process of academic inflation .
I say , " Ter@@ ry , please , I 'm trying to f@@ ry an egg in here . "
( la@@ ughter ) Ac@@ tually , do you know that old philosophical thing , " If a tree falls in a forest , and nobody hears it , did it happen ? "
in the end , the doctor went and sat next to Gil@@ li@@ an and said , " I 've listened to all these things your mother 's told me .
and when they got out of the room , he said to her mother , " Just stand and watch her . "
take her to a dance school . "
our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip @@@ -@@ @ mine the earth for a particular commodity .
there was a wonderful quote by Jon@@ as Sal@@ k , who said , " If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth , within 50 years , all life on Earth would end .
if all human beings disappeared from the Earth , within 50 years , all forms of life would flourish . "
the second way in which sound affects you is psychological .
I don 't think so .
so if I were to play this ...
( jack@@ ham@@ mer ) for more than a few seconds , you 'd feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you 'd be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental , even hostile , and it has a dramatic effect on sales .
for you retailers , you may want to look away before I show this slide .
I hope that 's going to change over the next few years .
every brand is out there making sound right now .
secondly , make it appropriate to the situation .
finally , test and test it again .
this happened in some cases , but it did not happen in other cases .
in these communities , the fishermen developed a kind of social contract that told each one of them to hold back a bit to prevent over@@ fishing .
this is how communities in Asia managed water , and this is how indigenous peoples in the Amazon managed wildlife .
so today , we pump millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the air , we dump plastics , fertilizers and industrial waste into the rivers and oceans , and we cut down forests that absorb CO2 .
it does have limits .
now is the time we start managing the global comm@@ ons as our parents or our grand@@ parents managed their local comm@@ ons .
third , we need to change our production @@@ -@@ @ consumption system .
and finally , we need to change our food system , what to eat and how to produce it .
if everybody stays on the sidel@@ ines , waiting for others to step in , the global comm@@ ons will continue to deteriorate , and everybody will be much worse off .
we breathe the same air , we drink the same water , we depend on the same oceans , forests , and biodiversity .
do you know what this was right here ? this was World War II .
the personal debt @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years .
it shows leverage , tren@@ ded out from 1919 to 2009 .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households .
so if you think about that , the context , the casu@@ al@@ ness with which we talk about trillion @@@ -@@ @ dollar ba@@ il@@ out here and trillion there , we are stac@@ king ourselves up for long @@@ -@@ @ term leverage .
so there 's a bright side to everything .
blue @@@ -@@ @ coll@@ ar yacht club -- where you can join , but you 've got to work in the boat@@ yard as condition of membership .
so we see with em@@ pa@@ thy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession .
( la@@ ughter ) So , from a value and values standpoint , what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .
( la@@ ughter ) The third of the four laws of post @@@ -@@ @ crisis consum@@ erism is about durable living .
then we look at the High Line in New York City , an excellent use of re@@ imag@@ ining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand @@@ -@@ @ new park in New York City .
you actually need to organize it .
you need to harness it . you need to give it meaning .
and there 's lots of really interesting examples here .
so when we look at this and step back , what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real .
it 's been tremend@@ ously powerful for consumers .
and we 're going to try to do a photo @@@ -@@ @ real face of an actress named E@@ mil@@ y O '@@ Bri@@ en , who is right there .
this is a face @@@ -@@ @ scanning sphere , with 156 white LE@@ Ds all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions .
so the next process was then to anim@@ ate her .
you know , this little office of the conductor .
this is the closest to an Oriental bel@@ ly@@ dancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna .
you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body .
you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience .
and not all conduc@@ tors do just that .
Ric@@ car@@ do M@@ ut@@ i , please .
you have to sing " A@@ aa@@ aa@@ ah , " and I 'll stop you .
when M@@ ut@@ i is asked , " Why do you conduct like this ? "
it 's Moz@@ art as I , Ric@@ car@@ do M@@ ut@@ i , understand it . "
so he had to resign . is@@ n 't that nice ?
it 's not true . when he was a young man of about 30 , he wrote what he called " The Ten Comm@@ and@@ ments for Conduc@@ tors . "
so it 's not about my story . it 's not about your story .
audience : ( cl@@ aps ) I@@ ta@@ y Tal@@ g@@ am : good . now like a Kar@@ a@@ jan . since you 're already trained , let me concentrate , close my eyes . come , come .
now I can tell you , even the Berlin Phil@@ harmon@@ ic do@@ es@@ n 't know when to play .
they look at Kar@@ a@@ jan . and then they look at each other .
that is another story .
and that 's what makes them into partners .
you have the plan in your head .
( music ) And now there is a trum@@ pet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done .
but authority is not enough to make people your partners .
and the second thing is it 's about actually being in control , but in a very special way .
Kle@@ i@@ ber not only creates a process , but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place .
you have this control . you have this control . and all you put together , in partnership , brings about the best music .
so Kle@@ i@@ ber is about process .
Kle@@ i@@ ber is about conditions in the world .
( la@@ ughter ) D@@ id you see L@@ enn@@ y 's face ?
it 's suffering , like , enjoying himself in a Jewish way , as they say .
and for the last video , I think this is simply the best title .
( music ) ( Appl@@ ause )
it 's the basis of human connection .
boys who were taught to man up -- " don 't be so emotional . "
it was my daughter who reminded me of how much I used to feel .
we were at the beach .
so I cur@@ led up next to her and I dri@@ zz@@ led sand on her other arm and then her legs .
and then I said , " He@@ y , you want me to bury you ? "
" what else ? " I ask .
" violent , " she says .
and that 's because we live in this binary culture and we 're taught from a very young age to sort the world into good and bad .
let 's teach our children to stay open and curious about their experiences , like a travel@@ er in a foreign land .
and over the course of half an hour , not one sy@@ rin@@ ge was fil@@ med being un@@ wrapped .
so you can imagine the scale of this problem .
and that job is that they go around and pick up sy@@ ring@@ es from the back of hospitals , wash them , and in the course of this , obviously picking them up they in@@ jure themselves .
the last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago .
it will create huge opportunities in technology .
this is a stem cell that we 've developed here in Oxford , from an embry@@ onic stem cell .
I don 't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030 , because of this capacity to regener@@ ate parts of the body .
the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in gene@@ tics .
but will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can afford it ? are we headed for a new eu@@ gen@@ ics ?
this could be our best century ever because of the achievements , or it could be our worst .
we need to understand that the governance structure in the world is f@@ os@@ sil@@ ized .
we know , and I know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
nothing new was learned .
think how many discoveries they represent .
well , we 've seen that that can 't be true .
" so you admit it 's all interpretation .
and they don 't perceive even those as what they really are , namely electrical crac@@ k@@ les .
consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons .
that accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth .
but now , the fact that it 's also a good explanation , hard to vary , makes the crucial difference .
for instance , when Dem@@ e@@ ter 's upset , she ban@@ ishes heat from her vicinity into the other hemisphere , where it makes summer .
it is instrumental as it really in@@ spi@@ res us to ask questions , but it is also instrumental because it ign@@ ites change .
H@@ w@@ ami has fantastic takes on what it means to be an African and an African life .
this involves blue@@ prints , industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers .
and that 's the shell around that glob@@ ular fat .
well , most likely it would . it might be able to grow .
the proto@@ cells can actually move away from the light .
this is terrestrial chemistry . we 've all got it , which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries .
they can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture .
and finally , an observer in the future marvel@@ ing at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one .
and after my conviction , after that awak@@ ening of forgiveness , I had this move to help change the system .
it was an honest trust issue .
he trusted us , even though we were on death row .
we rolled up our tro@@ users , and waited for mosqu@@ it@@ oes that were coming to b@@ ite us so we could collect them to check if they were carrying malaria .
today , ladies and gent@@ lemen , I still catch mosqu@@ it@@ oes for a living .
but I do this mostly to improve people 's lives and well @@@ -@@ @ being .
it turns out we actually know very little .
this is our mosqu@@ ito city .
but what if we could use the mosqu@@ it@@ oes ' sexual behavior to also control them ?
so , first of all I would like to tell you that actually mosqu@@ it@@ oes mate in what we call s@@ war@@ ms .
male mosqu@@ it@@ oes usually cong@@ reg@@ ate in clusters around the horizon , usually after sunset .
they cl@@ ump together and fall down onto the floor .
they can smell from as far sometimes as 100 meters away .
and when they get closer , they can even tell the difference between two family members .
they know who you are based on what you produce from your breath , skin , swe@@ at and body odor .
and this is why my colleagues , for example -- we have looked at the fact that some mosqu@@ it@@ oes like to b@@ ite you on the leg region .
and we 've now created these mosqu@@ ito rep@@ ell@@ ent sand@@ als that tourists and locals can wear when they 're coming .
and you don 't get bit@@ ten -- this gives you ' round the clock protection until the time you go under your bed@@ net .
the African Union has set a goal of 2030 to eliminate malaria from the continent .
thank you very much , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
K@@ K : I won 't ask then , you answer .
in Africa , we 're having to deal with three or four of these as the major guys .
in Africa we do a lot of household spraying .
all these are aimed solely at killing the mosqu@@ it@@ oes .
thank you very much .
and there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that .
one : that society equ@@ ates living in a permanent structure , even a sh@@ ack , with having value as a person .
at first , living in the van was great .
and it became impossible to park anywhere -- ( L@@ augh@@ s ) -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me , and it was really hot .
food ro@@ tted in the heat .
ice in my ice chest mel@@ ted within hours , and it was pretty mis@@ erable .
and I faced a whole new set of challenges .
and when I realized that T@@ im Rus@@ sert , former moderator of " Me@@ et the Press , " was talking about my writing , while I was living in a van in a W@@ al @@@ -@@ @ M@@ art parking lot , I started laugh@@ ing .
but society continues to stig@@ mati@@ ze and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
we 're not top on people 's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on .
she told this to one of her colleagues , who said , " Well , what does your boy@@ friend do ? "
and you can count : one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 -- it happens after the 10th t@@ oss .
the first time they do it , maybe it happens after the 10th t@@ oss , as here .
either they 're the same , or this one 's bigger than this one , or this one 's bigger than that one .
OK , who h@@ as@@ n 't voted yet ? because that 's really n@@ augh@@ ty -- I said you had to .
that turns out to be important .
you 're a little bit excited with the first head -- you get rather more excited with the next tail .
and that 's an informal way of presenting it -- that 's why there 's a difference .
it 's another way of getting the in@@ tuition .
when you look at DNA , there 's a sequence of not two things -- heads and tails -- but four letters -- As , Gs , Cs and Ts .
why do we want to do that ?
because we understand very little about most human diseases .
and I take one of you , or I take someone off the street , and I test them for the disease in question .
come on -- everyone 's got to get involved .
and in fact , if this is the prevalence of the disease , about 100 will have the disease and the rest won 't .
each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit .
unfortunately here -- and , really , regrettably -- first of all , in a situation like this you 'd have to verify it empir@@ ically .
it 's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test , which is 99 percent accurate , the chance of having the disease is 99 percent .
and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that 's unlikely , because of the presumption of innocence .
and then if she were trying to kill the children , she succeeded .
and it 's particularly topical because he 's currently facing a dis@@ repu@@ te charge at Britain 's General Medical Council .
at the very least , we should recognize that , and we tend not to .
and everyone said , " Well , that 's fine . he 's an expert . "
forensic scientists said , " The chance that this guy 's innocent is one in three million . "
we sort of expect it of politicians and don 't hope for much more .
and the last words he said to his brother were , " Don 't cry for me , Al@@ fred .
but on a larger scale of biology , actually sym@@ metry is very important , because it actually communic@@ ates genetic information .
they also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it .
so they explored a more geometric art .
the Al@@ ham@@ bra somehow asks all of these questions .
for G@@ alo@@ is , sym@@ metry -- unlike for Thomas Man@@ n , which was something still and dea@@ thly -- for G@@ alo@@ is , sym@@ metry was all about motion .
what can you do to a sym@@ metrical object , move it in some way , so it looks the same as before you moved it ?
now , for G@@ alo@@ is , there was actually a sixth sym@@ metry .
what G@@ alo@@ is realized : it is@@ n 't just the individual sym@@ me@@ tries , but how they interact with each other which really character@@ izes the sym@@ metry of an object .
let 's see . let 's do the third of the turn first , and then the sixth of a turn .
well , the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with .
it 's almost like the concept of number being developed for sym@@ metry .
and then there is an interesting place half@@ way along an edge , where I can rotate by 180 degrees .
so rotate along half@@ way along the edge , and they all match up .
and it 's a sym@@ metry we call 6 @@@ -@@ @ 3 @@@ -@@ @ 2 .
so I think it 's a great example of things un@@ seen , which the power of mathematical language allows you to create .
if you all stay down he wins it automatically .
( la@@ ughter ) Let 's have the other ones , who sat down during the 20 , up again . ok@@ ay ?
and I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese " Es@@ says in Id@@ len@@ ess " : " in everything , uniformity is undesirable .
if you look at all the world religions , all the main world religions , you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion .
and I 'm touched , so that tears come to my eyes .
who CA@@ N@@ NOT be touched by compassion when we see the terrible hor@@ rors of the results of war , or famine , or earthquakes , or tsu@@ nam@@ is ?
therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
and then God looked to the future and realized that , in fact , if the world were just filled with compassion , there would be an@@ archy and chaos .
there had to be limits to all things .
because in Judaism , the number 18 , in Hebrew letters , stands for life -- the word " life . "
so one has got to discover a certain whol@@ eness .
your moment of happiness reveals that reality , that realization , that recognition : " maybe I am the whole .
maybe the sw@@ ami is right . " you start your new life .
( la@@ ughter ) You learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
you have to act comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately .
( la@@ ughter ) You fake it and make it .
and if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , " Fix a plate " for that person , put it in the oven , then we could say grace , and we could eat .
for when one is honored , all are honored .
my task was , at least once a week , to visit Mother Las@@ sit@@ er who lived on East Street , Mother Willi@@ am@@ son who lived on B@@ led@@ so@@ e Avenue , and Mother La@@ thers who lived on O@@ ber@@ lin Road .
of course , it was a minister 's family , so we had to add God into it .
and if we had been faithful in caring and sharing , we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world .
let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion .
and whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . "
now that 's compassion .
I see -- always , it sti@@ rs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Lu@@ ther King , J@@ r .
arm in arm for struggle .
you heard about riots all across the land .
Bob@@ by Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indi@@ an@@ apolis .
it was , " he said , " one of the most powerful moments of life together .
or , as Father Divine in Har@@ le@@ m used to say to fol@@ ks , " Some people preach the Gospel .
so , the real issue is : how do you tangi@@ bil@@ itate compassion ?
that is all well and good , but where do we go wrong , and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world ?
in one of the battles that the prophet waged , he told his followers , " We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war , to the greater battle . "
" it 's me , " or , more grammatically correctly , " It is I , " as we might say in English .
all we have to do is to get our eg@@ os out of the way , get our eg@@ o@@ tism out of the way .
we know it all .
for what defines humanity , perhaps bi@@ ologically , is our physi@@ ology , but God defines humanity by our spirituality , by our nature .
and this immediately che@@ ers him up , as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion .
he is a very good colleague of E@@ in@@ stein 's , we must say .
they 're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enligh@@ tenment , but they are acting sel@@ fish and pa@@ thetic .
so he went on this retreat . and he med@@ itated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya .
and he said , " That 's ridic@@ ulous . you can 't make a needle by rub@@ bing a lump of iron with a cloth . "
and he again leaves , and this time : water dri@@ pping , making a giant bow@@ l in the rock where it dri@@ ps in a stream .
and he becomes interested in this dog because it 's so pa@@ thetic , and it 's trying to attract his attention . and he sits down looking at the dog .
so , he takes it to some water . he 's about to clean , but then his awareness focuses on the mag@@ go@@ ts .
so he says , " Well , I 'll put my tongue on the dog 's flesh .
and then , suddenly , there 's a p@@ ff@@ t , a noise like that .
and then you try to say , " Well , the loved ones I love .
and also , actually , I 've been your mother .
I 've been female , and I 've been every single one of yours ' mother in a previous life , the way the Budd@@ hi@@ sts reflect .
and so , we reflect until we can sort of see that mo@@ therly expression in all beings .
every being , even the most mean looking ones , can be mo@@ therly .
and then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy , when they are satisfied .
and every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness .
and you look at them , and you see how they are .
and you realize how un@@ happy they are actually , mostly , most of the time .
and they think of it as somehow mach@@ o , hard discipline on themselves .
and , of course , they are cruel and ru@@ th@@ less toward others .
and this is where you feel real compassion for them .
some bad guy is making himself more and more un@@ happy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways .
and in Buddhism , they catch it in the future life .
of course in the@@ istic religion they 're punished by God or whatever .
and materi@@ alism , they think they get out of it just by not existing , by dying , but they don 't .
but " kindness " means " universal responsibility . "
so , practice compassion , read the charter , disseminate it and develop it within yourself .
OK so , a quick natural history , first of compassion .
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fu@@ zz@@ y .
the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family .
I 'm sure a lot of you , if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them , you feel really bad .
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison .
you see it in the Middle East : people who , from Gaza , are firing missiles at Israel .
it 's why social organization has grown from the hun@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ ga@@ there@@ r village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a globalized world .
any form of interdependence , or non @@@ -@@ @ zero @@@ -@@ @ sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people .
environmental problems , in many ways , put us all in the same boat .
and there are non @@@ -@@ @ zero @@@ -@@ @ sum relationships that maybe people are@@ n 't aware of .
if they get less and less happy , that will be bad for Americans .
I think it 's worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand .
I would just sum up the way things look , at least from this secular perspective , as far as compassion and the golden rule go , by saying that it 's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature .
I 've got apparently 18 minutes to convince you that history has a direction , an arrow ; that in some fundamental sense , it 's good ; that the arrow points to something positive .
but then at some point , one of these mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff , which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution : cultural evolution .
a lot of you have heard the term " mem@@ es . " the evolution of technology , I pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand ax@@ e .
now , first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are , to be on the br@@ ink of true global social organization .
now , I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called " non @@@ -@@ @ zero sum@@ ness . "
non @@@ -@@ @ zero @@@ -@@ @ sum games in which cor@@ relations can be positive , OK .
the argument I make is basically that , well , non @@@ -@@ @ zero @@@ -@@ @ sum games have always been part of life .
it 's just the Persi@@ ans who are@@ n 't fully human and don 't deserve to be treated very nic@@ ely .
and there 's something I worry about especially , which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slip@@ per@@ y slope .
there 's going to have to be a less@@ ening of the amount of hatred in the world , given how dangerous it 's becoming .
and that 's why I lump growing le@@ th@@ ality of hatred and death spiral of neg@@ ativity under the general ru@@ bri@@ c , reasons to be cheer@@ ful .
there are people who worry about this , and in fact , I , myself , apparently , was denounced on national TV a couple of nights ago because of an op @@@ -@@ @ ed I 'd written .
it was kind of along these lines , and the allegation was that I have , quote , " affec@@ tion for terrorists . "
and something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of " democratization of intim@@ acy . "
and I would actually , I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they 're doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
they Skype with their families a few times a week .
I mean , I could tell you hundreds of them .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
now we have spra@@ w@@ ling residential subur@@ bias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
and they are doing it m@@ assi@@ vely .
in the last six months , more than 300 sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers in the UAE have been put on hold or cancel@@ ed .
let 's think about your ethical footprint .
head@@ lines that look like this when they have to do with climate change ; and like this when they have to do with air quality or smo@@ g .
but despite its very small weight , enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet .
we run enormous models on super@@ computers ; this is what I happen to do .
and you don 't necessarily have to have your own TV set .
conte@@ stants also put themselves forward .
and here she relates , in the documentary film " Afghan Star , " how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
what I got is basically a gesture @@@ -@@ @ interface device that actually acts as a motion @@@ -@@ @ sensing device made for two dollars .
I thought , " Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical stic@@ ky note to the digital world ? "
the camera is actually tracking all your ge@@ stures .
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I 'm touching the paper .
you can of course watch movies .
this is incredible , really .
PM : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
so I 'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment .
if this is true , learning a language in childhood may give you a more holistic grasp of its social and emotional contexts .
if you understand the difference between ' the world ' and ' my world , ' you understand the difference between lo@@ gos and my@@ th@@ os .
it is the belief system that we carry .
we don 't know who he was .
and the gym@@ nos@@ oph@@ ist answered , " I 'm experiencing no@@ th@@ ingness . "
" what should you not be ?
it was called the Va@@ it@@ aran@@ i .
because it has to end .
who knows ?
and then look at the Indian classical dan@@ cer , the Ku@@ ch@@ ip@@ ud@@ i dan@@ cer , the B@@ har@@ at@@ an@@ at@@ y@@ am dan@@ cer , cur@@ vac@@ eous .
and he knew very intu@@ i@@ tively , that best practices , developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India .
" just know where I came from , why I did the Ju@@ ga@@ ad . "
under a tree she saw a woman med@@ itating fu@@ ri@@ ously .
in India there is a rape every three minutes .
look around you , look at your own countries .
if you 're in India , it 's either Muslims or A@@ di@@ va@@ sis , our tri@@ b@@ als , the N@@ ax@@ al@@ ites .
if you 're in the U.S. , it 's mostly the bl@@ acks .
so , have we all become one @@@ -@@ @ e@@ yed -- two @@@ -@@ @ e@@ yed instead of one @@@ -@@ @ e@@ yed -- mon@@ keys ?
good morning .
art can go through where other things can 't .
she told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dow@@ ry Dance .
we had somebody from public health . and Dev@@ du@@ t@@ t also mentioned public health .
well , millions of people around the world die of water@@ borne disease every year .
and the M@@ N@@ Cs give them machines that they CA@@ N@@ NOT afford .
and it was a simple idea . it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field .
because there is no profit in it .
I have a solution that requires neither machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas .
five , six , seven , eight fol@@ ds we make .
our drinking water safe we make .
five , six , seven , eight fol@@ ds we make .

( whi@@ st@@ ling ) Her father the king said , " Don 't whi@@ stle . "
so she went up to each and said , " Do you accept that I have defeated you ? "
is it military strength ? well , we have the world 's fourth largest army .
now , in this age , again , countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage .
in order to have soft power , you have to be connected .
and that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market .
but , what perhaps some of you don 't realize is how far we 've come to get there .
they had to suspend functions at 8 : 30 .
so , maybe -- oh sorry , he is Christian , I be@@ g your pardon -- and he is male , but he is@@ n 't white .
we don 't even have geography uniting us , because the natural geography of the sub@@ continent framed by the mountains and the sea was h@@ acked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947 .
in fact , you can 't even take the name of the country for granted , because the name " India " comes from the river Indu@@ s , which flows in Pakistan .
that is a 21st @@@ -@@ @ century story as well as an ancient one .
well , what does that mean ?
he sk@@ inned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ri@@ bc@@ age of the dog and improvised a s@@ led , harn@@ essed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it knife in belt .
it 's an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
156 nations carry our television channel .
actually this creature is the result of the Pen@@ field research .
and this noise is the most neutral .
and this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school .
and the ir@@ ony for me was of course , I did@@ n 't do that for the sake of science progress .
so we took too many of them .
and the concept is to create a kind of on@@ ion , a kind of structure in layers .
but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient .
and he does not feel anymore it 's relies on asth@@ ma treatment , as the asth@@ ma treatment needs him .

( la@@ ughter ) It would be a great honor , a great compli@@ ment for me , if he had@@ n 't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening .
I guess you won 't be surprised if I tell you that Pin@@ oc@@ ch@@ io is one of my great influences .

and at that young age , 10 years old , Ben@@ ki became the pa@@ je of his community .
so when I think of that , I wonder what our grand@@ children and our great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ children , when they ask themselves that question , I wonder how they will answer .
we 're running out of fossil fuels .
when I asked S@@ ang@@ ha@@ mit@@ ra , " How did you get from English literature to HIV / AIDS ? "
not an obvious path , she said to me , " It 's all connected .
literature makes one sensitive , sensitive to people , to their dreams and to their ideas . "
Mur@@ ali Krishna comes from one of those villages .
he 's a Leaders ' Qu@@ est fellow , and that helps him with his work .
over a lifetime , through everything , through the Cultural Revolution and everything after@@ ward , he 's kept collecting , so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history .
why did he do all this ?
two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the Cultural Revolution , a period that actually most Chinese would prefer to forget .
but he do@@ es@@ n 't want his nation ever to forget .
but they have qualities we 'd all recognize .
they 've built bridges , and they 've walked across them .
they know people have come before them and will follow them .
and they know that they 're part of a whole , that they depend on other people .
so I think we need succession planning on a global basis .
we can 't wait for the next generation , the new join@@ ers , to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need .
as technology progres@@ ses , and as it advances , many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent , make us s@@ mar@@ ter and more connected to the world .
and the mat@@ er has some scales and puts it all together .
the idea is actually relatively simple .
the real gen@@ ius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly .
first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky , if you 're telling time at night .
so , tonight , if it 's clear you 'll be able to see the summer triangle .
( la@@ ughter ) So , I know what you 're thinking : " that 's a lot of work , is@@ n 't it ? is@@ n 't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time ? "
he would not only know what time it was , he would also know where the sun would rise , and how it would move across the sky .
you can survey with it . the city of Baghdad was surveyed with it .
( la@@ ughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d .
( L@@ augh@@ er ) And that , to me , that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mind@@ set I grew up with was changed .
and they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in Tokyo harb@@ or over the last year .
look here , 18@@ 58 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United Kingdom was richer over there .
and I will start the world like this .
but 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of foreign domination , and India had been de @@@ -@@ @ industrialized .
in the 1930 's now , you can see that Japan is going to a period of war , with lower life expectancy .
but they did recover quite fast afterwards .
and they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation , but in very big difficulties down there .
what happens in the after independence ?
you can see that the health started to improve .
but they went up here , and India was trying to follow .
and both countries had the better health , but still a very low economy .
and he said , " do@@ es@@ n 't matter if a cat is white or black , as long as it cat@@ ches m@@ ice . "
and the market re@@ former was successful there .
and here they march on . and will they catch up ?
and I can understand him , because Washington , D.C.
now , the question is , " When will the catch up take place ? "
look at , look at the United States .
Japan did it like this , until full catch up , and then they follow with the other high @@@ -@@ @ income economies .
it 's always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to Asia ?
but of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
there is the story of " The El@@ ves and the Sho@@ em@@ aker . "
and we have the el@@ ves in the form of China .
but we don 't appreciate what an aston@@ ishing thing that has been .
we can be aston@@ ish@@ ingly inven@@ tive and creative .
so how does this transition idea work ?
so it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland , where I was teaching , and has since spread .
another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan , which is basically to develop a plan B for the town .
what does it look like if that 's not the case ? and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody ?
because if we cl@@ ing to it , and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices , the future that it presents to us is one which is really un@@ manageable .
in a way , the static , stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand .
dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth 's land surfaces .
it 's nothing like a tsunami or a Kat@@ r@@ ina : too few c@@ rying children and sm@@ ashed up houses .
a fantastic project , the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent , from Mauritania in the west , all the way to Djibouti in the east .
and a good way of doing that , the most efficient way , is to use some kind of sand cat@@ cher .
it provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habit@@ able spaces inside of the sand dun@@ es .
then , a few years afterwards , using per@@ mac@@ ul@@ tural strategies , we green that part of the desert .
we then pull the pil@@ es up through the d@@ une and we 're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a m@@ old as we go up .
I 'm still on hold .

a woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squ@@ ea@@ king .
I know one guy who 's spent $ 4,000 just on Photoshop over the years .

already , we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design .
( la@@ ughter ) You have to sc@@ roll , like , seven screen@@ s@@ ful to get to it .
this one 's been touched on before , but why in God 's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called " Start ? "
it 's like a 7@@ 47 shuttle cock@@ pit .
he says , " Nice talk . " and I said , " Than@@ k you . what do you do here ? "
you buy the box ; I 'll sell the code .
but there 's also a new Microsoft , that 's really doing good , simple interface designs .
( la@@ ughter ) So , the signs might indicate that the complexity c@@ run@@ ch is only going to get worse .
( la@@ ughter ) When I try to explain why I 'm back , after telling the press Apple 's future is black .
but the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted .
and it 's not just what I dictate that it writes down ; period .
and if you 're among the people who create this stuff : easy is hard .
pre @@@ -@@ @ swe@@ at the details for your audience .
remember , the hard part is not deciding what features to add , it 's deciding what to leave out .
( la@@ ughter ) Or failing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
and I think , look at the tsunami , it 's a classic example .
and whether it 's Jewish or whether it 's Muslim or whether it 's Hindu , or whether it 's S@@ ikh , the same global eth@@ ic is at the heart of each of these religions .
all these things have happened .
and then the Secretary @@@ -@@ @ General of the United Nations came up to speak to God and said , " When will our international institutions work ? "
I 'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive , what we like to call " super@@ massive " black hole at the center of our gal@@ axy .
an ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star 's life .
and all the light that we see from a typical gal@@ axy , which is the kind of gal@@ ax@@ ies that we 're seeing here , comes from the light from the stars .
and we call them active gal@@ actic nuc@@ lei .
now , this is wonderful , because the campaign promise of large teles@@ cop@@ es is that is that the bigger the teles@@ cope , the smaller the detail that we can see .
but it turns out these teles@@ cop@@ es , or any teles@@ cope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise .
and that is because of the atmosphere .
so , to give you a sense of what this is like , it 's actually like looking at a pe@@ b@@ ble at the bottom of a stream .
so , I 've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere , to give us a cleaner view .
and that bu@@ ys us about a factor of 20 .
now , in the next few slides I 'm just going to focus on that little square there .
so , I want to see how these things have moved .
absolutely my favorite star in the world .
and this one , this one goes around in a human lifetime .
that 's kind of profound , in a way .
you can see a lot of stars .
so , there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the gal@@ axy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
and because of that , we 've been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
now , truth in advertising . right ?
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Sch@@ war@@ z@@ child radius .
and the truth is , I 'm not quite there .
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shou@@ ld@@ n 't proceed in that environment .
there is a de@@ ar@@ th of old stars .
there is an abundance of young stars , so it 's the exact opposite of the prediction .
and in fact , today , this is what we 're trying to figure out , this mystery of how do you get -- how do you resolve this contradiction .
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
second , we 've been able to look at that interaction of how super@@ massive black holes interact , and understand , maybe , the role in which they play in shaping what gal@@ ax@@ ies are , and how they work .
and the water will go where it should go .
the water@@ proofing is done perfectly , better than our city contractors , because not a single drop should go waste in this .
it can break sometimes .
( la@@ ughter ) And we request them .
you can see person coming up with two can@@ i@@ sters of water .
and the water level -- these are not empty can@@ i@@ sters -- water level is right up to this .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it become like this .
because soon the water was not able to reach these areas .
( appl@@ ause ) Ja@@ is@@ al@@ mer . this is heart of desert .
well connected , 800 years ago , through Europe .
such a limited rainfall , and highest colorful life flour@@ ished in these areas .
whether water level goes up or down , the beauty is there throughout .
in severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up .
but perhaps they knew that on sixth , November , 2009 , there will be a TED green and blue session , so they painted it like this .
this is called K@@ und . we have , in English , surface water and ground water .
it squee@@ ze the moisture hidden in the sand .
and where we have this gy@@ p@@ sum strip they can harvest this water .
this is the same dry water body .
there are three things : concept , planning , making the actual thing , and also maintaining them .
another pillar , stone pillar on your right side .
and you have to go further down .
there were no English medium schools at that time , even no Hind@@ i schools , [ unclear ] schools .
the last point , we all know in our primary schools that that ca@@ mel is a ship of desert .
last picture , it 's a tat@@ too , 2,000 @@@ -@@ @ years @@@ -@@ @ old tat@@ too .
these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides .
I 'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third @@@ -@@ @ largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry .
P@@ ran@@ i@@ tha 's mother was a woman in prostitution , a prostitu@@ ted person .
by the time we got the information , we reached there , P@@ ran@@ i@@ tha was already raped by three men .
Sha@@ he@@ en 's background I don 't even know .
and when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 sti@@ t@@ ches to put back her intestin@@ e into her body .
my own journey to work with these children started as a teen@@ ager .
I had this I.@@ S. officer 's daughter , who is 14 years old , studying in ninth standard , who was raped chatting with one individual , and ran away from home because she wanted to become a hero@@ ine , who was trafficked .
9@@ 9.9 percent of them resist being induc@@ ted into prostitution .
( appl@@ ause ) one story about one man , at least , putting chil@@ i powder in her vag@@ ina , one man taking a cigarette and burning her , one man wh@@ ip@@ ping her .

( appl@@ ause ) I did@@ n 't inv@@ ent " Be@@ jewel@@ ed . " I can 't take credit for that .
I created something new , I was very excited because , you know , I 'd made cross@@ word pu@@ zzles , but that 's sort of like filling in somebody else 's matrix .
this was something really original . I got ho@@ oked .
now , I should pause and say , what do I mean by puzzle ?

here 's the word " mirror . " no , it 's not the same up@@ side @@@ -@@ @ down .

well , let 's first of all simplify the v@@ ases illusion , make the thing on the right .
and here it is , figure @@@ -@@ @ ground .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
cut up the DNA , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for overl@@ aps , and you basically match them at the edges . and I said , " This is kind of like a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle , except the pieces overlap . "
so , here is what I created for Dis@@ cover Magazine .
there is only one solution . it 's not that hard .
there is also a trend towards games that are good for you .
and what does this add up to ?
here is what we see coming .
let 's see how well we can do . there are three images .
I mean , he must walk in and they will say , " W@@ ould you like a mac@@ chi@@ ato , or a lat@@ te , or an Americ@@ ano , or a cap@@ pu@@ cc@@ ino ? "
( la@@ ughter ) And E@@ la@@ ine M@@ organ yesterday , was@@ n 't she wonderful ?
( la@@ ughter ) But , you know , he 's gone . now he 's gone .
that 's eight years of American History , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that .
" you know , it 's the end of an error [ sic ] .
( la@@ ughter ) " We 're going to find you . "
( la@@ ughter ) But now he 's gone , and it 's great to see one of the -- argu@@ ably one of the worst speech makers in American history , now given way to one of the greatest , in Obama .
( la@@ ughter ) " Not so easy is it ? he@@ h he@@ h he@@ h . "
and you want a leader who in@@ spi@@ res and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen . right ?
do you remember that ? George Bush , " A nu @@@ -@@ @ ca @@@ -@@ @ ler . "
so I kind of had to change h@@ ats , and became quite entrepreneurial and started looking for money to buy the equipment that we required .
and so I was able to convince a government official to buy one of these for the university where I was teaching .
so you had this rich mix of people , people who think differently from one another , and this always is really good for innovation .
I said , " What do you mean ? "
so they were making money -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) and they therefore we@@ ren 't focusing on their studies .
they 've made Kenya famous for IT .
they 're further along .
what you 're seeing in this image over here is Dou@@ gl@@ as , and Dou@@ gl@@ as is an electrical engineer , one of the people who was really active in the Fa@@ b La@@ b .
and he designed a circuit that the client came to him and said , " I need this circuit for a pay @@@ -@@ @ as @@@ -@@ @ you @@@ -@@ @ go system . "
and so the plasma cu@@ tter makes possible the cutting of plate and sheet metal , and basically , you make a design on the computer and send it over to the machine , and then quickly and precisely , it will cut the shapes you want .
so this was designed by my Head of Engineering .
now this is really important -- ( Appl@@ ause ) and it 's really important because the population growth being what it is , a lot of very large companies are looking very closely at the market that 's developing in Africa .
and so we 've te@@ amed W@@ ach@@ ira up with a bank , and the bank is paying him to train people from this sector on how to use this industrial robot .
she 's in her mid @@@ -@@ @ 20@@ s , and she came in very passionate about a problem that she explained .
she was able to engage people in our space to be able to help her to do this , and she 's off and running now with a business acceler@@ ator , so we expect to see great results .
he joined up with his sister who is an architect , and they have this business , and they present the roof tile to a person who is doing development and say , " You can buy it for the cost of just the roof tile without the solar . "
and so they 'll make their money over time , and they 've been able to do quite a few install@@ ments .
we have lots of discussions in our space around who we were as Africans , who we are today , and who we want to be vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis things like consum@@ erism and ethnicity and corruption and so on .
now , I had two preconditions .
well , for one thing , we 're a youth @@@ -@@ @ obs@@ essed culture .
that 's the one advantage that older people have .
fair enough .
this was not an oral history program .
this was not a devastating stroke , but it did affect his speaking and so forth .
I did@@ n 't know who she was , and she said , " D@@ id you get George Ab@@ bot@@ t to talk ? "
and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Ab@@ bot@@ t actually could talk .
the journalist who did " The R@@ ise and Fall of the Third Re@@ ich . "
this guy had met Hitler and G@@ and@@ hi within six months , and every time I 'd ask him about it , he 'd say , " Oh , I just happened to be there .
aw@@ ful .
there 's an extraordinary woman named Cl@@ are Bo@@ o@@ the Lu@@ ce .
she was editor of V@@ anity Fair , one of the great phenomen@@ al women of her day .
so she and I had a del@@ ight@@ ful conversation .
when we were alone , I was her audience .
and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life .
so this is the context in which Ara@@ v@@ ind came into existence about 30 years back as a post @@@ -@@ @ retirement project of Dr. V.
I 'm often asked , " What surprised you about the book ? "
I do believe what Chris said ; I believe that you 're not an accident .
and I began to think about what I call the " stewardship of aff@@ lu@@ ence " and the " stewardship of influence . "
I don 't own a gu@@ esthouse .
in fact , personally , I 've never met a priest or a pa@@ stor or a minister who does it for money .
and I 'm going , what do I do with this no@@ tor@@ iety that the book has brought ?
the purpose of influence is not to build your ego .
you know , there 's a story in the Bible about Moses , whether you believe it 's true or not , it really do@@ es@@ n 't matter to me .
I think that 's one of the most important questions you 'll ever be asked : what 's in your hand ?
and if you saw the movie , you know , he thro@@ ws it down and it becomes a sna@@ ke .
now , I 'm reading this thing , and I 'm going , what is that all about ?
so , he 's saying , " You 're going to lay down your identity .
I 'll do some things you could never imagine possible . "
it represents your income : you 're making a lot of money off that little ball .
and it represents your influence .
and even though you 're only going to be in the N@@ BA for a few years , you 're going to be an N@@ BA player for the rest of your life .
so , what are you going to do with what you 've been given ? "
what are you doing with what you 've been given ?
if you 're wired to be an anthro@@ polog@@ ist , you 'll be an anthro@@ polog@@ ist .
did you know that God s@@ miles when you be you ?
and I just watched their little bodies rise and lower , rise and lower .
rise and lower .
the bottom line is , God gets pleasure watching you be you .
my experience , however , in the Islamic world is very different .
the USA .
4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels .
in the world of 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b , it 's not about b@@ ump and gr@@ ind .
its videos are intended to show a kin@@ der , gent@@ ler face of Islam , for young people to deal with life 's challenges .
" the 99 " and 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural hy@@ bri@@ di@@ zation .
they sat in silence through their trails , w@@ aving occasionally at family and friends .
and they drew a list of people with whom they would talk , and tell their story .
I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist .
I 'll give you an idea .
the political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership , which , generally , is never more than five to seven people .
it was a psychi@@ atr@@ ist . he loved sailing .
he was a really keen sail@@ or . and he had this beautiful boat .
so , because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms , all of the sudden I thought , maybe there is something here .
I sold my company , and funded the research myself .
and there are three main stages .
and the third , of course , is the globalization of terrorism .
but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country .
now , deregulation also brought back ro@@ gue economics .
it is tril@@ lions , it 's not billions .
the United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world .
now , many of you know that the Patri@@ ot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism .
people simply moved their money @@@ -@@ @ laundering activities away from the United States into Europe .
so , within six months Europe became the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the money @@@ -@@ @ laundering activities of the world .
so , this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror , and our own life .
( la@@ ughter ) This is the only way for you to step into the dark side , and have a look at it .
and believe me , it 's going to be sc@@ ary .
I felt , when I had my photographs , that I was holding on to something true , regardless of agendas or politics .
and over there I experienced other people 's suffering , up close and personal , immer@@ sed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories , and at times I experienced great fear for my own life .
Joshua commanded his child @@@ -@@ @ soldiers to commit un@@ speak@@ able crimes , and enforced his command with great brutality .
during this expedition I expected him to be killed outright , and us as well .
but what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible .
but the question is , does forgiveness and redemption replace justice ?
Joshua , in his own words , says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes , and speaks about them from so@@ ap@@ boxes across Monrovia , to an audience that often includes his victims .
where does such rage come from ?
however , a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel .
focus on what 's dignified , courageous and beautiful , and it grows . thank you .
but this is@@ n 't about Red@@ dit .
so the voting started .
( la@@ ughter ) This was the final vote : 78 percent of the votes .
there was a clear lesson : the Internet loves Mi@@ ster Spl@@ ash@@ y P@@ ants .
but even more important was that they accomplished their mission .
the Internet provides a level playing field .
one of the great lessons Green@@ peace learned is that it 's OK to lose control , OK to take yourself a little less seriously , given that , even though it 's a very serious cause , you could ultimately achieve your goal .
actually , sitting here today in My@@ s@@ ore , we 're closer to Mal@@ é than we are to Delhi , for example .
but if you 're a marine bi@@ ologist , Maldives is not such a bad place to be .
for those of you who 've been there , fantastic coral reefs , fantastic diving , fantastic s@@ nor@@ k@@ eling .
this is a blue wh@@ ale . we have blue wh@@ ales in the waters around here , off Maldives , around the waters of India . you can see them off Ker@@ ala .
and , in fact , we 're very lucky in this region .
pic@@ ks up moisture as it crosses the ocean .
now , I 'm a marine bi@@ ologist , but I 'm actually a bit of an old fashi@@ oned natur@@ alist , I suppose .
this is a very beautiful species , it 's called the Oriental S@@ car@@ let .
little lar@@ v@@ ae hat@@ ch out in fresh water .
if you 're going to study dra@@ gon@@ flies , you want to study those really bright beautiful ones , like that red one . or the really rare ones , the endemic endangered ones .
but if you take that attitude , you 're actually missing something rather special .
but I asked some Mal@@ divi@@ an friends and colleagues , and yes they come every year .
and I asked people about them and yes , they knew , but they did@@ n 't know anything , where they came from , or anything .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's built entirely of coral reefs .
average height , about that much above sea level .
you 're too keen . you 're too keen . no . hang on . hang on .
and the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives .
it stret@@ ches about 500 miles , of course it 's India here .
and then the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most Maldives .
I had a rigorous scientific tran@@ sect .
and that sort of gives the impression you 've got one air mass going up and down , up and down . it do@@ es@@ n 't work like that .
it do@@ es@@ n 't make sense . there is nothing for them in Maldives .
they 're up , and they 're off .
if they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look , nothing there , they 'll carry on .
here , here , Kenya , East Africa , they 've actually just come out of a long drought .
those of you from North America will be familiar with the Mon@@ arch bu@@ tter@@ fly .
and that 's where it bree@@ ds .
but it 's a pretty mis@@ erable place to be in the winter .
no , they turn across here .
they have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from India to Africa . includes this one , the hob@@ by .
those of you from northern India will be familiar with this .
and these birds , what I 've done is I 've complied all the records , all the available records of these birds , put them together , and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dra@@ gon@@ flies .
an Indian Navy jet was flying off Go@@ a , ban@@ g ! in the middle of the night . fortunately , a two engine jet got back to base , and they pulled the remains of one of these [ Eurasian Rol@@ lers ] out .
same height as the dra@@ gon@@ flies go .
it 's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract -- ideas , emotions , feelings , concepts , thoughts -- we inevitably resort to met@@ aph@@ or .
and met@@ aph@@ or gives us a much more vivid understanding of Jul@@ ie@@ t than if Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are had literally described what she looks like .
what we see , however , are two overlapping tri@@ angles .
often it is the constra@@ ining or the back @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ wall situation that the ha@@ pl@@ ess common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bri@@ be .
most definitely you don 't want to pay the bri@@ be .
some people actually come back and say , " Oh , you want to screw me . let me show you what I can do . "
and the way we 'll make energy in the future is not from resource , it 's really from knowledge .
f@@ ission .
we 've been trying for 50 years .
you have to make it from something else .
if you just plot how much fuel we 've got left , in units of present world consumption .
and the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
and as you go across there you will see that we 've got a few tens of years , and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left .
and just down the road , this is J@@ ET .
it gets very expensive to do this research .
it 's going to cost us 10 billion . and we 'll produce half a gig@@ aw@@ att of fusion power .
I wish we had more money , I wish we had more resources .
but this is what we 're aiming at , some@@ time in the 20@@ 30s -- real electric power from fusion . thank you very much .
my name is Pap@@ us@@ ay .
I 'd like to speak about technology trends , which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow , for related reasons .
and then finally , DV@@ Ds are approaching free .
but I think that the implications of them approaching these cross@@ overs , these inter@@ sections , are interesting to think about .
start with gene sequ@@ encing .
that 's as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
that is , I imagine , what people in Red@@ mond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about .
at two percent , you start seeing them on the roads everywhere .
and you 've seen the numbers .
and the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to India , is the p@@ is@@ sed @@@ -@@ @ off program@@ mer , is the outsourcing .
because in the ballo@@ on , like in life , we go very well in unforeseen directions .
and as long as we fight horizontally , against life , against the winds , against what 's happening to us , life is a night@@ mare .
well , in a ballo@@ on it 's easy , we have ballast .
we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas .
and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis .
and that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious do@@ g@@ mas .
but sometimes it 's very paradox@@ ical .
so , we dis@@ o@@ bey@@ ed . we flew much higher , and double the speed .
we are burning , as you heard , so much energy , not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life CA@@ N@@ NOT last for long .
when we were flying over the Sahara and India it was nice holidays .
that 's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking .
and after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt .
when I saw that , I made a promise to myself .
I had no idea how it was possible .
for that , unfortunately , four meters w@@ ing@@ span is not enough .
64 meter w@@ ing@@ span to carry one pilot , the batteries , flies slowly enough with the aer@@ odynam@@ ic efficiency .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
it 's not designed by an artist , but it could be .
I don 't think it will transport 200 people in the next years .
it 's a pipe , and it 's written , " This is not a pipe . "
so , through speeches like this one today , through interviews , through meetings , our goal is to get as many people possible on the team .
no , the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life , save energy , go to rene@@ wa@@ bles .
I 'd like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the University of California .
there are 100 billion ne@@ ur@@ ons in the adult human brain .
and each ne@@ ur@@ on makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other ne@@ ur@@ ons in the brain .
and based on this , people have calculated that the number of per@@ mu@@ tations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe .
these are called motor command ne@@ ur@@ ons that have been known for a long time .
so , 120 years ago , Dr. R@@ ö@@ n@@ t@@ gen X @@@ -@@ @ ra@@ yed his wife 's hand .
and I 'm sure Ros@@ s can associate that with design .
still has the tag in it from me buying it , so I can take it back to the shop if she did@@ n 't like it .
because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real , to make it look like it was a real athlete .
and that 's how this was done . it 's actually sl@@ ice , sl@@ ice .
now , that 's a variety of things , from recently deceased bodies , to a sk@@ elet@@ on that was used by student radi@@ ograph@@ ers to train in taking X @@@ -@@ @ rays of the human body , at different den@@ si@@ ties .
( music ) I will show how the cap@@ illary action works , how it feeds , I 'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem .
not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye , the way the leaves form . they 're cur@@ ling back on each other .
and does purpose play into it ?
it reminds me of my college days .
if you 're a mam@@ mal , if you 're a rat or an ele@@ phant , or a human , in between , it 's the same story .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
there is just too many things to go wrong .
and here we have this area where men live the longest , about 10 times more cen@@ ten@@ arians than we have here in America .
you go into the bars in S@@ ard@@ inia , instead of seeing the Sports Il@@ lu@@ str@@ ated sw@@ im@@ suit calendar , you see the cen@@ ten@@ arian of the month calendar .
that 's called the grand@@ mother effect .
it 's a place where people have the longest disability @@@ -@@ @ free life expectancy in the world .
they live a long time , and tend to die in their sleep , very quickly , and often , I can tell you , after sex .
five times as many cen@@ ten@@ arians as we have in America .
a few of the strategies we observed : they eat off of smaller plates , so they tend to eat fewer cal@@ ories at every sitting .
fifteen years ago , the average American had three good friends .
there is our work life , where we 're productive .
and typically that has meant reti@@ ring to the easy chair , or going down to Ari@@ z@@ ona to play golf .
and this is a question . the National Institute on A@@ ging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these cen@@ ten@@ arians .
and one of the questions , they were very culturally a@@ stu@@ te , the people who put the questionnaire .
they instantly knew why they wo@@ ke up in the morning .
for this 102 year old woman , her ik@@ ig@@ ai was simply her great @@@ -@@ @ great @@@ -@@ @ great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ daughter .
and I asked her what it felt like to hold a great @@@ -@@ @ great @@@ -@@ @ great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ daughter .
my editor at Geographic wanted me to find America 's Blue Zone .
but for an Ad@@ ven@@ tist woman , their life expectancy is 89 .
they take their diet directly from the Bible .
Gene@@ sis : chapter one , Ver@@ se [ 29 ] , where God talks about leg@@ um@@ es and seeds , and on one more stan@@ za about green plants , o@@ sten@@ sibly missing is meat .
instead they 're talking about their next nature walk , exchanging recipes , and yes , they pray .
ed R@@ aw@@ lings , 103 years old now , an active co@@ w@@ boy , starts his morning with a swim .
every trip to the store , or to church or to a friend 's house occasions a walk .
they don 't have any conveni@@ ences .
( la@@ ughter ) They tend to eat a plant @@@ -@@ @ based diet .
I want you to put off your pre@@ conceptions , your pre@@ conceived fears and thoughts about rep@@ tiles .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of indeli@@ bly scar your minds with these char@@ is@@ matic and maj@@ estic creatures .
and it actually cra@@ w@@ led into somebody 's bathroom , and was hanging around there for two or three days .
but in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures [ it was necessary ] for us to actually insert a small radio transmit@@ ter inside [ each ] sna@@ ke .
it 's just a w@@ resting match , but a remarkable activity .
you drink it in peri@@ l of your life .
so , in fact at this point there are only 200 breeding gh@@ arial left in the wild .
but complac@@ ency does have a tendency to breed contempt .
people sco@@ op water out of the Cha@@ mb@@ al and drink it , something you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't do in most north Indian rivers .
animals like the Gan@@ ges river dol@@ ph@@ in which is just down to a few left , and it is also critically endangered .
and it 's a bl@@ ea@@ k future for them .
so , people talk about political will .
and there is a gh@@ arial looking at us from the river .
it 's not like the te@@ d@@ dy bear .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : thanks R@@ om . thank you .
you think of , you know , urbanization , consum@@ erism , the workplace , technology .
and I think what that does to us psych@@ ologically is it creates an equation .
well -- well , we speed up , don 't we ?
it 's saying to the rest of world , and to the people in that town , that we believe that in the 21st century , slow@@ ness has a role to play .
because I think they 're looking at the West , and they 're saying , " Well , we like that aspect of what you 've got , but we 're not so sure about that . "
I no longer hear time 's w@@ ing@@ ed ch@@ ari@@ ot drawing near , or at least not as much as I did before .
and perhaps , the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper , richer , stronger .
they need you to move at their rhythm .
the couple are barely 18 years old .
now , when we started working deeper and dig@@ ging deeper , we found that it 's an illegal act .
so , when R@@ ag@@ a@@ v experienced that he went from " teacher told me , " to " I am doing it . " and that 's the " I Can " mind@@ shift .
and it is a process that can be energ@@ ized and nur@@ tured .
show us the grades . "
so , how did the city respond ?
( music ) A@@ tu@@ l Kar@@ w@@ al : a@@ Pro@@ C@@ h is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .
and we plan to extend this to other parts of the city .
( music ) K@@ BS : and because of that , Ah@@ med@@ abad is known as India 's first child @@@ -@@ @ friendly city .
so , you 're getting the pattern . first 200 children at Ri@@ ver@@ side .
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .
children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems .
child : our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
K@@ BS : first time , a rally and a street play in a rural school -- un@@ heard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important .
K@@ BS : girls and boys in Hy@@ der@@ abad , going out , pretty difficult , but they did it .
woman : even though they are so young , they have done such good work .
girl : thank you , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
for our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids .
are you ready , ladies and gent@@ lemen ? audience : yes !
girl : are you ready ? audience : yes !
I mean , they were changing lives .
it was incredible .
70 years ago , it took one man to infec@@ t an entire nation with the power of " We can . "
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India ?
so , if not us , then who ?
like I said , contag@@ ious is a good word .
the new software they used ? Google Map@@ Mak@@ er .
I am going to be talking about secrets .
( la@@ ughter ) Yes . I 'm sure ! just change it !
now , as humans , we make maps of places that we seldom even go , which seems a little wa@@ st@@ eful of time .
this , of course , is a map of the moon .
there 're some very del@@ ight@@ ful names .
this is from their actual book .
( la@@ ughter ) I mean kids are studying this stuff and they 've got the word " fl@@ uc@@ tus " up there . that 's wrong .
( la@@ ughter ) One dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ic k@@ id and he could be ru@@ ining his life .
would you mind taking the insects ? thank you dar@@ ling .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , we 're going to be going to Mars one day . and when we do , it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridic@@ ulous names .
so , you 'll be on Mars , and you 're at Hell@@ es@@ poin@@ tica De@@ pres@@ si@@ o which has got to be a really " up " place .
I go to Ch@@ ryso@@ ker@@ as .
( la@@ ughter ) Left to the Th@@ y@@ mi@@ am@@ ata .
that 's a cool name . I will say that .
this is from their rule book , the International Astr@@ onom@@ ical Union .
and you know they 're international because they put it " en Fran@@ ca@@ is " as well .
from the rul@@ ebook : no@@ menclature is a tool .
" now , Frank is this clear to you , Dj@@ ab@@ ran Fl@@ uc@@ tus ? "
" ye@@ ah , that 's the go@@ at go@@ dd@@ ess right ? the Ab@@ ac@@ az@@ anian ?
something is as@@ ke@@ w here .
( la@@ ughter ) Which a lot of you are like , " How did he figure that out ? "
he 's got no body , no man , just a head floating high .
what a coincidence !
( la@@ ughter ) that 's not a good picture .
I mean these guys are extrapol@@ ating in real@@ ms that are not necessarily valid .
( la@@ ughter ) Ren@@ é Des@@ car@@ tes , of course . once again these Grenada people , this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination .
there is the Orange System .
I go to J@@ PL .
I look at the orb@@ its of the planets .
He@@ y , you can 't make this up .
my middle child , O@@ liver , was born with a rare form of mus@@ cular dy@@ stro@@ phy , or MD .
but everyday tasks for O@@ liver that we all take for granted were incredibly challenging .
but when O@@ liver was in third grade , I found out he was more like me than I ever imagined .
he came home from school one day and said very defini@@ tively that he was going to wear je@@ ans to school like everybody else gets to wear .
he went into school with his head held so high .
adaptive clothing is defined as clothing designed for people with disabilities , the elderly and anyone who struggles with dressing themselves .
and that 's a huge problem , because what you wear matters .
the mission was to educate the fashion industry that modifications could be made to mainstream clothing for this community that has never been served .
he was going to Harvard University .
I got myself into Harvard , but my dream is to be able to wear je@@ ans on campus , like the other fresh@@ men will wear . "
you see , Eric is a really big guy , and it took two a@@ ides and a lifting machine to get him dressed .
the first were closures .
so we 're talking about good witnessing , but what happens if the perpetrators are fil@@ ming ?
this is the story of Chris@@ sy .
if everybody on the planet lived the way we did , we 'd need between five , six , seven , some people even say 10 planets to make it .
clearly we don 't have 10 planets .
and people simply do not have enough to survive .
I don 't need to go into that .
and given that I have 13 minutes to do this , this is going to go kind of quick .
so , first of all , what are we looking for ? bright Green city .
one of the biggest le@@ vers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities .
here , for example , is Vancouver , which if you haven 't been there , you ought to go for a visit . it 's a fab@@ ulous city .
you can also start to change what you build .
so one great example is car @@@ -@@ @ share clubs , which are really starting to take off in the U.S. , have already taken off in many places in Europe , and are a great example .
we 're starting to cover this more and more .
it 's every seven days .
so , we 're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days , and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in .
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
so I rather like this picture here .
the second thing is tools for collaboration , be they systems of collaboration , or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration . right ?
and those quarter @@@ -@@ @ million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Pa@@ olo .
you have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out .
some of those designs include models for acting , such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps .
his core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees .
and when I was research@@ ing pe@@ arl di@@ vers , I found the world of free @@@ -@@ @ diving .
two days before my big breath @@@ -@@ @ hold attempt , for the record , the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath , and almost dro@@ w@@ ning , is too b@@ oring for television .
and there was no way to slow my heart rate down .
so , I started to really get really par@@ ano@@ id .
and I think magic , whether I 'm holding my breath or shu@@ ff@@ ling a deck of cards , is pretty simple .
the central moti@@ f of B@@ har@@ ti 's practice is the ready @@@ -@@ @ made store @@@ -@@ @ bought B@@ ind@@ i that un@@ told millions of Indian women apply to their fore@@ heads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
and she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well .
while , at the same time , the actual number of trans@@ plants has remained almost entirely flat .
and on the right you actually see a car@@ oti@@ d ar@@ tery that was engineered .
they are not nearly as complex as hol@@ low organs .
for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes , small , medium , large and extra @@@ -@@ @ large .
and the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy .
this is actually a simple solid organ like the ear .
that 's the oven @@@ -@@ @ like device ; once it 's coated it gets placed there .
this is actually digits that we 're engineering .
and you can see the v@@ ascular tree that remains intact .
if at all possible , we really would like to use smart biom@@ ater@@ ials that we can just take off the shelf and regener@@ ate your organs .
and we 're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago , stem cells from the am@@ ni@@ otic fluid , and the plac@@ ent@@ a , which have those properties .
so , we have patients now walking around with organs , engineered organs , for over 10 years , as well .
and that is really very simple , to make our patients better .
can geographic information make you healthy ?
" why now ? " " why here ? "
just think about that , you know , w@@ ander through your life thinking about this .
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
OK , so I ended up in Lou@@ is@@ ville , Kentucky .
did you know that data existed ?
so , our cell phones can now build a place history .
I 'd suggest that that 's a bad idea Bill , because of this report . "
these programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I 've shared here with you today .
so with that , I 'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
and I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . thank you .
so I thought that it will be good to start with it .
but that 's totally another and separate topic .
we had the ability to understand what was going on .
we were actually recording history .
he was running a media systems organization which is still in business , the gent@@ l@@ eman is still in business .
and what did I know at that time about media systems ?
to make a long story short , the gent@@ l@@ eman comes into the office , great suit and tie .
I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be .
so I thought that that 's actually my problem .
and what these guys need , actually , is access to capital .
you see , at the level of a concept , it was a great concept .
and I want to offer you a deal .
Boris Nikol@@ a@@ ye@@ vich says , " It 's not for sale . "
the governor says , " We will close you . "
Boris Nikol@@ a@@ ye@@ vich says , " No , you CA@@ N@@ NOT do it . "
the second angle , like in this cli@@ p .
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries .
that is not too much , is it ?
we 've decided to do it this fall ; we will issue them , probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars .
now take it to the last step .
this is a construction hel@@ met that I received two years ago at the ground@@ breaking of the largest project I , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
I stayed thr@@ illed until I got home , threw the hel@@ met onto my bed , fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription .
and we were going to do something that was horri@@ ble for the profession .
now , I 'm going to present it on the same terms : issue , position and architectural manifestation .
and that 's that the company and the building was multi@@ form .
I 'll go through the three basic configurations .
meaning , nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it .
and the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a sco@@ re@@ board lift .
here you see the chairs being s@@ pu@@ n around to go from pro@@ scen@@ ium or end stage to thrust configuration .
and again , this is not all the flexi@@ bilities of the building that is actually built , but at least suggests the ideas .
to be strong means not to be a girl .
there is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tat@@ to@@ o@@ ed on the right side of her face .
so , for years A@@ gn@@ es walked through the R@@ ift valley .
and she knew that meant she would be cut .
she knew that meant she w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't go to school .
she knew that meant she w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have a future .
she went to school and she found her voice , and she found her identity , and she found her heart .
then , her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation , after a year .
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down c@@ rying .
and I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here .
and it happened because I met a girl in Wat@@ ts , L.@@ A.
things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard @@@ -@@ @ pressed ideas .
they pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears .
these feelings make me better .
this is not extreme . it 's a girl thing , what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open .
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
he looks like he 's resting peacefully , but in fact he 's struggling to stay alive because he can 't regulate his own body temperature .
that is the primary function of an incub@@ ator .
what you see here looks nothing like an incub@@ ator .
it 's a wa@@ x @@@ -@@ @ like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees Cel@@ sius .
and we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Em@@ br@@ ace .
he leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
and they say , " Well , streets don 't have names .
as a researcher , every once in a while you encounter something a little dis@@ concer@@ ting .
so , I hope I can really accomplish that .
so , this incident that I 'm going to describe really began with some diar@@ rhe@@ a .
that 's why there 's a glass of water up there .
I 'll start with insul@@ in , diabetes medication in the U.S.
you get it , either in pill form or you get it as an injection ; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels .
it 's not just medicine .
well , look at some old ways , some ways that we 'd already crac@@ ked .
some people are doing that , many are not . what 's going on ?
this machine is really strange , and one of the consequences is that people are we@@ ir@@ d .
it just do@@ es@@ n 't happen to be right about the world .
a bat and a ball together cost $ 1.10 .
ye@@ ah . so , together they would cost $ 1.@@ 20 .
how is that possible ? let 's go to something else .
I know alge@@ bra can be complicated .
there 's a great show on American television that you have to watch .
it 's called " Are You S@@ mar@@ ter Th@@ an a Fifth Gra@@ der ? "
but the truth of the matter is , you look at that car , it do@@ es@@ n 't look like a Vol@@ vo , and it do@@ es@@ n 't look like a Hum@@ mer .
the second task is fuel efficiency . ok@@ ay ?
I 'm going to take off some of that weight , and I 'm going to buy a Hum@@ mer that 's 11 miles per gall@@ on . "
here was B@@ MW 's brilliant insight , which they embodied into an ad campaign .
B@@ W@@ M real@@ izes safety , in people 's minds , has two components .
this is a typical insul@@ in injection .
anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence , just as a result of this .
now , I think that we 're on the ver@@ ge of something big .
is what we are here to do in medicine , is what everyone should do .
here they are . it 's an open network , everybody is sharing . we can see it all .
how they treat it , the drugs , the components of it , their side effects , all of it in a rich environment , and you can drill down and see the individuals .
you can adjust the time scale . you can adjust the symptoms .
I want to solve a problem . I want an application .
so , the patients print it out , because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network .
but the short story is : if you 're a patient , you want to be on the blue line .
and then we say , " Well how do we line them all up ? "
and it works almost every time .
so , remember I told you about my brother 's stem cell trans@@ plant .
and her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores , because he knew how much she cared .
in a moment , I 'm going to ask if you would close your eyes and see if you can work out what emotions you 're feeling right now .
now , you 're not going to tell anyone or anything .
how did it go ?
perhaps you felt some strange , distant worry about that email you sent this morning or excitement about something you 've got planned for this evening .
or that in that same period , brave men -- k@@ nights -- commonly f@@ ain@@ ted out of dis@@ may ?
it begins in a g@@ arre@@ t in the late 17th century , in the Swiss university town of Basel .
was it the invention of telephones or the expansion of the railways ?
happiness is supposed to make us better workers and parents and partners ; it 's supposed to make us live longer .
I think we could learn from this today .
the B@@ aining people of Papua New Guinea speak of " aw@@ um@@ bu@@ k , " a feeling of le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that des@@ cen@@ ds when a house@@ guest finally leaves .
and sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside .
clearly , the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee has a little bit harder time of walking .
good .
SS : so Kan@@ zi is very interested in fire .
he 's learning the uses for a fire , just by watching what we do with fire .
this is his sister .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
( la@@ ughter ) Li@@ ke us , she knows that that individual in the mirror is her .
his name is Ny@@ ota .
in the wild , the parent Bon@@ ob@@ o is known to gro@@ om its off@@ spring .
subtle maneu@@ vering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this .
he can now cut through tough animal hide .
the tough hide is difficult to cut , even with a knife .
the flat sharp edges are like knife blades .
video : then Pan@@ ban@@ isha does something unexpected .
what is she writing ?
" a frame " represents a hu@@ t in the woods .
the Bon@@ ob@@ o 's abilities have stun@@ ned scientists around the world .
she was@@ n 't forced to learn the piano ; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest .
now watch out , stay away from them now .
we 're learning that they probably have a language in the wild .
I don 't know what kind of health care is delivered there .
put it on your shirt , it ruins the shirt .
so in this device , the idea is that you dri@@ p the bottom end of it in a drop of , in this case , urine .
and then finally , a point you don 't think of so much in developed world medicine : it eliminates shar@@ ps .
and there are two bars ; one bar indicates that the test is working , and if the second bar shows up , you 're pregnant .
the printers cost 800 buc@@ ks now .
and so I regard that as done .
and the thing you 'd most like to analyze , we 're a fair distance from .
it 's what 's called " fever of un@@ diagnosed origin . "
what do they have ?
there are an aw@@ ful lot of things that you 'd like to distinguish among .
what do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis ?
and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting , which is , the yellow seems to disappear , get through the blue , and then get through the red .
it distribu@@ tes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color , all done with paper and carpet tape .
now , I have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business .
it works really , really well .
I know what it is , but I don 't actually know what it means .
so I actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people .
it 's not in the abstract ; it 's the interaction with the environment .
the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .
people got upset , but this is the only way we 're going to go forward .
you know , I was very fortunate to meet D@@ anny H@@ ill@@ is a few years ago .
I said , " Do I really want to meet a guy from Dis@@ ney , who designed computers ? "
and it came back at 9@@ 8.7 , I would say , " Great . "
you know , I 've been using it for two and a half months .
most of that state is hidden .
so , about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get .
and the answer , obviously , is not .
and , again , that 's where these new technologies can come in .
and I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work .
Tom Shan@@ non : ye@@ ah , the subject matter that I 'm looking for , it 's usually to solve a question .
and in proportion , what would the size of the sphere and the length , and what would the tap@@ er be to the Earth ?
J@@ H : I agree .
but then I started dre@@ aming of having six colors .
I sort of think about it as the DNA -- these colors , the red , blue , yellow , the primary colors and white and black .
TS : I 'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody 's shoes in the front .
and so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much , much simpler way .
you think of yourself as the servant .
because there is this asym@@ metry , which creates , basically , failing governance .
at that time , I noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do .
it was even tax @@@ -@@ @ deduc@@ tible .
they needed help , and the large companies themselves have this dilemma .
in the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years .
and President von We@@ iz@@ s@@ ä@@ c@@ ker , by the way , chaired one of the sessions , the first one , to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs , who were not used to deal with non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organizations .
in fact , [ unclear ] still says this today .
and that 's why the law has changed .
and , again , civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment .
this case , they are not prosecuting in the UK .
why ? because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies .
the World Bank has turned from Sa@@ ul@@ us to Paul@@ us ; under Wolf@@ en@@ so@@ hn , they became , I would say , the strongest anti @@@ -@@ @ corruption agency in the world .
thank you .
I 'm 34 years old .
I 'm not a doctor ; I 'm a ch@@ ef , I don 't have expensive equipment or medicine .
this is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world .
can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today ?
you can continue to put your hands up , a@@ un@@ ties and un@@ cles as well .
look at homicide at the bottom , for God 's sake .
Mexico , Australia , Germany , India , China , all have massive problems of obesity and bad health .
obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health @@@ -@@ @ care bills , 150 billion dollars a year .
in 10 years , it 's set to double : 300 billion dollars a year .
we 've got a new one this year , but we 'll work on that next season .
but you know what ?
come winter , three times as many people die .
I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now ; the Ed@@ wards family .
the system is highly run by accountants ; there 's not enough , or any , food @@@ -@@ @ knowledgeable people in the business .
now , the reality is , the food that your kids get every day is fast food , it 's highly processed , there 's not enough fresh food in there at all .
k@@ ni@@ ves and for@@ ks ? no , they 're too dangerous .
( video ) Who knows what this is ?
J@@ o : no . what do you think this is ?
this , all this bad news , is preventable .
that 's the good news .
it 's very , very preventable .
now , look , if we do all this stuff , and we can , it 's so achievable .
if you click on this , you 'll see some of the ones that we 've put out , just in the past couple of months since we 've launched .
and the answer is , until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
it 's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don 't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
so here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
now , we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level .
who 's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
also , these are intermit@@ tent sources .
the sun do@@ es@@ n 't shine all day , it do@@ es@@ n 't shine every day , and likewise , the wind do@@ es@@ n 't blow all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it 's not available .
is it a Manhattan Project ? what 's the thing that can get us there ?
so instead of worrying about them , you just take that , it 's a great thing .
you see it 's a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether .
there 's a lot that has to come together .
you 'd be stun@@ ned at the ridic@@ ulously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
this is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
the tough thing is building the pilot reactor -- finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
B@@ G : that 's right .
and we start out , actually , by taking the waste that exists today that 's sitting in these cooling pools or dry @@@ -@@ @ cas@@ king by reactors -- that 's our fuel to begin with .
ca : so , in your mind , tim@@ esc@@ ale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
B@@ G : well , we need -- for one of these high @@@ -@@ @ scale , electr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ generation things that 's very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to deploy .
it shou@@ ld@@ n 't take away from other things .
and so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate .
the R & amp ; D piece -- it 's crazy how little it 's funded .
ca : well , Bill , I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true .
and if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today , I think you can completely , as I 've said , re@@ make politics , re@@ make government , re@@ make your public services .
local power , central power , now , people power .
now , here is King C@@ nut , king a thousand years ago .
suddenly , all sorts of transport , travel information were possible , and this gave birth to , what I like to call , the bureaucratic age .
it was able to do that itself .
and this is so obvious , in a way , because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop , the way we travel , the way that business is done .
so , how could this happen ?
anyone thinking , " I could do that service better , I could deliver it cheaper , " it 's all available there .
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , se@@ archa@@ ble for anyone to see .
and you can see this looks a bit like a ch@@ ef 's hat , but actually that 's an assault , the one in blue .
it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages , the intelligence of our public debate .
thank you .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
and Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
it 's part of our life .
and , certainly , I 'm not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person 's struggle .
and , perhaps , until we 're tested , we don 't know what we 're made of .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bus@@ hel of tomatoes .
see , Dr. K@@ ean made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there 's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
they were simply told , " These are the ' A @@@ -@@ @ students , ' these are the ' D @@@ -@@ @ students . ' " and that 's how they went about teaching them and treating them .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
so , man@@ tis shri@@ mp come in two varieties : there are spe@@ arers and Sm@@ ash@@ ers .
and you can see it 's just a really spectacular extension of the lim@@ bs , explo@@ ding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shri@@ mp that I had offered it .
now , the other type of man@@ tis shri@@ mp is the sm@@ as@@ her stom@@ at@@ op@@ od , and these guys open up sn@@ ails for a living .
( la@@ ughter ) So , I 'll play it one more time .
so , the sm@@ as@@ her rap@@ torial ap@@ pend@@ age can sta@@ b with a point at the end , or it can sm@@ ash with the he@@ el .
and I immediately came upon a problem .
and what he showed in man@@ tis shri@@ mp is that they use what 's called a " catch mechanism , " or " click mechanism . "
and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract , and a latch that prevents anything from moving .
( la@@ ughter ) So , this -- what I saw , on every single man@@ tis shri@@ mp lim@@ b , whether it 's a spe@@ arer or a sm@@ as@@ her , is a beautiful sadd@@ le @@@ -@@ @ shaped structure right on the top surface of the lim@@ b . and you can see it right here .
it just looks like a sadd@@ le you 'd put on a horse .
so it 's very well known to engineers , not as well known to bi@@ ologists .
but that was not the end of the story .
people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat prop@@ eller that do@@ es@@ n 't cav@@ itate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it , just like these pictures show .
it goes back .
stars are basically nuclear f@@ ission machines that self @@@ -@@ @ organize and self @@@ -@@ @ sustain themselves for billions of years : order against the Ex@@ trop@@ y of the world .
and so what I 've done is , I 've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say , " What are the general trends in evolutionary life ? "
there 's really no dispute about progress , if we discount the cost of that .
but a better way is what I call the pro@@ action@@ ary principle , which is , you engage with technology .
and actually , in a certain sense , technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas , if you can think about it that way .
but that 's a really good idea ; that 's a good job for technology .
thank you .
the principal did@@ n 't want to stand up to the parent because he did@@ n 't want to get dra@@ gged into some legal proceedings .
so , she had to go to meeting after meeting , same arguments made over and over again .
but he was told he cou@@ ld@@ n 't go on the hi@@ ke this year because one of the students in the class was disabled , so the other 25 students did@@ n 't get to go on the hi@@ ke either .
but reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year .
there is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains . "
that 's the only explanation . because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot ?
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
those di@@ kes have burst . people w@@ ade through law all day long .
because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else 's freedom .
worked pretty well for 200 years .
if they can 't intern@@ alize it , they won 't trust it .
it do@@ es@@ n 't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want .
law is a human institution ; responsibility is a human institution .
what the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .
what has changed our society has been wireless devices .
this is already available today .
and then as we go further , today we have continuous gl@@ uc@@ ose sensors .
how about counting every cal@@ ori@@ e ?
ok@@ ay , well this was a week of my life in sleeping , and you get a Z@@ .@@ Q. score . instead of an I.@@ Q. score , you get a Z@@ .@@ Q. score when you wake up .
and this one is now 67 , and that 's not a good score .
when does a ner@@ d turn into As@@ per@@ ger , which is just mild au@@ tism ?
you have to get away from verbal language .
then when I did my book , " Th@@ inking in Pictures , " I started inter@@ viewing people about how they think .
now , I had this brain scan done several years ago , and I used to jo@@ ke around about having a gig@@ antic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cor@@ te@@ x .
and then there 's a verbal mind , they know every fact about everything .
they 'll be absolutely fine with the veter@@ in@@ arian and with the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ er , but you can 't ride him .
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
is it a minor problem , with something simple I can fix ?
ye@@ ah , I 'm a million @@@ -@@ @ mile f@@ lier .
I was a go@@ of@@ ball student when I was in high school .
because I 'm seeing a lot of these ge@@ e@@ ky , ner@@ dy kids , and the teachers out in the Mid@@ west and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas , they don 't know what to do with these kids .
and they 're not going down the right path .
the thing is , you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind , or your mind can be wired to be more social .
we 've got to show these kids interesting stuff .
but you know what ? I was getting work experience .
how to have table man@@ ners at gran@@ ny 's Sunday party .
let 's say the k@@ id is fix@@ ated on Leg@@ os .
the thing about the au@@ ti@@ stic mind is it tends to be fix@@ ated .
the pattern thin@@ kers -- they 're the ones that are going to be your mathemati@@ cians , your software engineers , your computer programmers , all of those kinds of jobs .
and this brings up ment@@ ors .
and you get him turned on , then you 'll learn all the new stuff .
and we 've got to ment@@ or them , hire them .
well , that 's the end of my talk .
and I just want to thank everybody for coming .
it was great to be here .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) Oh -- you have a question for me ? OK .
T@@ G : well , first of all , we 've got to look at age .
ca : w@@ ow . so most people , if you ask them what they 're most passionate about , they 'd say things like , " My kids " or " My lover . "
you know , the slaughter plants I worked with in the ' 8@@ 0s ; they were absolutely aw@@ ful .
you directly observe a few simple things .
it 's worked really well .
thank you so much .
that 's an extreme of micro@@ p@@ thal@@ mos called en@@ oph@@ thal@@ mos .
doctor : what are their shapes ?

the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin par@@ sing the world is dynamic information .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k@@ fully , there is@@ n 't any audio to go with this .
because , if that hypothesis were to be true , it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what 's causing the many different aspects of the au@@ tism phen@@ o@@ type .
that 's my mother . I love her to bits .
the rest of my family are b@@ oring academics , busy collecting I@@ vy League dec@@ als for our classic Ambassador car .
I hop@@ ped into his car , and off we went through the remaining layers of security .
I sat him down , I car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured him , and since then I 've car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured hundreds of celebrities .
I don 't think I 've succeeded , but they 've taught me .

I moved back to New York , my work has changed .
I work with children all over the world , and that 's an entirely different talk , but I want to leave you with one story that really , really inspired me .
they , in fact , told me three weeks .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it 's between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
it 's the finite resource that we 're spending while we 're on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the rememb@@ ering self keeps for us .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two @@@ -@@ @ week vacation is twice as good as the one @@@ -@@ @ week vacation .
I have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large extent , in the service of our rememb@@ ering self .
I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
and the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
you have that much uncertainty .
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other plea@@ sures , but this is dominant .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
OK . we can violate your expectations about shape .
do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? it 's completely static .
it 's a static image . how many people see this illusion ? it 's completely static .
pi@@ an@@ ist trans@@ forms to viol@@ in@@ ist .
so , what I 'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India 's -- maybe the world 's -- longest running soap opera , which is c@@ ric@@ ket .
but it was@@ n 't always like that .
( la@@ ughter ) The Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata was like that as well , was@@ n 't it ?
you don 't always have five days . so , we moved on , and we started playing 50 @@@ -@@ @ over c@@ ric@@ ket .
but there was another big date .
the scri@@ pted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was c@@ ric@@ ket .
and so c@@ ric@@ ket started becoming big ; c@@ ric@@ ket started bringing riches in .
they were not bureauc@@ rats who were forced into sport because they did@@ n 't actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
this was the new India , was@@ n 't it ? this was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
and they said , " Fine , you play to date X , minus one . "
but what this also did was it started mar@@ rying the two most important things in Indian c@@ ric@@ ket , which is c@@ ric@@ ket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
they started going to the c@@ ric@@ ket to watch Sha@@ h Ru@@ kh Khan .
and so it started resem@@ bling the Indian movies more and more .
( appl@@ ause ) There was criticism too because they said , " Pla@@ yers are being bought and sold ?
could you have imagined that day would come ?
but we did it . you know why ?
there 's no fil@@ th , there 's no beg@@ g@@ ars , all the sna@@ ke char@@ mers have van@@ ished , everybody 's gone . this tells you how the capitalist world rules .
hopefully , it 'll make everyone richer , hopefully it 'll make the game bigger and hopefully it 'll give c@@ ric@@ ket commentators more time in the business .
thank you very much . thank you .
with Pi@@ vo@@ t , you can drill into a decade .
and I see Gre@@ g Le@@ M@@ ond now .
so the summary consists of just a little syn@@ op@@ sis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
we talk about the curse of information over@@ load .
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wisdom to be found .
so with that , I thank you .
you know , I was a real science ge@@ ek .
I still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what I see when I make these dives .
and with " The Ab@@ y@@ ss , " I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with fil@@ m@@ making .
working with IL@@ M , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hun@@ g in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and the envelope pushed back , and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we we@@ ren 't going to be able to do this for a while .
so , I shel@@ ved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .
secret@@ ly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real wrec@@ k of " Tit@@ anic . "
we 'll be using it in the opening of the film .
and I 'm flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
I felt like I was physically present inside the ship@@ wrec@@ k of Tit@@ anic .
and so , you 're seeing animals that are living next to a 500 @@@ -@@ @ degree @@@ -@@ @ C@@ enti@@ grade water plum@@ es .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , " What am I doing out here ?
and it really changed the dynamic .
and it completely changed how I do movies .
so , what can we synthe@@ size out of all this ?
well , I think number one is curi@@ osity .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
I have young fil@@ m@@ makers come up to me and say , " Give me some advice for doing this . "
( music ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I 'm J@@ on M. Ch@@ u . and I 'm not a dan@@ cer , I 'm not a chore@@ ograph@@ er -- I 'm actually a fil@@ m@@ maker , a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er .
and dance has progressed .
( music ) ( Appl@@ ause ) J Smo@@ oth : when I 'm in the zone -- I 'm dancing and free sty@@ ling it -- I actually visually kind of picture lines , and moving them .
and if your life is@@ n 't like that , I 'd like to hum@@ bly suggest that you 're w@@ asting your life .
what do you have to get in order to be happy ?
let me repeat that : there is nothing that you have to get , do or be in order to be happy .
now , all of you are very pol@@ ite , and in some of the other forums I speak in , such as top business schools , they 're not so pol@@ ite .
and the only thing that 's different between you now and where you were 10 years ago is what is the particular " if " that you were focusing on ?
the outcome is completely out of your control .
like there was a friend of mine who said , " Ge@@ e , you know , I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife , and this has to change . "
and if you did the best that you were capable of , the score do@@ es@@ n 't matter .
the question that I get all the time , is people say , " Professor Ra@@ o , but nothing makes me passionate . "
but second , even if it did and you were plug@@ ged into it , it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry , mis@@ erable self there as you are now , because passion exists inside you .
and if you start doing that , you will find that your life changes .
that 's the power of taking one piece of data , another piece of data , putting it together , and showing the result .
it allows anybody to go there and bur@@ row down .
let 's now spin the world during the same year .
every flash is an edit . somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map , and realizing it could be better .
I only have three minutes so I 'm going to have to talk fast , and it will use up your spare mental cycles , so multi@@ t@@ asking may be hard .
so , un@@ sign@@ alized inter@@ sections , meaning stop signs , they save many lives , but there 's an excessive proliferation of them .
but they are not applicable in all situations .
that 's five cents each , and times 3,000 cars per day , that 's $ 5@@ 1,000 per year .
that 's just the gasoline cost . there is also pollution , wear on the car , and time .
but one time it broke down .
so I had another un@@ productive day .
and all those phones were in the few urban places .
and after all , poor countries , like rich countries , one thing we 've got equal , is their days are the same length : 24 hours .
that you see , the horizontal axis is where you place your country .
but if you come back to a poorer country , where the GNP per capita is , let 's say , 500 dollars , or 300 dollars , then the impact is huge : 6,000 dollars . or 5,000 dollars .
but how would you speci@@ alize ?
let 's say I 'm a fisher@@ man and a farmer .
and if we are neighbors , I could just walk over to his house .
the car pays for itself .
see , you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .
so for example , we did@@ n 't have ways to have credit checks , few banks to collect bills , etc .
and they had these branches .
and it 's a business for her .
and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day , which is like 700 dollars per year .
and 2004 , the net profit , after taxes -- very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars .
most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .
" poor countries need aid . "
businesses -- this one company has raised the -- if the ideal figures are even five percent true , this one company is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives .
and as I was trying to show you , as far as I 'm concerned , aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens .
what a fish .
( la@@ ughter ) E@@ ven better , it was farm @@@ -@@ @ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us ch@@ efs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
it do@@ es@@ n 't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
the day before the event , I called the head of P.@@ R. for the company .
" that 's right , " he said . " we 're so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . "
2.5 to one , great .
" great , " I said . got off the phone .
( la@@ ughter ) So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head bi@@ ologist .
he said , " Y@@ ea@@ h , fea@@ thers , skin , bone meal , sc@@ ra@@ ps , dried and processed into feed . "
it 's the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
let 's call him Miguel -- actually his name is Miguel .
( la@@ ughter ) And no , he did@@ n 't cook the fish , and he 's not a ch@@ ef , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
you st@@ are out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are floo@@ ded can@@ als and this thick , rich marsh@@ land .
now , he 's mentioning the mineral needs of phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton .
and then he 's off , launching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aquatic plants .
" I know , du@@ de , the algae , the phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : it 's amazing .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
" that 's success , " he said .
the flam@@ ing@@ os eat the shri@@ mp .
Oh , and by the way , those flam@@ ing@@ os , they shou@@ ld@@ n 't even be there in the first place .
( la@@ ughter ) He said , " No ; they do it because the food 's better . "
it 's that ac@@ rid , tar @@@ -@@ @ like flavor .
he said , " The skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
it 's the last defense before anything enters the body .
and then he added , " But our water has no impu@@ rities . "
OK . a farm that do@@ es@@ n 't feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
because when that water leaves , it dum@@ ps out into the Atlantic .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
now , I don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
that 's been the motivation , it 's been the justification : it 's been the business plan of American agriculture .
our bread@@ basket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources .
want to feed the world ?
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
it 's high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it 's never produced anything really good to eat .
farms that are@@ n 't worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deple@@ te ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
and if I 'm going to be really honest , they 're a better ch@@ ef than I 'll ever be .
thank you .
OK . we 've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .
and when it occurred , I was the only doctor on the mountain .
it was on my fourth trip to E@@ ve@@ rest that a com@@ et passed over the mountain . Hy@@ ak@@ u@@ take .
and the Sher@@ p@@ as told us then that was a very bad omen , and we should have listened to them .
Cam@@ p@@ Three is at the base of L@@ hot@@ se , which is the fourth highest mountain in the world , but it 's d@@ war@@ fed by E@@ ve@@ rest .
and then Camp Four is the highest camp ; that 's 3,000 feet short of the summit .
these are some clim@@ bers reaching the top of the ic@@ ef@@ all just at sun @@@ -@@ @ up .
a fall here , if you we@@ ren 't ro@@ ped in , would be 5,000 feet down .
this is a picture of Ro@@ b Hall .
it 's the first part of climb .
this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before , and you can see I 've got an oxygen mask on with a re@@ brea@@ ther .
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay , fully dressed , fully equipped , laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain .
we were in radio contact with some of them .
he was exhausted , and Ro@@ b was staying with him .
he called in to say that he was alone now .
ro@@ b then signed off , and that was the last we ever heard of him .
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24@@ ,000 feet , which was an im@@ possibility .
( la@@ ughter ) He really said that .
you can see his hand is completely white ; his face , his nose , is burned .
first , it turns white , and then when it 's completed nec@@ ro@@ sis , it turns black , and then it falls off .
and then he said to himself , " I don 't want to die .
he 's collapsed in the snow here . everything is quiet , there 's very little red anywhere .
he was critically ill , there were other critically ill patients ; luc@@ k@@ ily , we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys .
he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible will@@ power , he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself .
these are Tibetan prayer flags .
and I 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that 's been in every children 's magic book since at least the 1950s .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tr@@ ick@@ ery . and you can examine everything .
the reason I 'm holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that 's actually the secret of the illusion .
that 's my skin right there . this is not a Hollywood special effect .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pi@@ erce .
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
( la@@ ughter ) Yes , there it is .
I 'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma .
bacterial spo@@ res are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive , but in suspended animation for as long as 250 million years .
this is Sea @@@ -@@ @ Mon@@ keys .
well , I was@@ n 't so interested in the swimming .
I was interested in what was going on in the bag , the bag on the to@@ y store shelf where those shri@@ mp sat in suspended animation indefinitely .
so these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and we@@ ir@@ d , little organisms .
ten years ago , there was a sk@@ ier in Norway that was trapped in an ic@@ y water@@ fall , and she was there for two hours before they extracted her .
I thought it might be interesting to sort of hun@@ t for such things .
yet , it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
I 'd like to buy some concentrated , compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas , see , about wanting to suspend people .
so that 's kind of a tough day , but I said , " There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this . "
and here 's the really important point .
we hope not , or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common .
thank you very much .
and if you think about the phone , right , it 's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time .
we 're testing these kinds of simple sensor @@@ -@@ @ network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .
but those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet .
and it 's the whole field that we 've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel .
Y@@ 2@@ K + 10 was coming , the baby bo@@ omers starting to retire .
this is a map of the entire world .
I was like , " Ac@@ tually it was your idea . you said it in a For@@ tune Magazine article .
the first word that comes up is " doctor . "
our entire health reform discussion right now , health I.@@ T. , when we talk with policy makers , equals " How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the main@@ frame ? "
and now we want to do a double @@@ -@@ @ double of the age wave coming through ?
so , we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of post@@ ural s@@ way , and look at the changes in your post@@ ural s@@ way over many months .
here 's why .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ ances here : the cr@@ ink@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
OK , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
this is actually me making it .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it 's over .
we did a game called Super@@ struc@@ t at the Institute for the Future .
you know Jer@@ ry Br@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movies , you form a dream team -- you 've got the astr@@ on@@ aut , the scientist , the ex @@@ -@@ @ convic@@ t , and they all have something to do to save the world .
we 've got a graphic novel , we 've got level@@ ing up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ fulness .
so , I 'm going to wrap up now .
what do you think happens next ?
J@@ a : the ram@@ ps are made of simple material -- the kind of pl@@ y@@ wood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point .
in the face of America 's worst destruction people are building again .
K@@ a : on the H@@ ud@@ son River ?
and there was no mediation between us and the experience .
there was no filter .
there was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site .
so we came up with a foundation , and actually what happened was one major developer in New York -- KA : who shall remain nam@@ eless , I guess ?
where it overl@@ aps with thoughts about our work in general is , number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done .
so that , very much , is in the realm of things I 've been interested in before .
I don 't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces , regardless of what the number is .
Dr : we 're looking from Ful@@ ton Street , west .
this is crystall@@ ized DNA .
and that mu@@ tation was passed on to their kids because they 're the ones that survived , so there was a great deal of population pressure .
so , it 's about the size of a little period on a sentence .
your fear should be that you are not , that you 're paying attention to stuff which is temporal .
and when we learn how to close the gene gaps , then we can put a full string of DNA together .
that means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code .
not so in human beings : you cut off an arm , you cut off a leg -- it do@@ es@@ n 't reg@@ row .
it won 't do anything for you .
the greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing , and it turns out that this is not so important any more .
this is what 's been powering the U.S. economy . it 's Mo@@ ore 's Law .
this is on a log scale , and that 's what su@@ pere@@ x@@ pon@@ ential growth means .
this is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School .
( la@@ ughter ) So , you want to know where life is happening ?
and that 's the triangle between Sal@@ k , Scrip@@ ps , U@@ CSD , and it 's called Tor@@ rey P@@ ines Road .
in a knowledge society , that number is now 427 to 1 .
and very soon it 's going to matter if you 're literate in life code .
so , if there is something you should fear , it 's that you 're not keeping your eye on the ball .
and it turns out that if you went back to the 18@@ 7@@ 0s , the most productive nation on earth was Australia , per person .
it 's got nothing to do with inflation .
it turns out there 's now about 192 .
but thank you very much .
so we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer , and they came to me and said , " She@@ k@@ har , what do you think ? "
the other said , " How much did we hire him for ? "
and the third said , " Let 's find another director . "
so I re@@ thought the whole thing , and then we all came to a consensus .
I 'm doing it right now ; you can watch me . I 'm getting nervous , I don 't know what to say , I don 't know what I 'm doing , I don 't want to go there .
and as I go there , of course , my A.@@ D. says , " You know what you 're going to do , si@@ r . " I say , " Of course I do . "
I 'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos , I 'm hoping some moments of truth will come .
when I was a k@@ id -- I was about eight years old .
my father was a doctor .
so , how far does eternity go ?
and I would lie there c@@ rying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity .
a story is our -- all of us -- we are the stories we tell ourselves .
so that 's as wide as we look at stories .
we all , everybody , has a story that they follow .
and I said , " Why ? " he said , " Because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about sub@@ text .
of course , all the British press got really upset .
I said " It 's about my@@ th@@ ology , the gods . "
and she 's recognizing the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality .
B@@ ess ?
are you with child ?
you go to your tra@@ itor brother and leave me to my business .
these offenses are punishable by law . arrest him .
B@@ ess : as you wish , Majesty .
what am I doing with the architecture ?
they started to build fl@@ y@@ overs to get from A to B faster , but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth .
so the design has a story .
remember the word I said , suc@@ k up .
but ultimately , what is a story ? it 's a contradiction .
that first bl@@ ush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other .
in a poet 's mind , it 's a conflict of words , in the universe 's mind , between day and night .
resolution is something that is far more limited .
they are facts about the well @@@ -@@ @ being of conscious creatures .
probably not .
( la@@ ughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
when this statue was car@@ ved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
why would we think this ?
now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
( appl@@ ause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
they train their flying , they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature , and they are able to soci@@ alize with others from the same species .
( la@@ ughter ) But then what ?
therefore , it would be too risky to release these animals , both for the released and for the natural populations .
how about that ? do you think your bank is going to show that to people ?
there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate .
this is 2,000 miles across .
( la@@ ughter ) This is Oly@@ m@@ pus M@@ ons .
this is my favorite picture . this was just taken a few weeks ago .
there 's a model of A@@ RES here .
we will look for methane as well as other g@@ asses produced by living systems .
this is how we do it .
it enters the atmosphere of Mars .
the rocket engine begins .
we are on the ver@@ ge right now to make the first flight of an air@@ plane outside the Earth 's atmosphere .
one day , Los Angeles Times colum@@ n@@ ist Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ ez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and Na@@ than@@ i@@ el was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney Concer@@ t Hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes , he was lost .
and as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Na@@ than@@ i@@ el 's eyes .
and that is an escape from his tor@@ mented state .
and I understood that this was the very essence of art .
I went out and did a lit review , 3,000 articles on the key word " slavery . "
it 's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history .
well , this map in the sort of red@@ der , yel@@ lower colors are the places with the highest den@@ si@@ ties of slavery .
well , that is precisely what has happened around the world .
now , everything I 've been telling you , I admit , is pretty dis@@ hear@@ tening .
slavery , illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society .
in fact , it 's pe@@ anu@@ ts .
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dump@@ ed .
dump@@ ed without political participation , decent education , any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives , and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination .
we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch , and end up as second class citizens .
and you know what ? if we can 't do that , if we can 't use our intellectual power to end slavery , there is one last question : are we truly free ?
I 'm standing in front of you today in all hum@@ ility , wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education .
and I 'm not a trained academic .
we also heard that 250 billion Indian ru@@ pe@@ es was dedicated for government schooling .
those numbers were absolutely mind @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ ggling , overwhelming , and we were constantly asked , " When will you start ? how many schools will you start ?
but they know there is this myth that children from the slums CA@@ N@@ NOT speak English well .
no one in their family has spoken English .
even if it takes me four and a half hours , or three and half hours to finish my book , I do it .
you know , when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible , the IC@@ SE curriculum .
not only do our children cope very well , but they exce@@ l in it .
fathers have started to attend .
it 's very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thumb@@ prints in the attendance register .
now they have started writing their signature .
we had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study .
we want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools .
so , you can imagine how traum@@ atized and how dys@@ functional the houses are where our children come from .
we are dro@@ w@@ ning in news .
Reu@@ ters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year .
and when you look at the news through that filter , a lot falls by the way@@ side .
Britain will star@@ ve without genetically modified crops .
makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
my point is this : in the long run , some news stories are more important than others .
now , there he is calling to his friends .
now it 's not a l@@ one nut , it 's not two nuts -- three is a crowd , and a crowd is news .
now we 've got momentum . this is the ti@@ pping point .
( la@@ ughter ) So , over the next minute , you 'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridic@@ ul@@ ed for not joining in .
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
so , as we 're told that we should all be leaders , that would be really ineffective .
and what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
for kids like me , being called chil@@ dish can be a frequent occurrence .
( la@@ ughter ) Tru@@ e story , by the way .
instead of just sco@@ ffing at this he@@ res@@ y that a k@@ id wanted to get published , or saying wait until you 're older , my parents were really supportive .
and that changes the equation slightly , do@@ es@@ n 't it ?
we 've got what 's rational for public health .
now , the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well @@@ -@@ @ known , bleeding heart liberal Marg@@ aret Th@@ at@@ cher .
now , Marg@@ aret Th@@ at@@ cher did@@ n 't do this because she has any great love for jun@@ k@@ ies .
but in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) we 've taken a very different approach .
so what we 've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- end@@ lessly reviewing the data .
so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this .
well , I 'm not even going to address the clearly ir@@ rational positions of people like the Catholic Church , who think somehow that if you give out condoms , everyone 's going to run out and have sex .
here , maybe you 'll have better luck .
these are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven , and one in three of all adults , are infected with HIV .
of course , you can 't get HIV just by having un@@ protected sex .
this is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex , perhaps .
let 's just stop treating people . "
what does that mean ?
no , and I call it the " compassion con@@ und@@ r@@ um . "
I want to give what 's very nearly the last word to In@@ es .
why does she do that job ?
so it 's not a great job , but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice .
we 're not all of them , of course , but TED is a community of opinion leaders .
a few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DA@@ RPA , the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't take the risk of doing .
now , I CA@@ N@@ NOT imagine -- I 'm sorry , you may have a better imagination than I do -- I can 't imagine losing my arm , and typically at 22 years old .
we sort of agreed to disagree .
I could show you it with a cosme@@ sis on it that 's so real it 's e@@ er@@ ie , but then you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't see all this cool stuff .
I 'll give you some ast@@ ounding things that have happened as we started this .
and he made a few comments .
and it was ast@@ ounding how positive they are .
we 're scre@@ aming along .
and they shipped him to Germany and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Re@@ ed .
( la@@ ughter ) An@@ y@@ way , he was just like all the rest of them .
and we 're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less , that we 've done since the Civil War , a stick and a ho@@ ok .
that 's an in@@ convenience compared to having both of them gone . "
I keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
over the next month I visited lots of places , some out here , around the country , found the best of the best .
now he 's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thum@@ b and index finger .
it 's a robot that has three legs , which is inspired by nature .
we want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long @@@ -@@ @ range motion .
so we have two proto@@ types .

welcome to Ro@@ Me@@ La , the Ro@@ bo@@ tics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech . "
instead of using electrical motors , electro@@ mechanical actu@@ ators , we 're using compressed air .
it can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg , or in this case , a light@@ bulb .
this was more of a feasibility study : what kind of motors should we use ? is it even possible ?
for those who probably know , if you don 't have any sensors and there 's any disturbances , you know what happens .
let 's see how it does .
it 's very impressive .
( appl@@ ause ) DA@@ Rw@@ In also has a lot of other talents .
we have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .
at night , when I go to bed , at three , four in the morning , I lie down , close my eyes , and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around .
and I think , " Ah , this is cool . "
four in the morning -- what do you expect , right ?
that 's really the secret of our success , we 're having too much fun .
and there you go .
and I 'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London , and that 55 million years ago London was full of man@@ gro@@ ves .
is@@ n 't that cool ?
you can tell that from the little bar@@ bs on there .
this is some pol@@ len embedded in a cotton shirt , similar to the one that I 'm wearing now .
now , much of the pol@@ len will still be there after repeated wash@@ ings .
actually this one is particularly easy , these pictures were all taken in different countries .
thank you to the colleagues at Ke@@ w , and thank you to p@@ aly@@ n@@ ologists everywhere .
and this book was one of the most famous books in America for about 35 years .
gradually , bringing it down , bringing it down .
and I wonder what you 'd choose , because I 've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
it 's because possibilities on this planet , they don 't go back , they go forward .
so I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
my grand@@ parents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
a k@@ id born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
and why is it true ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are trium@@ phs of the scientific method .
so the question is : can we do that ? and I think we can .
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
they don 't understand that these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
fine .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's ok@@ ay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
absolutely . absolutely , I do .
thank you .
the truth is that we know that the images themselves don 't change the world , but we 're also aware that , since the beginning of photography , images have provoked reactions in people , and those reactions have caused change to happen .
and at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
most recently , we 've been tra@@ g@@ ically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti .
the horri@@ fying images from Abu G@@ hra@@ ib as well as the images from Guant@@ an@@ amo had a profound impact .
in the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
my company has 70 million images .
well , now a paper to@@ wel looks better .
now , PVC is a little bit better , but still not as good as the wood that we chose .
overnight .
for the next eight years , I saw friends die , I saw others go to prison and inflict un@@ told pain on countless victims and their families ' lives .
but then my life changed .
and eventually , they started to talk to me .
I 'd tried to make new friends and cover my tat@@ to@@ os with long sle@@ eves , and I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't admit it because I was afraid of being judged the same way I had judged other people .
I flew to Bu@@ ff@@ alo the next day , and I sat down with Dar@@ rel@@ l , and I asked him , " Have you ever met a Muslim person before ? "
my choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama , on the Florida peninsula .
these examples are just the first g@@ lim@@ pse of our ignorance of life on this planet .

and not uniquely but certainly , the oc@@ top@@ us in Australia are masters at cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age .
and they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for for@@ aging , but this particular one used vision .

if you 're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals , you might as well pick one that 's fairly common .
and this whole ecosystem was@@ n 't even known about until 33 years ago .

there 's no coral , algae growing on it , and the water 's pe@@ a sou@@ p .
and over here there 's a golf course going in .
I 've been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , " But , but what can I do ?
I 'm an individual . I 'm one person .
and these problems are so large and global , and it 's just overwhelming . "
fair enough question .
my answer to that is don 't look at the big , overwhelming issues of the world .
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it 's not isolated points on a map anymore , it 's a network we 've created .
what can you do that is more responsible than what you 're doing now ?
the vent community animals can 't really do much about the life and death that 's going on where they live , but up here we can .
Jean @@@ -@@ @ Michel Bas@@ qu@@ i@@ at , important to me because [ he was ] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into .
my interest is in artists who understand and re@@ write history , who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art , but who have created new places for us to see and understand .
it looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art .
I 'm showing you two works , one on the right by Le@@ on G@@ olu@@ b , one on the left by Robert Col@@ es@@ cott .
and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was , as it related , for her , to the idea of how black people had been represented .
and she pointed to the image on the right as an example , to me , of the kind of dignity that needed to be portra@@ yed to work against those images in the media .
this is Har@@ le@@ m , actually , on January 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way .
so I work now at The Studio Museum in Har@@ le@@ m , thinking about exhibitions there , thinking about what it means to discover art 's possibility .
now , what does this mean to some of you ?
in some cases , I know that many of you are involved in cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural dialogues , you 're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation .
the Studio Museum was founded in the late 6@@ 0s .
and then , of course , to bring us to today .
and Mohammed Ali said , " Me , we . "
it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I 'm asking .
it is why I make exhibitions .
now , where , perhaps , does this end up right now ?
what do I think about when I think about art ?
my addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called W@@ asp ; that 's not an acrony@@ m -- just somebody thought it looked like the in@@ sect .
we trained in a tank in Port Hu@@ enem@@ e , and then my first open ocean di@@ ve was in Santa Bar@@ bara Channel .
it was an evening di@@ ve .
it was breath@@ taking .
in the ocean , it 's the rule rather than the exception .
I first developed this technique working from a little single @@@ -@@ @ person subm@@ er@@ sible called De@@ ep R@@ over and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea @@@ -@@ @ Link , which you see here .
and inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that 's about as sensitive as a fully dark @@@ -@@ @ adapted human eye , albeit a little fu@@ zz@@ y .
you can actually see it in surface waters .
well , that was the question that 19th century French physi@@ ologist Rap@@ hael Du@@ bo@@ is , asked about this bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ es@@ cent cl@@ am .
so , most animals make blue light , and most animals can only see blue light , but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs .
and we know a little bit more about bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence thanks to Pi@@ x@@ ar , and I 'm very grateful to Pi@@ x@@ ar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people .
these are the eyes of a living an@@ gl@@ er@@ fish .
so , she 's got a l@@ ure that she sticks out in front of this living mou@@ se@@ trap of needle @@@ -@@ @ sharp teeth in order to attract in some un@@ suspec@@ ting prey .
and this one has a l@@ ure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it .
so they can use it for finding food , for attracting mates .
this fish is called the sh@@ ining tu@@ bes@@ hou@@ l@@ der because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squ@@ irt out light .
and we were using a special tra@@ w@@ ling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive .
so I 'm holding it , and I 'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when I do , you 'll see bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence coming out .
but to me , what 's shoc@@ king is not just the amount of light , but the fact that it 's not just lu@@ ci@@ fer@@ in and lu@@ ci@@ fer@@ ase .
for this fish , it 's actually whole cells with nuc@@ lei and membran@@ es .
it 's energe@@ tically very costly for this fish to do this , and we have no idea why it does it -- another one of these great myster@@ ies that needs to be solved .
and once this display gets going , I 'm not touching it anymore .
the other primary way is we go down with subm@@ er@@ si@@ bles and remote @@@ -@@ @ operated vehicles .
I 've made hundreds of dives in subm@@ er@@ si@@ bles .
and so , some@@ time ago , I got this idea for a camera system .
you can 't use infrared in the sea .
and so , the place that we took it to was this place called a Br@@ ine Pool , which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico .
so one of these take @@@ -@@ @ home messages here is , there is still a lot to explore in the oceans .
I have a very peculiar background , attitude and approach to the real world because I am a con@@ ju@@ rer .
no , I don 't do that ; I 'm a con@@ ju@@ rer , who is someone who pre@@ tends to be a real mag@@ ician . ( la@@ ughter ) Now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
( la@@ ughter ) I have to do something now , which seems a little bit strange for a mag@@ ician .

the second question that I 'd like to ask , rather simple : suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , as an example .
now , this is a process that is called cold reading .
" did he ever have an electric raz@@ or ? " " no . "
we all know who he is on television .
it 's very easy , win the million dollars .
they need to be stopped because this is a cruel far@@ ce .
I have to explain that to you .
why don 't they affect me ?
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) The answer may surprise you .
( la@@ ughter ) Work on it . work on it .
it 's a ridic@@ ulous thing . it is absolutely ridic@@ ulous .
we really must do something about this .
you will see the records that we have .
there 's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that M@@ um gave away all the family fortune .
and this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from cap@@ sizing in Sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan Africa .
this was in the 9@@ 0s during the peak of the HIV epidemic , before there were any AR@@ Vs in Sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan Africa .
so , with one micro@@ flu@@ i@@ dic chip , which is the size of an iPhone , you can actually diag@@ nose 100 patients at the same time .
thank you very much .
and then they execute on it .
sound familiar ? right .
and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team 's performance .
and I tried something interesting .
and the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
so , when you start to think about politicians , you 've got to realize these are strange creatures .
that do@@ es@@ n 't move .
that was a tradition I wanted to follow .
this was once a park .
the Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now .
again , international NGOs , united under the umbrella of the U.@@ N. , staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved .
the next day I left for Rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell .
they were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia .
a prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcu@@ ffed to a post in the mid@@ day sun .
a boy who lost a leg to a lef@@ to@@ ver mine .
this is a helicopter medi@@ c giving CPR to a soldier who had been shot in the head .
since the HIV epidemic , hospitals have been struggling to manage regular HIV treatment records for increasing volumes of patients .
and if they lose their booklets , their records can still be pulled by searching with their names .
at the time , we imported internet appliances called i @@@ -@@ @ Open@@ ers that were manufactured during the do@@ t @@@ -@@ @ com era by a failed US company .
we modified their screens to add touch sensors and their power system to run from re@@ chargeable batteries .
we used to fill ballo@@ ons with flour instead of water when we played .
but the city did@@ n 't y@@ ell at people .
it did@@ n 't ple@@ ad with them not to use water .
by the end of the drought , this created such a sense of urgency as well as a sense of community .
with help from the city , they were able to do something even more imp@@ ac@@ tful .
companies which completed the challenge saved on average 35 percent of water .
if it saved water , they replaced it , eventually reducing their employees ' water consumption by half .
as such , it needs to make use of as much space as possible to catch rainfall .
they are not hard@@ wired brain reactions that are un@@ control@@ l@@ able .
but the bottom line is that emotions are not built into your brain at birth .
this is my favorite part . are you ready to be cured ?
( gas@@ ps ) All right .
you have more control over your emotions than you think you do .
but some people experience crip@@ pling anxiety before a test .
it could be that your body is preparing to do battle and ace that test ...
or , you know , give a talk in front of hundreds of people on a stage where you 're being fil@@ med .
( la@@ ughter ) And research shows that when students learn to make this kind of energ@@ ized determination instead of anxiety , they perform better on tests .
and if they do that often enough , they not only can pass a test but it will be easier for them to pass their courses , and they might even finish college , which has a huge impact on their future earning potential .
now you can cultivate this emotional intelligence yourself and use it in your everyday life .
so just , you know , imagine wa@@ king up in the morning .
they might have a purely physical cause .
maybe you 're tired .
is it possible that you can transform emotional suffering into just mere physical discomfort ?
now responsibility is a big word .

and within two and a half years , about the time the Whole Earth Cat@@ alog came out , these images started to appear , and indeed , they did transform everything .
this was the norm and can be again .
obviously , one of the huge concerns right now is that extinction is happening at a faster rate than ever in history .
that 's the mem@@ e that 's out there .
and the story is , we 're the next me@@ te@@ or .

this is one of the things James Lo@@ vel@@ ock has been insi@@ sting ; basically , our knowledge of the oceans , especially of ocean life , is fundamentally vap@@ or , in this sense .
the stories -- these go@@ d@@ dam stories -- the stories we tell ourselves become lies over time .
the reason that Se@@ bas@@ tian and I are optimistic is we read people like Ste@@ ven Pin@@ ker , " The Better Ang@@ els of Our Nature , " and so far , so good .
he says many of those kids have dropped out of school , including three of his own .
Governments seem to think that 's OK .
right now , in the United States , in India , in Slovenia , people like R@@ av@@ i are raising their children in the shadow of factories or mines that are poisoning their air and their water .
let me give you another example .
she is one of five million people in Kenya who faces a discriminatory vetting process when trying to obtain a national ID card .
by that I think he means fight using law rather than guns .
one is invest .
because if we all start knowing law , using law and shaping law , then we will be building that deeper version of democracy that I believe our world desper@@ ately needs .
in those days , most cultural and public institutions did@@ n 't really care to preserve these treasures .
so he created a mix of comp@@ as mixed with fun@@ k and jazz .
he only made what he could afford : 2,000 copies of the record .
he was@@ n 't specifically looking for it .
he took out his little , plastic , portable turn@@ table that he brought with him whenever he was on these dig@@ ging qu@@ ests and put the record on .
he knew the artist , at the time of the recording , was living in Montreal , so for months , he tried to track him down .
that 's how DI@@ Y Hen@@ ri @@@ -@@ @ Pierre No@@ ë@@ l was .
but thank@@ fully , the Hen@@ ri @@@ -@@ @ Pierre No@@ ë@@ l tapes were safe and they were ready for re@@ ma@@ stering .
the record was finally re@@ released and received praise from music critics , D@@ J@@ s and listen@@ ers worldwide -- the praise that it should have received in 1979 .
I went from planning my retirement to playing on the BBC Radio in London , and on Radio Canada and more . "
beyond the r@@ arity and the dollar value -- and I 'll be honest , we 're totally obs@@ essed by that -- the true beauty is to give art a second chance ; to save art from obl@@ i@@ vi@@ on .
that 's why we call it record dig@@ ging and not record clicking .
then we file them , we contex@@ tu@@ alize them , and we keep them safe .
we are ta@@ stem@@ akers and cur@@ ators .
so for myself and most of the record collectors I 've encountered in 20 years , I think that we all have some sort of an outlet for these discoveries .
they want to do -- they want to di@@ g deeper , but they don 't necessarily have 20 hours a week like us ner@@ ds , so they trust us to do that for them .
beautiful art deserves to be cher@@ ished , shared and re@@ discovered .
all you have to do is open your ears and take risks .
maybe . that 's sort of interesting , kind of new . but is it creative ?
however , only one person said this : " if you were dying and it were a murder mystery , and you had to car@@ ve the name of the murde@@ rer into the ground with your dying words . "
OK , so the two groups that sat together for the first test , they looked pretty similar to each other , and they averaged about 20 creative ideas per person .
and they were just walking on a t@@ read@@ mill in a w@@ indow@@ less room .
the people who sat twice for that second test did@@ n 't get any better ; practice did@@ n 't help .
here 's the interesting thing .
well , the answer for me is that if I were running , the only new idea I would have would be to stop running , so ...
so you can put your head@@ phones on and record through your phone and then just pre@@ tend you 're having a creative conversation , right ?
so let 's take a closer look at rule number 30 here .
we 're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here , but we 're getting all this amazing stuff .
it also brings up new issues , though , like compu@@ tational ir@@ re@@ duci@@ bility .
the only way to find its outcome is , effectively , just to watch it evolve .
but that 's just the beginning .
so far , there are about 8 million lines of Mathematic@@ a code in Wol@@ fra@@ m Alpha built by experts from many , many different fields .
I mean , everything is scaling up very nic@@ ely and we 're getting more confident .
you can expect to see Wol@@ fra@@ m Alpha technology showing up in more and more places , working both with this kind of public data , like on the website , and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on .
on the one hand , we have Mathematic@@ a , with its sort of precise , formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines .
so here 's a tri@@ vial piece of Mathematic@@ a programming .
then on the other hand , we have Wol@@ fra@@ m Alpha , with all the mess@@ iness of the world and human language and so on built into it .
I think it 's actually rather wonderful .
with Wol@@ fra@@ m Alpha inside Mathematic@@ a , you can , for example , make precise programs that call on real world data .
I mean , anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language .
I don 't know for sure , but I think at this point it 's sort of almost embar@@ ras@@ sing not to at least try .
it 's taken us a long way already , but there 's so much more to come .
does your work relate to his ?
you 'll notice , they 've all got something that I don 't .
so this might be a good moment to take a quick time @@@ -@@ @ out to answer a few FA@@ Q@@ s about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
so , how do you top rowing across the Atlantic ?
by the time I get to Australia , if I get to Australia , I will have row@@ ed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all .
I eventually made it to Hawa@@ ii still alive .

and if you look at the list of things on the bottom , we are familiar with the Arabic numbers one to 10 and so on .
now wall switches , we all know , fail .
with integrated circuits , you can build cell@@ phones .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And also , could you create the worst possible TE@@ D@@ Talk that they would still let you get away with ?
and the more technical topics , such as architecture , materials and , str@@ ang@@ ely enough , men , those are not good topics to talk about .
first of all , I must , as a speaker , provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you , instead of saying what I can 't have .
if I don 't understand something , I can just say , " etc . , etc . "
and worst of all , we will never know .
they 're smaller questions , but they are not that small .
immunization , that 's the cheapest way to save a child 's life .
bed nets are very cheap .
maybe that 's the solution , maybe we should send kids to school .
so here is the thing .
but maybe there is another problem as well .
so let 's try them .
so the blue do@@ ts are selected randomly .
so we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immun@@ ized .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kil@@ o of l@@ enti@@ ls for each immunization .
so what do we find ?
add the l@@ enti@@ ls and you reach to 38 percent .
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emo@@ tion and angry rhetoric .
we can know the answer to this question .
and this one that was in Kenya , they went around and distributed to people vouchers , discount vouchers .
second thing is , how about the use ?
and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who did@@ n 't get a free one .
maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit .
so suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
and then can@@ als were built , and with the same hor@@ sem@@ an and the same horse , you could carry ten times as much cargo .
here 's an example of how this can be powerful .
if Apple were like everyone else , a marketing message from them might sound like this : " we make great computers .
they 're beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
here 's our new law firm : we have the best lawyers with the biggest clients , we always perform for our clients .
and Samuel Pier@@ pon@@ t L@@ ang@@ ley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success .

I love asking businesses , " What 's your conversion on new business ? "
you should have success then .
they were extremely well @@@ -@@ @ funded .

in the summer of 1963 , 250,000 people showed up on the m@@ all in Washington to hear Dr. King speak .
in fact , some of his ideas were bad .
he did@@ n 't go around telling people what needed to change in America .
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
they 're not inspiring anybody .
leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us .
and that was largely because there we@@ ren 't any .

and it occurred to me that in this whole non @@@ -@@ @ governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
when Al G@@ ore won his well @@@ -@@ @ deserved O@@ scar for the " In@@ convenient Truth " movie , I was thr@@ illed , but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly .
we need a movie on those six categories .
will it provide high quality care ?
and so we have set about doing that .
now , we started working together 18 months ago .
our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Di@@ ana No@@ ble , who is an unusually gif@@ ted woman , but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work .
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five .
over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal paras@@ ites and diar@@ rhe@@ a from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- all entirely preventable and treat@@ able .
listen to this : less than four @@@ -@@ @ ten@@ ths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise de@@ fa@@ ulted on treatment .
we 've started the first malaria treatment programs they 've ever had there .
and that was what I did .
then , in 1980 , there was a hurricane , Hur@@ ric@@ ane Al@@ len .
and within a few months after that sea ur@@ chin dying , the sea@@ weed started to grow .
and so I 'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things .
CO@@ D fed most of the people of Western Europe .
it 's one of those things .
it 's not just the fish , though , that are dis@@ appearing .
but , instead of dev@@ ouring the people in the shop , what it 's doing is over@@ growing and smo@@ ther@@ ing virtually all of the bottom @@@ -@@ @ dwelling life of the entire nor@@ th@@ western Mediterranean Sea .
it runs down the rivers , and it feeds the plan@@ k@@ ton , the little micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic plant cells in the coastal water .
and the only people who are left there are the people who can 't afford to move away from the coast , because the coast , instead of being paradise , is harmful to your health . "
think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Nor@@ thwest Pass@@ age .
and , of course , Arctic communities are to@@ ast .
except it 's supposed to be brown .
but when it gets too hot , the algae can 't make the sugar .
the cor@@ als say , " You che@@ ated . you did@@ n 't pay your rent . "
the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great ancho@@ ve@@ ta fisheries , of the s@@ ard@@ ines of California or in Peru or whatever , those slow down and those fisheries collapse .
it 's about us and our gre@@ ed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the sel@@ fish world we live in today .
the point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years , the point that people may be economically poor , but they 're not poor in the mind .
the research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.@@ K.
and feet in the water will develop fun@@ gu@@ s , infections , and that infection pa@@ ins because then other insects b@@ ite that point .
it all begins with curi@@ osity .
and if you cure him , I will get my wall painted . "
we saw it in Sho@@ d@@ h Y@@ at@@ ra . every six months we walk in different parts of the country .
look at what she has done .
this innovation is from the slums of Rio .
so , creativity counts , knowledge matters , innovations transform , incentives inspire .
for me , this story begins about 15 years ago , when I was a hosp@@ ice doctor at the University of Chicago .
and the daughter 's husband , he also was sick from his wife 's exhaustion .
and so I suddenly realized two very simple things : first , the wid@@ o@@ wh@@ ood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives .
I became obs@@ essed with how it might be that we 're embedded in these social networks , and how they affect our lives .
so , social networks are these intr@@ icate things of beauty , and they 're so elaborate and so complex and so u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous , in fact , that one has to ask what purpose they serve .
in addition , if your body size , if your B@@ MI , your body mass index , is above 30 -- if you 're clin@@ ically ob@@ ese -- we also colored the do@@ ts yellow .
but the visual complexity is still very high .
it 's not obvious exactly what 's going on .
a kind of induction , a kind of spread from person to person .
was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person ?
and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure , the architecture of the ties , was changing across time .
every tie between them is a relationship .
and , in fact , emotional contag@@ ion can be broader still .
maybe there 's a kind of below the surface , quiet riot that anim@@ ates us all the time .
again , a social network , but now we color the people yellow if they 're happy and blue if they 're sad and green in between .
there 's a middle and an edge to this network , and the un@@ happy people seem to be located at the edges .
but that 's not the case with real networks .
now , those people both have four friends , but A 's friends all know each other , and B 's friends do not .
and , finally , compare nodes C and D : C and D both have six friends .
you 'd rather be D , on the edge of the network .
see , today if you want water in space you have to take that resource , you have to load it onto a rocket and launch it into space .
there 's water on aster@@ oids , on com@@ ets , on the poles of our Moon , and on other planets .
this is a planetary @@@ -@@ @ scale , power @@@ -@@ @ generation system .
and it has to be designed to survive the violent rocket launch to the atmosphere .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Brea@@ thing in ) ( Brea@@ thing out ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) In the only breath@@ able atmosphere that we know of anywhere , a resource that we take for granted every minute of every day .
today , you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure , create a bun@@ ch of micro@@ scope slides and have a trained person examine it .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you did@@ n 't have to draw the blood .
we can see it because of this molec@@ ule called h@@ emo@@ zo@@ in .
that 's really , really , really short .
this is a pulse of light that 's only about one wa@@ vel@@ ength of light long , so it 's a whole bun@@ ch of pho@@ tons all coming and hitting simultaneously .
one of the problems that you have if you 're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don 't know what 's the most effective thing to do .
you spend a certain amount per bed net .
and this is this latter part of the rainy season .
we 're going to the dry season now .
it nearly goes away in the dry season , because there 's no place for the mosqu@@ it@@ oes to breed .
now , one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT .
well , let 's try to kill it with consumer electronics . "
your laser printer has a mirror galvan@@ ometer that 's used to steer a laser beam very accurately ; that 's what makes those little do@@ ts on the page .
they 're the only ones that are dangerous .
what I care deeply about is this new industry that is working to convince us that we are consuming something natural while fixing social ills , when we are@@ n 't .
cannabis is a plant that grows naturally and has been used within textiles and even traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years .
they also started to use pesticides and fertilizers in some ways that we should be concerned with .
in many circles , leg@@ alized m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana is too much of a sacred cow to question .
I finally found a way to shut this up .
I quickly turned to other drugs and alcohol , and something just wo@@ ke up inside of my brain .
my addic@@ tive use mirrors many of the stories that I 'm sure you 've heard before .
it started out as fun , it got sc@@ ary , and then it was just necessary .
what if we held them to a higher standard than we are right now ?
( appl@@ ause ) JD : so it sounds like your talk is less about being anti @@@ -@@ @ cannabis and more about raising awareness about aspects of commercialization .
BC : yes . so , I am not the anti @@@ -@@ @ weed guy .
and no , I 'm not the anti @@@ -@@ @ weed guy , I 'm the pro @@@ -@@ @ thought guy .
and let me start with this .
now , if an alien came to earth -- let 's call him Jo@@ e -- what would Jo@@ e see ?
here we have the extreme with dead cor@@ als , micro@@ b@@ ial sou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
we did@@ n 't see a single shar@@ k .
and this is something that is very unusual in today 's coral reefs .
if we get all of the fish of a coral ree@@ f together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , the par@@ rot@@ fish , the surge@@ on@@ fish that eat the algae .
the good news is that , in addition to having more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there 's more of everything .
so how are these fish , these pre@@ dat@@ ors going to help ?
in Christmas , where the food web is really trim@@ med down , where the large animals are gone , the cor@@ als have not recovered .
so if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
this was my baseline . this is what I saw when I was a k@@ id .
after a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the algae grow again .
so let me just give you a summary of what no @@@ -@@ @ take reserves do .
in some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
and same thing for in@@ vertebr@@ ates . this is the example .
this is in the Bahamas : Nas@@ sau grou@@ per .
but if we add the no @@@ -@@ @ take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
and the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spa@@ w@@ ning population every year .
but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
it would be just too de@@ pressing .
one is computation ; this is the stuff you 've forgotten .
for example , fac@@ toring quad@@ rati@@ cs with leading coefficients greater than one .
( la@@ ughter ) In all seriousness . here 's an example from a physics textbook .
notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compu@@ te .
I 'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
so I can diag@@ nose the problem a little more specifically in math .
and here 's how it works .
and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you 'll need .
it 's te@@ di@@ ous .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's how you know you 've ba@@ ited the ho@@ ok , right ?
we 're no longer intim@@ idated by math , because we 're slowly re@@ defining what math is .
I have a daughter , Mul@@ an .
and I thought , " Ok@@ ay , here we go . "
and you go through the woman 's vag@@ ina . "
Oh ... "
and then she got all caught up in the legs . " but how would the legs go , M@@ om ?
audience : W@@ ho@@ a oh .
one , two , three , four , five .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you so much . thank you .
thanks so much . thank you guys .
that 's the person who carries the tor@@ ch into the world .
by this , I mean how many of you have cared for someone suffering from an illness , injury or disability ?
I am now a long @@@ -@@ @ distance care@@ r for my mother , who suffers from multiple chronic conditions .
so a few years ago , I asked myself , " Can we take this one step further and treat other can@@ cers , even in other species ? "
so we created a cocktail of anti@@ an@@ gi@@ ogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food , as well as an anti@@ an@@ gi@@ ogenic cream , that could be applied on the surface of the tumor .
but what 's very cool is when we combine the two less potent te@@ as together , the combination , the blend , is more potent than either one alone .
here 's some more data from our testing .
now in the lab , we can simulate tumor an@@ gi@@ ogene@@ sis , represented here in a black bar .
and we 're now studying the role of a healthy diet -- with Dean Or@@ nish at U@@ CS@@ F and Tu@@ fts University -- the role of this healthy diet on markers of an@@ gi@@ ogene@@ sis that we can find in the blood@@ stream .
so , you 've grown up and reached the age of reason , and now God will start keeping notes on you , and begin your permanent record . "
you mean all that time , up till today , all that time I was so good , God did@@ n 't notice it ? "
( la@@ ughter ) Now , I did@@ n 't know it at the time , but I really was@@ n 't turning seven on September 10th .
every year on October 10th , when it was your birthday but you did@@ n 't realize it , I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day . "
my mother had been celebrating my birthday with me , without me .
( la@@ ughter ) What was so up@@ setting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my sl@@ umber party with all of my gir@@ l@@ friends .
the Vir@@ go poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair , sort of loun@@ ging by some water , but the Li@@ bra poster is just a huge scale .
sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Ad@@ ven@@ tist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven .
( la@@ ughter ) And I sat them down , and I got them glasses of water -- O@@ k , I got it , I got it .
OK .
and they told me this story all about this guy named Le@@ hi , who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC .
or , if you 'd gone blind , you could see . "
if you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major cul@@ pr@@ its in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed me@@ ats .
best of all , I 'm healthier , I know that I 'm going to live longer , and I 've even lost a little weight .
so we changed these houses into people .
here we see , it says on the top , " Families in the world by income , " and we have the street represented just beneath it , you can see .
we can look at beds .
so let 's go there .
so we go to China , we pick three families .
they have a plastic shield and grass .
they have the same kind of sofa , they store their grain in similar ways , they 're going to have fish for dinner , and they 're boiling their water in identical ways .
and observe , in all these comparisons , their homes are chosen so they are in completely different places of the world .
but what we see is pretty identical .
coming to our group up here , similar shoes , Jordan , US .
Pun@@ ta E@@ spin@@ osa is where I lived for over a year , and we call it un@@ inhabited because there are no people there .
so a lot has happened in the last 40 years , and what I learned when I came to the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os is the importance of wild places , wild things , certainly wildlife , and the amazing qualities that pen@@ gu@@ ins have .
you have to train to be able to do that .
when I counted pen@@ gu@@ ins for the first time and tried to do a census , we just counted all the individual be@@ aks that we could around all these islands .
what I found out I was studying is really the difference in how the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os changes , the most extreme variation .
why do they do that ? because it 's cheaper , because they don 't pay the real environmental costs .
the same thing 's true for pen@@ gu@@ ins as well .
we need to be able to get information out to the general public .
this guy has never been in before and he 's trying to figure out , " What is going on ?
so pen@@ gu@@ ins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats .
and pen@@ gu@@ ins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another .
it 's great stuff .
now that might be the end of the story -- Ok@@ ay , we just replace it all with conventional rene@@ wa@@ bles -- but I think , actually , there 's more to the story than that .
this is pretty incredible stuff .
it 's not because we have a lot of it .
it turns out , the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually meth@@ yl@@ ated , and the meth@@ yl@@ ation protects it from the restriction enzy@@ me , from dig@@ esting the DNA .
so the team developed new debu@@ gging software , where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA .
we felt one of the ten@@ ets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA .
and we also built in a website address so that if somebody dec@@ o@@ des the code within the code within the code , they can send an email to that address .
and the last one is a Richard Fe@@ yn@@ man quote : " what I CA@@ N@@ NOT build , I CA@@ N@@ NOT understand . "
we need some alternatives for oil .
he said , " There are two types of people in this world : those who divide the world into two types and those who do not . "
they get no great pleasure from what they do .
and high among them is education , because education , in a way , dis@@ loc@@ ates very many people from their natural talents .
the great problem for reform or transformation is the ty@@ ran@@ ny of common sense .
( la@@ ughter ) We suppress it . you know , this is our policy .
maybe they go later , not right away .
he said , " It was humiliating .
( la@@ ughter ) A friend of mine once said , " A three year @@@ -@@ @ old is not half a six year @@@ -@@ @ old . "
there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
( la@@ ughter ) It worked out for Eric , that 's all I 'm saying .
it 's about passion .
there are many great models .
or at home , if that 's what they choose , to be educated with their families or friends .
and I wanted to just very quickly -- I was very struck by Nat@@ ali@@ e Mer@@ chant 's songs last night , recovering old po@@ ems .
thank you .
she 's turning it inside out .
now , the academics in this audience may think , " Well , that sounds like pl@@ ag@@ i@@ arism . "
well , it turns out that it 's actually not illegal .
and sometimes these are fun , right ?
this is Vi@@ vi@@ enn@@ e West@@ wood . no !
I 've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind ch@@ im@@ es as they walk through .
they 're trying to put together a signature look , an aesthetic that reflects who they are .
when people kno@@ ck it off , everybody knows because they 've put that look out on the run@@ way , and it 's a coherent aesthetic .
they develop a person@@ a , a signature style , much like fashion designers .
but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world , it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really in@@ effec@@ tual .
but even though it 's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there , they don 't register their garments , generally , and there 's not a lot of litigation .
if you look at the registry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the E.@@ U.
the retailers have kind of qu@@ ashed this notion though .
that is a very difficult question to answer .
it do@@ es@@ n 't matter how w@@ ack@@ y they look or how cool they look , you CA@@ N@@ NOT copyright the sculp@@ tural design .
same with furniture , it 's too util@@ itarian .
( appl@@ ause ) It ain 't pretty .
when I found out that there are a whole bun@@ ch of industries that did@@ n 't have copyright protection , I thought , " What exactly is the underlying logic ?
then no , it does not deserve protection .
the other one is : is it an idea ?
in 2009 , there were 500 bomb bl@@ asts across Pakistan .
( singing ) The Taliban now run their own schools .
SOC : would you like to carry out a suicide attack ?
Ha : if God gives me strength .
step one is that the Taliban prey on families that are large , that are poor , that live in rural areas .
but what really threatens humanity ?
a few years ago , Professor Vac@@ lav Sm@@ il tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history .
he looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic erup@@ tion , even of an aster@@ oid hitting the Earth .
you took a path@@ ogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
by that time , the battle against HIV would already have been lost .
so let 's take a look at the flu virus .
in addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
now , what does this mean ?
it 's like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it 's still wearing the same s@@ ocks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those s@@ ocks .
so what we 've got is a situation .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro @@@ -@@ @ vacc@@ in@@ ology to make a preventive flu vaccine .
these are largely hidden from the immune system .
so far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .
we really could think of flu , then , as just a bad cold .
so to do that , we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and , of course , smart delivery methods .
for most strains , you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg .
the developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they 're le@@ ap@@ fro@@ gging the West .
now think of where this leads us .
no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : thank you .
so , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem .
ca : and that 's the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
it 's such a large conference .
and the theme , in two years , is going to be " Cu@@ te Pictures Of P@@ up@@ p@@ ies . "
( la@@ ughter ) It do@@ es@@ n 't actually take pictures , but it 's a hell of a lot cheaper , and you still feel like you were there .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Cle@@ ars his throat ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) " De@@ ar Sir , good day , compliments of the day , and my best wishes to you and family .
( la@@ ughter ) Before my father death , he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars , which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war .
( la@@ ughter ) The fund was deposited as a family rea@@ sure , in a safe , reliable security company in Dakar , Senegal , where I was only given temporary asylum .
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to un@@ favorable economic climate , and so close to my country .
so what are you , like , a thousand , two thousand , somewhere in there ?
that 's nothing to be ashamed of .
( sigh@@ s ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Within a week , I received a call from Ear@@ th@@ link that said , due to a 10 cents per meg@@ aby@@ te over@@ age charge , I owed them 30,000 dollars .
I don 't know .
and I 've got to say that , you know , it 's really , really great to be here .
( loud music ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) And fro@@ g mode .
some people say to me , " Z@@ e , you 're doing all this stuff , this Internet stuff , and you 're not making any money . "
( la@@ ughter ) But you come back as a duc@@ k .
( la@@ ughter ) Good choice .
and very , very quickly -- I love pup@@ pets .
and indeed , this is just one of the examples of the jun@@ k that flows across the tubes in these Inter@@ nets here .

Lar@@ ry Les@@ si@@ g : so what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos .
( music ) And then some people from Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n saw it .
and San Franc@@ isc@@ ans thought they had to do the same as well .
here 's lesson number one .
it should feel familiar and kind of res@@ onate for anyone who 's had a sing @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ long or a dance party with a group of good friends .
stage two , social re@@ mix , is really about using it to mediate people 's relationships to each other .
indeed , anything you add to the m@@ ash@@ up , music you might add , Luc@@ as has a worldwide perpe@@ tual right to exploit that for free .
the creator do@@ es@@ n 't have any rights .
I tri@@ pped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week .
but then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been sil@@ enced .
my whole 45 @@@ -@@ @ minute video had been sil@@ enced because there were sn@@ ip@@ pets in that video , a video about fair use , that included War@@ ner Music Group music .
so memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million .
same thing for processor speeds .
short shad@@ ows at noon and so forth .
and that 's all well and good .
you have to be able to navigate in 3D .
so the computation is space soluble and network soluble .
and finally , I 'd like to leave you with a g@@ lim@@ pse that takes us back to the world of imagery .
and let 's just pick out a few elements .
we can grab elements off the front , where upon they re@@ anim@@ ate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here .
the gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
so this is the inev@@ itability about it .

the first was that these animals continue to be hun@@ ted , killed with hak@@ ap@@ i@@ ks at about eight , 15 days old .
I read that last year the pu@@ p mortality rate was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Law@@ rence .
but the truth is we 're way too efficient at catching them , and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .
they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are fl@@ ush@@ ed out into the ocean , and maybe even affecting their reproduction .
and I got in the water with them , and I was amaz@@ ed at how curious they were .
and I wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of over@@ fishing , the global fish crisis story .
it 's a video game move from " Star Fox . "
two is you do not talk about / b / .
( la@@ ughter ) So they broke that poll .
I ended up at this really fancy party .
anonymous is this group of people that protested , very fam@@ ously , Sci@@ ent@@ ology .
so what they did is they -- I mean , they put CS@@ I to shame here -- the Internet detec@@ tives came out .
they matched , they found his My@@ Space .
but anonym@@ ity basically allows people to say anything , all the rules gone .
ca : but words , saying things , you know , can be constructive ; it can be really damaging .
ca : and that content is all off the board now .
( appl@@ ause ) CP : I got out of M@@ om 's , and I 'm back in school right now .

it 's called " hel@@ ios " -- hel@@ ios from the Sun .
what happens when you have a star that 's right on the edge of that mass ?
well , this is a picture of it .
so that star is also 50 million light years away .
and it has a binary companion that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas .
now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Ban@@ g .

so it goes like this : sustained goodwill creates friendship .
so what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion .
so , are you ready for the lecture ?
take the example of fl@@ utes .
( audience : random . ) Michael San@@ del : at random . you would do it by lottery .
now , fl@@ utes may seem ... the distribution of fl@@ utes may seem a tri@@ vial case .
how many would rule in favor of Cas@@ ey Martin ?
all right , we have a good division of opinion here .
audience : the endurance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes .
that 's part of the game of golf ? ( audience : absolutely . ) MS : what 's your name ? ( audience : W@@ arre@@ n . ) MS : W@@ arre@@ n .
Char@@ ley : and I am . ( MS : ok@@ ay . ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) You know , it 's interesting .
and what do you suppose they all said ?
the fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
what would it be ? ( audience : let everyone use the cart . ) Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to .
because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf , but , rel@@ at@@ edly , the question : what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athle@@ tic talents ?
let me put the point as delic@@ ately as possible : gol@@ fers are a little sensitive about the athle@@ tic status of their game .
usually , things that talk are people , not machines , right ?
and they would ch@@ ase them down the hall@@ way .
we actually do things together .
I spent about a week in this Din@@ ka cattle camp on the banks of the Nile in South Sudan .
it was a like a graduate course in ecological ethno@@ graphy , and I got busy taking notes with a camera .
I want to go over the horizon and find new things , find we@@ ir@@ d stuff , like this volcanic cal@@ der@@ a in Niger .
if you were to walk through those palm gro@@ ves , you could drink fresh water out of your foot@@ steps .
I never thought I would see date pal@@ ms in snow , but the kids that day had a great time throwing snow@@ balls at each other .
ye@@ ah , there is a garbage truck of plastic entering the ocean every minute of every hour of every day .
why don 't we turn off the tap ?
roughly eight million ton are racing to flow into the ocean to join the estimated 150 million ton already there .
and if you live in the gri@@ ps of poverty concerned , always , about food or shelter or a sense of security , recycling -- it 's beyond your realm of imagination .
and as a result of the program , L@@ ise can afford her two daughters ' school tuition and uniforms .
we sell it to suppliers of great brands like Mar@@ ks and Sp@@ enc@@ er , who have commissioned the use of social plastic in their products .
social plastic is money , a globally recogn@@ izable and tra@@ dable currency that , when used , allevi@@ ates poverty and cle@@ ans the environment at the same time .
( la@@ ughter ) I think , how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in 18 minutes ?
most African stories these days , they talk about famine , HIV and AIDS , poverty or war .
and in the center of Kun@@ ene region is the village of S@@ es@@ fon@@ te@@ in . this is where I was born .
this is where I 'm coming from .
Don 't move . stand your ground .
and it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and what to run from .
I was born in 1971 .
we lived under apartheid regime .
during the same year almost every Him@@ ba had a rifle .
because it was war@@ time , the British .@@ 303 rifle was just all over the whole country .
we were hungry .
I remember a night when a hungry le@@ op@@ ard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed .
and my father said , " Why don 't you just go to school ? "
but then , the people from IR@@ D@@ NC proposed to Joshua : what if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife ?
and here are the new ideas .
thirty years have passed since my father 's first job as a community game guard .
( appl@@ ause ) We were successful in Namibia because we dre@@ amed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife .
( la@@ ughter ) But imagine with me that you 're a conservative member of Congress .
we 're going to the Moon before the decade is out .
you utterly reject them .
it would serve a country .
you see their p@@ itch@@ for@@ ks and tor@@ ches , and you know they 're not good building tools .
they can 't build up the institutions and the communities so necessary to a stable and prosperous country .
you are a conservative member of Congress .
you realize that many in your party look to some good old days that you know never existed .
you are ready to lead .
there 's still time to lead .
tell them that Mil@@ ton Fried@@ man would say to tax pollution rather than profits .
tell them that America must stop the dividing , and must start the uniting .
play your part before it 's too late .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you very much .
but secondly , to incenti@@ vi@@ ze that in@@ oc@@ ulation by giving a kil@@ o of l@@ enti@@ ls to everybody who participated .
it 's a tiny , tiny thing .
you 're not really confident standing up there saying , " I 've got it crac@@ ked ; it 's the l@@ enti@@ ls , " are you ?
no , no , no , the next one is actually blue , to your left , and says " He@@ ath@@ row Express . "
I said , " When people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they 'd probably quite like to look at .
ok@@ ay , you simply w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't .
let 's face it , most of us -- how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine ?
in truth , we do live in a world that science can understand .
but it 's very , very uncomfortable for us to actually acknowledge that we 're living in such a world .
that 's called tri@@ via .
and if actually we created a Ministry of De@@ tail and business actually had Chief De@@ tail Officers , then that fourth quad@@ rant , which is so wo@@ efully neglected at the moment , might finally get the attention it deserves .
which means we 're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts , if at all .
with nuclear , those who know the most are the least worried .
and H@@ ans@@ en is hard over for nuclear power , as are most clim@@ at@@ ologists who are engaging this issue seriously .
and we are educating our kids , having fewer kids , basically good news all around .
they 've run out of good sites .
likewise , with solar , especially here in California , we 're discovering that the 80 solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bull@@ do@@ ze 1,000 square miles of southern California desert .
the high is the average of 103 scientific , peer @@@ -@@ @ reviewed studies .
so then here 's the final ranking .
and I want to support Ste@@ wart Br@@ and 's position .
so if we want to keep the lights on , we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time .
man : the last person who was in favor made the premise that we don 't have enough alternative renewable resources .
and so the fall@@ acy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible .
it was a sunny day and a win@@ dy night .
I 've played the Dis@@ ney Hall here and Car@@ ne@@ gie Hall and places like that .
and he 's singing right into your ear .
and they no longer have to be exactly the same .
so the early hip @@@ -@@ @ hop guys would loop certain sections .
( music : " rap@@ per 's Del@@ ight " by The Su@@ gar@@ hill G@@ ang ) The MC would impro@@ vise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would impro@@ vise mel@@ o@@ dies .
and does it happen anywhere else ?
maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds .
another update : you will recall I introduced you guys to the Qu@@ ad@@ ro Trac@@ ker .
essentially , we are pattern @@@ -@@ @ seeking pri@@ mates .
your next decision could be the most important one of your life .
because fiel@@ ders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .
in a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
you get a hypo@@ x@@ ia , or a lower oxygen .
so their little wedding video went on to get over 40 million views .
and they 've ended up on a bun@@ ch of talk shows , and they 've used it as an opportunity to make a difference .
so we have to manage many claims to the same video .
since we are such a visual species , it 's hard for us to really understand this , so I 'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it .
but there are some exceptions .
as these two animals form a social bond , their distinctive whi@@ stles actually conver@@ ge and become very similar .
let 's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dol@@ ph@@ ins from human disturbance .
anybody looking at this picture will know this dol@@ ph@@ in is surrounded , and clearly his behavior is being disrupted .
when there was one boat , not much of an impact .
so it could have a negative impact on the whole population .
I 'd also like to point out that sound do@@ es@@ n 't obey boundaries .
the world is mostly blue .
the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours .
now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clar@@ k , 0.2 miles away from a hum@@ p@@ back .
look what happened by 2000 to the average call .
it 's as if the whole population had to shift from being b@@ asses to singing as a ten@@ or .
it turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right wh@@ ales in the summer time , and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision .
well , bi@@ ologists who cou@@ ld@@ n 't take no for an answer went to the International Maritime Organization and peti@@ tioned them to say , " Can 't you move that lane ? those are just lines on the ground .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
so let 's talk about what business should do .
so what does T@@ SI look like ?
some companies are already making this happen .
if you 're like me , they make some important products , like coffee and chocolate .
it 's because they partner with NGOs around the world that are working with small shareholder farmers .
now , what about those consumer goods companies -- the ones who make those products we love like coffee and chocolate ?
consumer goods companies that perform best on total societal impact see an 11 percent valuation premium .
so this thing right here is f@@ rea@@ king me out .
and we 're giving them R@@ ital@@ in and saying , " Don 't be an entrepreneurial type .
and my mom came into the room and said , " Where are you going to get the han@@ gers to sell to the dry clean@@ ers ? "
this one guy offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half .
when I was about 10 years old , I sold com@@ ic books out of our cottage on Georgian Bay .
go get some of that . I learned that at a young age .
it was , " Which color would you like ? "
and they could use those for practice balls .
this is what really kind of gets everybody h@@ ating you , because you 're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time .
come and tell me what it is .
they go around looking for what it is , then we negotiate what they 'll get paid .
I 'm teaching them to force that savings habit .
there 's two traits I want you to also look out for that we don 't get out of their system .
because there 's huge opportunities in that .
I needed an anchor , an image , a pe@@ g to pe@@ g this process on , so that I could go from there .
how do you not get overwhel@@ med by the despair and the misery of it all ?
I present to you an excer@@ pt of that work " Sim@@ han@@ and@@ ini . "
so I spent time with Vi@@ vian , and I saw that she did@@ n 't find joy in cleaning toilets .
so I realized in that do@@ t@@ com crash that my role in life was to channel A@@ be Mas@@ low .
these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Mas@@ low 's hierarchy of needs .
they did@@ n 't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
so I started asking myself the question : how can we get leaders to start valu@@ ing the intangible ?
and he 's a very wise man , and he said , " Li@@ sten , Bhutan 's goal is not to create happiness .
their religion , their isolation , their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their GN@@ H movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have .
this is a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote .
so how do we do that ?
we 're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same .
we 'd sk@@ ied 400 miles . we were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole , and we 'd run out of time .
and it 's always dri@@ fting . the pack ice is always dri@@ fting .
last year , blog@@ ging live from an expedition that 's been described as 10 times as dangerous as E@@ ve@@ rest .
she started c@@ rying . she asked me to call her back .
this was the last day I had on the ice .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I think if I 've learned anything , it 's this : that no one else is the authority on your potential .
lower the mask , dear denti@@ st , lower the mask . "
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay , in this presentation , I 'm going to be putting the right side of your bra@@ ins through a fairly serious workout .
my current work seems to res@@ onate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that I still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on .
the things that interest me when I 'm working are visual structure , surprise and anything that requires fig@@ uring things out .
they have a magazine that they call G@@ 2 .
and pu@@ zz@@ ling it is .
I 've been eating ce@@ real for breakfast all of my life .
to say I wonder is to say I question , I ask .
there 's an implication that orna@@ mental graphics de@@ tract from the seriousness of the content .
believe it or not , I devised this as a tim@@ es@@ aving method .
it did@@ n 't exactly work out that way .
and I specifically wrote four pages that don 't connect .
so I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) So Valentine 's Day is coming up in a couple of days , and these are currently arriving in mail@@ boxes all around the world .
I don 't have that much else to say , but they turned out really well .
and yes , sometimes I 'm sw@@ ay@@ ed by money .
here I am ; I 'm showing you some pretty visu@@ als and talking about aesthe@@ tics .
well , so , for this last year , with the help of Cisco who sponsored me , for some bal@@ my reason , to do this , I 've been looking somewhere else .
most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities .
and as a special treat , he took me to the path@@ ology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders origin@@ ates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observ@@ able behavior .
to diag@@ nose and treat a brain disorder accurately , it would be necessary to look at the brain directly .
started out with my then four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old : " Oh , should buy the k@@ id some LE@@ GO .
that stuff 's cool . "
( la@@ ughter ) I think the box says -- let 's see here -- " 8 to 12 " on it .
the dining room looked like this .
w@@ ow , you guys are great .
and you 're like , " Holy sh@@ it !
( la@@ ughter ) There 's a whole programming language and robo@@ tics tool , so if you want to teach someone how to program , k@@ id , adult , whatever it is .
and the guy that made this , he made a slot machine out of LE@@ GO .
the in@@ sides were LE@@ GO .
and then , just some examples . this stuff really is sculpture .
and don 't k@@ id yourself : some architectural details , incredible organic shapes and just , even , nature out of , again , little blocks .
and this is my house .
anyway , I 'm out of time .
my best friend recently had a baby .
and when I met him , I was in a@@ we of witnessing this tiny , beautiful being enter into our lives .
you know , I wanted him to know that the way we find our strength is through our challenges .
I wanted him to know that we can all do something big when we start small .
so here I am holding little T@@ hel@@ on@@ ious .
start by being a better listen@@ er .
see people .
ask how they are doing and listen to what they say .
start by being a better friend , a better parent , a better child to your parents ; a better si@@ bling , a better lover , a better partner .
start by being a better neighbor .
meet someone you do not know , and get to know them .
the world will say to you , " What are you going to do ? "
do not be afraid to say , " I know I can 't do everything , but I can do something . "
give what you can give , and do what you can do .
peace CA@@ N@@ NOT be shared or created with others if we CA@@ N@@ NOT first generate it within .
find truth beyond the stories you are told .
ask , " Is this fair ? "
do this with forgiveness .
we are all more than our mistakes .
we are all more than who we were yesterday .
the world will say to you , " How do we speak to bias and big@@ o@@ try ? "
when you help just one person to be more secure , a nation is more secure .
those with boats got in their boats and started loading in every woman , man and child they came across .
do you have any advice during these current times ? "
be good to as many people as possible . "
the story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .
the comments began p@@ ouring in , and Ok@@ ol@@ lo@@ h would coll@@ ate them . she would post them .
and two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said , " We could do that , " and in 72 hours , they launched U@@ sha@@ h@@ idi .
and that , that maneu@@ ver called " crisis mapping , " was kicked off in Kenya in January of 2008 .
what Ok@@ ol@@ lo@@ h did would not have been possible without human generosity .
I call it cognitive surplus .
now , that free time existed in the 20th century , but we did@@ n 't get U@@ sha@@ h@@ idi in the 20th century .
that 's the second half of cognitive surplus .
and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we 're getting now .
this is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that , along with U@@ sha@@ h@@ idi .
now I want to stipulate , as the lawyers say , that LO@@ L@@ cats are the stup@@ id@@ est possible creative act .
someone who has done something like this , however medi@@ oc@@ re and thro@@ wa@@ way , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
and someone who makes a LO@@ L@@ cat has already crossed over that gap .
freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
this is a graph from a paper by U@@ ri G@@ nee@@ zy and Al@@ do Rus@@ ti@@ ch@@ ini , who set out to test , at the beginning of this decade , what they called " deterrence theory . "
simple , straightforward , common@@ sen@@ sical -- also , largely un@@ tested .
and so they went and studied 10 day@@ care centers in Ha@@ ifa , Israel .
at pick @@@ -@@ @ up time the teachers , who have been with your children all day , would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back .
meanwhile , the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running er@@ ran@@ ds -- want a little s@@ lack to pick the kids up late .
so G@@ nee@@ zy and Rus@@ ti@@ ch@@ ini said , " How many instances of late pick @@@ -@@ @ ups are there at these 10 day@@ care centers ? "
so they divided the day@@ care centers into two groups .
the white group there is the control group ; they change nothing .
but the group of day@@ care centers represented by the black line , they said , " We are changing this bargain as of right now .
if you pick your k@@ id up more than 10 minutes late , we 're going to add a 10 she@@ kel fine to your bill .
and the minute they did that , the behavior in those day@@ care centers changed .
I mean , how affordable is it to continue to live in subur@@ bia with rising gas prices ?
that basically , the Bo@@ omers want to be able to age in place , and G@@ en Y would like to live an urban lifestyle , but most of their jobs will continue to be out in subur@@ bia .
it 's keeping the lights on .
and it 's just incre@@ mentally , over the last 20 years , built urban@@ ism on top of its parking lots .
sometimes , it 's all at once .
and the w@@ avy line is a path alongside a cre@@ ek that has now been day@@ lit .
one , in a hundred years , transit on all major rail and road corridors .
they are new but trying to look old .
and that 's what we 're trying to preserve when we say , " Save the ocean . heal the ocean . "
they 're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and I believe we shou@@ ld@@ n 't tolerate that either .
they 're a tiny fraction of an inch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
well , there 's a bun@@ ch of things you could do .
Monte@@ rey is one of those .
( la@@ ughter ) Ye@@ sterday , the automotive guys gave us some new insights .
they pointed out that , I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today , they will be steering cars by wire , without all that mechanical stuff .
I mean , look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Con@@ est@@ oga wagon , then on a railroad , then an air@@ plane .
every other form of transportation 's been improved .
the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wil@@ shire Bou@@ lev@@ ard , or Fifth Avenue , or Tokyo , or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their down@@ towns .
he agreed . we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat , carrying 70 pounds of stuff . they love it .
one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted , happened out here in California .
I 'm thinking , " W@@ ow , that was great -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- please lady , don 't say another word . "
I still have to get to the store , and I can 't carry a lot of things . "
they did@@ n 't have to take the 100 @@@ -@@ @ year trip we took .
the Greeks went from the theater of Di@@ ony@@ sus to the Par@@ th@@ en@@ on in their sand@@ als .
that 's Seg@@ way . this is a Sti@@ r@@ ling cycle engine ; this had been confused by a lot of things we 're doing .
and that 's what you see here .
if you add twice as much of it , you have twice as much display .
if you shoot a gun through the middle , nothing happens .
so , that 's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material .
it 's an information processing system .
you can do other things . that 's in 2@@ D . it works in 3D .
it is also recorded for later release where , when and how the user chooses .
just year after year -- and I finally realized the students were showing the kill@@ er app of personal fab@@ rication is products for a market of one person .
so , with that , in turn , 20 million dollars today does this ; 20 years from now we 'll make Star Tre@@ k repl@@ ic@@ ators that make anything .
this is late at , you know , 11 o 'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time .
PD@@ Ps came between main@@ frames and min@@ ic@@ om@@ pu@@ ters .
in the same sense we are now , today , in the min@@ ic@@ om@@ pu@@ ter era of digital fab@@ rication .
computing , communication , energy for the rest of the planet are these top @@@ -@@ @ down mega @@@ -@@ @ projects .
the message coming from the Fa@@ b Lab@@ s is that the other five billion people on the planet are@@ n 't just technical sinks ; they 're sources .
the real opportunity is to harness the inven@@ tive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems .
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe .
we use a modified ink@@ jet printer , and we print geometry .
now , what did we just do ?
but copying behavior is also common in wild animals .
but could copying behavior in wild animals affect entire ecosystems that we humans depend on ?
an in club and an out club was established , and I did@@ n 't even know what the gating test was in the moment .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , honestly , I did@@ n 't mind a C + .
now , how many people here have had an experience similar to that , either at school or the workplace ?
we 're not alone .
we 'd actually done almost no theater .
in@@ still deep trust and mutual respect .
people should feel seen and heard .
it won 't happen .
but we did@@ n 't throw out all the rules of theater altogether .
at Blue School , teachers and parents and students are equal collaborators at the table , intentionally creating a safe space where they can develop a lifelong , joy@@ ful passion for learning .
their process began with a question : what do you need from our community to be happy and productive at school ?
they articulated what took us 20 years to identify .
please excuse me for sitting ; I 'm very old .
and so today , I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents .
others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
if you try to weigh it -- of course it 's very easy to weigh it , and when you eat it , the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface .
so then if you try to ask questions : " what 's the surface of a ca@@ ul@@ if@@ lower ? "
the closer you measure , the longer it is .
the concept of length of coastline , which seems to be so natural because it 's given in many cases , is , in fact , complete fall@@ acy ; there 's no such thing .
now it 's very easy to do .
and I think that my mathematics , surprisingly enough , has been of great help to the surge@@ ons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses , all these bran@@ ching systems , for which there was no geometry .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man 's mind .
and so here I introduce something , the set of rivers of a plane @@@ -@@ @ filling curve .
mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
and it went really well 50 years ago .
it 's so complicated .
and at the same time , certainly in Rwanda , it destroyed the local retail@@ ing industry .
and because we had a good business model , we actually did it , and I watched these women transform on a micro @@@ -@@ @ level .
the genocide happened in 1994 , seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream .
and the good news was that the institution , the banking institution , lasted .
it 's thr@@ illing .
that 's who we talk about when we think about " the poor . "
where we typically work , there 's people making between one and three dollars a day .
a couple of principles : build small .
malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year .
on the distribution side , though , as a world , we have a lot of work to do .
a lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor .
there , I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs .
but at the UN , sometimes things move slowly and they basically said no .
I think about eating a lot and I really love it .
so African agriculture , which is the place of most hunger in the world , has actually fallen precip@@ it@@ ously as hunger has risen .
and in America , a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is , in the last 30 years .
a fifth of kids under two drinks so@@ da .
and so in my lifetime , a lot of what 's happened in the world -- and being a person obs@@ essed with food -- a lot of this has really changed .
some ideas I 've had is like , look , the reality is -- kids in the South B@@ ron@@ x need apples and car@@ ro@@ ts and so do kids in Botswana .
the 30@@ Projec@@ t@@ .org is launched and I 've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start .
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this des@@ pa@@ iring cycle of incarceration continues .
that , I think , is movement .
that , I think , is movement .
this box contains one billion people .
and they will start to buy electric cars .
what about the poorest two billion here ?
here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
every bubble is a country . the size is population .
thank you very much .
on top of that , one of the core principles of J@@ ain@@ ism is something called " non @@@ -@@ @ absolu@@ tism . "
but the most interesting thing to me about N@@ ones is that we 're often spiritual .
( la@@ ughter ) So the first take@@ away for me when I realized I was a N@@ one and had found that information out was that I was@@ n 't alone .
but to be honest , the whole thing for me was kind of we@@ ir@@ d and in@@ conclusive , and in the end , I flew home , even more confused than I already started out .
even if they did@@ n 't believe , they were hed@@ ging their bets .
the second common@@ ality was just as curious , but far more hum@@ bling .
and for love , they all asked for the kind of romantic love , the soul mate that we read about in ep@@ ic romantic no@@ vels , the kind of love that will stay with us till the end of our days .
women are still mi@@ stru@@ sted , sha@@ med , harmed and , in the worst cases , subjected to honor killings if they don 't ble@@ ed on their wedding night .
ESD : like in Indonesia , where women are systematically examined to enter military service .
you may have wondered why we brought a h@@ ula ho@@ op on@@ stage today .
it is different before and after I pun@@ ched it .
( la@@ ughter ) N@@ DB : but the hy@@ men is nothing like a piece of plastic you can wrap around your food , or a seal .
she examined a middle @@@ -@@ @ aged sex worker and concluded that her gen@@ it@@ alia were remin@@ is@@ cent of a teenage vir@@ gin .
you simply CA@@ N@@ NOT look a woman between her legs and read her sexual story .
sexual oppression of women comes from something much deeper than a simple an@@ atom@@ ical misunderstanding about the properties of the hy@@ men .
but we must try .
and the same thing with the atmosphere : if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball , you would get that little sphere of gas on the right .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fuels , have changed the atmosphere greatly .
they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
when the water goes down , they know what to do .
but when it 's something other than water , and their water habitat changes , they don 't have many options .
if you go to the Gulf and you look around , you do see a lot of oil .
you go in along the shore , you can find it everywhere .
it 's really mess@@ y .
and Congres@@ s@@ man Mar@@ key asks , you know , " Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plum@@ es ? "
so this is the Gulf of Mexico ...
you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface , and then it is attacked , because they don 't want the evidence , in my opinion .
tur@@ t@@ les eat it . it gets in the g@@ ills of fish .
I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here .
everybody wanted their deposit back , everybody is fleeing .
he said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dol@@ ph@@ in do that .
and he felt that -- ( S@@ igh ) he felt that it was coming to ask for help .
and some things , I think , will probably come back a little faster .
but these are really high @@@ -@@ @ performance athle@@ tic animals .
if it 's not , it 's certainly affecting their eggs and lar@@ v@@ ae , I would certainly think .
the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways .
I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ ggling examples of total un@@ preparedness that I can even think of .
and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do .
here they are working .
and that lower photo , that 's a bird colony that has been bo@@ omed .
well , as an or@@ ni@@ th@@ ologist , I can tell you that birds fly , and that -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) and that bo@@ oming a bird colony do@@ es@@ n 't do it ; it do@@ es@@ n 't do it .
as far as cleaning them ...
I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident .
I think that this is the result of gross negligence .
BP operated very sl@@ op@@ p@@ ily and very reck@@ lessly because they could .
and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that is supposed to be our government , protecting us .
we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need .
but I think we have to understand where this leak really started from .
so I think that the oil bl@@ ow@@ out , the bank ba@@ il@@ out , the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause .
that 's what it would really mean to be conservative .
so it 's a continued fight .
it 's a historic moment right now .
now are we stuck with this ?
we 're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy .
people who sell us fossil fuels .
we 've been here before with energy , and people saying the economy CA@@ N@@ NOT withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery .
it 's a matter of right and wrong .
the oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
there was no progress , no innovation .
my body 's an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
one goes extin@@ c@@ t for the other to survive .
and I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
it 's a unique human feature .
as Adam Smith said , " No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . "
you can have , as it were , as@@ exual culture .
they teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to off@@ spring .
so O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and axes than Adam .
he can make his own spe@@ ars and axes .
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
if you had to start from scratch , let 's say you go out into the countryside .
the stone ax@@ e was made by someone for himself .
but a modern tourist going around the palace of Ver@@ sa@@ ill@@ es and looking at Louis XIV 's pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
and the reason for that is because there 's a reproductive division of labor .
but I 've got no evidence for that .
they were imagin@@ ative . they buried their dead .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and speci@@ alize ?
they explained that the Gal@@ va@@ o bird is a rare and endangered par@@ rot that 's in terrible , terrible danger .
in fact , I 'll let them tell you a bit more about it .
narr@@ ator : a word about Gal@@ va@@ o , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
the good news about this is that the global community -- again , my Brazilian friends tell me -- is pit@@ ching in to help out .
and if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guys .
and that 's basically what our media is about .
a this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo @@@ -@@ @ coded .
this is a group called Global Vo@@ ices .
this is a team of blog@@ gers from around the world .
they look for the most interesting content in the English language .
who 's going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
I don 't think this is necessarily an algorith@@ mic process .
he is a bridge figure .
I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
when you 're a lat@@ ec@@ om@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpe@@ tual frustration .
there 's a fu@@ zz@@ y category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lum@@ ped together .
it was just a story .
in the end , stories move like whir@@ ling der@@ v@@ ishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
it shows a U.S. soldier laugh@@ ing at people dying .
what would you say to that ?
it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that 's our hope .
ca : ye@@ ah . have you had information from inside BP ?
the 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Kor@@ an , things like generosity and mercy and fore@@ sight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about .
the concept centers on something called the No@@ or stones .
he said , " Na@@ if , Islam and cartoon ?
( la@@ ughter ) So fl@@ ur@@ ry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times .
they don 't know , OK , and they 're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them .
Jab@@ bar : D@@ ana , I can 't do this without you .
you can tell by the glasses there .
in a world like that , they 'll always be a job for Super@@ man and The 99 .
but there are people all the way .
and you can see how South Korea is making a very , very fast advancement , whereas Brazil is much slower .
they c@@ ached all the oil ; they got all the money ; but health CA@@ N@@ NOT be bought at the supermarket .
and Sheikh Z@@ ay@@ ed did that in a fairly good way .
why are we not using the data we have ?
there are some web pages like this , you know , but they take some nour@@ ishment down from the databases , but people put prices on them , stupid passwords and b@@ oring statistics .
it 's not a new database that you need .
so we started a non@@ profit venture linking data to design , we called " G@@ ap@@ min@@ der , " from the London Under@@ ground , where they warn you , " M@@ ind the gap . "
it took some person years , and we have produced anim@@ ations .
we are liber@@ ating UN data , some few UN organization .
we need really to see it .
and the thing would be to get up the databases free , to get them se@@ archa@@ ble , and with a second click , to get them into the graphic formats , where you can instantly understand them .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let 's start with the planets .
so , what have we learned ?
in fact , even back during the an@@ ci@@ ents , the Solar System in that sense would look on a diagram like this .
now the total planet number in our solar system was nine .
the small planets dominated , and there was a certain harmony to that , which actually C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us was very happy to note , and Ke@@ pl@@ er was one of the big proponents of .
in the next 15 years , almost 500 planets were discovered or@@ biting other stars , with different methods .
we need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that .
on one hand , on the left bank of the river , are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .
we don 't want to go blind because there 's too many possibilities , and there is not too much lab , and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .
so why should you care about that ?
would that make us more responsible for what is happening today ?
it is un@@ imagin@@ ably small .
we can 't imagine it .
life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent , parent and off@@ spring .
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
our brain is made up of billions of active ne@@ ur@@ ons , around 17@@ 0,000 km of combined ax@@ on length .
when these ne@@ ur@@ ons interact , the chemical reaction em@@ its an electrical impulse , which can be measured .
EE@@ G measurements typically involve a hair@@ net with an array of sensors , like the one that you can see here in the photo .
( appl@@ ause ) So the device that you see is a 14 @@@ -@@ @ channel , high @@@ -@@ @ f@@ idel@@ ity EE@@ G acquisition system .
so facial expressions -- as I mentioned before in emotional experiences -- are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for person@@ alization .
so what you want to do -- at least with movement @@@ -@@ @ based actions , we do that all the time , so you can visu@@ alize it .
and the great thing about it is that we 've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about " disappear . "
now bl@@ ink left to turn back left .
but I saw parents on social media reaching out to other parents , asking if their au@@ ti@@ stic children could play together .
I don 't have that many Facebook friends .
well , it goes back to that research paper I was talking about .
respect goes a long way .
they want to learn when they feel safe and happy .
I 've seen it .
the celebr@@ ant got some of the facts wrong , and it made me really angry .
( la@@ ughter ) In Australia , you have three options .
and I am pleased to report that innovation has touched the world of cor@@ pse disposal .
I 've actually bought a plot in the rose garden next to my d@@ ad .
well , I was hungry .
we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing men@@ isc@@ us car@@ til@@ age to reg@@ row that in a patient 's knee .
what about getting to a total bi@@ ologic knee replacement , not just the parts ?
we 're going to rebuild your knee with the parts .
it is essential for success .
here , I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries , who had all faced the challenge of transi@@ tioning to a more democratic and capit@@ alistic society .
combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better , and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters .
in a study I conducted with Sim@@ ona Bo@@ tti and K@@ ris@@ tina Or@@ f@@ ali , American and French parents were interviewed .
they could not imagine turning that choice over to another , even though having made that choice made them feel trapped , guilty , angry .
in a number of cases they were even clin@@ ically depressed .
when it comes to choice , we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narr@@ atives .
thank you .
and one was called " Ballet S@@ lip@@ pers . "
the other lady tells me to wear " Ad@@ orable . "
they are loaded with toxic chemicals in their body , hundreds of compounds , all kinds of compounds -- it 's st@@ agg@@ ering .
it 's called Se@@ als as Sen@@ tin@@ els .
and there 's quite a complicated path@@ way for that because , as these products age , they get concentrated in dust , and then they also get thrown out , so they go to the land@@ fills .
but lo and behold , I 'm one of the high @@@ -@@ @ end individuals .
and as you know , there 's been a very weak response , up until recently , to actually collect the oil .
if you disper@@ se , the sea grass and the cor@@ als are getting hit pretty hard , but you 're saving the man@@ gro@@ ve .
and actually , one of our federal officials said that it was probably heat stress . so ...
so it actually ha@@ st@@ ens oil getting into the body easily and readily .
and with the Co@@ re@@ x@@ it and the oil , there 's zero percent fertil@@ ization .
with oil alone , there 's 98 percent fertil@@ ization .
and we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture .
that 's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects .
but my bad dreams go like this .
and the g@@ ills are quite sensitive .
and I think , personally , that we have not begun to see the impacts of this spill on the wildlife of the Gulf .
which means that somebody gets wi@@ ped out , and then everything above that 's eating those guys will crash .
obviously the plan@@ k@@ ton , the plan@@ k@@ ti@@ vo@@ res , and that 's about as far as we got .
that was it .
they define what the system is .
if you can see the complexity , you can see how tiny , little ed@@ dies and large ed@@ dies and the motion -- this is just sea surface temperature , but it 's immen@@ sely complicated .
and many of you remember the early stages of oce@@ an@@ ography , when we had to use what we had at our fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps .
and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites .
it 's a full spectrum of tools .
there are emerging technologies throughout the field around oce@@ an@@ ography , which we will incorporate into oce@@ an@@ ography , and through that convergence , we will transform oce@@ an@@ ography into something even more magical .
we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything , like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data .
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species .
Don 't worry , I 'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes .
one possibility is , in some sense , it 's not really our fault .
and of course , if we are put in environments where we can 't deal with it , in some sense makes sense that we actually might m@@ ess certain things up .
but there 's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying , which is , maybe it 's not our environments that are mess@@ ed up .
this is a h@@ int that I 've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors .
the good news about Hol@@ ly though is that she do@@ es@@ n 't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .
my students and I got very excited about this a few years ago .
you know , where are we actually going to start with this ?
maybe we should look at mon@@ key 's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dum@@ b things that we do .
it do@@ es@@ n 't look like much -- in fact , it is@@ n 't like much .
and so you see one of our mon@@ keys , May@@ day , up here doing this .
but he too wa@@ its pati@@ ently , gets his food and goes on .
is this a market at all , or did we just do a we@@ ir@@ d psych@@ ologist 's trick by getting mon@@ keys to do something , looking smart , but not really being smart .
they dressed differently ; they were different people .
and you can see that each of the experi@@ men@@ ters is actually holding up a little , yellow food dish .
one thing we never saw in the mon@@ key marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know , just like our own species .
this seems like a good bet . I 'm going to go with that .
they actually tend to go a little risky .
and so this is what we did , we gave the mon@@ keys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time .
and so we ran a second version of this .
because we 've answered the question we started out with .
I heard about this lake , Lake Im@@ ja .
I put on my iPod , I listened to some music , I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hur@@ led myself into that water .
I could barely breathe .
and luc@@ k@@ ily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gas@@ p of air .
and I don 't where I got it from , but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake .
I 've heard it said that dro@@ w@@ ning is the most peaceful death that you can have .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
this is the time to swim with real hum@@ ility .
the warning signs are all there .
when I was born , the world 's population was 3.5 billion people .
we 're now 6.8 billion people , and we 're expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 .
and then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
now , if you get a Ph.D. , and you decide not to teach , you don 't always end up in a place like this .
it 's a choice . you might end up driving a tax@@ ic@@ ab .
we did our first million @@@ -@@ @ dollars @@@ -@@ @ worth of trade by buying on 30 days and selling on 21 .
we were attacking the wrong driver .
we needed to be working on beef .
he said , " You can 't wake a person who 's pre@@ tending to sleep . "
population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet , and right now , it 's a simple " not equal . "
they were consuming what they were consuming -- let 's say one unit of consumption each .
and then we need to use less again .
ok@@ ay , so let 's be generous .
how do you get informed ?
from a greenhouse gas perspective , is lam@@ b produced in the U.@@ K.
it 's got to be something we all care about .
and we need coll@@ usion .
we need to focus on the where , the what and the who .
we have to work in these places .
let 's see , that 's about 7,000 languages , 350 major languages -- a lot of work there .
I don 't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively .
so , we went through our 15 commodities .
we lined them up side @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ side , and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those .
in sal@@ mon aquaculture , we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago .
we eventually got , I think , 60 percent of global production at the table and 25 percent of demand at the table .
three of the original eight entities were su@@ ing each other .
in the last 18 months , we 've signed agreements with 40 of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain .
and in the next 18 months , we will have signed up to work with another 40 , and we think we 'll get those signed as well .
we 're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table .
the study shows that the highest net present value for palm oil is on land that 's been degraded .
thank you .
this is to illustrate what it would look like if a bun@@ ch of species were not related to each other at all .
everything lines up nearly perfectly .
they 're all relatives of each other .
but now check out where they go on our tree of life .
if these things wanted to colon@@ ize our thro@@ ats and make us sick , they would get mus@@ cl@@ ed out by fast @@@ -@@ @ growing stre@@ p@@ to@@ coc@@ cus before they could even initiate cell division .
they never get over@@ grown by wee@@ ds .
maybe they looked at all that food we offered them and said , " Than@@ ks , I 'm going to speed up so much that I 'm going to make a new cell next century .
but I want to start with what I call the " official do@@ g@@ ma . "
and those days are gone .
and if -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) if by some chance you haven 't seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon , you will .
these are important questions to answer .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) There is one corner , by the way , that I 'm not going to tell anybody about , where the WiFi actually works .
we can go to watch our k@@ id play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip and our Black@@ berry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our l@@ aps .
should I respond to this email ? should I draft this letter ? "
I 'll give you one very dramatic example of this , a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
[ and lastly , for all eternity , French , bl@@ eu cheese or ran@@ ch ? ] ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) You really want to get the decision right if it 's for all eternity , right ?
do you want them di@@ stressed ?
( la@@ ughter ) He had no idea what that was .
now , as a policy matter -- I 'm almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people 's lives be improved , but ours would be improved also .
if you shat@@ ter this fish@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction .
many of you have been there . it 's not the real China .
he was delighted .
the entire center was filled with girls like her .
we don 't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed .
you know , childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event .
let me tell you about Ma@@ ha@@ bu@@ ba .
the villagers thought she was cursed ; they did@@ n 't know what to do with her .
actually , she had never been to school , not to a l@@ ick , one day .
he@@ if@@ er sent two go@@ ats to Africa .
one of them ended up with Be@@ at@@ rice 's parents , and that go@@ at had tw@@ ins .
( la@@ ughter ) And that go@@ at was $ 120 .
you know , the criticism is fair ; it is@@ n 't easy .
you know , people say how half of all water well projects , a year later , are failed .
he sort of m@@ um@@ bled .
one year , all the chick@@ ens died , and no one wanted to put the chick@@ ens in there .
so , here 's the cause .
thank you very much .
and so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech .
now , this tech incorporates three big elements .
now , you notice he 's sitting .
you 're actually sculp@@ ting a human being here .
how do you sk@@ im stones ?
again , all of this is done in the way us humans do things , and that 's cru@@ cially important if we want Mil@@ o to appear real .
try hitting the boat .
PM : that 's Dim@@ it@@ ri at his most competitive .
now beaten an 11 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child . well done .
Mil@@ o : what do they want to come here for anyway ?
we don 't know anyone .
that means Mil@@ o 's mind , as millions of people use it , will get s@@ mar@@ ter and cle@@ ve@@ rer .
this is the story of the rise and rise of stand @@@ -@@ @ up com@@ edy in the Middle East -- a stand @@@ -@@ @ up uprising , if you will .
and wherever they went , they killed .
I had four phases to this plan .
first , the A@@ xis guys recorded a Com@@ edy Central special that ai@@ red in the States , and it was getting great hits on YouTube .
I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed to showcase his new A@@ xis special to a packed room .
and one more thing : no , don 't F it up . "
I 'd say , watch any successful well @@@ -@@ @ written , family @@@ -@@ @ friendly sit@@ com in the West for your answers .
in Jordan , we had His Majesty the King come and see them .
so clearly , from the inside , we are doing our best to change our image , and it 's explo@@ ding .
well , if you 're used to listening to com@@ edi@@ ans , then I 'm not surprised .
( la@@ ughter ) Three : is the Middle Eastern character being played by one ?
for inspiration , go to one of our festivals , go online , drop us a line .
now , being Iranian @@@ -@@ @ American presents its own set of problems , as you know .
he goes , " What is your grand@@ father 's name ? "
he says , " You wait . I 'll be back , " and he walked away .
( la@@ ughter ) Li@@ ke , I think you 're missing the point here .
if I want the money , why would I kill myself ? "
that 's what I try and show in my stand @@@ -@@ @ up , good people everywhere .
like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York , there was a Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .
now I 'll tell you , as a Middle @@@ -@@ @ Eastern male , when you show up around a lot of these activities , you start feeling guilty at one point .
my question is : why would you take credit for a failed car bombing ?
" we just want to say : we tried . "
( la@@ ughter ) " And furthermore ...
my name 's Se@@ th Pri@@ e@@ bat@@ s@@ ch . I 'm the chief nin@@ ja of SC@@ V@@ NG@@ R .
before we jump into that , there 's a question of : why is this important ?
they own half a billion people .
so , the social layer is all about these connections .
so like I said , the way you go through and build on the game layer is not with glass and steel and cement .
so I had just recently dropped out of Prin@@ ce@@ ton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and I saw these happy hour things all over the place .
they have these G@@ low@@ C@@ aps which flash and email you and do cool things to remind you to take your medicine .
and here , we have a game that people play .
over the years , online , we 've laid down a huge amount of information and data , and we irrig@@ ate it with networks and connectivity , and it 's been worked and til@@ led by unpaid workers and governments .
but if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way , interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed .
what rises twice a year , once in Easter and then two weeks before Christmas , has a mini peak every Monday , and then fl@@ atten@@ s out over the summer ?
and here 's my visual C.@@ V.
I started as a program@@ mer , and then I worked as a writer for many years , about 20 years , in print , online and then in advertising , and only recently have I started designing .
then you have touch , which is about the speed of a USB key .
and then you have poor old taste , which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator .
the eye is exquis@@ itely sensitive to patterns in variations in color , shape and pattern .
so , you have the eye , and then you drop in the concepts .
but is it true that America has the biggest military budget ?
that changes the picture considerably .
but of course , China has an enormous population .
take a look at this one .
should I take vitamin C ? should I be taking whe@@ at@@ grass ?
this is a visu@@ alization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements .
so you can immediately ap@@ prehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity , but you can also , if you grade the evidence , do a " worth it " line .
so heart is filtered out , so I can see if I 'm curious about that .
so the data is now alive ; this is a living image , and I can update it in a second .
and it feels just incredibly cool to do that .
so we can have a look .
it is the best place on the planet , many say , to study the history of climate change .
there , about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin , the Des@@ ert Research Institute in Nev@@ ada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming .
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures ?
their entire camp , every item of gear , was fer@@ ried 8@@ 85 miles from Mc@@ Mur@@ do Station , the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica .
this process requires extraordinary precautions .
eventually , my mom took the red cra@@ yon away , so it was [ unclear ] .
and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dra@@ gon and this enormous hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ale was like something out of a science @@@ -@@ @ fiction movie .
it 's just incredible ; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that .
but instead , we stick a camera in the deep ocean , and we see a fish , and it do@@ es@@ n 't capture our imagination as a society .
it 's not an animal we draw carto@@ ons of or draw at all .
he 's like an underwater Spi@@ der@@ man .
and he does manage to find them , but great navigation skills , l@@ ous@@ y pick @@@ -@@ @ up lines .
and so I killed a character that 's been in the newspaper for 15 years .
this is what I love about com@@ ic strips , you know .
and he clic@@ ks the " buy now " button .
and they turn up the lights .
and you realize where you are ; you 're in the Lou@@ v@@ re .
it 's a quite wonder@@ fully designed animal .
they have evolved over mill@@ enn@@ ia .
now that very idea , I think , strikes terror in many people , or anger , or anxiety of one sort or another .
it 's the one policy proposal that I make in the book , at this time , when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make .
and this should be presented fac@@ tually , straight@@ for@@ war@@ dly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
and as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
democracy depends on informed consent .
one review@@ er for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it " total@@ itarian . "
they could out@@ source all their problems : protection from pre@@ dat@@ ors , food @@@ -@@ @ finding ...
and why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lan@@ ce@@ t flu@@ ke that was needed to get into the bel@@ ly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .
here 's what he said : " ten thousand years ago , at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebr@@ ate land@@ mass . "
this is a million people gathering on the banks of the Gan@@ ges in 2001 , perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever , as seen from satellite photograph .
here 's a big crowd .
the ant is@@ n 't alone .
I wish he could do this with a revision , a Mark 2 version of his book .
but that , as I said , is just a difference of opinion .
there might be some way of treating that as true .
well , the sense of which I agree with him , except I think it has an evolutionary explanation .
( sigh@@ s ) " Don 't ever argue with the De@@ vil .
you 've got a reasonable objection to it ?
bap@@ tize them in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , and teach them to do everything I 've told you . ' " the Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world .
if you are like me , you know many wonderful , committed , engaged a@@ the@@ ists , ag@@ nos@@ tics , who are being very good without God .
this is an early @@@ -@@ @ on photograph -- you can see , we had these g@@ ush@@ ers .
they we@@ ren 't farmers , they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground .
it 's the " Be@@ ver@@ ly h@@ ill@@ bil@@ lies , " basically .
and we 've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CE@@ Os .
they really influence people .
it also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act , the Clean Air Act , the Clean Water Act .
here we are normally ; we 're standing at the gas pump , and we 're feeling kind of helpl@@ ess .
but it 's also really important that we don 't get distr@@ acted by the theater or the morals of it .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business -- they 're entrepreneurs . they don 't actually want to be doing what they 're doing .
we need to focus on reducing the oil .
and the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign , very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack .
and so this -- you can see that you 're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax .
with this whole sort of suite of policies , we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent by 2020 .
and they need to know so much , yet most lack knowledge on livestock disease prevention and treatment .
apart from shared experiences , trial and error , conventional farming extension services are boots on the ground and radio -- expensive and hard to scale in the face of population growth .
by the end of this year , we 'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions .
thank you .
we 'll start with something very simple -- New@@ ton 's Law : " the force equals mass times acceleration . "
and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for por@@ n on the Web , it 's very few .
so luc@@ k@@ ily , the science -- no , sorry -- the marketing is getting easier .
what this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning , and it will strengthen it , but it will not conclu@@ sively prove it .
it only took one robust observation from C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us to blow that idea out of the water .
take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident .
it 's a beautiful piece of fil@@ m@@ making , but everything is des@@ olate , everything is dead .
and I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been compl@@ icit in creating this vision of the future .
and any psych@@ ologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism .
a de@@ er free@@ zes very , very still , po@@ ised to run away .
and I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
come on . in the Western world , we have enough .
I believe , if Kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile .
and actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world .
we want to be healthy and live a full life .
and what we do , is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens .
that should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
but we have to remember that there 's a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet 's resources we use .
it is an efficiency measure .
more is bad .
we want to be top left , where good lives don 't cost the earth .
that is longer than in the USA .
and they invested in social programs -- health and education .
( la@@ ughter ) The challenge is , that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American , might not be Western European .
it 's actually not very long away .
I think we want it to carry on .
and if we 're going to engage them , I think that 's what we 've got to do .
you put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you 're using right now , how much it 's costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly .
what would that look like for society ?
and so I think it 's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it 's also part of the good news .
we 're the first generation -- thanks to science -- to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it .
on this journey , I 'd like to bring , apart from yourselves , a good friend , a stakeholder , who 's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues , a stakeholder who refuses to compromise -- planet Earth .
the trouble is we 're putting a quad@@ ru@@ ple sq@@ ee@@ ze on this poor planet , a quad@@ ru@@ ple sq@@ ee@@ ze , which , as its first squee@@ ze , has population growth of course .
the majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority , the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial band@@ wagon in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 18th century .
well , the evidence is , unfortunately , ample .
the system suddenly , very surprisingly , loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover .
in fact , you 're not even allowed to stand where this gent@@ l@@ eman is standing , at the fo@@ aming , slip@@ per@@ y waters at the threshold .
together , these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the An@@ thro@@ po@@ cen@@ e , understanding that the planet is a complex self @@@ -@@ @ regulating system .
in fact , most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three Mus@@ ke@@ teers , " One for all . all for one . "
this is a new paradigm .
the Australian Great Barri@@ er Re@@ ef is another success story .
but again , a crisis , new partnerships , actors locally , transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning .
but even on the hard policy area we have innovations .
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy , but you can subsidi@@ ze electricity to poor people .
you solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector , while at the same time , stimulating innovation -- examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level .
so there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here , and we can list many , many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet .
TD : from the time I was very young , onward , I was given a lot of different responsibilities , and it always seemed to me , when I was young , that everything was laid out before me .
and these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel .
I was separated , largely , from my family , including my mother and father .
when I was 14 , I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father , my relatives , my friends and my homeland .
but nevertheless , there 's no real sense of separation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that I feel for these people .
so it 's an interesting parad@@ ox at play there .
because how we deal with our inner world drives everything .
at school , I dri@@ f@@ ted from science to mathematics to history to biology , as my father sli@@ pped from the world .
we felt , as a family , financially and emo@@ tionally rav@@ aged .
it 's a ty@@ ran@@ ny .
( la@@ ughter ) Only dead people never get stressed , never get broken hearts , never experience the disappointment that comes with failure .
neither of us knew that in 10 short years , he would be gone .
and in seeing yourself .
it costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid .
it 's wireless , and that revolution is about solar and it 's about distributed solar .
I 'm not sure what the kids feel about that .
the idea that she 's co@@ ined is the energy lad@@ der .
it starts , again , with a light@@ bulb . right ?
they 're retail companies , so they 're taking products out to people in the connecting markets .
so an extraordinary thing is happening out there that 's worth recognizing .
and it 's the ability to have powerful tools .
so just listen to this .
help us understand , what are the key road@@ blocks right now ?
like , what could make this go faster ?
in my mind , this might be the biggest le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g of them all .
and thank you for all you 're doing and for sharing that vision so power@@ fully .
everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal .
ideally you would not be satisfied until you 'd actually done the work .
and then because you 've felt that satisfaction , you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary .
so , let 's look at the proof .
positioning satellites tell us where we are by telling us where they are .
these stories that I 've shared with you all illustrate that space truly is useful for sustainable development for the benefit of all peoples .
but we have more work to do , because there are still barriers that exclude people from space and limit the impact of this technology .
this strange @@@ -@@ @ looking plant is called the L@@ la@@ ret@@ a .
it was@@ n 't until later , when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project .
so it was the slow ch@@ ur@@ n , if you will .
so what you 're looking at here is the rh@@ iz@@ ocar@@ p@@ on geograph@@ ic@@ um , or map lic@@ hen , and this is around 3,000 years old and lives in Greenland , which is a long way to go for some lic@@ hen@@ s .
but luc@@ k@@ ily , it worked out obviously , but it was a hum@@ bling experience to feel so disconnected .
it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet .
and what you 're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon .
so this strategy has served it pretty well -- it 's 2,400 years old .
this is a Bra@@ in Cor@@ al living in Tobago that 's around 2,000 years old .
this is at about 60 feet or 18 meters , depth .
and you 'll see , there 's some damage to the surface of the coral .
this is cl@@ onal colony of qu@@ aking As@@ pen trees , living in U@@ tah , that is literally 80,000 years old .
( la@@ ughter ) This is a cl@@ onal tree as well .
so we don 't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them .
and we saw a number of them , and this is most likely the oldest .
you can see that this one has names car@@ ved into its trunk , but it also records some natural events .
this plant is called the Wel@@ wit@@ sch@@ ia , and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola , where it 's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from m@@ ist coming off the sea .
it 's a primitive con@@ if@@ er .
and it 's one -- again , that interconnected root system , making it one genetically identical individual .
it 's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things , because if the per@@ ma@@ frost mel@@ ts , it won 't survive .
well , that 's kind of an obvious statement up there .
the children barely went to school , they did@@ n 't know any English -- they 'd never seen a computer before , and they did@@ n 't know what the internet was .
after this , we noticed a couple of interesting things , which you 'll see .
this is the first experiment that we did -- eight year @@@ -@@ @ old boy on your right teaching his student , a six year @@@ -@@ @ old girl , and he was teaching her how to browse .
I gave them a computer with a speech @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ text interface , which you now get free with Windows , and asked them to speak into it .
( la@@ ughter ) And I left .
( la@@ ughter ) So they could do that on their own .
( la@@ ughter ) The second thing he said was that , " If children have interest , then education happens . "
( video ) Arthur C. Clar@@ ke : and they can definitely help people , because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them .
Su@@ g@@ ata Mit@@ ra : I took the experiment to South Africa .
they 'd say , " This is very b@@ oring . "
so I found that they had a friend , a local accoun@@ tant , a young girl , and they played football with her .
I asked that girl , " W@@ ould you teach them enough biotechnology to pass ? "
I said , " Well , what you 've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time .
what is that ? can you do that again ? can you show me some more ? ' " she did that for two months .
in G@@ at@@ es@@ head , I took 32 children and I started to fine @@@ -@@ @ tune the method .
remember , from the H@@ ole in the Wall .
you can go to another group , peer over their shoulders , see what they 're doing , come back to you own group and claim it as your own work . "
and I explained to them that , you know , a lot of scientific research is done using that method .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) The children enthusi@@ as@@ tically got after me and said , " Now , what do you want us to do ? "
I gave them six G@@ CS@@ E questions .
the first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes .
when I did the experiment , when I did the test , after two months , the score was 76 percent .
there was photographic recall inside the children , I suspect because they 're discussing with each other .
I can beam them to whichever school I want to .
( video ) Teacher : you can 't catch me .
you say it .
SM : back at G@@ at@@ es@@ head , a 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girl gets into the heart of Hindu@@ ism in 15 minutes .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) It 's pretty simple stuff .
if they want , they can call the gran@@ ny cloud .
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year @@@ -@@ @ old students .
I said , " Well , do it . "
this sent shi@@ vers up my spine .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) SM : so you know what 's happened ?
but in the meanwhile , there is a method available .
I would say with a great smile , " I will definitely pass . "
" Oh , he 's bad at studies , but let him send to the drawing competitions . "
so it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school .
if you travel in Indian trains , you can see people listening to radio and , you know , even from their mobil@@ es .
I said , " It 's a prize from [ an ] art competition . "
I think you should study in a school of art .
so I was working on the line , but instead of working about traces , I started capturing traces .
so this is called " Self In Progress . "
so there is an element of performance , and there is an element of sculpture , and there is an element of feeling one 's self , so close to one 's self .
and then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces .
why the cow was crossing the road , you know .
it 's just created by the mind .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't find it .
this is the work I made out of that material .
will you help me to make this sculpture ? "
they never wrote back to me .
and if they say it 's solid , it will not be solid , it will evapor@@ ate .
we see where it 's b@@ ouncing , but we don 't see [ them ] as they exist .
this is called " Gra@@ vity . "
and to really get to the point , we should move beyond , you know , go to the other side of the wall , like il@@ logic , like are invisible .
it 's about death .
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry .
later , I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban .
and the pin@@ n@@ acle of my career , as it turned out , was when I was posted to New York .
I was exhausted , and I was also di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sioned in a way I cou@@ ld@@ n 't quite put my finger on .
the third reason , I won 't go into .
and so I was in crisis .
so took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cl@@ iff .
and it was a very , very uncomfortable , unpleasant feeling .
18 people were killed .
it was an@@ archy .
and the only way that ramp@@ aging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they 've had enough burning and killing .
and that riot taught me something , which is@@ n 't immediately obvious and it 's kind of a complicated story .
but one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots , which went on for several days , took place -- was because the Kosovo people were dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised from their own future .
we 're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations , which is suppose to culmin@@ ate in Copenhagen .
and we started talking , and he said -- I told him what I was doing , and I told him rather gran@@ dly I was going to establish Independent Diplom@@ at in New York .
independent Diplom@@ at is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world , which is that the world is frag@@ menting .
they may be corporations , they may be ma@@ fi@@ osi , they may be nice NGOs , they may anything , any number of things .
we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world .
if governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world , then that means , who is left to deal with them , who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them ?
the maps they gave us are out of date by years . "
this group , others have called the pro @@@ -@@ @ ams , amateur artists doing work at a professional level .
but I want to be clear , just as the religious Re@@ formation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the pri@@ es@@ thood ; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance .
God knows , if we ever needed that capacity in human history , we need it now .
what frigh@@ tens you ? "
here in Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os , we 're affected by El Nin@@ os and La Nina .
but to answer that question , to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide , you have to know something about all of these other agents of change .
and so that 's what we 've done with this ship .
because it 's partly floating , you can imagine , is sea level rises a little bit , the ice lifts off the bed , and then it can break off and float north .
it took about 10 years to put this project together .
and here 's what we found .
and this is in the past four million years .
nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice She@@ et was this dynamic .
then there was similar mortality in ' 97@@ - ' 98 .
so these events in our recent past really are unique .
here 's how we sample the cor@@ als .
this coral is eight meters tall , right .
the core comes up as these cylin@@ dr@@ ical tubes of lime@@ stone .
and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it .
then after we harvest a coral , we measure this ratio , and now you can see , those curves match perfectly .
in this case , at these islands , you know , cor@@ als are instrumental @@@ -@@ @ quality rec@@ orders of change in the water .
it 's not just my group ; there 's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
but they all tell us what the natural variability is .
there are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbon@@ ate -- plants and animals both .
and here 's the thing : you have to go back about 15 million years to find a time when CO2 levels were about what they are today .
that 's the reason that they 're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that 's going on right now .
and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear .
and it 's important to note that it 's not just the stars who are benefiting : because you can see the best , everyone can learn .
and if you can get that wheel to turn , look out .
ok@@ ay , step back a minute .
even he said that , and he would know .
it 's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation .
for the past 15 years , powerful communities have been connecting online , spar@@ king off each other .
but what 's key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared dig@@ it@@ ally -- a picture , a music file , software .
this is the technology that 's going to allow the rest of the world 's talents to be shared dig@@ it@@ ally , thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd @@@ -@@ @ accelerated innovation .
if it 's all pu@@ pp@@ ies , por@@ n and piracy , we 're doomed .
video is high @@@ -@@ @ bandwidth for a reason .
here , let me introduce you to Sam Hab@@ er .
and I have to tell you , as a former publisher of hob@@ by@@ ist magazines , I find this str@@ ang@@ ely beautiful .
face @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ face communication has been fine @@@ -@@ @ tun@@ ed by millions of years of evolution .
that 's what 's made it into this mysterious , powerful thing it is .
print scaled .
for the first time in human history , talented students don 't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by l@@ ous@@ y teachers .
now , TED is just a small part of this .
now , is it possible to imagine a similar process to this , happening to global education overall ?
why not a self @@@ -@@ @ fu@@ eling cycle in which we all can participate ?
schools can 't be si@@ los .
let 's start with day and night .
and so plants and animals developed their own internal cl@@ ocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
so , no matter how at@@ y@@ pical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal cl@@ ocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
and in @@@ -@@ @ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of med@@ itative quiet in bed .
so , cut to the modern day .
and this spreads on out end@@ lessly into a distance .
so one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predic@@ ting epidemics .
and if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you 'll know where the epidemic was today .
but what I 'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic , but also actually early detection of an epidemic .
because , as I said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
now if you look at a network like this -- this is 105 people .
for instance , sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties .
we took 1,300 randomly selected under@@ graduates , we had them nominate their friends , and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic .
the epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left , over here .
and if you look at this image -- here we are now in September the 13th -- you 're going to see a few cases light up .
it CA@@ N@@ NOT be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .
and the answer is no .
this is a map of eight million phone users in a European country .
or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway , and the phone company can see , as the velocity is slowing down , that there 's a traffic j@@ am .
the first string is the dr@@ one string , which plays a continuous sound like the bag@@ pipe .
( audience : yes . ) Carol@@ ine Phil@@ lips : I did@@ n 't hear you . would you like to hear it ? ( audience : yes ! ) CP : ok@@ ay .
( music ) Than@@ k you . thank you .
it 's used in paint for the texture , but also for the gl@@ os@@ sin@@ ess .
you would be shar@@ per and more alert .
so it 's not an accident that a great flow@@ ering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee .
it 's something that happens often in a wonderful , illuminating moment .
that 's really where innovation happens .
this is what your office should look like , it 's part of my message here .
I call this the " slow hun@@ ch . "
( la@@ ughter ) " C@@ ould you just give me some time to do that ? "
now a couple of companies like Google have innovation time off , 20 percent time .
it 's October of 1957 , and S@@ pu@@ t@@ nik has just launched .
we should record it . "
I want you to take a trip with me .
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .
you go in for a test and you find out that you 're pregnant , and you 're delighted .
these mothers , we call them ment@@ or mothers , are able to engage women who , just like themselves , pregnant with babies , have found out about being HIV @@@ -@@ @ positive , who need support and education .
they 're hired -- they 're paid as professional members of the health care teams , just like doctors and nurses .
imagine that : a woman , a former patient , being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she 's taking care of .
in Africa , it 's very , very hard to engage men .
the father and the mother , together , they get the results .
the hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction .
and everybody was quiet .
the second , communities -- empowering women .
our health care systems are broken .
and so in re@@ defining the health care teams by bringing the ment@@ or mothers in , we can do that .
it was at that point , just the spark of an idea .
referen@@ cing Ste@@ ven Johnson 's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from , I was in the shower at the time -- I was alone .
mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV .
it 's transform@@ ational .
they have education programs .
it 's quite extraordinary what they do .
and once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children 's Cho@@ ir who I simply ad@@ ore .
now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about A@@ vel@@ ile .
so , we may have gotten rid of the no@@ os@@ es , but I still consider it ly@@ n@@ ching when they murder Black boys and leave their bodies for four hours in the sun .
see , there is something about being Black in America that has made motherhood sound like something I 'm not sure I look forward to .
her testimony so deeply impacted me that I found myself constantly asking , what would it mean to mother in the United St@@ ated of America in this skin ?
yesterday , during re@@ hear@@ sal , when I was told that I should " maybe cut the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter portion from my talk , " I found myself fear@@ ful for a moment .
thank you .
on the other hand , we 're humans , we live in a physical world .
so if I download an e @@@ -@@ @ book and it has 20 pages -- well , they could be thin , right ?
( la@@ ughter ) So let me show you the shape @@@ -@@ @ changing mobile .
the shape is the second thing .
the smallest sound you can perceive moves your ear@@ drum just four atomic diame@@ ters .
for example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
it reduces everything down to what 's relevant and it disc@@ ards everything that 's not relevant .
the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time .
I think there 's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hon@@ ia .
it 's not good for you in the long run .
if you 're going to use head@@ phones , buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don 't have to have it so loud .
the Eliz@@ abe@@ th@@ ans described language as decorated silence .
I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design sound@@ s@@ cap@@ es just like works of art .
if you can 't do it yourself , get a professional to do it for you .
it 's been around for thousands of years .
it 's a fantastic anti@@ do@@ te to sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hon@@ ia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , whichever style you enjoy particularly .
some people will say it 's for bi@@ ometric security .
all right : " I 'm more than my genes " -- all together .
and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity -- maybe your personality and your intellec@@ t -- maybe they 're also en@@ coded in the connections between your ne@@ ur@@ ons .
and in fact , we don 't know if this hypothesis is correct , because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it .
finding that wor@@ m connec@@ t@@ ome took over a dozen years of te@@ di@@ ous labor .
and we keep on doing that , sl@@ ice after sl@@ ice .
and so when the green ne@@ ur@@ on wants to communicate , it wants to send a message to the red ne@@ ur@@ on , it sp@@ its out neuro@@ transmit@@ ter .
well , we take this three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gig@@ antic three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional col@@ oring book .
and so I think we 're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuro@@ science : how are the bra@@ ins of men and women different ?
girls ' bra@@ ins are like sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti ; everything in their life is connected to everything else .
or maybe really , really fine cap@@ el@@ lin@@ i with branches .
in the 17th century , the mathemati@@ cian and phil@@ os@@ op@@ her , Bla@@ ise P@@ asc@@ al , wrote of his dre@@ ad of the infinite , his feeling of in@@ significance at contempl@@ ating the vast reaches of outer space .
it 's absurd .
but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connec@@ t@@ ome .
for now , let me try to convince you of the pl@@ au@@ sibility of this hypothesis , that it 's actually worth taking seriously .
second question : what causes these changes ?
do not forget that gro@@ ove in the Earth called the stream bed .
the connections of the brain 's ne@@ ural network determines the pathways along which ne@@ ural activity flows .
so let 's return from the heights of met@@ aph@@ or and return to science .
and if that were successful , that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connec@@ t@@ ome .
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for m@@ is @@@ -@@ @ wiring of the brain .
I mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species .
if it has , there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen bra@@ ins .
one figure for that : 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition .
this is a picture I took in 2005 , walking on Fri@@ days over the hills in Kabul , and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation .
why ?
so , soon after my arrival , I had confirmed something which I had already known ; that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe , yes .
and very often violence is a way to cope with it .
so the key here is em@@ pa@@ thy .
somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .
so everybody must be able to say , " This happened to me , and it did this with me , but I 'm able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it .
eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the Ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan .
graduates are fun@@ n@@ eled through a long , narrow unfor@@ giving path to lic@@ ensure .
now , there are places that make us feel un@@ happy , unhealthy or un@@ inspiring .
but we all should .
the contemporary world was literally built by men who have rarely taken the time to understand how people unlike them experience their designs .
over the past two years I had the opportunity to interview over 100 people from all walks of life about their experience of design .
people like these are invaluable ambassadors for design and yet they are round@@ ly absent from architectural discourse .
other professions , like law and medicine had made far greater strides in these crucial areas .
both become part of your possible .
and yet , in two million years , the human brain has nearly tri@@ pled in mass , going from the one @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ quarter @@@ -@@ @ pound brain of our ance@@ stor here , H@@ abil@@ is , to the almost three @@@ -@@ @ pound me@@ at@@ lo@@ af everybody here has between their ears .
we synthe@@ size happiness , but we think happiness is a thing to be found .
it 's very simple .
they remember their childhood , but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room , when you come back , they don 't know who you are .
but freedom to choose , to change and make up your mind , is the enemy of synthetic happiness , and I 'm going to show you why .
we created a black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white photography course , and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a dar@@ k@@ room .
so we gave them cameras , they went around campus , they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dor@@ m room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of .
they have two gor@@ geous 8 x 10 gl@@ ossi@@ es of meaningful things to them , and we say , " Which one would you like to give up ? "
better yet , I 'll check with you .
in fact , even after the opportunity to swap has expired , they still don 't like their picture .
they can 't be exactly the same .
so the first step : get to the children , get to the mothers , and then follow up with family planning .
so we said , " Let 's do it . "
and no difference , the people they chose were the people we chose .
that was their perception .
we had relay races with condoms , we had children 's condom @@@ -@@ @ blowing championship .
if you 're pregnant , take care of your pregnancy .
if you 're not pregnant , you can take a loan out from us . "
you could call it the C@@ oca @@@ -@@ @ Col@@ a approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing .
but it 's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior .
so I thought , " Well , if you can 't go to the government , go to the military . "
he asked me in because he liked my wife a lot .
so I said , " Ok@@ ay . "
and we said , " Everyone needs to be involved . "
so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don 't work , and dead customers don 't buy .
of course I can . and they 'd enjoy it immen@@ sely ; I see them standing around right now , everywhere .
look at this -- I gave this to Al G@@ ore and to Bill Senior also .
so , that was done .
and these are our Thai t@@ uli@@ ps .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you very much indeed .
this recycling system has been in place for the last billion years .
if you 're in Northern Europe or North America , you can use things like buck@@ wheat hus@@ ks or o@@ at h@@ ul@@ ls .
so , why my@@ cel@@ ium ?
I want to talk to you today about prosperity , about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity .
it 's a dilemma , a dilemma of growth .
in the world I describe to you , we have to be right over here at the right @@@ -@@ @ hand side at six grams of carbon .
it 's a process of the production and reproduction of novel@@ ty , continually ch@@ asing expanding consumer markets , consumer goods , new consumer goods .
this is people expanding debt , drawing down their savings , just to stay in the game .
they want to spend less and save more .
and my , then , five year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter was helping me in the way that five year @@@ -@@ @ olds do .
and these tensions have deep evolutionary roots , so sel@@ fish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -- fight or flight .
we 're actually all hap@@ pier , and a country 's more beautiful , and our lives are better . "
that 's one of our bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in at the Monte@@ rey Bay Aqu@@ arium .
it 's actually got a naked skin for most of its body , so it reduces friction with the water .
this fish was re@@ vered by humankind .
bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on Earth , and this is a gold rush for bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in .
for that , bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in have been given a status equivalent to ti@@ gers , to lions , to certain African ele@@ ph@@ ants and to pan@@ d@@ as .
these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
we don 't know where the structure is .
and then imagine being Bru@@ ce M@@ ate 's team from OS@@ U , getting up close to a blue wh@@ ale and fixing a tag on the blue wh@@ ale that stays , an engineering challenge we 've yet to really overcome .
we 've actually taken a sli@@ ver of the ocean , put it behind glass , and we together have put bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in tuna and yel@@ low@@ f@@ in tuna on display .
what do they like to eat ?
we go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it 's pretty amazing . it feels wonderful .
that 's the closest you 'll probably ever get .
we put water over its g@@ ills , give it oxygen .
now sometimes the tun@@ as are really large , such as this fish off Nan@@ tuc@@ ket .
we 're going to do something that in recent years we 've started : take a m@@ uc@@ us sample .
watch how sh@@ in@@ y the skin is ; you can see my reflection there .
and my favorite scene , three tun@@ as going into the Gulf of Mexico .
they 're coming together . that could be tuna sex -- and there it is .
so we can then predict where management places should be .
places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species , the single population , can be captured .
it 's a several thousand @@@ -@@ @ pound animal .
and we 'll place an acoustic tag that says , " OM@@ SH@@ AR@@ K 10@@ 165 , " or something like that , ac@@ ous@@ tically with a ping .
they get returned , and when they get returned , here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in in blue go across their corridor , returning to the Western Pacific .
these ele@@ phant seals cover half an ocean , take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data .
and then there 's Scot@@ t Sha@@ ffer and our sh@@ ear@@ waters wearing tuna tags , light @@@ -@@ @ based tags , that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monte@@ rey and back , journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before .
we see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on .
we have the technology that 's shown us where it is .
thank you .
there 's a second reason I like these development goals , and that is because each and every one is measured .
that 's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
and there 's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening . "
come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
here you see the data .
it looks nasty , like in college when you did@@ n 't like statistics .
what is the origin of the data ?
what we rely on is not an incomplete system .
this was 1977 , 1988 , 1992 , ' 97 and 2002 .
and when the experts in the U.@@ N.
but in June , I got a mail in my in@@ box from Demographic Health Surve@@ ys , and it showed good news from Kenya .
so what I 'm telling you is that we know the child mortality .
and [ the ] U.@@ N. says it 's a reduction with 1.8 percent .
we in public health , we hate child death , so we want less and less and less of child deaths .
and look here when I take you into my bubble graphs .
and these are the so @@@ -@@ @ called " developing " countries .
welcome to a decent life .
it 's the richest country in the world with Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era .
you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size , even within Africa .
we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don 't stabilize the world population .
thank you very much .
no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal , because it was against the order of nature .
some of them are very well known , like the flow@@ ering .
some of them are much more sophisticated .
and it 's really so gr@@ ac@@ eful ; it 's like a dancing angel .
we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance -- very energ@@ izing -- having in change this transportation of the pol@@ len .
he wrote that , " It 's hardly an exagg@@ eration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . "
the signals that you are seeing here are action potential , are the same signals that the ne@@ ur@@ ons of my brain , of our brain , use to exchange information .
you can remove 90 percent of the Internet and it is [ continuing ] to work .
thank you .
and when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places , I 'm really struck by the things that we have in common .
but I am surprised by one thing that they do have : coca @@@ -@@ @ Col@@ a .
if they can do that , why can 't governments and NGOs do the same thing ?
now Co@@ ke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders , they have to turn a profit .
they 're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent .
coke 's been in Africa since 1928 , but most of the time they cou@@ ld@@ n 't reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .
it do@@ es@@ n 't sound anything like " W@@ av@@ in ' F@@ lag " to me .
people reuse it for a sla@@ b for their home .
( la@@ ughter ) But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diar@@ rhe@@ a ?
( la@@ ughter ) Now , it 's not just a funny head@@ line -- it 's innovative . it 's an innovative marketing campaign .
they 're waiting to be circum@@ c@@ ised .
and when we first heard this result inside the Foundation , I have to admit , Bill and I were scrat@@ ching our heads a little bit and we were saying , " But who 's going to volunteer for this procedure ? "
and polio , I think , is one of the most powerful examples .
but let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you .
let me tell you the story of Sh@@ ri@@ ram , an 18 month boy in Bi@@ har , a northern state in India .
and after the qu@@ ake , we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed , to examine what was safe and what was@@ n 't .
we inspected schools and private resid@@ encies .
adjusted for population density , that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian qu@@ ake .
now there are many groups doing this .
and the fellow in the vest there , Cra@@ ig To@@ ten , he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this .
the way at the bottom is a confined mas@@ onry building , where the walls are tied together , the building is sym@@ metric , and it will stand up to an earthquake .
many feel that voting every few years for leaders disconnected from their daily challenges is poin@@ tless .
international organizations and academic experts define democracy as regular , multi@@ party electoral competition .
this may come as a surprise to those of who think that the only way Africans engage in politics is through the barrel of the gun .
across the continent , protest is not exceptional , but a normal part of life .

Wit@@ t@@ gen@@ stein replied , " Well , what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating ? "
we never evolved to navigate in the world of at@@ oms .
may I introduce Major General Albert Stu@@ b@@ bl@@ eb@@ ine III , commander of military intelligence in 1983 .
but we find real matter comfor@@ ting only because we 've evolved to survive in Middle World , where matter is a useful fiction .
there 's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wa@@ vel@@ ength .
a marble statue could wave its hand at us ; the at@@ oms that make up its crystall@@ ine structure are all vibr@@ ating back and forth anyway .
but the at@@ oms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time , and again and again .
evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very impro@@ b@@ able events ; we don 't live long enough .
one way to think about that is by counting planets .
we 'd be different , our characters would be different , if our ne@@ uro @@@ -@@ @ an@@ atom@@ y and our physiological chemistry were different .
treating people as machines may be scientifically and phil@@ os@@ op@@ hic@@ ally accurate , but it 's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next .
thank you very much .
but that suggests the issue that I 'm trying to get at here , that we have an opportunity to re@@ define what is health .
they share your environmental stres@@ sors , the asbestos levels and lead levels , whatever you 're exposed to .

his brother , R@@ ana , turned to me and said , " No@@ thing has changed . "
" we already for@@ gave you . "
but if some of us begin to wonder about them , listen even to their stories , we learn that participation in oppression comes at a cost .
joy is the gift of love .
we love ourselves when we breathe through the fire of pain and refuse to let it har@@ den into hate .
that 's why I believe that love must be practiced in all three directions to be revolutionary .
we can train our eyes to look upon str@@ angers on the street , on the subway , on the screen , and say in our minds , " Bro@@ ther , sister , a@@ unt , uncle . "
number three : in order to love ourselves , breathe and push .
our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love .
you will tend to the wound in the ones who want to hurt him .
you will teach him how to love himself because you love yourself .
all the points , all the lines -- it 's incredible .
( la@@ ughter ) I put together projects like Earth Sand@@ wich , where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth .
in Youn@@ g@@ me@@ N@@ ow@@ me , the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and re@@ stage it as an adult .
but the truth is life is being lived there .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
and that 's not always going to happen in physical spaces .
" right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom , I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cher@@ ry col@@ a . "
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit .
sometimes they 're a little bit more abstract .
and people called in and left messages like this .
recording : ok@@ ay , here 's something .
and when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry .
so I thought , " Well let 's just give it a try .
some came from the winning party .
" dear 48 , I promise to listen to you , to fight for you , to respect you always . "
it 's amazing .
I was like , " I don 't know .
but what 's awesome is , as I started getting more and more and more of them , all of a sudden I had 30 , 40 voices from around the world .
I just want to say thanks for even considering it . "
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth , because I was@@ n 't doing more , apparently , to make things better .
but more importantly , he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before .
he was talking about strong , smart , hard@@ working entrepreneurs who wo@@ ke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family 's lives better .
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .
and over and over again , as I interviewed them and spent my days with them , I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change .
in fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .
the money came in basically overnight .
we sent it over to Uganda .
because as that happens , I think we can feel free to interact in a way that 's more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
so the mapping of participating in the story , it actually flows with the up and down .
smile , friendly .
if you can cook , nothing can happen to you , because whatever you find , you will try to transform it .
this technology affected two organs , the brain and the gu@@ t , which it actually affected .
if you get a stomach ache , if you get a little bit blo@@ ated , was not the right food , was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong .
it 's a very big signal ; it 's sent to the brain says , " Go and eat . "
you have on your left an olive oil dro@@ ple@@ t , and this olive oil dro@@ ple@@ t gets attacked by enzy@@ mes .

I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia , about one and a half years ago , when their academy honored me with a fellowship .
here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot .
we 've talked about mobility and the rest of it , let 's talk about health .
and he also said , " I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all . "
and therefore , ladies and gent@@ lemen , this is the theme , getting more from less for more .
so you are not talking about low cost , you are talking about ultra @@@ -@@ @ low cost .
and therefore , you 're not talking about incremental innovation , you 're talking about disrup@@ tive innovation .
and by whom ?
[ in the ] 20th century , we gave G@@ and@@ hi to the world .
it has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century .
to understand power diffusion put this in your mind : computing and communications costs have fallen a thous@@ and@@ fold between 1970 and the beginning of this century .
but to make it more real , if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power , you could buy a car today for five dollars .
now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically , the barriers to entry go down .
so in 1970 , if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasi@@ lia and anywhere simultaneously , you could do it .
but to be able to do it , you had to be very rich -- a government , a multinational corporation , maybe the Catholic Church -- but you had to be pretty wealthy .
now the problem is that we 're not thinking about it in very innovative ways .
and we have to think much more in terms of narr@@ atives and whose narrative is going to be effective .
and president Medvedev of Russia , for example , pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of United States power .
let me give you an example from history .
and the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear .
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we 're going to be able to manage this process .
wars persist . power persists .
all this still persists .
restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replen@@ ish the ocean and to encourage its resili@@ ency .
but what if we eat only in the green list ?
we have lost this sen@@ sibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
while we try to manage declining marine populations , the media 's recommending increased consumption of seafood .
but it 's not all about the seafood .
people got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
it 's like a han@@ go@@ ver from protein .
there 's no escap@@ ing the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
we 've seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
science is made by humans , and as human beings , even if we try hard , we CA@@ N@@ NOT get rid of our emotions .
and this is what I , as a chem@@ ist , have in mind when I think about them .
no males at all .
those ap@@ hi@@ ds sec@@ re@@ te a stic@@ ky , sug@@ ary liquid called hon@@ ey@@ dew , and this just cl@@ og@@ s the upper parts of the plant .
and here you can see this paras@@ ite in action , like in an ac@@ rob@@ atic maneu@@ ver .
and after a few days , depending upon temperature , the egg will hat@@ ch and the lar@@ va of this paras@@ ite will eat the ap@@ hid from the inside .

what 's clear is that there will be significant change .
as productivity increases , incomes rise and demand grows .
they 've fallen for the intelligence myth , the belief that machines have to copy the way that human beings think and reason in order to out@@ perform them .
and with a professor called Phil@@ lip Cap@@ per and a legal publisher called Bu@@ tter@@ wor@@ ths , they produced the world 's first commercially available artificial intelligence system in the law .
think how often you hear people say to you machines can only perform tasks that are predictable or repeti@@ tive , rules @@@ -@@ @ based or well @@@ -@@ @ defined .
those are all just different words for routine .
this is the path we 're currently on .
solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways .
I 'm in a@@ we of their power in terms of imagination , in terms of technology , in terms of concept .
it 's something called the reward schedule .
and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data .
fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
there 's 100 percent up here .
we also say there 's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement .
we notice , looking at all these people opening boxes , that when people get to about 13 out of 15 p@@ ies , their perception shifts , they start to get a bit bo@@ red , a bit te@@ sty .
the first one is very simple : experience bars measuring progress -- something that 's been talked about brilli@@ antly by people like J@@ esse Sch@@ ell earlier this year .
it 's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States , among other places .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict enhanced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level .
but you know , sort of " our bra@@ ins have been manip@@ ulated ; we 're all addicts . "
we can use calculated random@@ ness .
and we can use the kind of group behavi@@ ors that we see evolving when people are at play together , these really quite un@@ prece@@ den@@ tedly complex cooperative mechanisms .
Government , well , one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government , among others , is literally starting to pay people to lose weight .
and after the close of the election , you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website .
I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s , when I was seven or eight years old , watching Jacques Cou@@ ste@@ au document@@ aries on the living room floor with my mask and f@@ lip@@ pers on .
and this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world , operated by the Japanese government .
I needed to head towards conservation goals .
and I 'm going to tell you that story here in a moment .
but before I do , I just want you to pon@@ der this graph for a moment .
but the ocean @@@ -@@ @ protected area is basically flat line until right about now -- it appears to be tic@@ king up .
but s@@ cu@@ ba diving , subm@@ er@@ si@@ bles and all the work that we 're setting about to do here will help rectify that .
let me give you a little pe@@ ek here of the Pho@@ eni@@ x Islands @@@ -@@ @ protected area .
the average depths are about 12,000 ft .
there 's lots of se@@ amounts in the Pho@@ eni@@ x Islands , which are specifically part of the protected area .
and we explored the surface of the Islands as well -- very important bird n@@ esting site , some of the most important bird @@@ -@@ @ n@@ esting sites in the Pacific , in the world .
and we finished our trip .
and when I was first going up there , I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago , and people would ask me , " Why are you going to this place called Kiribati ? "
just get whatever anybody wants . "

well , perhaps it is because health care systems themselves incenti@@ vi@@ ze in a non@@ ideal way towards applying or not applying certain procedures or treatments .
artificial intelligence @@@ -@@ @ based data analysis and the mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zation of sensor technologies are already starting to make monitoring of the individual health status possible .
in 2012 , 50 percent of all Americans had a single chronic disease , resulting in 86 percent of the $ 3 trillion US health care budget being spent for treating such chronic diseases .
this is 100 times th@@ inner than a human hair .
here , the roof@@ s are not designed to bear additionally heavy loads .
but if you think about it ecologically , both cancer and immune cells -- the prey and the pre@@ dat@@ or -- require nutrients such as gl@@ uc@@ ose to survive .
but as mathemati@@ cians , we have the power to zoom in on any sub@@ system in any tim@@ esc@@ ale and simulate effects of interventions that take place in any tim@@ esc@@ ale .
and it does demand some capacity of translation on both sides .
for as long as I remember , I 've loved mathematics .
square of nine -- three ; square of 256 -- sixteen .
why should we care ?
and we 're seeing big improvements for students who use the program regularly .
but once the excitement settled down , there were a few concerns that cre@@ pt in our minds .
I 'm a bit of a mathematical pur@@ ist .
so I 'd be one of the first people to say that we should study mathematics for the sake of mathematics .
( la@@ ughter ) As I struggled with this , I came to see that , while it 's a way I look at mathematics now , it 's only because I studied it long enough to appreciate it .
but it do@@ es@@ n 't pay off for a very long time .
so we 're always looking to make our product decisions around helping students reach their weekly ma@@ ths goal , effectively ensuring that they get paid and not us .
she would meet her future husband by age 27 , get engaged a year later and get married a year after that .

the ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable .
one of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to ide@@ alize the person who broke it .
all that does is make our loss feel more painful .
and if you want to get over them , you have to remind yourself of that , frequently .
although Miguel was not religious , he accompanied Sharon to church every Sunday , where he was welcomed into the congregation .

at work , un@@ fairness makes people defensive and dis@@ engaged .
is it about more rules ? is it about systems ?
careers were set , so my toolkit was@@ n 't very effective , and I was frustrated .
but he was so relaxed .
there was an HR director who proposed that I hire someone internally and give him a managerial job .
and so we built it .
that 's because un@@ fairness triggers the primitive , rep@@ tile part of our brain , the part that deals with threats and survival , and when un@@ fairness triggers a threat , that 's all we can think about .
so the first thing I try to do in my fairness c@@ rus@@ ade is to try to take myself out of the equation .
that means being aware of my own bi@@ ases .
so we try to actively promote a culture of diversity of opinions and diversity of character .
it 's about what people 's emotions are , what their needs are , what 's going on in their private lives , what society needs .
is it right that this guy should be fired ?
but if we take the time to ask ourselves whether the rational answer is the right one ...
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't it be great to have colleagues and bos@@ ses that were selected and trained for fairness and for character and not based on 60 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old G@@ MA@@ Ts ?
but fairness is a risk worth taking , so we should be asking ourselves , where can we take this risk ?
for those of us from this beautiful continent , to be African is to be inspired by culture and to be filled with und@@ ying hope for the future .
to combat these bi@@ ases , my work draws aesthe@@ tics from different parts of the globe and crafts a narrative about the importance of fighting for inclu@@ sivity .
this met@@ aph@@ or extends beyond the realm of art and out into the real world .
my work speaks for those who will no longer let their futures be dictated by a troubled past .
but the question still remains : are you prepared for what you are about to hear ?
