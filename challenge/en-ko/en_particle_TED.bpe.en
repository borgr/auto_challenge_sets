this is Richard Kel@@ ly who was born 100 years ago , which is the reason I bring him up now , because it 's kind of an anniversary year .

I want to tell you how we found that out .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stu@@ x@@ net and checked this thing out .
and I ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the small war@@ head is taking one casc@@ ade , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and slowing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six casc@@ ades and manip@@ ulating valves .

but if you 're a leader , the people you 've counted on will help you up .
MK : we 've got some places we can go . ( MS : ok@@ ay . ) Tur@@ n the camera off .
MS : I thought " Tur@@ n the camera off " meant , " Let 's have an off @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ record conversation . "
... do@@ es@@ n 't have to be fear . what kind of roller co@@ aster are you on ?
I feel like I had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe . "
and so after ad@@ mitting I cou@@ ld@@ n 't see to HR , they sent me off to an eye specialist .
and I gra@@ bbed this book off , and I 'm sitting on the cou@@ ch going , " I know what I 'm going to do .
and we have to dream it up together .
she explained that the father that she 'd had would tell them he 'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk .
they laugh him off .
you don 't laugh him off , because in the context of everything else , all the pieces fit .
he just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and real@@ izes that he 's in mid @@@ -@@ @ air .
she 's an@@ esthe@@ tized , the surgeon does his thing -- sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
they don 't have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they 're going to see the light and come on over to our team .
and unlike all of the other animals , we are obs@@ essed with trying to figure it out .
and for the rest of us , audience members , as listen@@ ers , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
I 've learned to ce@@ de control of the classroom over to the students over time .
and what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire ballo@@ on -- the fabric , par@@ ach@@ ute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with hel@@ ium .
now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to Mc@@ Mur@@ do Station .
they 're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff , but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old @@@ -@@ @ style evolution into neo @@@ -@@ @ evolution .
we 'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
that rab@@ bit will make a security trade @@@ -@@ @ off : " should I stay , or should I flee ? "
I go home , I look it up .
( la@@ ughter ) And you f@@ lip it over , and it 's the am@@ ino acids with the pH at which they have different charges .
and so I give this out to thousands of people .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) L@@ ater in a lecture that he gave on clean energy , he pulled it out and said , " And people at MI@@ T , they give out periodic tables . " so ...
and what we 've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dy@@ e @@@ -@@ @ absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna , and you get an energy transfer across the virus .
the utility company finally t@@ ore it down , cleaned the soil and cap@@ ped most of the site with asph@@ alt so that the clean soil w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't blow away .
and if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up .
and so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open .
open it up .
you can just pull this out , this becomes a rectangle .
look at the pent@@ agon , for instance , pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape tra@@ pe@@ z@@ ium .
in three minutes , you just fold this up .
teachers who have been teaching science for don@@ key years , they just m@@ uck up the definition and they sp@@ it it out .
a huge wave comes and sl@@ aps the front and knoc@@ ks it down .
and another one comes and sl@@ aps the a@@ ft and knoc@@ ks it down .
this sw@@ allows the bridge and knoc@@ ks it down .
there 's no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
we sti@@ r this in until it 's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .
so I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
and then you can either cut that out and se@@ w it conven@@ tionally , or you can use the wet material to form it around a three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional shape .
you might say , " Well , maybe things just smooth@@ ed themselves out . "
we want to know -- this is 50 years ago , " Su@@ rely , " you 're thinking , " we 've fig@@ ured it out by now . "
it 's not true that we 've fig@@ ured it out by now .
let 's try and sum things up , shall we ?
( la@@ ughter ) B@@ ring it over here and open it up . A@@ aa@@ ah !
OK , now they 're du@@ king it out . now they 're du@@ king it out .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And those roll @@@ -@@ @ up cookies coated with white chocolate .
and there 's no better , s@@ exi@@ er , more beautiful , char@@ is@@ matic meg@@ af@@ a@@ una species for me to hang my campaign on .
he s@@ col@@ ded me out , and said , " This is why we 're here .
I put my f@@ lip@@ pers on . I could barely part my lips .
and much like in the DVD , you can read it out op@@ tically .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but I 'm going to click this off right now .
and so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
Fe@@ yn@@ man decided , as a sort of amateur hel@@ ium phy@@ sic@@ ist , that he would try to figure it out .
if we could turn them off , then we could try and figure out what they 're necessary for .
over the last couple years , we 've gone back to the tree of life , because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .
most of us don 't have fun@@ g@@ uses or algae in our bra@@ ins , so what will our brain do if we put that in ?
and by turning things off , it 's more or less a zero .
J@@ e : and in theory , that means that , as a mouse feels , sm@@ ells , hears , touches , you can model it out as a string of ones and zer@@ os .
( la@@ ughter ) But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Pack@@ ard Children 's Hospital up at Stan@@ ford in Pal@@ o Al@@ to .
the ligh@@ test touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sle@@ eve , of a garment , as she put it on -- caused ex@@ cruci@@ ating , burning pain .
and when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
we 've looked at three things : peacemaking centers , centers for restorative justice and restorative economics and pop @@@ -@@ @ up villages .
and you 'll note there 's no light coming from them right now , either because they 're dead -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) or because I need to sti@@ r them up in some way for you to see what bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence really looks like .
but it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
and you normally don 't get to see this because we 've exhausted the lumin@@ escence when we bring them up in nets .
and we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the El@@ astic M@@ ind exhibition .
we 're not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explo@@ de again if you don 't s@@ nu@@ ff it out completely .
one congres@@ s@@ man here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into small@@ po@@ x eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foreg@@ one treatment costs and vaccination costs .
so you could get around the disease ; you could vacc@@ inate around the disease and cut it off .
B@@ G : well , hopefully we 'll get the word out , and the governments will keep their generosity up .
letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : " now I understand why there is Bra@@ ille on a drive @@@ -@@ @ up ATM machine . "
so this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the S@@ ayan Valley in Indonesia .
sal@@ mon swim upstream to get to their spa@@ w@@ ning grounds , and lan@@ ce@@ t flu@@ kes comman@@ de@@ er a passing ant , cra@@ wl into its brain , and drive it up a blade of grass like an all @@@ -@@ @ terrain vehicle .
we 're a free society , so we let pornography and all these things -- we sh@@ rug them off .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and suc@@ ked out all the air , and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .
it 's when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
and I 'm going to break it down for you for just a second .
the way we 're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off .
how should we figure it out ?
I 'm going to find that out , and when I find that out , I 'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause .
then I just pick things up .
a fellow by the name of Matthew Har@@ ris at the University of Wisconsin in Mad@@ ison actually fig@@ ured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth , and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chick@@ ens .
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don 't actually know my chro@@ mos@@ om@@ al make @@@ -@@ @ up , but I think I 'm probably typical -- most females like me are actually and@@ rogen @@@ -@@ @ sensitive .
give them up .
so he pairs these up .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
lift me up with the aesthetic su@@ bl@@ ime and give me a practice or some tools to turn that inspiration into understanding and action .
and if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fi@@ bers represent vulnerability .
but you can see also , once again -- so some places are much more wired than others , and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S. , going up over to Asia , Europe in the other direction , and so forth .
but partly , we want to make the world a better place , and so one thing that we 're embarking upon is the Google Foundation , and we 're in the process of setting that up .
and in News ' case , you know , they had a couple of people working on it for a while , and then more and more people started using it , and then we put it out on the Internet , and more and more people started using it .
and we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up .
all right , see ? you guys should try it out .
we also like to inno@@ vate in our physical space , and we noticed in meetings , you know , you have to wait a long time for projec@@ tors to turn on and off , and they 're nois@@ y , so people shut them off .
are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself ? "
and at the end of the meeting , we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project ; most people wanted to tear it down .
Mayor Gi@@ uli@@ ani wanted to tear it down .
you don 't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure can@@ ning because bacterial spo@@ res can 't grow in the acid .
as it comes out of the gr@@ in@@ der , you just have a little tra@@ y , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , sl@@ ice it vertically .
( la@@ ughter ) Now dece@@ it carries on through the plant kingdom .
fifteen percent suffer mig@@ ra@@ ines that wipe them out for days on end .
but the system has moved me on because , as my family started to discover , there is no long @@@ -@@ @ term concept in the health care system .
what does it do ? well actually , I 'll show you down here .
this thing bl@@ inks all the time ; I 'll leave it out , so you might be able to see it .
you sco@@ op it up . you put it in card@@ board boxes .
we 're going to test them out . they 'll probably all fail .
all the cardi@@ ac doctors tried to shut him down .
shut it down at once . "
we started with , you can take it off in the office .
and then after that , you can take it off on assignments .
how do you actually track them down ?
I give it its due .
and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like bu@@ tter@@ flies .
and you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them , and they 're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom .
we put our to@@ es in and we go up to our neck .
but if you believe you 're drinking expensive stuff , parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree .
and we said , listen , during the lean season , take the food out .
it 's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that 's a foreign object -- we want that out .
so I invite you to connect with me , connect with each other , take this mission out .
here 's what he wrote in starting that out .
you all know remote controls have an infrared LED -- basically you switch on the LED , and if it 's off , you switch it off .
so if I don 't want that receiver to receive the data , then what I could do , turn it away .
but he looks at the pile of ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads , thinks they 're a gift , pic@@ ks them up , s@@ miles and walks off .
so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on -- like heating , cooling etc . -- and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on .
and collectively , we really did@@ n 't know if we could pull this off .
you very quickly work out what is it that you 've got to do to fa@@ th@@ om that out .
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there 'd be more -- when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
and she was really crucial in getting the message in .
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
" we have l@@ asers ; we can wh@@ it@@ en it out . "
" fantastic ! " I thought . " let 's throw him out .
so we decided not to throw the guy out and to re@@ run the experiment .
can we really scale this up ? can we really emb@@ ed robo@@ tics into every part ?

someone invited me to a meeting , but cou@@ ld@@ n 't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , " I have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? "
so they 're modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line , and they 're tr@@ uc@@ ked anywhere in the world , you plo@@ p them down , and they produce electricity .
you can run these off -- they 're really hungry , they really like down @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ ended weapons p@@ its , so that 's highly enriched uranium and weapons @@@ -@@ @ grade plutonium that 's been down @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ ended .
well , we 're securing them , and it would be great if we could burn them , eat them up , and this reactor loves this stuff .
and they eat them up , which means that , combined with the fact that the cl@@ adding do@@ es@@ n 't last very long , you can only run one of these reactors for roughly , say , 18 months without refu@@ eling it .
no refu@@ eling means you can seal them up and they 're not going to be a proliferation risk , and they 're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material prolif@@ erated from their co@@ res .
in 1967 , 13 years after he fig@@ ured that out , he fig@@ ured out something else , which is that the democratic circle was not complete by just giving the people the classi@@ cs .
( la@@ ughter ) He did@@ n 't mean it compli@@ ment@@ arily , but Jo@@ e put it up in the lobby , he was so proud of it .
please give it up for him one more time .
some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause .
at 7 : 45 a.m. , I open the doors to a building dedicated to building , yet only breaks me down .
if you work with twenty@@ som@@ eth@@ ings , you love a twenty@@ something , you 're losing sleep over twenty@@ som@@ eth@@ ings , I want to see - Ok@@ ay . awesome , twenty@@ som@@ eth@@ ings really matter .
so this is the Ma@@ key Ma@@ key circuit , and I 'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you .
and now if I ho@@ ok up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow , I 'm kind of programming it by where I ho@@ ok it up , now I have a left arrow and a right arrow , so I should be able to go for@@ wards and back@@ wards and for@@ wards and back@@ wards . awesome .
and you can literally draw joy@@ sticks and just find Pac@@ man on your computer and then just ho@@ ok it up . ( video game no@@ ises ) And you know the little plastic draw@@ ers you can get at Target ?
and so we put it up on K@@ ick@@ star@@ ter , and hundreds of people bought it in the first day .
maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down , and maybe some Cha@@ p@@ S@@ tick , whatever .
you know , I 'd be like -- But in this case , you know , I whi@@ p this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to .
here 's S@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us as portra@@ yed by T@@ iti@@ an , condemned by the gods to push a huge b@@ oul@@ der up to the top of the hill .
( la@@ ughter ) Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally .
so he fig@@ ured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
and they said , " Well , we 've picked it up from the CDs . "
this is the Him@@ al@@ ay@@ as . up in the north , very cold .
when I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering , I started to re@@ discover the true power of music .
this is a scar@@ f to@@ y , and I 'm trying to lead the dol@@ ph@@ in over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal .
and they would look that up .
they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
it 's going to come bring it over here and put it down .
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 6@@ 5,000 feet into the atmosphere .
they find me up on the top terrace .
and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic d@@ ron@@ es to detect ro@@ gue d@@ ron@@ es , and instead of sending kill@@ er d@@ ron@@ es of their own up to shoot them down , they should notify humans to their presence .
and in certain very high @@@ -@@ @ security areas , perhaps civic d@@ ron@@ es would sn@@ are them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility .
I looked it up , and he was right .
that really cre@@ ep@@ ed us out .
how do you get them out ?
and then I 'll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an in@@ cu@@ rable optim@@ ist .
when I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pa@@ ins , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
now mix this in with cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aging cells , jet propulsion and a raz@@ or @@@ -@@ @ sharp be@@ ak , and you have all the ma@@ kings of a formidable pre@@ dat@@ or .
put it in , set up my Go@@ Pro , put the second oc@@ top@@ us in , cover it up and leave it alone .
you could see will@@ ful blind@@ ness in the run @@@ -@@ @ up to the Iraq War .
but I wonder who re@@ members Jo@@ e Dar@@ by , the very obedi@@ ent , good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in .
I 'd say , as a doctor , I delivered the best clinical care I could , but as a human being , I let you down .
you needed my em@@ pa@@ thy and compassion , and above all else , you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you did@@ n 't let the system down .
it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the low@@ lands . so stop and think for a minute .
the sharp , c@@ ris@@ p outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
take O@@ bi@@ ang junior . well , he did@@ n 't end up with high @@@ -@@ @ end art and luxury houses without help .
we were in love , and our love grew stronger up until her last day .
pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself !
now obviously , every time I bring this up , people even , you know , here at the conference , say , " Are you serious ? thirty stories ? how 's that going to happen ? "
so I started cold @@@ -@@ @ calling , and eventually got through to S@@ ue Sav@@ age @@@ -@@ @ R@@ umb@@ au@@ gh , and she invited me down .
and so if we could also have this up , great .
so we 're able to bring the camera right up to the ele@@ phant , put food into the ele@@ phant 's mouth , show people what 's going on inside their mou@@ ths , and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are .
thirty years ago , we turned it on .
( laugh@@ s ) You start with some water , pour in some nano@@ tubes , add anti@@ bodies , mix it up , take some paper , di@@ p it , dry it , and you can detect cancer .
if you guys haven 't fig@@ ured it out already , my name 's Tom Th@@ um , and I 'm a be@@ at@@ box@@ er , which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice , and the only thing was my voice .
what keeps you up at night ?
so a couple of things I 've created are , there 's a poster over here that you can play drums on .
I remembered an old man y@@ elling to us and c@@ rying to help us get him up .
a few years after I started this organization , in a Jewish community , two Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up .
they send the results of their analysis up to the aud@@ itory cor@@ te@@ x .
and then the aperture closes , and we have to fl@@ ush the pipes with toxins , or we have to di@@ g them up .
that 's a mus@@ sel you can find in the waters out here , and the threads holding it to a rock are ti@@ med ; at exactly two years , they begin to dissolve .
this is the simple design brief . I mean , it looks simple because the system , over 3.8 billion years , has worked this out .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shad@@ ows , a young man with a propane lan@@ tern came on , hun@@ g it up on a tree , set up a cur@@ tain .
what , if I were to bo@@ il it down , would be the one image that I could hang my hat on for this ?
but if you want to do something a little bit more immediate , something that you can 't achieve with live lo@@ oping , there 's other ways to layer your voice up .
you don 't have to . it 's fine . check it out .
it is possible , and you can do it very simply using this machine . it 's really fantastic . check it out .
we want to have our def@@ enses up and our strategies all in order .
think about that one -- have you ever entered an argument thinking , " Let 's see if we can h@@ ash something out , rather than fight it out .
you see , up till now , us designers , we 've mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we 've ignored the other three senses .
if I just put the microphone down for a bit , I 'm going to play a cluster of notes .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
I 'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I 'd -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't get it off .
and I just love learning and I 'm incredibly inqu@@ isi@@ tive and I love taking on , you know , the status quo and trying to turn it up@@ side down .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : did he tell you to jump , or he just said , " I 'm out of here ! " and ...
and so I managed to fly the ballo@@ on down through the clouds , and about 50 feet , before I hit the sea , threw myself over .
and the ballo@@ on hit the sea and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me .
I mean , there 's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they 've got kids , and we 've got this dilemma about how you bring them up .
ca : and what are the issues that you worry about most , care most about , want to turn your resources toward ?
and the journey that I want to take you on , we need to start by going back in time .
( la@@ ughter ) If you are a tired brain , the brain is cra@@ ving things to wake it up .
do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey @@@ -@@ @ heavy dew of sl@@ umber .
if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file , that 's 22 me@@ g .
give it up for the fundamental particle that be@@ qu@@ ea@@ ths all other fundamental particles their mass .
( la@@ ughter ) You can see why this study fre@@ aked me out .
now to explain how this works , I want you all to pre@@ tend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out .
your biological stress response is n@@ ud@@ ging you to tell someone how you feel , instead of bott@@ ling it up .
he used to pick people up here every day .
( multiple voices ) Voice 13 : I got a call from my father . voice 14 : the phone ran@@ g , it wo@@ ke me up .
see it up there ?
in 1974 , the great R@@ ay Kur@@ z@@ we@@ il , the American inven@@ tor , worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech .
for example , I was too sh@@ y then , and I 'm actually too sh@@ y now , to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material .
I slowed it down for you .
so the in@@ sect is continually trying to fight off the paras@@ ite , and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off .
but I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought , this book is amazing .
we really should clean that up .
bring them out , check and see how accurate you were .
now that you 're done , close them down .
come on up to the stage , Jo@@ e . let 's play a little game now .
go ahead and take it off .
hold your hand out flat . open it up .
put your hand up a little bit higher , but watch it close .
for example , we study hygiene , where some be@@ es are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest , from the colony , and it keeps the colony healthy .
SG : absolutely . so I got a little quick on that , but he 's going to slow me down .
we 've got ourselves in a world that 's m@@ assi@@ vely complex , and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it .
and what we next do is we take the cells and their coll@@ agen and we spread them out to form sheets , and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another , like Ph@@ yl@@ lo pa@@ stry , to form thick@@ er sheets , which we then let mature .
you just record the information , then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images .
these are just plain old molecules , but if you sn@@ iff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face , you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose .
or , " You know what , I 'll look it up , I 'll ask someone , I 'll phone someone . I 'll find out . "
they wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use .
they string them up in the right sequence , and then they send them back to you via Fed@@ Ex .
these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates -- what turned out to be truly aw@@ ful dates .
the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gad@@ gets , we share a love of math and data and ' 8@@ 0s music , and so I agreed to go out with him .
so Ste@@ ve the I.@@ T. guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia 's white @@@ -@@ @ table @@@ -@@ @ cloth , extremely expensive restaurants .
and as it happens , the algorithms that were setting us up , they we@@ ren 't bad either .
these algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do , which was to take our user @@@ -@@ @ generated information , in my case , my r@@ é@@ sum@@ é , and match it up with other people 's information .
I 'm going to keep using these online dating sites , but I 'm going to treat them as databases , and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up , I think I 'm going to try reverse @@@ -@@ @ engineering this entire system .
so knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people , I decided instead to ask my own questions .
now I 've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
let 's start with those of you who object , who would rule it out even before trying .
Dr. James Lev@@ ine at , in this case , the ap@@ tly @@@ -@@ @ named May@@ o Clinic put his test subjects in electronic under@@ wear , held their diet steady , and then started pumping the cal@@ ories in .
we can put those onto a material , and we can make that material very complex if we want to , and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient .
they typically make the best out of their conditions , and try to make their spaces look nice and hom@@ ey , or at least up until as far as they can reach .
from the main dock , people board long wooden can@@ oes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expan@@ sive area .
they were floating through the can@@ als in a large can@@ oe with a fitted @@@ -@@ @ out generator for all of the community to enjoy .
you can just make stuff up or steal stuff .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be leaving this stuff up to AI to decide what 's appropriate or not , because we know what happens .
in " Bra@@ ve New World , " he imag@@ ines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coer@@ cing us .
now I 'm going to let you in on a little not @@@ -@@ @ so @@@ -@@ @ secret .
what the car really did in the 20th century is it created this car@@ ved @@@ -@@ @ up , segregated landscape .
as the tell@@ er of the tale and the audience , we know just what details to include , to di@@ g that knife in . right ?
does the novel show us a way out ? I 'm not sure .
and I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with per@@ for@@ ations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a filtered way .
it 's kind of been taking on that risk . bring it on .
now , Mau@@ i was terri@@ fied of the dark , so I had to carry him up the stairs , actually down the stairs first , for his walk , and then bring him back up .
night after night , he took me up on the terrace , on his shoulders , and pointed out J@@ up@@ iter and Satur@@ n and the Great Be@@ ar to me .
behind the lean @@@ -@@ @ to was a dump , maybe 40 feet square with ro@@ tting apple co@@ res and b@@ alled @@@ -@@ @ up aluminum foil , and a dead s@@ ne@@ aker .
we use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know there 's a workforce on the other side that 's going to take it all away .
the pi@@ e chart in the center represents the capacity of the main cables -- that 's what holds the bridge up -- the capacity of the main cables .
and notice that 78 percent of that capacity is used up just holding the bridge up .
but check this out .
now check this out .
so how does the story of a small town k@@ id just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
we 'll have over 100 miles when we 're through building it out .
this is really important . you can 't , like , wait while they fight it out and then sw@@ o@@ op in at the last minute .
you 've been sitting for a@@ while , so the physical relief , getting to shake it out .
I 'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that 's going to tell you a little bit about how we open user @@@ -@@ @ generated content up for business .
in which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
when we want some information , we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask .
if you turn it off , that 's called a com@@ a , ok@@ ay ?
Don 't write them down . just hang on to them .
just sh@@ out it out .
we can be in the middle of a meeting , listen to somebody 's presentation , evaluate it , decide whether or not we like it , ask follow @@@ -@@ @ up questions .
we 're going to write it down , and when you get home , pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time .
if you read a book , pull things up .
now you can just go on Google . just look it up .
so leave it up to your own imagination .
there was a huge pit or shaft called a mou@@ lin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the gl@@ ac@@ ier .
this duc@@ k died on the surface of the gl@@ ac@@ ier long , long ago , and its fea@@ thers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice before falling inside the cave .
so these three psychi@@ atri@@ sts , after about two or three weeks of observation , laid him down on a table , connected his temples to a very small source of current .
I have met with him over and over again .
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
it pul@@ ls me . it turns . I throw my hand up . I 'm able to grab a branch .
my foot goes down its throat . it sp@@ its me out .
I pull myself up into the branches , and as I come out of the water , I look over my shoulder .
he lays me down . he pul@@ ls his shirt off .
and I watched young El@@ vis begin to psy@@ ch herself up for the hill .
half@@ way up the bank , a young teenage ele@@ phant came in behind her , and he prop@@ ped his trunk under@@ ne@@ ath her , and he began to sho@@ vel her up the bank .
and finally , after four full hours of my lying and st@@ aring at it , the phone ran@@ g , and somehow I managed to pick it up , and it was my father , and I said , " I 'm in serious trouble . we need to do something . "
she said , " I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I cou@@ ld@@ n 't go out of the house .
people will come to me and say , " I think , though , if I just stick it out for another year , I think I can just get through this . "
but not only did Mr. Ol@@ ber@@ mann invite me back , he made me a full @@@ -@@ @ time contributor , and he tap@@ ed down my chair .
you 'd probably kick me out , or something .
and you can trans@@ cend time by sending a message at your convenience , and someone else can pick it up at their convenience .
this is just street @@@ -@@ @ up innovation .
you can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range , but it 's much , much harder to stay outside of it .
even after you 've kept the weight off for as long as seven years , your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back .
you can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle , even If you can 't lose weight and keep it off .
then we can take the Nan@@ op@@ at@@ ch off and disc@@ ard it .
however , you still don 't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sle@@ eves up and vacc@@ inate and wait .
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war , having just finished the washing up . ( la@@ ughter ) He seems also to have forgotten his sword .
stand in front of a mirror , act it out in front of a camera -- whatever you need -- and then put it back in your character .
you can see when I psy@@ ch it out , it gets fool@@ ed .
as one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me , " Here , sex is the opposite of sport .
so one evening , he said , " Lo@@ ok , you are doing all these things , but is@@ n 't it nice , also , to build something within ? "
and they would take a yellow stic@@ ky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board .
and when it 's time to mate , up to 20 individuals will all get together in this kind of , like , con@@ ga line and they 'll all mate together .
pause here if you want to figure it out yourself .
and so we stuck to riding it out and dropped another dose .
but I believed that if I saved myself from the withdrawal with the drugs that I would never be free of them , and so we buck@@ led ourselves in , and I dropped the last dose .
I 'd made it out .
and a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said , " You want men to talk about violence against women and girls . men don 't talk . "
this is a new idea that 's cre@@ pt up that may be , essentially , a cle@@ ve@@ rer idea than putting sul@@ f@@ ates in .
it 's saying that you do some geo @@@ -@@ @ engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off , not that you 'd use it as a substitute for action .
to find out , we developed a software engine called En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a , designed to maximize the production of long @@@ -@@ @ term ent@@ ro@@ py of any system that it finds itself in .
these teachers call themselves " pick @@@ -@@ @ up artists . "
" pick @@@ -@@ @ up " is to pick someone up , but not just any picking up -- it 's picking up ch@@ ic@@ ks .
that 's the latest U.@@ N. stat@@ s . up to half of the food .
Don 't ever invite me over because I 'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that .
so first , we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development .
provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so , the central bank would be mandated to match the government 's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit .
so it would work like this : if in a given year the government gave 0.2 percent of its income to overseas aid , the central bank would simply top it up with a further 0.2 percent .
take the arm@@ or off . be yourself .
so I tried this out with kids with au@@ tism , and I found that there was an incredible amount of identification .
and this , this has a lot of potential , a lot of promise , and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us , and they 're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them English .
but the other way is to effectively par@@ ach@@ ute in cells , trans@@ plant them in , to replace dying or lost cells , even in the brain .
they are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled @@@ -@@ @ down version of the entire universe .
so after several years , I tun@@ ed myself up and I have lots of great , really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistic@@ ation and the analytical backbone behind them .
so let me set this up for you .
what happens to matter if you cho@@ p it up very fine ?
I 'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
and we saw people who had a functional micro@@ scope but just did@@ n 't know how to even turn it on .
what you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a to@@ y , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stom@@ p on it .
a group of males will grab a female , hold her down , and ball@@ istically ejac@@ ulate their spiral @@@ -@@ @ shaped penis into her cor@@ k@@ screw @@@ -@@ @ shaped vag@@ ina over and over and over again .
so this bu@@ ys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years , so that they can work it out .
you would never be able to pick them out in a crowd .
and so a young scientist that I was working with at the time , Ro@@ b Ol@@ son , was able to take this thing apart , put it on a ship , put it back together and take it off to sea .
R@@ NG : and if , our friends , you detect a f@@ law in this argument , just remember you 'll be depending on reason to point it out .
well first you need to work out where you want to set it up .
these are the companies that can set your one up for you , and remember , it 's all legal , routine business practice .
it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can 't be seen .
they 're tun@@ ed such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris , but they 're sti@@ ff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface .
we can make sp@@ ines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out .
let 's slow it down and you can see the sp@@ ines in action .
if we slow it down , they attach their feet at eight mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds , and det@@ ach them in 16 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds .
if we could have a slide up , and E@@ d , I don 't know whether you can see , the slides are here .
this is something that we need to change , not just for Amazon , I don 't mean to single them out , but they 're a great example .
ca : and do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyber@@ attacks from other sources ?
it 's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here , but I see them .
we ride the elevator up and we cra@@ wl in , on your hands and knees into the spac@@ eship , one at a time , and you wor@@ m your way up into your chair and plun@@ k yourself down on your back .
SPIDER web@@ s like this , it do@@ es@@ n 't build those , it builds them down in the corners .
I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found .
I think the follow @@@ -@@ @ up to that is our knowledge .
if you inv@@ ent something , T@@ es@@ la invented electric power that we use , but he struggled to get it out to people .
( la@@ ughter ) So when I was feeling bad about myself , insecure , I would j@@ ack my height up .
now , I made sure to s@@ have my legs last night , because I knew I 'd be showing them off .
we 're building body parts from the ground up .
it 's so profound in its aug@@ mentation , that when a normal , healthy person we@@ ars the device for 40 minutes and then takes it off , their own biological legs feel ridic@@ ulously heavy and aw@@ k@@ ward .
man : is it pushing you up ?
I 'm here at this stage because it 's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice .
but women will tell you over and over again , " I can 't negotiate a condom with my husband .
right now there 's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says , " Pu@@ t them down . "
if you 're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular , these guys will probably cancel each other out , and then we 'll be ok@@ ay . "
so just to make sure , I insisted that we build a mo@@ ck @@@ -@@ @ up in wood , at scale , of the rail@@ ing and the sea wall .
where there used to be parking spaces , there are now pop @@@ -@@ @ up cafes .
OK , I can see , if I found something , up , up , and they continue , up up up .
MK : ye@@ ah , with ap@@ ha@@ sia , Gab@@ by knows what she wants to say , she just can 't get it out .
more than 70 percent of the te@@ ens in our study said that the police had tried to " be@@ friend " them or indicate a desire to help them out during the interrogation .
l@@ m : so he sums it up pretty beautifully there : " they got into my head . "
we sign them up for team sports , thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills , you know , for when they go to Harvard Business School .
sending vaccines around in a digital file , rather than stockpiling those same vaccines and shipping them out , promises to save thousands of lives .
it was taken by the Vo@@ y@@ ager spacecraft in 1990 , when they turned it around as it was exi@@ ting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away .
well to see , let 's imagine we take the Hu@@ b@@ ble Space Tel@@ es@@ cope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars .
it would be the same thing if I put my thum@@ b up and blocked that spot@@ light that 's getting right in my eye , I can see you in the back row .
I 've got to take that slide off .
in Hel@@ ve@@ tica Com@@ pressed , Extra Com@@ pressed , and Ul@@ tra Com@@ pressed , this rigid 18 @@@ -@@ @ unit system really bo@@ xed me in .
it looks very elegant up on a slide .
one of the works , in fact , so did@@ n 't meet her mark , she had set it out in the tra@@ sh in her studio , and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value .
and one of them said , " Come here . I think I can help you out here . "
and then you take this symbol , and you put it back in so it 's a self @@@ -@@ @ generating diversity of symbols .
we 're eth@@ ically precluded from even using human@@ oid shapes and ba@@ iting them up in the water .
it happened to be over U@@ C @@@ -@@ @ Dav@@ is ' campus in California when we turned the camera on .
under most circumstances , the energy in a laser beam he@@ ats things up .
but used in a very precise way , the beam 's momentum can stall moving at@@ oms , cooling them down .
similar to if you have a cold and your immune system fights it off .
ok@@ ay , well if you think about how you can calculate these things , you can take what you can see , ok@@ ay , I 'm going to cho@@ p it up into lots of little boxes , and that 's the result of physics , right ?

( la@@ ughter ) And I was young , I was full of it , and I thought , five years in the lab , and we 'll c@@ rank this out , and we 'll have this into the clinic .

we need to figure that out pretty fast .
keep your hands up if you did 10 .
and as they repeatedly kno@@ ck it down and start again , learning is happening as a sort of by @@@ -@@ @ product of play .
and I think the best way to achieve that , and get a feeling for any flaws in your design , is to act it out .
they dismiss an interesting interaction by saying , you know , " That 's just happening because they 're acting it out . "
so to sum it up , we need trust to play , and we need trust to be creative . so , there 's a connection .

it 's about getting a spacecraft that 's hur@@ t@@ ling through deep space and using all this bag of tric@@ ks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour .
actually , the lander will come down to about 100 feet and ho@@ ver above that surface for 100 feet , and then we have a sky crane which will take that R@@ over and land it down on the surface .

we put a ton of virus up this guy 's nose . so -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- I mean , we wanted it to work . he really had a cold .

take it off the flame and pour water on it , or let it cool down , the pi@@ ston moves down .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you 're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
that allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundre@@ d@@ th of a percent to about two percent .
the way the unit works is , when the sun comes out , the engine will start and you get power out here .

I have dropped a blo@@ b of organic y@@ og@@ urt from happy self @@@ -@@ @ actu@@ alized local cows on my counter top , and I grab a paper to@@ wel and I want to wipe it up .
wipe it up , throw it away .
I wipe it up with a spon@@ ge , and I put it under the running water , and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water .
unless you 're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on , and then you start to use more energy .
and overnight , because this man had pulled me in , and I had gra@@ bbed onto that lif@@ eline with every fiber of my being , I had gone from " Jo@@ an@@ ie Lo@@ ves Ch@@ achi " to full @@@ -@@ @ blown Nazi .
I draw them in closer , and I listen very closely for their po@@ th@@ ol@@ es , and then I begin to fill them in .
and I reached down and picked him up , and immediately became fasc@@ inated and impressed by its speed and its strength and ag@@ ility .
and I bring this up because it 's important to locate this practice in history .
now , where , perhaps , does this end up right now ?
and we were using a special tra@@ w@@ ling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive .
we capture it in a very special device on the front of the subm@@ er@@ sible that allows us to bring it up in really pris@@ tine condition , bring it into the lab on the ship .
dilu@@ ting it down to the point where there 's none of it left . ( la@@ ughter ) Now fol@@ ks , this is not just a met@@ aph@@ or I 'm going to give you now , it 's true .
I thought , let 's up the ante , once .
but what you 're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out .
face to face would work , but it 's hard to set it up .
so the narrative -- and Al G@@ ore is master of putting it out there -- is that there 's this civilization @@@ -@@ @ threatening climate change coming on very rapidly .
this is : try a little bit here , back the hell off if it 's an issue , expand it if it seems to go OK , meanwhile , have other paths going forward .
they dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fy law , break it down into simple terms , and then they help people look for a solution .
he took out his little , plastic , portable turn@@ table that he brought with him whenever he was on these dig@@ ging qu@@ ests and put the record on .
he knew the artist , at the time of the recording , was living in Montreal , so for months , he tried to track him down .
and then you write it down .
build a team , open it up , offer prizes and so on .
so they 'd had to pull in and do all the li@@ ds up .
when they opened this one up , they found its stomach was full of plastic .
if we can pull this off , if we can build more function , it will be st@@ ack@@ able .
to find this out , I looked at three things : I looked at the topic that you should choose , I looked at how you should deliver it and the visu@@ als on@@ stage .
then , you should be brief . ( la@@ ughter ) But other than that , talk until they drag you off the stage .
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four @@@ -@@ @ word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ ks as opposed to the least favorite TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ ks .
when we can communicate from the inside out , we 're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior , and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do .
we negotiated it down to 190 .
( la@@ ughter ) We 're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation fol@@ ks to scale this system up .
I put half the lab up in my house .
the tro@@ phy fish were so big that you cou@@ ld@@ n 't put any of those small fish up on it .
and when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it ro@@ ts , which means that bacteria break it down .
they kick them out , and then they die .
and , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , do@@ es@@ n 't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .
I think the head@@ line in The New York Times was , " Are you packing it on ?
because if you open it up and reach inside , you 'd let the heat in , the game would be over .
next we can actually light them up with a laser . ( la@@ ughter ) Now , this is a low powered laser , and we can actually pick up a wing @@@ -@@ @ beat frequency .
I mean , here we 're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down .
I finally found a way to shut this up .
( appl@@ ause ) Jeremy Du@@ h@@ on : I know this is a sensitive topic but a very important one , so thank you for bringing this up and helping us explore it .
Ben Cor@@ t : I 'm actually glad you brought that up .
so I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we 're looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
and then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
the question is : how long will it take you to fill it up ?
how long will it take you to fill it up ? and that 's it .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
and then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
everyone 's filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , " How long will it take ? "
they cou@@ ld@@ n 't figure it out .
and , in fact , you can cycle the weight up and down simply by in@@ hibiting an@@ gi@@ ogene@@ sis .
( la@@ ughter ) And I sat them down , and I got them glasses of water -- O@@ k , I got it , I got it .
( la@@ ughter ) So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water , and after nic@@ eties , they said , " Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart ? "
and we also visited a family in the poorer end , down here .
Tur@@ bo has taken to knoc@@ king on the door with his be@@ ak , we let him in and he comes in here .
I picked it up outside of Mar@@ ble F@@ alls , Texas .
I picked this up at MI@@ T . it 's a little younger .
when we started this out , we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem , which is why we chose the smallest gen@@ ome .
when we did these experiments , though , we could get the chro@@ mos@@ ome out of ye@@ ast but it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't trans@@ plant and boot up a cell .
we narrow@@ ed it down to one fragment ; we sequ@@ enced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene .
great . now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you 're wearing your wri@@ st@@ watch ?
( la@@ ughter ) He said , " He was in a car wrec@@ k , and I pulled him out , gave him CPR , and I saved his wife 's life as well . "
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " You 've been around for 36 months , and this is it ? "
when people kno@@ ck it off , everybody knows because they 've put that look out on the run@@ way , and it 's a coherent aesthetic .
they kno@@ ck themselves off .
he ble@@ w himself up , killing six .
if you lo@@ p this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacter@@ ium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they 've created a very powerful flu fighter .
and I have to tell you , this is an un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated piece of software , this is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site , and we 're going to test it out live today .
so we can throw it out like that . let 's reset it .
so if we don 't like stuff , or we 're inten@@ sely curious about Er@@ n@@ st Ha@@ ec@@ kel 's scientific falsi@@ fications , we can pull them out like that .
we can grab elements off the front , where upon they re@@ anim@@ ate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here .
we 'll go over to Jacques Tat@@ i here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .
but that 's due to natural pre@@ dat@@ ors like vul@@ tures that pick them off on a beach or pre@@ datory fish that are waiting offshore .
I actually jumped in and photograph@@ ed this , and with the fisher@@ man 's permission , I cut the tur@@ tle out , and it was able to swim free .
and so what I did is I took it , I translated it into English , and I stuck it up for my friends to use .
now , I 'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway .
what you 're seeing when you put it through a pr@@ ism is that you heat hydrogen up and it do@@ es@@ n 't just g@@ low like a white light , it just em@@ its light at particular colors , a red one , a light blue one , some dark blue ones .
and so the fact that at@@ oms , when you heat them up , only em@@ it light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of at@@ oms .
you can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a teles@@ cope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun .
and if I blow it up there , you see it .
often , we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthe@@ tics or whatever .
you can just call it out .
even if it might not look like Ro@@ si@@ e the Ro@@ bot , it 's doing something that 's really useful in my life so I don 't have to take care of turning the temperature up and down myself .
and I 'm not going to turn him off , right ? that 's kind of r@@ ude .
human psychology is not changing at the same speed that tech is and so we 're always playing catch @@@ -@@ @ up , trying to make sense of this world where these autonomous things are running around .
it did make it across the park to the other side of Manhattan -- which is pretty great -- just because people would pick it up and point it in the right direction .
and while we think that HIV is done and that the tide has turned for it , just like with real ti@@ des , it can come right back .
here , they mix the sal@@ ty mud with spring water and spread it out in shallow pon@@ ds , and as it evapor@@ ated , it turned into a spectac@@ le of color .
and they sent me off to school , just to get busy somewhere there .
however , you pick them up and under@@ ne@@ ath , actually engra@@ ved in the metal , are the words , " St@@ olen from Virgin Atlantic Air@@ ways upper @@@ -@@ @ class . "
and once you have a very , very large budget , you actually look for expensive things to spend it on .
and so far there are only three major sources of that -- coal and gas , hydro @@@ -@@ @ electric , which in most places is ma@@ xed @@@ -@@ @ out -- and nuclear .
it 's ok@@ ay on fra@@ pped @@@ -@@ @ out agricultural land .
and of course , with wind , you could put it all over the East Coast , offshore theoretically , or you can split it up .
I 'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blind@@ fold on .
and as a young k@@ id , nobody can say it can 't happen , because you 're too dum@@ b to realize that you cou@@ ld@@ n 't figure it out .
so this thing right here is f@@ rea@@ king me out .
at seven years old I fig@@ ured it out .
I asked what he did with it , and he said he just thro@@ ws it out .
these women we@@ ren 't going to go to anybody else because they liked me , and I kind of fig@@ ured it out .
so I 'd go into the pon@@ ds and cra@@ wl around and pick them up with my to@@ es , just pick them up with both feet .
I 'd thrown a pen@@ ny out in the street , and my d@@ ad said , " Go pick it up .
when you see gr@@ um@@ py customer service , point it out .
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out , and I would not allow cancer to ride me .
as I spent my week up in the Him@@ al@@ ay@@ as , I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation .
but I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I 'd let myself in for .
we 've got to pick you up . "
the next bit , we 'd char@@ tered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called K@@ hat@@ anga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all @@@ -@@ @ clear , loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
( la@@ ughter ) To make things worse , you can just see the white do@@ t up at the top right hand side of the screen ; that 's a full moon .
I knew there was more open water . and I had a secret weapon up my sle@@ eve .
when you get lots of m@@ ist , low cloud , the wind starts blowing the snow up .
I war@@ med the battery up in my ar@@ mp@@ it .
we 'd like to pick you up .
he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front , and I clim@@ bed in the back .
that 's as close as I can come to summing that up .
the things that interest me when I 'm working are visual structure , surprise and anything that requires fig@@ uring things out .
and I drew each person their own unique val@@ en@@ tine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out .
and two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said , " We could do that , " and in 72 hours , they launched U@@ sha@@ h@@ idi .
it happens because we have j@@ am@@ med so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clo@@ g it up and over@@ fill onto our beaches .
often what j@@ ams us up is sewage .
nobody would want to give them up .
that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero , this internet of devices .
we did@@ n 't think this up , that we would get pulled to these places ; we 'd open it . the first step was just empowerment .
we back so far up we 're finally seeing a containment around us -- the after@@ g@@ low of the Big Ban@@ g .
and one by one , he calls us up , and he plays middle C , and he asks us to sing it .
but so , curious , I run up to the child -- of course scar@@ ing the living be@@ je@@ sus out of him -- grab him by the coll@@ ar , turn it over , and there is my name written on the coll@@ ar of this swe@@ ater .
but previously it 's only been created for large @@@ -@@ @ scale farms , so Am@@ i Tab@@ ar took this and mod@@ ul@@ arized it down to an eighth of an ac@@ re .
and that 's what I 'm going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a st@@ agg@@ ering four billion people have been added to the world population .
and the same thing with the atmosphere : if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball , you would get that little sphere of gas on the right .
but he told T@@ ed that on the last day he went out , a bott@@ len@@ ose dol@@ ph@@ in suddenly appeared next to the boat , and it was spl@@ at@@ tering oil out its blo@@ whole .
the oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
if we can have this document up ...
radio : ... just f@@ uc@@ kin ' , once you get on ' em just open ' em up .
and we got a report -- a sort of engineering analysis into what happened -- saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , par@@ ked trucks there and blown them up .
so we were kind of skep@@ tical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
so under that basis , we put it out and said , " Lo@@ ok , we 're skep@@ tical about this thing .
( la@@ ughter ) So I said , " Great . " so I called him up a few weeks after@@ ward .
in spite of falling oil prices , he brought this country up here .
at first they spelled things by sound , like most kids do , but because they were part of a community , they saw other people sp@@ elling the same words properly and just picked it up .
put your hand up .
this is the field of bi@@ ologic replac@@ ements , where we replace worn @@@ -@@ @ out parts with new , natural ones .
I can 't gr@@ ind it up in a bl@@ ender .
in one study , which we ran in Jap@@ an@@ town , San Francisco , we brought seven@@ - to nine @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old An@@ glo@@ - and Asian @@@ -@@ @ American children into the laboratory , and we divided them up into three groups .
we all have physical , mental and emotional ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter , even in the gro@@ cery store , let alone over the course of our entire lives .
they could not imagine turning that choice over to another , even though having made that choice made them feel trapped , guilty , angry .
so I brought these two bottles of nail pol@@ ish into the laboratory , and I stripped the labels off .
when the oil gets into the marsh@@ es , you can 't get it out .
you know , we 're the s@@ mar@@ test thing out there , why can 't we figure this out ?
and of course , if we are put in environments where we can 't deal with it , in some sense makes sense that we actually might m@@ ess certain things up .
you know , she 's a smart , very cut creature , a pri@@ mate as well , but she lacks all the stuff we think might be m@@ essing us up .
we said , all right , let 's , you know , throw so problems at Hol@@ ly , see if she m@@ esses these things up .
so we said , well , maybe we should just , actually just suc@@ k it up and teach mon@@ keys how to use money .
when we first gave it to them in their en@@ closures , they actually kind of picked them up , looked at them .
hands it over , and then gets some food .
we just allowed them to pick this up on their own .
you can 't just shut that off .
the hope is that you all will think about your limitations , not necessarily as un@@ over@@ com@@ able , but to recognize them , accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out .
and I don 't where I got it from , but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake .
my crew gra@@ bbed me , and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rub@@ ble -- down to our camp .
if you did that and then linked it up to a turbine , that would create enough power to make me happen for a day .
of course , most of China was flour@@ ishing at the time , but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China .
and so a year ago , I showed this off at a computer show called E@@ 3 .
his parents are too busy to listen to his problems , and that 's when he starts almost con@@ j@@ uring you up .
( la@@ ughter ) So remember , this is the first time you 've met him , and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious .
PM : so , Mil@@ o 's being called back in by his parents , giving us time to be alone and to help him out .
and one more thing : no , don 't F it up . "
the other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed , who is an Egyptian @@@ -@@ @ American , who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out before we went out as a tour .
and I opened it up , it said , " Bor@@ n in Iran . " I 'm like , " Oh , come on , man ! "
then he opened it up . " born in Iran ? wait . "
( appl@@ ause ) " G@@ im@@ me all your money , or I 'll blow myself up ! "
( la@@ ughter ) " Well , then blow yourself up .
all it takes in one person to m@@ ess it up .
and when you put your two @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old on a slide in the United States , they put something on the slide to slow the k@@ id down as he comes down the slide .
I was doing a show , and they said , " We 'll send a driver to pick you up . "
that suc@@ ks . why not level @@@ -@@ @ up ?
and they have these systems where you can level @@@ -@@ @ up .
let me point them out .
so let 's filter that out .
they have to di@@ g themselves out every day .
they cut the cylinders up into three @@@ -@@ @ foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these lab@@ s , some 8,000 miles from the drill site .
of course , sea c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers shoot them out their re@@ ars , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a super@@ hero .
and he does manage to find them , but great navigation skills , l@@ ous@@ y pick @@@ -@@ @ up lines .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't fit them in .
and you find other things , and you break that up , and you ha@@ ul those away .
but then I read on , and I read this : " first , No@@ ah had never seen rain , because prior to the Flo@@ od , God irrig@@ ated the earth from the ground up . "
I 'm so angry about it . the oil companies are ri@@ pping me off .
farmers store their messages , they write them down in books , and in effect , we 're dri@@ p @@@ -@@ @ feeding agricultural manuals into the fields .
and the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here .
you put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you 're using right now , how much it 's costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly .
the fastest way out of a bad mood : step outside , go for a walk , turn the radio on and dance .
it costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid .
they 're retail companies , so they 're taking products out to people in the connecting markets .
from a governmental perspective , from a social perspective , it takes us out to two really big goals .
maybe even think about crow@@ d@@ sourcing with your neighbors the grid from the ground up , rather than waiting for the government to bring it from the top down .
I connected high speed internet to it -- it 's about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there .
this sent shi@@ vers up my spine .
and I gave it up .
and it 's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump .
the nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders -- it tended to be the leaders of the small island states , the low @@@ -@@ @ lying island states .
now , Syl@@ via Ear@@ le turned me on to this exact same coral .
it 's not as if J.@@ J. and J@@ ill actually ended their talks saying , " Step your game up , " but they might as well have .
and we see a bli@@ p up in the tr@@ uc@@ kers ' purchases of fuel , and we know that a recession is about to end .
so this is actually a Dutch company , so I called them up , and I asked , " Can I borrow a heart valve from you ? "
it 's also useful if you want to put it down on your night@@ stand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock .
( la@@ ughter ) How do we calm it down ?
if we take many images of many sl@@ ices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional image .
and they are working with me up to today .
and also -- I think -- without psycho @@@ -@@ @ social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we CA@@ N@@ NOT build @@@ -@@ @ up civil societies .
human beings have this marvel@@ ous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life .
but these are@@ n 't the data . I made these up !
and then , finally , some of you recognize this young photo of Pe@@ te Best , who was the original dr@@ um@@ mer for the Be@@ at@@ les , until they , you know , sent him out on an err@@ and and sn@@ uck away and picked up R@@ ingo on a tour .
we now spend six hours teaching them about dar@@ k@@ rooms , and they blow two of them up .
everybody joins in , and they feel they own the bank , because they have brought the money in .
the ir@@ ony is , though , that we have c@@ ashed @@@ -@@ @ out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth .
we bring the tuna out , we measure it .
in this case , what we 're going to do is put a pop @@@ -@@ @ up satellite archival tag on the tuna .
so from data like this , we 're able now to put the map up , and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tag@@ ging .
they can throw out a target -- it 's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shar@@ k , a curious crit@@ ter that will come right up to our 16 @@@ -@@ @ f@@ t. boat .
same thing with Lay@@ san al@@ bat@@ ross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tun@@ as use .
they set them up as what they called micro @@@ -@@ @ distribution centers , and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people , who go out with bicycles and push@@ car@@ ts and wheel@@ bar@@ rows to sell the product .
now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign .
but by taking your t@@ ad@@ pole out for a walk in the evening -- there 's a few action shots -- your neighbors are likely to say , " What are you doing ? "
and then I swap it out with the students and actually re @@@ -@@ @ release that carbon black .
here 's who put them up and who are avi@@ d pen@@ cil users .
do you know what slow@@ s it down ?
it cuts them off from their own capacity to love .
it 's also going to now happen in virtual spaces , and we have to get better at fig@@ uring that out .
we sent it over to Uganda .
so that 's where Ki@@ va is today , just to bring you right up to the present .
we 've got to go out there and clean this thing up . "
he said , " I can cho@@ p your head off right away and bring you back to life . "
it had a revolutionary pros@@ thetic f@@ itment and delivery system , a quick mol@@ ding and modular components , enabling custom @@@ -@@ @ made , on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ spot lim@@ b fit@@ ments .
go back to the turn of the first century AD , and if you took the global economic pi@@ e and divided it up into equal sl@@ ices for everyone in the world , everyone would get a few hundred dollars .
the 25 percent . this lights the brain up .
they were the world 's largest marine @@@ -@@ @ protected area up until last week when the Ch@@ ag@@ os Arch@@ ipel@@ ago was declared .
many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
and I 'll leave you with one final slide , that is : how do we scale this up ?
we 've been testing this now for the last five months on just our personal home users in Australia before we think about rolling it out to schools .
