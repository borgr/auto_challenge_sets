the F@@ ounding Fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activists , and this is why .

we also have a lot of engineers in those meetings , and they don 't always do their laundry as much as they should .

Oh , it 's almost 50 / 50 . ok@@ ay .
most of you said U , which is right .
so , as the old saying goes , if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script , then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30 @@@ -@@ @ day challenges , my self @@@ -@@ @ confidence grew .

we call it the N@@ 170 component .
and what I mean by this is that when we direct attention to the face , it becomes clearer and more salient , it 's easier to see .
to kind of bring it back , I 'd like to make a prediction about your attention for the remainder of my talk .
so we might ask why do we do this ?
because those are the moments in which their attention is most likely to be vulnerable , because of stress and mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .

in fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .

this one is called the Talk to Y@@ our@@ self H@@ at .
( la@@ ughter ) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .
and so when I was first living in New York City a few years back , I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them .
or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool , like an ic@@ y meg@@ aph@@ one that I can use to ampl@@ ify my voice when I direct it at the ice .
but really the most satisfying experience I 've had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , I actually made a device called the Gl@@ ac@@ ier Em@@ brac@@ ing Su@@ it .

women have two copies of that big X chro@@ mos@@ ome ; men have the X and , of course , that small copy of the Y.
is that a big number ?
and perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es -- decided they would want to sequence it .
then we bring that into software and reas@@ sem@@ ble it , and tell you what the story is .

simply the ID that denies you health care .
people are living far longer now , and for the first time in human history , it 's common for four generations to be living side by side .

and La@@ en@@ ne@@ c thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abd@@ omen using what he called " the cylinder . "
I say that because these are difficult patients .
and so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and I tried not to interrupt them .
the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this , but here 's what you should do , here 's what we should do . "
I took this to my colleagues at Stan@@ ford in anthro@@ pology and told them the same story .

that 's what happens in academic journals , it 's what happens at academic conferences -- the Q & amp ; A session after a post@@ doc presents data is often a blood@@ bath .
if there is publication bias , if small negative trials have gone missing in action , you can see it on one of these graphs .

and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they 're sick .
in urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside , but they don 't have the sense of belonging .
and also , the bit@@ ter@@ ness and even resent@@ ment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .

a father posted his son 's picture onto the Internet .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
and I said , " What is that ? "
who on Earth would write something as con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted and complex and in@@ ane ?
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types .
and this type of activity goes on for quite a while , until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs .
so why despair when the unexpected knoc@@ ks on the horizon ?
but it was@@ n 't until I got older and I learned more about the National Park System that I realized just how lucky I was .

there was no official investigation into his death .
he realized we had an intention to tell a different version of events ; we were skep@@ tical .

( la@@ ughter ) So I made series of images , cut@@ tings , and I assembled them in portfolios .

it is a paper@@ cutting , and then after , I added color on the computer .

I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now .

we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that 's what we 'd like to know .

I 'm going to add some resource from the left , here , that def@@ uses into the system , and you can see , they really like that .

if you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful .
and the way that Generation G is different from X , Y , and all the different generations that we may belong to , is that video games are the primary form of entertainment that Generation G is consuming .
part of the reason gam@@ ification has become such an emer@@ gent topic right now is because of Generation G 's effect on culture and society already .
it turns out that we are already out of touch .
they 're the ones who had to deal with the summer of love and sex and drugs and all that kind of stuff .
so we already are doing solar engineering .
but it 's so little , it would be like putting a handful of chal@@ k into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain .
and I do worry about that .
but I 'm really afraid we need much , much more .
it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country .
this is a potential threat .
the smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years .

" could be I 'm wrong . I 'm tired of being wrong .
but if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane , I think you need to learn to live , not without regret , but with it .
so let 's start off by defining some terms .
why ?
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
but it turns out that regret feels aw@@ ful in four very specific and consistent ways .
but I want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one .
we 're incredibly used to not having to face life 's hard realities , in a certain sense .
and this do@@ es@@ n 't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life .
I mean , even the stupid " reply all " regrets can leave us in a fit of ex@@ cruci@@ ating ag@@ ony for days .

but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
and then he said , " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . "

you don 't actually have to hear it .
you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
I believe that journalism is a public good .
so they 're collaborating with reporters , because for many researchers , it 's difficult for them to write a simple story or a clear story .
and it was a discussion with Rev@@ i that brought us to the edge of the researcher and repor@@ ter , that fu@@ zz@@ y boundary .
it 's a ter@@ rific story .
this also is not a research picture .
research environments and reporting trips and NGO projects are very intimate environments ; you make good friends while you 're doing good work .

Lu@@ ana : we 're just a tool for people that want to send a positive message .
their ability to do that is strengthened when they 're enabled with modern technology .
you of course want to record maybe how thick something is , which you can 't measure from space , whether that 's soil or snow .
she 's able to give back and really contribute in a meaningful way .
however , we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molec@@ ule for one @@@ -@@ @ time use .
you have a voice through the arts that do@@ es@@ n 't judge what you 've been through .
so never stop fighting to stand in your light because even in your dar@@ k@@ est times , we see you .
old Man River , Big M@@ ud@@ dy .
I strongly believe we can translate the science , bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment .
we all want a clean environment .
thank@@ fully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
imagine your internet access went off for a day , and when it came back , it only stayed on for three hours at a time , with random 15 @@@ -@@ @ hour out@@ ages ?
as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment , it do@@ es@@ n 't matter .
your a@@ or@@ ta comes up behind your heart , it 's your major ar@@ tery -- and it was se@@ vered , so my blood was g@@ ur@@ gling out of my mouth .
and my lung collapsed , so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well , to stop that catastrophic event from happening .
it was like I was giving them a remote control over the information .
( la@@ ughter ) He was wrong .
it takes 10 cal@@ ories of fossil fuel energy in our highly industrialized food system in order to produce one cal@@ ori@@ e of food energy .
why not green food ?
( la@@ ughter ) So I 'm going to take you to task , guys .
so here 's the new history of ga@@ str@@ onomy .
and it 's also due , sometimes , to the fact that doctors and patients are fal@@ sely influenced by advertising campaigns of pharmaceutical companies .
except that they 're not as rich as ours , because they don 't have a cere@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x like we do .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our en@@ co@@ der and trans@@ duc@@ er .
once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one .
other conditions show people the future self .
sc@@ ra@@ ps of men do not exist .
people like Mahmoud are agents of change .
well now you should see me .
I thought , " Oh my g@@ os@@ h . I 'm going to become a Cro@@ t@@ ch@@ ety old lady . "
and you 're able to go back and forgive them .
you can work to change your relationship to your past .
these live in a global space which is largely unregulated , not subject to the rule of law , and in which people may act free of constraint .
you see , our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel , the Internet , satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their po@@ ison , which is about destroying our systems and our ways .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gent@@ lemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spa@@ w@@ ning more U.@@ N. institutions .
in fact , what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
it is no longer the case .
and unfortunately , when I first received the answers -- and here , you 'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed .
51 % wanted to turn his or her life into a story .
you don 't have to read any books .
I 'm really not sure , and I 'm not here to tell you to burn your DVD player and throw out your Tol@@ sto@@ y .
well , we focus on needs and people and context .
it 's crucial to understand , I believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom @@@ -@@ @ up .
medical appointments would be scheduled during business hours , and I knew that I would need time off to recover from surgical procedures .
but in each one of your cells , each str@@ and of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nan@@ ometers long .
it 's involved with the growing of the micro@@ tu@@ b@@ ules , and it 's able to transi@@ ently couple onto them .
but this is the kind of community I was thinking of -- a lun@@ ar community It had all of the same needs as a community on Earth would have , but it had some very unique constraints .
and thor@@ ium is not a rare substance , either .
there are many sites like this one in I@@ da@@ ho , where an area the size of a football field would produce enough thor@@ ium each year to power the entire world .
after every criminal and societal sanction that we can come up with , people still use drugs , and far too many die .
many people who were reliant on a steady supply of prescription drugs turned to heroin .
over@@ doses are un@@ common .
this year even more people will get caught up in the illegal drug trade .
why is this ?
it 's like we need some mel@@ odic Vi@@ ag@@ ra in our culture , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
these people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued -- they 've argued that believing in God is ak@@ in to believing in fai@@ ries and essentially that the whole thing is a chil@@ dish game .
in there , we 'll find a lot of the tru@@ ths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
I 'm an independent , individual person . "
" give us the new , " we 're always saying .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
what is a calendar ?
and the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
they 're selling us shoes and cars .
I 'm going to show you one example of what I 'm talking about .
we have a bun@@ ch of engineers , but none of them could please this client .
yes , our workforce needs specialized skill , but that skill requires a far less rigorous and formalized education than it did in the past .
the first metric is : is it sustainable ?
we actually have a solution for that .
and the answer is : yes .
here 's the plant species . Sal@@ ic@@ or@@ nia vir@@ g@@ in@@ ica .
we do things because of other things .
and so really , there are all these things , like beliefs , desires , sens@@ ations , experiences , they 're all related to each other , and that just is you .
there are lots of different processes in the brain , all of which operate , in a way , quite independently .
you might think that if it 's true , that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self , no permanent essence , does that mean that really , the self is an illusion ?
for one thing , it 's always changing .
of course the water that flows through the water@@ fall is different every single instance .
I 've heard some fantastic musicians this morning , and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them .
is this an envelope we 're living inside of , or no , does it go onto in@@ fin@@ ity in both time and space ?
and when I jumped into that water , I y@@ elled in my mother 's French , " C@@ oura@@ ge ! "
I don 't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
and at 41 hours , this body cou@@ ld@@ n 't make it .
I 'll just swim right through them .
we 've got Ben@@ ad@@ ry@@ l on board . if I get st@@ ung , I 'll just gr@@ in and bear it .
he had a potentially life @@@ -@@ @ threatening condition called ep@@ ig@@ lot@@ ti@@ tis .
I mean , it 's self @@@ -@@ @ awareness that separ@@ ates Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens from earlier instances of our mankind .
so my question to you is , can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape ?
this is actually a bra@@ in@@ wave sensor that 's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk .
now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
well , actually it came from a bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming exercise , probably a technique that many of you use , It 's this notion of testing your ideas .
and say , labor is cheap , land is cheap .
( la@@ ughter ) So we said mobile shel@@ ving - We 'll put them on mobile shel@@ ving .
and so we got underway on that and then I 'm sitting on my cou@@ ch in 2008 .
others work through the instrument of money .
why did I choose the gun as my instrument ?
war is simply no longer the best option , and that is why violence has decreased .
to understand how T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Fi@@ elds work , we first need to understand what are electric fields .
10 years ago , Dr. Pal@@ ti founded a company called Nov@@ oc@@ ure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
and then the second group received only T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Field therapy .
so I 'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial .
it 's still there .
she underwent four different regimes of chem@@ otherapy over two years , none of which had an effect .
thank you .
the first thing I want to do is start with a graph .
and into the silence , I said , " I 'd be happy to speak at your school , but that 's not a wellness week , that 's a sickness week .
the absence of disease is not health .
and I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success , which is this : if I work harder , I 'll be more successful .
and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and back@@ wards for two reasons .
essentially , to deliver an@@ esthe@@ sia , you want as pure oxygen as possible , because eventually you 're going to dil@@ ute it , essentially , with the gas .
I sh@@ ud@@ der to say simple ; it 's straightforward .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
so I 've talked a lot about an@@ esthe@@ sia , and I tend to do that .
who gets safe surgery and who do@@ es@@ n 't ?
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi @@@ -@@ @ log curves .
now the question that I 'd like to ask is , if you look at these expon@@ ential curves , they don 't go on forever .
now in order to do that I 'm going to have to talk about a bun@@ ch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ dless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
and I say , " Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
and now let 's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
so I 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
but they do the job .
and yet , we don 't quite understand the options of it .
so , fool@@ ish@@ ly or otherwise , I decided to build my own home .
trust me , the discomfort can range from minor anno@@ y@@ ance to feeling physically unsafe .
and I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called " m@@ ama " or something like it did@@ n 't feel like me at all .
now one of the most common things that happens when people meet us is for people to " mom " me .
but despite this risk , I know as El@@ li@@ ot gets older and grows into her consciousness and language skills , if I don 't correct people , she will .
I had to engage with some of my most uncomfortable parts to move towards my most authentic self .
so I talk about it more , I explore the depths of this discomfort and find language that I feel comfortable with .
I want her to see my journey towards authenticity even when it means showing her the m@@ essi@@ er parts .
we need to use it as a means , not as an end .
no , I don 't think so .
art becomes a very important part of our national identity .
she lives in New York City , but she do@@ es@@ n 't try to be a Western artist .
we will open the museum in a few days , and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Air@@ ways and come and join us .
it 's important for two things .
no drilling technology in the industry is capable of getting through rock that hard and that deep fast enough to save their lives .
te@@ aming is team@@ work on the fly .
of course , in te@@ aming , the stakes are@@ n 't always life and death .
OK . five years into the project , not a whole lot had happened .
( la@@ ughter ) All right .
well that 's not true , but we 'll get to the go@@ ose in a minute .
so it 's real easy to tell them apart .
and we want to look at these three first .
but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related .
the sp@@ ik@@ es on the back of the Sty@@ g@@ im@@ olo@@ ch are actually resor@@ bing , which means they 're getting smaller as that d@@ ome is getting bigger .
I mean , here 's Ed@@ mon@@ t@@ osa@@ ur@@ us and An@@ ato@@ tit@@ an .
we know this because trying to find a place to live is an example of an optimal stopping problem .
if it 's been a long time since you last accessed that piece of information , it 's probably going to be a long time before you 're going to need to access it again .
because , of course , it 's not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
and I see the same process with combining photographs .
but combined , they can create something like this .
the bell had run@@ g , and I was seated at my desk , when one of my students , who is deaf , approached me and said that he 'd like to join the military .
RO@@ TC , which stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps , allows students working on their college maj@@ ors to concurrently participate in the RO@@ TC program .
I fig@@ ured I better stand in the second line , so I could watch what the cade@@ ts were doing in the row ahead of me .
it 's the number one contamin@@ ant of groundwater , drinking water , rain water .
for those of you who don 't know , we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
and I have to take a little bit of artistic license .
we are in effect polluting our children .
this is my toxic baby .
on this type of mou@@ th@@ part , the man@@ di@@ bles themselves are not actually used for eating .
they stal@@ k bl@@ iss@@ ful couples and study their every move and man@@ ner@@ ism .
we produce hap@@ pier , more stable and more successful kids .
and from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity , some perspective on it , I realized this seems a little bit dangerous .
and like anyone , my views on many things have changed , and hopefully mat@@ ured , like my potential career choice .
it 's a very simple thing . it 's got one kno@@ b , on / off .
( music ) ( Heart @@@ -@@ @ beat ) We 've all got navigation controls in our car .
they might weigh up to two tons .
and then they 'd to@@ w the shar@@ ks back to Pur@@ teen Harb@@ our , bo@@ il them up , use the oil .
nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened .
so it does seem to be that bas@@ king shar@@ ks , for some reason , have incredibly low diversity .
so Les did a fin@@ er study , and he found out it came out about 9,000 .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster @@@ -@@ @ hard@@ ened veterans that Haiti was something different .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender @@@ -@@ @ based violence .
we have just published an evaluation of this program , and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable .
and 73 percent of them shared it .
right across the developing world , citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change , positive change , in their own communities .
they are telling their own story , by@@ passing the official narrative .
they 're normally back@@ room or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strateg@@ ists .
there are no more reasons not to do it .
and the Book of Chron@@ ic@@ les , the Book of E@@ z@@ ra in the Hebrew scrip@@ tures reported in ringing terms .
to see this object in Tehran , thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it .
and also because that 's where , in terms of our own self @@@ -@@ @ interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
I would bet many more of you in@@ sure your iPhone -- you 're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty .
if you think about the problem of ban@@ anas versus choc@@ ol@@ ates , we think we 're going to eat ban@@ anas next week .
save More Tom@@ orrow makes it easy .
if you 're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again .
he died broken by history .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
the sm@@ ells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
it can be a profoundly life @@@ -@@ @ affirming thing to do , even if it is@@ n 't always easy .
Bob@@ by 's own death , so similar to John 's , seems somehow fitting .
the other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular , or something like that , never having actually gotten physical access to your car .
well , you compromise the car by a buffer over@@ flow of vulnerability in the software , something like that .
they vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ ed people on a bus , and then they post @@@ -@@ @ processed the video .
the acceler@@ ometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone .
it 's the Supreme Court , right ?
so we 're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
thank you .
it involved 17 different projects around the world .
and to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool , because knowing how many fish are there is really critical .
and so from this we 're able to identify these blue highways , these hot spots in the ocean , that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation .
the Ocean Bio@@ geographic Information System is the database for all the census data .
what I 've plo@@ tted up here is the data that we have on hand .
we 've got about 75 percent of the fish , maybe as much as 90 percent .
and as the oceans go so shall we .
we used the dust in laboratory experiments and found that it induced cardiovascular dysfunction in rats .
how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Mid@@ west for example ?
we need to accept the fear and then we need to act .
so let 's look at what this last century has been to see where we 're going .
you see , scarcity is contex@@ tual , and technology is a resource @@@ -@@ @ liber@@ ating force .
he 's the du@@ de on the left .
it 's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
I 'll tell you a little bit more about this .
now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always fav@@ ored the man of action over the " man " of contempl@@ ation .
all right , let 's get ready for the worst TED Talk ever .
and we began making food that people could recognize , not things that come from a far@@ away place in plastic bags that you open and you CA@@ N@@ NOT even smell .
I went to FE@@ MA . they kicked me out with eight ar@@ mo@@ red guards and AK @@@ -@@ @ 47@@ s .
we brought the first water purification system to the island of Vi@@ equ@@ es , where we could be filtering one gall@@ on per minute .
Volunteers will go to the edges of the island .
José Andr@@ és : this is great . this is how good my talk was .
salvation Army came and asked me for 420 meals on a Wednesday rainy night for a local elderly shop .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
and sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it do@@ es@@ n 't have when it do@@ es@@ n 't .
I had some , your sister had some . have some beer . "
I said , " No , I don 't feel right about that . y '@@ all go ahead . y '@@ all go ahead . "
we love technology . we love creativity .
56 percent of all rape cases don 't result .
and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
we all want affir@@ mations that our lives have meaning .
and the idea is that the character has an inner motor , a dominant , un@@ conscious goal that they 're striving for , an itch that they can 't scratch .
cycl@@ ist : who are you ?
use what you know . draw from it .
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Ven@@ us .
this imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
a war@@ mer ocean releases CO2 , just as a warm C@@ oca @@@ -@@ @ Col@@ a does .
what sea level rise can we look forward to ?
the last time CO2 was 390 ppm , today 's value , sea level was higher by at least 15 meters , 50 feet .

we can 't ignore the stat@@ s , either .
and that is who you are . "
the small things we make can work to reinforce our assumptions about the world .
this first project is a holiday card I made for my friends .
and I did that through a holiday card , of course .
and as you can see , it 's a story about itself .
we have assumptions about material experience , like that paper should be silent or that websites should be flat .
but we also have these assumptions -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) that should be a lot sc@@ ari@@ er in a democracy , because they 're like these little thought loop@@ holes .
and Daniel Dun@@ nam , my other half , and I formed the beli@@ ev@@ ability team .
more nef@@ arious are companies like De Be@@ ers , who are making amen@@ ds for their sale of blood diamonds by don@@ ating pros@@ the@@ tics to war @@@ -@@ @ torn African countries .
they can heal and they can kill ...
I had no idea which direction was home .
who are we in our breath ?
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career .
you know what ? here 's a little secret : you want to work ? you want to work really , really , really hard ?
the world will give you the opportunity to work really , really , really , really hard .
I want to be a great friend .
but why don 't we see any evidence of it ?
they 're being wheeled out onto deck .
they 're absolutely some of the cool@@ est creatures on Earth .
in the last several years , two groups have introduced home sperm @@@ -@@ @ testing devices that are iPhone @@@ -@@ @ based and that are easy to use .
so he understood that the sun was directly above the city of Sw@@ en@@ et , because looking down a well , it was a straight line all the way down the well , right past the guy 's head up to the sun .
it 's actually hitting a tooth .
what happens when you look at what the disco@@ ve@@ rers were thinking about when they made their discoveries , is you understand that they are not so different from us .
let 's see , I 'd say about three or four percent .
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference .
ok@@ ay , that 's the majority .
now it 's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete met@@ aph@@ or .
and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new super@@ organisms .
nonetheless , when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement , they can move mountains .
this is why politics is so tribal .
nowadays we fly around like individual be@@ es ex@@ ul@@ ting in our freedom .

we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities , and that 's how we 're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream .
we think about the user interface .
but what we 've found is they like the flu@@ idity of the 3 @@@ -@@ @ D model .
now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since N@@ ap@@ ster first came on the scene .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's true .
( appl@@ ause ) Or about 7@@ 5,000 jobs .
and so many of the calls went like this , " Dr. Brown , we loved your TED talk .
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
and we 're going to walk in .
I know those things that happened to you growing up .
which means , yes , I have a little shame ; no , I 'm a soci@@ op@@ ath .
( la@@ ughter ) But he really list@@ ens -- because that 's all we need -- I 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work .
he 's kind of a classic , tim@@ eless @@@ -@@ @ type personality , so we did H@@ err@@ ing@@ bone t@@ weed , but in pol@@ ished nickel .

he was literally standing on a floating pl@@ exig@@ l@@ ass deck over his ad@@ oring fans , who had no choice but to praise to Ye@@ e@@ z@@ us up above .
it could become a really very important civic space .
your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we 'll some@@ day make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?
ye@@ ah , sure , I 'm game for it .
ca : Bo@@ one , I really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation .
where do women get fat ?
the second reason we really liked M@@ RI is that there 's no radiation .
that 's all stem cells .
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
we are bending the curve .

I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Hom@@ eland Security has .
he says that , " If at first you don 't succeed , hide all evidence you ever tried . "
but other days I am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a doll@@ house to sit with the others at the long table .
and I thought , surely , we do better than that .
thank you .
and let me repeat what you saw last year .
we can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am I choosing here ?
this we can call Dol@@ lar Street .
and the interesting thing , when you go around here in the photo panor@@ ama , you see the family still sitting on the floor there .
it comes beyond here , when you really can get good working conditions in the family .
and they are very , very eag@@ erly interested to get advice , and that 's to survive in poverty .

I think you cou@@ ld@@ n 't be human if you did@@ n 't ask those questions .
one young woman I met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college .
like the concrete block , the transi@@ stor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
the nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don 't learn at schools .
to enjoy being decei@@ ved , an audience must first suspend its dis@@ belief .
the only way they 're going to lift themselves out of energy poverty is by adapting fuels that are more efficient , that are less expensive , that are better for human health , better for the environment and that are more productive .
and I 'm g@@ onn@@ a share the secret recipe of how we did that .
and they can be applied to any business or social cause .
a s@@ warm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen of their own will to conver@@ ge on a common goal .
I 'm a woman who loves getting texts who 's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem .
it says you 're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
this is not like that . I 'm much more like Scot@@ ty .

right . you know what I 'm saying .
and he said , " Frank , I 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . "
so I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
it acti@@ vates the same areas in the brain .
and consol@@ ation behavior -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) it 's em@@ pa@@ thy driven .
one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts sp@@ itting water and intim@@ idating them -- then the choices go down .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's as if they 're saying , " If you 're not be@@ having , I 'm not going to be pro @@@ -@@ @ social today . "

everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not .
this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bi@@ onic human .

it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
I am an im@@ post@@ or .
I don 't feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
and so I want to say to you , don 't fake it till you make it .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
you know , when people say , " I don 't get art .
but I found a sign for Russian @@@ -@@ @ speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
my favorite ones are " no plants . " why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? I 'm not sure .

we evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous , and abundance meant survival .
we just haven 't had the tools to look at inter@@ acting bra@@ ins simultaneously .
throughout all of history , if you wanted something written , a report or an article , you had to involve a person .
it was written by an algorithm .
so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when I look at what 's going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey .
I 'm with him ; I 'm going to echo his words : " I , for one , welcome our new computer over@@ lords . "

hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
his name is No@@ stra@@ dam@@ us , although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Se@@ an Con@@ ner@@ y . ( la@@ ughter ) And like most of you , I suspect , I don 't really believe that people can see into the future .
now these are stories from basic science .

some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
and you can just imagine them .
it was@@ n 't just your standard installation .
over the past six months , I 've spent my time traveling . I think I 've done 60,000 miles , but without leaving my desk .
and then I struggled , because I was thinking to myself , " What should I talk ? what should I do ? it 's a TED audience .
you don 't believe me , do you ? ok@@ ay . ( appl@@ ause ) So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don 't understand .
people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen .
so I 'll put a little line up here which represents learning , and that 's how we used to do it . we could see things , understand them , take the time to put them into practice .
let 's go to this Google Map , and I 'll show you how you can edit it .
feelings are tunnels .
if you 're experiencing unwanted pain , talk to a medical provider .
is it sex @@@ -@@ @ related to have pressure directly against your cl@@ itor@@ is ?

but the question is , why is it obvious ?
when we do , however , make a turn into a side street , our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 @@@ -@@ @ degree angle .
maybe you 've had that experience as well .
in the 19@@ 30s , Harry Bec@@ k applied the principles of schem@@ atic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever .
so when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago , I tried to make sense of that .
I 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the qu@@ ays and West@@ mo@@ reland Street .
they 're splitting the cost of installing these green roof@@ s with home and building owners .
third , adapting to rising seas .
there are no quick fixes .
ok@@ ay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
but I got a little bad news for you fol@@ ks . I got some bad news .
but it was@@ n 't until we tested it in people that we actually knew .
so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous .
fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States .
right ? when I got these results , I started talking to doctors , and they told me not to tell anyone , and my reaction is , " Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease ? "
and in biology , the numbers are even better .
we 've mentioned the health , but it needs consumers to buy into it .
we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive .
if we look at al Qaeda . Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a sou@@ k somewhere which not many people had heard of .
what I 'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @@@ -@@ @ up calls for us ?
I did@@ n 't have the tools . I lacked the experience .
more precisely , the timber yard of a hardware store .
what else do tra@@ dies love ?
Tra@@ dies especially , and I 'm a tradi@@ e myself , we love egg and bac@@ on rolls .
it 's because perception is grounded in our experience .
the first step was to ask a question .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
I am very , very happy to be amid@@ st some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're reflecting on my glasses .
I have listened to the three previous speakers , and guess what happened ?
it may have jeopardized short @@@ -@@ @ term sales , but it builds lasting , long @@@ -@@ @ term loyalty based on shared values .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
if you include Internet tele@@ phony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
or think of investment . take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 .
and then finally , the one stati@@ stic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen : the export @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ GDP ratio .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
" foreign aid is the most aid to poor people , " is about the most home @@@ -@@ @ biased thing you can find .
so that 's why we 're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
and it 's getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that 's great . we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems .
when I got to the - For the next four , five years , I was held in four different children 's homes .
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of dis@@ g@@ ust sensitivity .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know @@@ -@@ @ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
but anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them .
the kind of part of the mind when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
people live for love .
and I think that the television is like the global cam@@ p@@ fire .
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you 've made love to them .
wounds are sc@@ ary , they are nasty , they are ick@@ y , it is why most of us look away when we don@@ ate blood .
anger is important ; it is the fire that cau@@ ter@@ izes our wounds and lets them scar over and heal .
a front @@@ -@@ @ row seat to their torture chamber ?
in all those years , with that guy cha@@ ined to my side , I got a lot done .
pretty soon , that little pos@@ se started to crowd me out of my own body and my own experience .
so these are my illusion glasses .
wake up .
and that can be seen directly through a micro@@ scope , and I 'm going to show you some of this today .
you have bits of a volcan@@ o . there 's a little bit of a volcan@@ o there . you have tube wor@@ ms .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
the first thing I 'm going to tell you about this mam@@ mal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly .
so among and within b@@ ats is a huge variation in their ability to use sen@@ sory perception .
and indeed , in this image , you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five b@@ ats .
some ? how about 30 ?
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night sk@@ ies , and you see this beautiful flying mam@@ mal , I want you to smile . thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
so in 2007 , we brought the campaign across here , and it was , it set the stage for the campaign .
( la@@ ughter ) And he said , " I 'm doing it for Mo@@ v@@ ember . " and I said , " So am I. " And I said , " T@@ ell me your Mo@@ v@@ ember story . "
so they identified that as a priority , and then they 've got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic , essentially the same topic .
any of those yes responses are what we called mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that be so cool , and that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
they 're just the right tools for the job .
and this is a little @@@ -@@ @ known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
it was@@ n 't really what people needed .
now , the S@@ ock P@@ up@@ pet , on the other hand , is a totally different animal . the s@@ ock pup@@ pet is@@ n 't about ambiguity , per se . it 's about identity .
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile .
if I were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ?
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
this is@@ n 't a dec@@ eption @@@ -@@ @ detection machine to tell if your gir@@ l@@ friend 's lying to you on text messaging .
my out@@ box for email is massive , and I never look at it . I write all the time , but I never look at my record , at my trace .
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms .
and it was such a blow that it wo@@ ke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , I guess .
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lin@@ gered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night .
in fact , this is better than a wheel , because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach , you will notice it 's very hard to do .
( sound of running air ) Yes !
you don 't plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework .
I was air@@ lifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney .
I had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above , as if it was happening to someone else .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward , we would never be the same .
and she said , " You 're going to get depressed . "
so someone tells us the story about super@@ t@@ as@@ kers , so this two percent of people who are able to control multi@@ t@@ asking environment .
people have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magne@@ ts to let them know that the revolution is near , so stock up .
they also stop passing on the virus .
so my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim , so to , you know , Indians , and L@@ ati@@ no@@ s , everyone , if you 're brown -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Here 's my advice to my brown friends .
you see , my si@@ bl@@ ings and I are the first generation to go to university , so for a family of immigrants , this was kind of a big deal .
it was a 7.6 magnitude . it was fairly big .
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source , and in this case , these guys were New York food blog@@ gers .
there is not the s@@ ligh@@ test prospect of any gain whatsoever .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
who would have thought that two young guys and a start @@@ -@@ @ up would beat out Google Video ? why ?
so there you have it : the evolution of a head@@ line .
I have to say , this sounds awesome . ( la@@ ughter ) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so I went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuro@@ scientists at MI@@ T fig@@ ured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling ne@@ ural activity in a specific part of their brain .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
because you 're not in the Middle East .
now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name .
the ver@@ b is the chassis of the sentence .
so which ver@@ bs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the ver@@ b specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change .
on the other hand , you want the dam@@ n gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole .
and you can think of it in terms of a game @@@ -@@ @ theore@@ tic pay@@ off matrix .
it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those stor@@ y@@ lines and patterns of mind .
and the answer is this thing .
so the males will go out , they 'll look for females , they 'll mate . if they mate successfully , then no off@@ spring .
and now what we 're doing is we 're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000 , so we can see this work at big scale .
so there 's a lot we can do , but who 's going to push them to do it ?
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
an author visited our school , Jack Gan@@ tos .
( la@@ ughter ) And a video camera .
my grand@@ parents , they were in the middle of it .
Mrs. Al@@ is@@ ch cut in front of the line and said , " I taught him how to read . " ( la@@ ughter ) And then something happened that changed my life .
now , I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
and I think the answer that they 're looking for is , " If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er and you have sh@@ ini@@ er hair , you will be so happy and fab@@ ulous . "
now , sunlight , of course , comes into this .
anyway , I came back from Australia , and despite the obvious risks to my health , I moved to A@@ ber@@ de@@ en .
but I also became interested in research , and in particular I became interested in this substance , nit@@ ric oxide .
and I started doing research , and we found , very ex@@ ci@@ tingly , that the skin produces nit@@ ric oxide .
it arises in the skin .
and that 's the key to success .
it devastated me when my mother did that to me .
maybe it 's not just the spar@@ kly dress .
what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo , and I don 't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .
thank you .
it 's b@@ oring , who ca@@ res , and it suc@@ ks . "
now , the story that I start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story .
because it took a lot of craf@@ ty work to infec@@ t this bacter@@ ium .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
so a professional science writer would say , " That has to go .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
she may have pos@@ sessions that she would like to trade at times she do@@ es@@ n 't need them .
( c@@ ric@@ kets ch@@ ir@@ ping ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( ch@@ om@@ ping ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) As kids are creating projects like this , they 're learning to code , but even more importantly , they 're coding to learn .
when you learn to code , it opens up for you to learn many other things .
he wanted to keep score .
I get it .
three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents bat@@ ted an e@@ yel@@ ash either .
[ " what does equality mean to you ? " ] [ " Marriage " ] [ " Freedom " ] [ " Civil rights " ] [ " T@@ reat every person as you 'd treat yourself " ] It 's when you don 't have to think about it , simple as that .
once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
thank you .
what is it , then ?
let 's look at today .
but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells , with your genes and your environment , and you print your own personal medicine .
" safer ? why ? they have posted more policemen here ? "
the freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of an@@ archy in the city , while the barbar@@ ism of the ' 9@@ 0s brought about a loss of hope for the city .
but people were waiting in long qu@@ eu@@ es under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
and finally , this ra@@ vel@@ ing can also lead to more and more damage .
P@@ isa has transformed that debate , and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany .
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did Hungary .
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success .
so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which CA@@ N@@ NOT be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system .
so if it 's a cell or a ter@@ m@@ ite or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
and across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent .
it is the only Ger@@ man@@ ic language that requires this .
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
well , she did that because she , at that time , had acquired a new arm .

people cross oceans to go see them .
so I went back and I had to go back to the tradition .

I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
as I spoke to the women , they told me , " You know what we need ? we really need a school for girls . "
because there had not been any school for girls .
but she was older . she was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade .
( appl@@ ause ) I want to challenge you today .
ok@@ ay ? friends , family and financi@@ ers .
but we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been mis@@ educated about it , and we have to admit that .
that 's the honest truth .
the point I 'm making is that it is a crime .
we 're standing today in the Central Bank , and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I 'm going to be speaking about .
it went right into my heart .
one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
and I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council , which is a not @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ profit .
the Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
you could see what I applied for and what replies I got .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
in Su@@ therland 's system , companies don 't use large , massive projects that take two years .

it turns out there 's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal .
so move where you sit . that 's adap@@ tability .
our instinc@@ t as parents is to order our kids around .
to me that is a certified ag@@ ile miracle .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And by the way , research backs this up too .
so ag@@ ile is great for stimulating progress , but I kept hearing time and again , you need to preserve the core .
and suddenly we were worried , like , do we have a mean girl on our hands ?
in fact , they need to be able to read discer@@ n@@ ingly .
and so on . so I suddenly fig@@ ured that , how come all the rich people are having these extra@@ ordinarily gif@@ ted children ?
about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .

some people say , " Well , that 's just because those M@@ BA types are gre@@ edy . "
but we don 't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity .
our attitude is , " Well , look , if you can get the advertising donated , you know , to air at four o 'clock in the morning , I 'm ok@@ ay with that .

moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific ne@@ ur@@ ons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those ne@@ ur@@ ons .
so how do we ask this question ?
now , in gene@@ tics , it 's a little counter@@ intuitive .

I think you 're right , which is , when people talk about Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , they talk about the shows that move them : " 13 Re@@ as@@ ons Why " or " The Crown . "
instead , we 've seen great viewing across a whole range -- " Black Mir@@ ror " -- we 're fil@@ ming season five now .
and that was a struggling show when it was only in the BBC .

I could have put the two voices in different spatial locations , I could have made one lou@@ der .
I believe it is the era of the emp@@ ath .
let 's face it : driving is dangerous .
why ?
a lot of times at a crime scene when people see a sk@@ elet@@ on@@ ized body , they think , " W@@ ow , this has been here for a really long time un@@ discovered . "
whether it 's nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
and I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world .
so it 's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here .
that 's between , say at an average use , that 's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that .
( la@@ ughter ) He did@@ n 't mean it compli@@ ment@@ arily , but Jo@@ e put it up in the lobby , he was so proud of it .
we know why .
is this job tough ? you bet@@ cha .
there I learned different things .
he said first , his curi@@ osity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure , about what worked and what did@@ n 't work .
how many places in America are going to change ? none .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
you just had to do things sometimes .
I was like , " You need to go to a hospital , the school nurse , something . "
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
and as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District , you better believe there was some opposition .
three together , that 's spar@@ k@@ les .
so we have gone through almost 30 characters .
the character on the left is two mountains stac@@ ked on top of each other .
and it 's working beautifully .
what it do@@ es@@ n 't count are all the kids who are in school but being dis@@ engaged from it , who don 't enjoy it , who don 't get any real benefit from it .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
but if nobody 's learning anything , she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it .
that 's it .
there 's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Frank@@ lin .
the system we have today is@@ n 't fair to them .
well , unfortunately there 's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems .
the U.S. is@@ n 't number one .
for example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
we also had students fill out surveys with questions like , " Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? "
this building was wired for change .
Hu@@ bert was saying , absolutely correctly , " These are the new ca@@ thedr@@ als . "
last but not least , Em@@ ma believed that you can 't pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
and we concluded a very important insight , which was that as people 's relationships to the things in their lives change , so do their relations with other people .
what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now ?
ho@@ ver the mouse over the " take a photo " button , and you 've got a little cat photo booth .
I always add humans to any technical -- if you 're drawing a technical diagram , put a human in it .
and a huge erup@@ tion of discussion around accessibility came , and we 're really excited about that .
and I love the car@@ rot on the turn@@ table .
we 've learned an amazing amount .
she was rush@@ ed to hospital , but it was too late . she died .
as I thought , that 's most of you .
take , for example , providing a guide dog for a blind person .
that 's a good thing to do , right ?
you never get off , and you never really feel satisfied .
so we can begin to see the seed of a completely open @@@ -@@ @ source , citizen @@@ -@@ @ led urban development model , potentially .
probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Lin@@ us Tor@@ val@@ ds , the open @@@ -@@ @ source pioneer , which was that idea of , " Be la@@ zy like a fox . "
in order to do that in 20 minutes , I have to bring out four ideas -- it 's like four pieces of a puzzle .
so the same Guardi@@ an rebu@@ ts , " Are video games art : the debate that shou@@ ld@@ n 't be .
so it was not very constructive . ( la@@ ughter ) So , I 'm making fun of it , but we discussed this for so many days . you have no idea .
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
so the question is , how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using , and start w@@ asting less of it ?
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future , it is@@ n 't on this slide .
so I was trained to become a gym@@ n@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an , China in the 1970s .
but my ti@@ ger mother said , " No . "
that is me playing my imag@@ inary piano .
an opera singer must start training young to learn ac@@ rob@@ atics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
" honor , " I said . " that 's so different , and better , than obey . "
so because of books , I 'm here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority marty@@ r@@ dom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a per@@ n@@ icious sickness . "
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , I wanted to protect my child from illness .
the sco@@ op was quite a very simple story .
another key story that comes to mind , which relates to this spirit child phenomenon , is " The Sp@@ ell of the Al@@ bin@@ os . "
so I 'm surprised .
how did you end up in jail ? this was just a few weeks ago , I believe , ye@@ ah ?
now I 'm interested in dol@@ ph@@ ins because of their large bra@@ ins and what they might be doing with all that bra@@ in@@ power in the wild .
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dol@@ ph@@ in .
they 're outside the dol@@ ph@@ in 's normal reper@@ toire , but they 're easily m@@ im@@ ic@@ ked by the dol@@ ph@@ ins .
they 're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at , and they 're actually getting so severe that they 're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement .
we 're facing very tough challenges .
but fortunately , Henry Kra@@ mer , who put up the prize for -- that was a one @@@ -@@ @ mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the English Channel , 21 miles .
with on @@@ -@@ @ board GPS , it can navigate autonom@@ ously , and it is ru@@ gged enough to self @@@ -@@ @ land without damage .
and it 's on us to find a way to rebuild trust , because fake news destro@@ ys it .
we 're playing against each other .
you may have noticed in the bas@@ eball and piz@@ za comparison , under the bas@@ eball , it 's all commands .
now she 's got the robot doing it .
democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power , whether it was of ty@@ rants or of high priests , their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth .
democracy could not work without the citizens deliber@@ ating , deb@@ ating , taking on public responsibilities for public affairs .
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
now , more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels .
now if responsibility and transparency are two of the corner@@ stones of representative government , autonomous robo@@ tic weapons could undermine both .
it was a few weeks later , we started receiving all these " Man wol@@ ves will rape you if you go and drive . "
ninety percent said yes , she 's a tra@@ itor .
thank you , everyone .
so , as a reflection of this , we started the Financial Crisis Observatory .
the root mechanism of a dra@@ gon @@@ -@@ @ king is a slow mat@@ uration towards instability , which is the bubble , and the clim@@ ax of the bubble is often the crash .
perhaps more surprisingly , the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine , par@@ tu@@ ri@@ tion , the act of giving birth , ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tic seizures .
we have applied this theory to many systems , land@@ slides , gl@@ ac@@ ier collapse , even to the dynamics of prediction of success : block@@ bu@@ sters , YouTube videos , movies , and so on .
we created the Financial Bu@@ b@@ ble Experi@@ ment .
this is a big deal , so the tic@@ ks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
( appl@@ ause ) In 2010 , for example , there were 8@@ 31 , all over Australia , and the Torres Strait Islands , all states , working to improve the houses where they and their families live , and that 's an important thing .
why ? because that fl@@ ush@@ es the bug out .
we wash the bug out .
they could trap the flies , send them to him in Per@@ th .
kan@@ ji Maya , she 's a mother , and a proud one .
and then I 'll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an in@@ cu@@ rable optim@@ ist .
let 's review them both . first of all , the meg@@ at@@ ren@@ ds .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
and we 've seen a new disease , not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases .
and we had to start all over again .
a disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India , and blin@@ ded half of all of those who were made blind in India , ended .
thank you .
Gre@@ g G@@ age : the oc@@ top@@ us is a rather strange @@@ -@@ @ looking animal that exhibits amaz@@ ingly complex behavi@@ ors .
we 've learned a lot about ourselves from studying marine animals .
and that 's not enough .
because the ocean gives us more than half of the oxygen we breathe , food , it absor@@ bs much of the carbon pollution that we throw in the atmosphere .
and fishing near the surface targets mostly species that migrate between the high seas and country 's waters , like tuna and shar@@ ks .
despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , I 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabol@@ ic syndrome .
you can think of insul@@ in as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
what if obesity is@@ n 't the cause of insul@@ in resistance at all ?
when we become insul@@ in @@@ -@@ @ resistant , the home@@ o@@ sta@@ sis in that balance devi@@ ates from this state .
" it sort of makes you stop and think , do@@ es@@ n 't it . "
and normally , when water free@@ zes , as you know , it expands , and the same thing happens in a cell .
we took the eggs of a related species , a living fro@@ g , and we in@@ activated the nucle@@ us of the egg .
that was a miracle , but it was workable .
we haven 't announced this publicly before .
have a look at this bit of film foot@@ age .
it has to be a different species . what could it be ?
and I 'm positive it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't .
they interview their superi@@ ors , their peers , their sub@@ ordinates . they vet their personal conduct .
and what we 're looking at here is a tr@@ uc@@ k@@ ful of data .
but the problem is , 20 or 30 programs , like , training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology , that is a tiny drop in the buc@@ ket .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous an@@ vil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
now let 's add a my@@ cor@@ rh@@ iza plant into the diagram I used earlier .
if you recall the graphs I showed you earlier , 85 percent of phosph@@ orus is lost in the soil , and the plants are unable to access it .
in other words , as I already said , I have invented nothing .
I 've been up to its front gates .
and there 's Dan E@@ te@@ te .
my first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African iv@@ ory .
in 2011 , natural resource exports out@@ weighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa , Asia and Latin America . nine@@ teen to one .
now let 's go back to the oil and mining companies , and let 's go back to Dan E@@ te@@ te and that $ 1 billion deal .
we 've discovered that our universe is va@@ stly gran@@ der than our ancestors imagined and that life seems to be an almost imper@@ cep@@ ti@@ bly small per@@ turb@@ ation on an otherwise dead universe .
now , AI can generate fake faces and simulate your face saying stuff that you never said .
so all this amazing recent progress in AI really be@@ gs the question : how far will it go ?
what was remarkable is , they explored this keyboard on their own . there was no intervention on our part .
so if we could switch to the audio from this computer , we 've been video conferencing with cognitive animals , and we 're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them .
they 're not really used to having cameras here at 8 o 'clock at night .
the production version , it uses IP version 6 .
whether or not we understand it is a different story .
( la@@ ughter ) And if " Where do you come from ? "
and when I got out of my car , the air was pul@@ sing .
there are lots of music venues on our map .
next , and this is a very big one , we need leadership , and we need a strategy .
they 're volunteer councils , and they work directly with a designated advocate inside of city hall or even the chamber of commerce .
changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .
and that 's no mere hypo@@ the@@ tical example .
after all , for all its gri@@ m , sat@@ anic mills , it worked out pretty well , did@@ n 't it ?
( Be@@ at@@ boxing ) Party , party , ye@@ ah .
and this is unacceptable .
and today I 'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that 's what 's crucial , how and why they set meaningful and aud@@ acious goals , the right goals for the right reasons .
An@@ dy was a superb leader and also a teacher , and he said to me , " John , it almost do@@ es@@ n 't matter what you know .
well , it 's a personal why .
why consciousness ?
ok@@ ay , the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us , and that is , all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them .
the disappointment of robo@@ tics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot , so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing .
and if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like U.@@ K. , Germany , and so on , they 're actually much lower .
but he did have one thing .
this is an am@@ bu@@ cycle .
it has everything an ambulance has except for a bed .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
we started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs .
Jan@@ ine Ben@@ y@@ us : Oh really ?
this is a loc@@ ust . there can be 80 million of them in a square kilome@@ ter , and yet they don 't colli@@ de with one another .
it was like , " Don 't m@@ ess with me .
you saw many examples of my work up there , but it 's one that people know .
let 's pick a bit of data from another three @@@ -@@ @ month @@@ -@@ @ old patient .
the Arabic language do@@ es@@ n 't satisfy today 's needs .
if we did so , they 'd strip us of our clothes .
let 's call this the rhetor@@ ical model , where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand .
there 's no magic w@@ and that 's going to make it disappear .
I don 't have an answer .
one thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
now , for a period of three years , I gathered data , not just me but also some of my friends , and I used to teach in university , so I forced my -- I mean , I asked my students to do this as well .
these people I still do hang out with .
they 've been looking outward for a long time , yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp , right within them .
DP : g minor .
most pi@@ an@@ ists would have a heart attack if you said , " Sor@@ ry , do you mind playing ' F@@ light of the B@@ um@@ ble@@ be@@ e ' in B minor instead of A minor ? " as we went on .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
that was the problem .
in 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
and in 2008 , in Ch@@ eng@@ du , Sic@@ hu@@ an area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
without understanding evolution the right way .
about three billion years ago , mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ul@@ arity evolved .
and in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline , and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company , I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline .
RB : well , I like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a Virgin company , they -- CA : they are quality , Richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?
how much -- what 's the total revenue ?
ca : OK .
ca : OK . so can you use your kn@@ igh@@ thood for anything or is it just ...
and it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
here 's a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net .
RB : I don 't actually think that the stereo@@ type of a business@@ person t@@ reading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works .
RB : yes , I mean , we 've got -- we 're setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word .
we throw it away .
so I 'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea .
good . we 'll talk more about that later , about what are your tips .
the other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate , make worse , the mental illness state .
if you have good sleep , it increases your concentration , attention , decision @@@ -@@ @ making , creativity , social skills , health .
now I was@@ n 't trying to be smart .
( la@@ ughter ) Ano@@ ther thing about pri@@ mes , there is no final biggest prime number .
a random odd number is a lot harder to test .
it was@@ n 't my highlight of 2012 .
do I shake their hand ? do I turn around and run away ?
but is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie cli@@ p so that we can make it different from the original ?
so what would happen here if , while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box , we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks ?
it 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
one of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lo@@ is would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
( la@@ ughter ) I no longer would be cen@@ sored .
it lives half its life inside the cold @@@ -@@ @ blo@@ o@@ ded mosqu@@ ito and half its life inside the warm @@@ -@@ @ blo@@ o@@ ded human .
so the in@@ sect is continually trying to fight off the paras@@ ite , and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off .
OK . so , the first one I was very tim@@ id , and I 'll begin .
this is what someone that specializes in malware and h@@ acking looks like .
today 's cyber@@ criminal , what do they look like ?
find these resources . apply them .
do you have an American Express in your wal@@ let ?
do you remember what it was ?
can I show them ? rather b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re . is this yours , si@@ r ?
and it can be very impressive to watch them at work .
you see the camera fixed on top .
this makes it possible to reach many different targets , such as tum@@ ors , deep inside a solid organ by using one single insertion point .
but of course , we are not even close to what nature fig@@ ured out in millions of years of evolution .
these people are moving pol@@ len from flower to flower with a pa@@ int@@ brush .
tom@@ ato grow@@ ers now put bum@@ ble@@ be@@ e colonies inside the greenhouse to pol@@ lin@@ ate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pol@@ l@@ ination when it 's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes .
now this society has no central authority .
and we call that the mem@@ e @@@ -@@ @ ome .
and as a result , mayors and city coun@@ cillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level , and this is the third feature about mayors , than national governing officials .
they work together in climate change , for example .
Bogo@@ ta , where Mayor M@@ ock@@ us , when he was mayor , he introduced a transportation system that saved energy , that allowed surface buses to run in effect like sub@@ ways , express buses with corridors .
in that journey from pol@@ is to Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ is , we can re@@ discover the power of democracy on a global level .
and the only question is , are you ?
and one night , the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal .
and really , that 's where this case should have ended .
how can you ever know all of this ?
so what do we do about this ? well , the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect , if you will .
and Lu@@ ria said , " At the North Pole , there is always snow .
and you can get moral argument off the ground , then , because you 're not treating moral principles as concrete entities .
you would probably begin by saying , " To do what ? "
how many of you know what I 'm talking about ?
so the net effect of all 250 of these str@@ ands is to fold the long str@@ and into the shape you 're looking for .
and if it 's the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic .
so he says , " All right . "
and ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it , principally having to do with vision .
thank you very much .
Arm@@ strong and Al@@ dr@@ in were alone , but their presence on the moon 's gray surface was the culmination of a con@@ vul@@ sive , collective effort .
A@@ pol@@ lo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological trium@@ phs .
in the middle years of the century , polio was eradicated and small@@ po@@ x eliminated .
we could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the outline of a plan .
but 30 years of research have taught us that fam@@ ines are political crises that catastro@@ ph@@ ically affect food distribution .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
so now , for lob@@ by@@ ists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don 't like to wait , there are companies , line @@@ -@@ @ standing companies , and you can go to them .
now , what this , even this brief debate , brings out is something that many economists overlook .
I 'm not a social problem guy .
it was like a Star Tre@@ k episode , you know ?
you can have fun with paint .
so if you di@@ g below the head@@ lines , though , you 'll see that the people were far ahead of the press , far ahead of the politicians .
quite radical .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evapor@@ ated .
it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
it 'll p@@ at his brother on the shoulder , it 'll answer the phone when it rings , it 'll wave good@@ b@@ ye .
" now , " I said , " now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom -- your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . "
there were many epidemics there .
after 10 years of working overseas , I was exhausted .
and that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed .
and then a bun@@ ch of community activities for changing norms .
some of them were new stories .
and for a while they were familiar formats , but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium .
it was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
I double checked the newspapers .
I want to be able to do what China 's doing .
I would argue the same thing that makes you more Sustain@@ ble is what gives you a higher quality of life , and that 's living in a wal@@ k@@ able neighborhood .
so it creates , in essence , an artificial cav@@ ity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
you can see here a very squ@@ ish@@ y one and now a material that 's also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable tough@@ ness , and it 's no longer b@@ rit@@ tle .
now 60 years later , the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for , like here , where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall .
designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven 't had any education in architecture or design .
and with each inhabit@@ ant finding their own unique way of coming by , this tower becomes like a living city , a place which is alive with micro @@@ -@@ @ economies and small businesses .
I 'm a writer and artist , and I make work about technology .
( la@@ ughter ) And I do these things mostly because I find them completely fascinating , but also because I think when we talk about technology , we 're largely talking about ourselves and the way that we understand the world .
here 's another thing that 's really big on kids ' YouTube .
it 's like , how much do we really understand -- by agency , I mean : how we know how to act in our own best interests .
he was the China representative for the American So@@ y@@ bean Association .
( la@@ ughter ) " Travel the world and have lots of kids . "
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do .
I say , " Ke@@ ep him alive if you can . "
and they were readily available .
the medical professionals too , you out there , you 're in denial too .
in the same span of time , computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude .
and that business is agriculture .
we know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market , and the risks of trans@@ acting in rural , agriculture markets , are extremely high .
about 25 years in total , and then three years ago , I found myself talking to I@@ K@@ EA 's CEO about joining his team .
the second number is six : this is six degrees centi@@ grade , what we 're heading towards in terms of global warming .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
we 've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children 's rights .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don 't always succeed , but they try and deliver .
twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan African growth is slightly better than India .
this amaz@@ ed the ancient Greeks , whose women led restricted indoor lives .
until recently , no one was sure how strong the links were between S@@ cy@@ th@@ ians and the Amaz@@ ons of Greek myth .
more than 1,000 ancient S@@ cy@@ th@@ ian k@@ ur@@ gans , or burial moun@@ ds , have been excav@@ ated , containing sk@@ elet@@ ons and weapons .
is it possible that the my@@ thic realm of thr@@ illing Amazon tales was a way to imagine women and men as equal compan@@ ions ?
they 're susceptible to human error .
and I bet you don 't because you don 't want processed food in your life .
so what do I mean by that ?
all of these ideas , to me , are no@@ st@@ alg@@ ia @@@ -@@ @ free .
and then I did it .
when S@@ wan@@ n is in his je@@ alous thro@@ es , and suddenly he 's listening at door@@ ways and bri@@ bing his mi@@ stress ' servants , he def@@ ends these behavi@@ ors .
is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
I mean , we 're all good citizens of social media , are@@ n 't we , where the currency is en@@ vy ?
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
at first , the first thing I thought was , I want to run away .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and I was living on the dark side .
night after night , he took me up on the terrace , on his shoulders , and pointed out J@@ up@@ iter and Satur@@ n and the Great Be@@ ar to me .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run deci@@ de@@ dly differently .
( la@@ ughter ) And she said to me , when I asked her the obvious , " Radiation do@@ es@@ n 't sc@@ are me . starvation does . "
immediately , the paraly@@ zed rat can stand .
they are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrong@@ do@@ ings .
they 're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
what am I sending to worry about this ? am I sending naked pictures or something ?
my training had started .
he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
maybe a year passes , nothing .
that small town k@@ id with the big city dreams was the suicide bom@@ ber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
for young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a City started in the most unique way imagin@@ able .
and I weighed 220 pounds .
we had also not required developers to build side@@ walks on new developments for a long , long time .
and then came the next stage of the equation .
it was time to push what I called MA@@ PS 3 .
so you can see up here .
now , if we had more people in the room , instead of just wrestling in a closed node , we might reach out and try and grab some other people .
any science ge@@ e@@ ks , you get that one .
everybody , up up up up up !
creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thum@@ bs into the node .
we had joy . you were laugh@@ ing , smil@@ ing . look at your faces . this room is full of joy .
this is what he had to say .
we will not have a vocal ch@@ ord left , " S@@ ous@@ a said .
we 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest bu@@ ff@@ alo@@ s in Gabon , ele@@ ph@@ ants , and even tur@@ tle ne@@ sts .
and so we took a step back and we said , " What is it that we are trying to achieve ? "
they published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
take for example the case of lions .
so I created this , the Car@@ ne@@ gie Air@@ borne Observatory , or CA@@ O .
we can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red , and the Amazon River and flo@@ od@@ plain cutting right through it .
the 2010 mega @@@ -@@ @ drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe .
this area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil , totally un@@ explored , almost totally unknown scientifically .
so what we 've been doing is using the laser @@@ -@@ @ guided spec@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ y from the CA@@ O to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rain@@ forest .
today , we 're using small qu@@ ads .

half a billion of us live in meg@@ ac@@ ities .
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repos@@ itories of knowledge .
ok@@ ay . what I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight .
so we need to think about it here .
everything we do is an approxim@@ ation of sophistic@@ ation .
maybe the human brain actually has the most ne@@ ur@@ ons of any brain , regardless of its size , especially in the cere@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x .

the second most exciting thing for a cave explo@@ rer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .
he and I have both been exploring ca@@ ves a long time and we 've been climbing mountains a long time , but neither one of us had ever really explored a gl@@ ac@@ ier cave before .
well , cave maps are@@ n 't like trail maps or road maps because they have p@@ its and holes going to overlapping levels .
B@@ rent named this cave P@@ ure Im@@ ag@@ ination , I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined .
it 's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years , and it 's just now starting to s@@ pro@@ ut .
not only would it lift , but it might never return .

now this is@@ n 't a particularly close approach or unusual distance .
E@@ in@@ stein said that " I never think about the future - it comes soon enough . "
it 's jet engines , locomo@@ tives , gas turbines , medical devices , communicating seam@@ lessly with each other and with us .

I had two advantages as I went into the fight .
but then I discovered something .
and I get letters , I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what 's worked for them .
and major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken .
so the second thing we learned , and this leads into my second point , which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user @@@ -@@ @ centric .
do they all get there on time ? the supply chain .
we 'd seen that users had actually modified it .
and this goes into my last point .
they 'll never meet that stranger ; the stranger will never meet them .
a lot of people with CP don 't walk , but my parents did@@ n 't believe in " can 't . "
the disabled are the largest - Y@@ ea@@ h , cla@@ p for that , man . come on .
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 D@@ NC .
but a more interesting way , the current way to take the long view , is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective .
and we see a drift towards complexity that 's very intuitive .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co @@@ -@@ @ evolution .
so we forget , but we 're also adap@@ table , and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .
it 's where you expect to find stuff .
and China is a country where you get a lot of f@@ akes .
at worst , they ru@@ in lives : weight ob@@ session leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
my d@@ ad 's the guy with the cigarette .
PM : and in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you 've learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons .
in the end , I accepted the job without actually having been here .
and I thought to myself : what the hell have I done ?
it was a Dum@@ bo night@@ mare . ( la@@ ughter ) But something more profound was happening as well .
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war , having just finished the washing up . ( la@@ ughter ) He seems also to have forgotten his sword .
I really hope that others , all of you , visiting objects in the museum , and taking them home and finding them for yourselves , will allow those objects to flourish in your imagin@@ ative lives .
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's what my mom was like when I did it .
but I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player , and more like a do@@ er that just clic@@ ks and works together .
and this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emo@@ tion that they want to express .
whatever that means .
so let 's look at a few seconds from this performance , where the robot list@@ ens to the human musi@@ cian and impro@@ vis@@ es .
this is the modern Middle East , where two mill@@ enn@@ ia after the coming of Christ , vir@@ gin births are still a fact of life .
women , and increasingly men , who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home .
mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors CA@@ N@@ NOT happen at the same time .
they are real Olympic champions of mind training .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer @@@ -@@ @ s@@ ong@@ writer .
then they come into the classroom for some in @@@ -@@ @ person interaction .
the second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Cam@@ den , New Jersey police department .
now , at that time , Cam@@ den , New Jersey , was the most dangerous city in America .
ideas truly are what make the world go round .
the result is that I was launched into acute opi@@ oid withdrawal .
we called surge@@ ons and pain doc@@ s and general practitioners -- anyone we could find on the internet , and not a single one of them would help me .
I was broken and beaten , and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't do it anymore .
I took the little orange prescription bottle , I set it on my night@@ stand ...

how much oil is stored in all of China ?
and we 've accomplished close to zi@@ p .
but if you do this , it 's quick .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric life@@ times -- much longer than before -- because they 're le@@ vit@@ ated .
I 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to trans@@ gress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
and I 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retro@@ fitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on ster@@ oids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
they were also lucky , they said , because they began to di@@ g in a sort of Bermuda Tri@@ angle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .

building on this strength , they attracted investment and started to process , being able to export higher @@@ -@@ @ value products like st@@ arch from c@@ assa@@ va .
but if we can tap into commercial debt , it is a small number -- only 0.1 percent of all the debt in the world today , 10 cents out of every 100 dollars .
they 're economic issues , and that makes them relevant to risk and return .
we did@@ n 't have the luxury of pre @@@ -@@ @ recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surro@@ gate .
I met her when she was nine , and since then , my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice .
who have donated their voices , and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices .
thirteen years ago , we set ourselves a goal to end poverty .
it 's a common reaction .
I did@@ n 't have any change to give him , and she was disappointed .
well , this is where Dor@@ oth@@ y and the Man@@ go Tree charity that supports her comes in .
and 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidi@@ ze agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have over@@ produced .
the oil price goes through the floor . that company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil price back up .
it 's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying .

( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : OK , so when these things first roll out -- right now , it 's a single person aircraft , right ?
this thing takes off .
the technology need to mature in terms of safety , to get to the safety levels that we expect from aircraft .
R@@ L : my personal view is that ride sharing actually allows you to operate that entire business much more efficiently .
ca : cool . thank you for that .
and so it 's no surprise that many h@@ ackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the House .
this year , we start the process , with the Angolan government , to establish one of the largest systems of protected areas in the world to preserve the Ok@@ av@@ an@@ go @@@ -@@ @ Zam@@ be@@ zi water tower we have been exploring .
there is no doubt this is the biggest conservation opportunity in Africa in decades .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
and it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for .
and so if you do this , then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in English , but what you 're conveying is really a meaning , the meaning of a sentence in English .
let 's take this sentence : " I told the car@@ pen@@ ter I could not pay him . "
now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays , and almost all of that is done in the language domain .
John I saw just last week in the clinic .
but actually it does , but it just do@@ es@@ n 't do it well enough .
[ " I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist ; on his present showing this is quite ridic@@ ulous . " ] So they did@@ n 't think much of him then .
I think there are two ways you can think about this : as a fantastic 21st @@@ -@@ @ century drug discovery tool , and / or as a form of therapy .
that 's straightforward , because that 's what pl@@ uri@@ potent cells can do .
and what you 're looking at , and this is amazing , these are living , growing , motor nerve cells from a patient with motor ne@@ ur@@ on disease .
and again there are two ways to think about this , and they 're not mutually exclusive .
so I just want to end with the theme I began on , which was regeneration and hope .
they are these huge collections of gal@@ ax@@ ies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
the second things is very hot .
and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide .
so , it 's very funny .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
well , the problem with the large @@@ -@@ @ scale structure of the universe is that it 's horri@@ bly complicated .
rating agencies are rating companies .
well , a country has many gar@@ den@@ ers , and one of them is the government , so we have to ask the question , how is a country governed ?
a poster child example was the enc@@ ycl@@ ope@@ dia business .
and what I 'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third , and it maps exactly on to the kind of Por@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ Hen@@ derson logic that we 've been talking about .
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stom@@ p on it .
there was something else I realized .
this is the Art @@@ -@@ @ o @@@ -@@ @ mat , an art @@@ -@@ @ ven@@ ding machine that sells small artistic cre@@ ations by different artists , usually on small wood blocks or mat@@ ch@@ boxes , in limited edition .
you can kind of tell from their reactions .
this is what that looked like .
but when you open them , you have different r@@ arities of the toys .
he 's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
and caregi@@ ving itself develops patience -- a lot of patience -- and em@@ pa@@ thy , creativity , resilience , adap@@ tability .

they 're psychi@@ atri@@ sts .
from fl@@ ac@@ ci@@ d to ejaculation in less than a second .
now , I like to share stories like this with my audiences because , ye@@ ah , we humans , we tend to think sex , sex is fun , sex is good , there 's rom@@ ance , and there 's org@@ asm .

( la@@ ughter ) Over the subsequent months , we tested Jo@@ e and his fellow inmates , looking specifically at their ability to categor@@ ize different images of emo@@ tion .
when you think about it , it is ir@@ onic that our current solution for people with stressed am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ ae is to place them in an environment that actually inhib@@ its any chance of further growth .
those situations don 't really define themselves more until the second decade of life .
in other words , one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other .
few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hang@@ ings or beating children .
R@@ NG : the appeal to religion to justify the otherwise un@@ justifiable , such as the ban on contraception .
companies were created to give people a chance to inno@@ vate and not have to put everything on the line .

they assumed that they were for protection and for sen@@ sory structures .
so here 's R@@ He@@ x with p@@ add@@ les , now converted into an incredibly maneu@@ ver@@ able swimming robot .
you 've been called many things in the last few months .
ca : so just to give some context for those who don 't know the whole story -- ( Appl@@ ause ) - this time a year ago , you were stationed in Hawa@@ ii working as a consultant to the N@@ SA .
ca : ed , there was a story broken in the Washington Post , again from your data .
we have a right to privacy .
ca : some people are fu@@ rious at what you 've done .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be threatening dis@@ sid@@ ents .
we knew everything there is to know about the spac@@ e@@ suit and we trained underwater thousands of times .
LP : ye@@ ah , and also saving space and making life better .
we 've had a more rapid turnover of companies .
now , we did study some other species of pri@@ mate .
and the final group that we studied , all the way on the right , is people living in the USA .
she is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them .
yes , I must mention it .
Israeli scientists Freder@@ ic Liber@@ sat and R@@ am G@@ al found that the ven@@ om is a very specific chemical weapon .
now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
technology had eliminated my disability , and allowed me a new climbing pro@@ w@@ ess .
the story of Adri@@ anne Has@@ let @@@ -@@ @ Dav@@ is .
Adri@@ anne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack .
we will not be intim@@ idated , brought down , diminished , conqu@@ ered or stopped by acts of violence .
we could call it clu@@ efulness .
and so they developed a platform , which we are announcing today , that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform .

all of a sudden , I was introduced to the world of beauty p@@ age@@ ants .
ca : so , given that this vacation led to the creation of the world 's biggest private foundation , it 's pretty expensive as vac@@ ations go . ( la@@ ughter ) MG : I guess so . we enjoyed it .
our na@@ ï@@ vet@@ é is pretty incredible , when we look back on it .
Ma : ye@@ ah , in ' 97 , we read an article about diar@@ rhe@@ al diseases killing so many kids around the world , and we kept saying to ourselves , " Well that can 't be .
and I would come back and talk to global health experts , and they 'd say , " Oh no , contraceptives are stoc@@ ked in in the developing world . "
and so condoms were stoc@@ ked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.
these causes have been a bit invisible .
ca : maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big , sad face to get engaged .
you shou@@ ld@@ n 't just say , ok@@ ay , because of that , because we don 't have a perfect record , this is a bad endeav@@ or .
mg : ye@@ ah , I 've had a lot of women say to me , " I really don 't think I could work with my husband .
Sunday , 11 o 'clock , you 're away from work , what comes up ? what 's the argument ?
it took three more years to get it than we expected , and then there was no way it was going to get out there .
their children , their six children , the two in the middle were tw@@ ins , 13 , a boy , and a girl named G@@ race .
there 's nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .
and if we had to go up , we had to go up in places where you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't need to own a car .
well , this was an un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably ambitious idea , ambitious because communities had to approve those plans .
my mission was always to create great public spaces .
at the other extreme , there are things that move too fast for our eyes , but we have technology that can look into that world as well .
even , I think , we copy our way to reproduce , you know what I mean , and something of -- oh no , forget it .
and this territory is fantastic .
that means intelligent people are in this angle . that is intelligence .
because at the vertical of us , if you look like that , " Ah ! my God , there is God . Ah ! God ! "
no , you must really understand that .
however , Sierra Leone is in@@ famous for a decade @@@ -@@ @ long rebel war in the ' 9@@ 0s when entire villages were burnt down .
people don 't realize that .
MK : that 's our political action committee , where we are trying to get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country , and to try to pass some reasonable legislation .
it 's not too difficult to do that .
in March of 2006 , police interrogated B@@ ren@@ dan D@@ as@@ sey , a 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old high school student with an I@@ Q around 70 , putting him in the range of intellectual disability .
P@@ 2 : and she 's behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here .
P@@ 1 : that 's what she said , because she thinks you know more , too .
so by honesty , they meant a confession , and his confession would definitely not end up setting him free .
therefore we must be saved by that final form of love , which is forgiveness . " thanks .
specifically , I don 't think we know what paren@@ ting is supposed to be .
well , for star@@ ters , there has been a major historical change .
this was true even when I was young .
our approach was to think of the gen@@ ome as the operating system of the cell , with the cell containing the hardware necessary to boot up the gen@@ ome .
four hundred parts per million : that 's the approximate concentration of CO2 in the air today .
they wanted a small core set of fon@@ ts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen , which were their co@@ ar@@ se resolution displays .
now , it 's very energy @@@ -@@ @ dense , it produces solid , reliable power , and it do@@ es@@ n 't make any CO2 .
it makes lots of energy .
so those have a couple of very good advantages .
so when you com@@ press that , the plasma co@@ ols down faster than the compression speed , so you 're trying to com@@ press it , but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing .
so in Man@@ ghet@@ u sculpture , you 'd see this recur@@ sive geometry .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
and then you take this symbol , and you put it back in so it 's a self @@@ -@@ @ generating diversity of symbols .
we 're eth@@ ically precluded from even using human@@ oid shapes and ba@@ iting them up in the water .
from the perspective of Shar@@ k Att@@ ack Mitigation Systems , we 're a biotechnology licensing company , so we don 't make we@@ tsu@@ its ourselves .
in short , we want to democrati@@ ze access to information about our planet .
you need context to tell whether you 're hearing Russian , Spanish , or English .
which is fitting , seeing as today , one in five soldiers develop depression , or post @@@ -@@ @ traumatic stress disorder or both .
and yet , despite how common@@ place these disorders are , our current treatments , if they work at all , only suppress symptoms .
but au@@ tism is not a single condition .
and I remember many nights , I would be sitting at home , just , like , concentrating and focusing , trying to feel the Force , and I did@@ n 't feel anything , don 't worry .
and then consider that U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t started by prop@@ elling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as human@@ ly possible .
now , 530 is a lot more than one , and that 's partly because there are many more people training today and they 're training more intell@@ igently .
suddenly , anybody who could be an N@@ BA player wanted to be , and teams started scour@@ ing the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships .
the average N@@ BA player is a sh@@ ade under 6 ' 7 , " with arms that are seven feet long .
we can look at the flu@@ xes .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
we can look at other examples .

I was tired of fa@@ king normal .
so I am calling on change agents and social entrepreneurs , artists and elders and impact investors .
I don 't need to know more . I don 't want to know .
ok@@ ay , well , I 'm just g@@ onn@@ a answer this really fast , as , like , three or four different people .
of course , I could just make up an answer and you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't know , so I come prepared for that .
what year was it , first of all ?
AB : 18@@ 24 , OK .
( la@@ ughter ) Good , thank you very much .

there was a gent@@ l@@ eman up here who had a 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit calculator .
OK , what I 'm going to try and do , is to square in my head a five @@@ -@@ @ digit number requiring a 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit calculator .
so you can actually , honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size .
six .

( la@@ ughter ) Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right , because this is my big finish , OK .
you see , my mother was ru@@ th@@ lessly realistic .
my mother looked at me and she said , " How did they treat you ? "

Mt : sorry . now , one way of persu@@ ading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Music ) MT : and that 's it . thank you very much , and thank you , EDI . EDI : thank you , Marco .
the fact that I know something has zero value if I 'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it .
so as a consequence , what we did was we changed the idea of information , instead of knowledge is power , to one where sharing is power .
H@@ W : thank you so much . thank you .
they constantly use the argument to de@@ value rap and modern pop , and these arguments completely miss the point , because the dam has burst .
so we knew again about this crisis .
horri@@ ble , absolutely horri@@ ble .
I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
that 's a san@@ e response to war .
" Ma '@@ am , I miss almost all of it . "
he 's not a psych@@ op@@ ath .
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who are@@ n 't making their own .

her n@@ ip@@ ple is completely hidden by the baby 's head , but what you 'll notice is a white dro@@ ple@@ t with an arrow pointing to it , and that 's the sec@@ re@@ tion from the are@@ ol@@ ar g@@ lands .
in the oceans , biodiversity is not at war with abundance .
what were you eating ?
we don 't know how to read the sentences .
forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right .

in Saudi Arabia recently , two men who had been caught in car@@ nal acts were sentenced to 7,000 l@@ ashes each , and are now permanently disabled as a result .
and yet , every step forward is so sweet .

when I first came back from Afghanistan , I thought that if you make it back from conflict , then the dangers were all over .
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me , " What did you do ? "
what I wanted to better understand was what 's behind that , and why " thank you for your service " is@@ n 't enough .
these are the people who I served with , and these are the people who I honor .
Don 't treat it like a game , and don 't treat it like a resume review .
it 's finding your person .
SS : turns out these answers were pre@@ recorded in a studio .
it turns out this problem is very challenging , but the key trick is that we are going to analyze a large photo collection of the person beforehand .
SS : so what 's being synthe@@ sized here is only the mouth region , and here 's how we do it .
thank you .
basically what this syndrome causes , is that I CA@@ N@@ NOT gain weight .
can you guess what that is ?
it starts with a ' B ' . can you guys guess it ?
they sat me down and said , " L@@ iz@@ z@@ ie , the only thing different about you is that you 're smaller than the other kids .
they said , " Go to school , pick your head up , smile , continue to be yourself , and people will see that you 're just like them . "

we have 25,000 kids in school , four percent overhead .
what emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America .
for many , it is their first time inter@@ acting with Islam on such an intimate level .
thank you very much .
we need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomo@@ tion , and we need the sensors , power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi @@@ -@@ @ intelligent ant robot .
and it survi@@ ves , b@@ oun@@ ces on the table , it 's incredibly robust , and of course survi@@ ves quite well until we lose it because it 's very tiny .
we all move in this kind of b@@ oun@@ cy way when we run .
and you 'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off , and the robot tum@@ bling through the air .
they made some ast@@ ounding discoveries .
but I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding .
so there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
I was a young humanitarian aid worker , and I met this woman who was my age .
we settled and we liked it .
I did it for your own good .
the aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them , because every child has a right to pleasure .
are you from California ?
now , I believe so .
and politics and democracy without an effective challenge hob@@ bles , because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial .
but despite that , we do know many things : we know that this virus probably survi@@ ves in a type of a bat .
this is a very dangerous , de@@ bil@@ itating , and deadly disease .
in fact , the average man can throw a ball further than about 98 percent of all women .
but let 's have a look at the size of this difference .
now , it is@@ n 't true per se that left @@@ -@@ @ handed people are more creative than right @@@ -@@ @ handed people .
and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes .
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
and so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the TH@@ E@@ RE@@ MI@@ N the way it is now .
so we have to do something about the scat@@ ter so we can see the tumor .
it 's amazing .
but we treat this sk@@ ull with great respect at our lab and here at TED .
Red light is all around us .
a system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost , higher resolution and smaller medical imaging .
so .
our system may be extraordinary at finding blood .
here 's a be@@ aker of blood .
so with our system , you can imagine detecting can@@ cers early , when intervention is easy , or tracking the size of your tumor as it grows or shr@@ inks .
compact , portable , inexpensive medical imaging can save countless lives .
her name is A@@ IV@@ A , and she 's an artificial intelligence that has learned the art of music composition by reading over 30,000 scores of history 's greatest .
now we know that there 's a lot of animals out there that can do it too .
the problem with infectious diseases , as we all know , is that path@@ ogens continue to evolve , and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy .
as part of my job , I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants , and the reason for this is that mon@@ archs are extremely pic@@ ky e@@ aters .
so then we moved on to adult bu@@ tter@@ flies , and we started asking the question whether it 's the mothers that can medic@@ ate their off@@ spring .
so we started this about 30 years ago , and we started dealing with this very issue .
so , come have your interviews .
so there 's a place for music and literature , etc . , but also for grammar .
and follow this all the time and we know how they 're doing and we say , you 're not interested in this now , let 's wait a year .
and so the courses are World Cup S@@ occer , or building a bicycle .
one , it freed our five kids from following in our steps , our shadow -- They don 't know what I do .
( la@@ ughter ) The five kids know nothing , which is good .
but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon .
this is a nice building .
and we push and we push and we push until we completely alien@@ ate all of you .
it means that a parking garage in Miami Beach , Florida , can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night .
it do@@ es@@ n 't matter how we build , it matters what we build .
when I was four years old , my grand@@ father and I were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost .
it was one of the sc@@ ari@@ est moments I 've ever experienced in my life , and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grand@@ father had Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's disease .
therefore , I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance .
I 've tested the device on my grand@@ father for about a year now , and it 's had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wan@@ dering .
and so , you know , it 's one of those things that you don 't take too seriously .
and that was a lot of heat to deal with .
and this is where it is ; it 's sort of evolving .
we missed each other terri@@ bly , but international phone calls were really expensive then , and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week .
I once worked with this woman who , after 20 years marriage and an extremely ug@@ ly divorce , was finally ready for her first date .
shoc@@ king , right , that a friend could be so cruel ?
because we don 't prioritize our psychological health .
the problem is , the urge to r@@ umin@@ ate can feel really strong and really important , so it 's a difficult habit to stop .
but Z@@ en Budd@@ hi@@ sts practicing throughout China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question - why do we need an explanation ?
since these are intentionally un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able , it would be mis@@ guided to try and deci@@ ph@@ er these stories ourselves .
it turns out this is exactly where the science comes in .
what I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement .
as an Arab female photographer , I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences .
now , in this project , I 'm using a co@@ creation approach , which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many artists .
more importantly , our studies showed that we could eliminate the possibility of this dangerous virus being transmitted into humans .
he said , " So maybe this is what you should do .
when I walked inside , the lady was just finishing up one contract with some fol@@ ks , some other people were coming in behind me .

here is a map I made with the most dangerous inter@@ sections in New York City based on cycl@@ ist accidents .
this is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years .
we can standardize our addresses , and if we do , we can get more maps like this .
it 's not a disease or an ab@@ norm@@ ality , and it is@@ n 't necessarily tied to depression , anxiety , or self @@@ -@@ @ esteem .
it 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
and that , in fact , turns out to be true .
my name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya .
yes , it may be hard to find talent .
and they were going up , and they finally made it to the peak .
and so there was a big movement to put all this information online , to track all the ownership of these plots of land , put them in the cloud , and give them to the communities .
there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere .
it looks super high tech .
it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut .
then , you also encry@@ pt the data as it sits on the server itself .
I have a playing card in my hand .
not only that , but I will impose myself a time limit of one second , something that would look like this .
audience member 3 : yes . Hg : yes ! perfect .
thank you very much .
and what it also means is you can win .
( la@@ ughter ) But I loved it , and I got involved in these s@@ lam@@ s , and I became the U.@@ K. sla@@ m champion and got invited to the Po@@ e@@ try World Cup in Paris , which was un@@ beli@@ evable .
this took place in my childhood , 1957 @@@ -@@ @ 65 .
that is exactly the size of the base of the spac@@ eship .
so , they had a lot of fun doing this .
they got quite serious about the engineering of this .
well , here we have a little problem , the radiation doses at the crew station : 700 ra@@ ds per shot .
but to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the Build it From S@@ cr@@ at@@ ch team , Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next @@@ -@@ @ generation system .
we 've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you 'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens .
what he did is tell them it was time for them to think about re@@ thinking what they were supposed to do .
and for this service , they were murdered , their families torn apart , and their story largely forgotten .
sometimes that 's the only difference you make -- one individual , one family , a small group of individuals -- and it matters .
every life matters , or every life should matter .
we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself .
I know I 'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for .
now , across the animal kingdom , different animals pick up on different parts of reality .
and this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a co@@ ch@@ lear impl@@ ant , which opens up this technology globally , even for the poorest countries .
so we 'll report on that later to see how well this goes .

we have delivered live pigs to Kenya 's parliament as a symbol of our politicians ' gre@@ ed .
( appl@@ ause ) Tom Ri@@ el@@ ly : it 's an amazing story .
so we package our activis@@ m and we package our message in art .
so I thought about it , I wrote my 50 words , and a few weeks later , Chris called and said , " Go for it . "
every day , people come up to me and say , " I wish I had interviewed my father or my grand@@ mother or my brother , but I waited too long . "
I hope you 'll help us make this wish come true .

the important thing -- ( Appl@@ ause ) The important thing that I remember is st@@ aring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this ap@@ ology .
it was extraordinary to see , for example , old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ri@@ pped away from their parents , like this lady here .
K@@ ev@@ in Rud@@ d : well , what we Austr@@ alians do best is organize the drinks , so you get them together in one room , and we suggest this and suggest that , then we go and get the drinks .
you could say that I look for choice alien real estate .

private spac@@ ef@@ light companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tant@@ alizing possibility of living our lives on Mars .
and that 's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
and it can change people 's perception of each other .
and ultimately , we become more human .
the next group , 14 percent of the wealth , 21 , 22 and 32 .
but the fact is , it 's because I did@@ n 't draw them on the same scale .
we asked , what about things like health ?
what about life expectancy of infants ?
we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency -- basically , young kids and babies , because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation .
we have two gaps : we have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap And the knowledge gap is something that we think about , how do we educate people ?
how do we get people to think differently about what we really want ?
B@@ F : you know , sometimes when people do those , they go all the way down .

( la@@ ughter ) My point is don 't control them , don 't protect them too much , and they need to tum@@ ble sometimes .
by 8 o 'clock , we kept on waiting , because it 's not very un@@ common that the leaders become late , for an hour or so .
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 children , and 50 more will join , that 's not done .
and the concrete result was that the number of child lab@@ ore@@ rs globally has gone down by one third in the last 15 years .
thank you so much .
beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from .
it has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution , but also its habit@@ ability potential .
all together , they are telling us what started as a micro@@ b@@ ial path@@ way , and why what started as a micro@@ b@@ ial path@@ way sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end .

at the same time , the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed .
we 'll eventually zoom out of the bl@@ az@@ ar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger gal@@ actic context .

it 's a cause that probably has involved all of us here .
I don 't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most j@@ ar@@ ring .

now , genetic modification is not new ; virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner .
how do we know that there is@@ n 't a big risk of some unintended consequence ?
so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we 've achieved , and everything we care about , depends cru@@ cially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind .
so at one end we have the village idi@@ ot , and then far over at the other side we have E@@ d Wit@@ ten , or Albert E@@ in@@ stein , or whoever your favorite g@@ uru is .

so my story in The Inter@@ cept , which was just published today , tells the story of how Sami Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac was set up in this F@@ BI sting and goes into much greater detail .
in this talk , I could only highlight the things that they said , such as calling him a " ret@@ arded fo@@ ol . "

you [ probably won 't ] randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls .

human minds generate research and discovery , and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater , and human minds take care of other humans : our old , our young , our sick .
in the years to come , we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even en@@ vision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approxim@@ ating the compu@@ tational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .
it has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you .
now we 're trying to ask , " Can we regener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
we 're able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .

the target was to take from a baseline of 1990 , when 36 percent of the world 's population lived in poverty , to get to 18 percent poverty this year .
the highest performing country , Norway , scores 88 .
so there 's our target , 75 out of 100 .
economic growth seems to have really helped in the fight against poverty , but it do@@ es@@ n 't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the Global Goals .
and that 's really important , because it tells us two things .

it ends with a special technique called the car@@ p , which allows me to store one to two extra lit@@ ers of air in my lun@@ gs by com@@ pressing it .
and what 's extraordinary is that we share this instinc@@ t with marine mammals -- all marine mammals : dol@@ ph@@ ins , wh@@ ales , sea lions , etc .
my lun@@ gs reach residual volume , below which they 're not supposed to be compressed , in theory .

it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their book@@ shelves .
and so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel , short story collection or mem@@ o@@ ir from every country in the world .
these days , when I look at my book@@ shelves or consider the works on my e @@@ -@@ @ reader , they tell a rather different story .
I hope it 's a story I 'm reading for many years to come .
and is@@ n 't it so cu@@ te ?
so , I 'm all for robots and smart robots .
how far do we push it ?
a computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paper@@ weight .
we had to ask people to specify not only their own answer , but the answer they wanted from someone else .
the algorithm c@@ run@@ ches the numbers and gives us a result .
you 've answered " no , " you want someone else to answer " no , " and the question is only a little important to you .
I hope this will help you do that .

1915 must have been an exciting year to be a phy@@ sic@@ ist .
the question is , ultimately , why does all this interesting stuff exist ?
we can 't see it or touch it , but if it was@@ n 't there , we would not exist .
rel@@ ativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings , a bit like a light switch .
if so , then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert E@@ in@@ stein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature .
but I mean , seriously , it 's great news .
let 's walk through three of today 's more prevalent theories , using the same restaurant setting for each .
are you paying attention ?

when we see , it 's because the energy of light stimulates a recep@@ tor in our eye called the re@@ tina .
and the cool@@ est thing of all , no matter the wa@@ vel@@ ength or energy , the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth .

they became factory workers and lawyers and bric@@ k@@ layers and doctors , one President of the United States .
( la@@ ughter ) So what have we learned ?
let 's take a look at a few of the most prevalent ones , beginning with two physiological hypo@@ theses before moving to a psychological one .
our first physiological hypothesis states that contag@@ ious y@@ aw@@ ning is triggered by a specific stimulus , an initial ya@@ wn .
this study was set up to show that dogs would enact a ya@@ wn ref@@ lex at the mere sound of a human ya@@ wn .
we were calling collectively for actions , and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know .
the e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia faded , we failed to build consensus , and the political struggle led to intense polarization .
and fourth , it became really hard to change our opinions .
fifth -- and in my point of view , this is the most critical -- today , our social media experiences are designed in a way that fav@@ ors broadcasting over engagements , posts over discussions , shallow comments over deep conversations .
without them , plants would lose a pol@@ lin@@ ator .

here are some questions and methods I 've used to help build the worlds in which those books take place .
what rules are in place here ?
what do people believe in here ?
where do the inhabitants live and work and go to school ?
what kind of technology exists ?
access to information ?
there 's so much to think about !
some astronom@@ ers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars .
it 's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car 's head@@ light .
ice on a planet 's surface is also important for climate .
only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom .
thank you .
when you travel in a car , your body gets two different messages .
you 're at the movies , and the camera makes a sweeping move .

so in other words , he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here .
( audience : " alpha House . " ) Yes , " Alpha House , " but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it did@@ n 't turn out that great .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " House of Cards " gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be .
you have 200 years of statistics to rely on .
look at the jum@@ per 's center of mass as his body ben@@ ds backward .
and , finally , there is the lip@@ id layer , an o@@ ily outer film that keeps the surface smooth for Ir@@ is to see through , and prevents the other layers from evapor@@ ating .
so there 's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in A@@ stro@@ tur@@ f and buying c@@ ac@@ t@@ uses .
pesticides used both on commercial be@@ e@@ hi@@ ves and agricultural crops to ward off paras@@ ites could be getting into the food and water that hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es consume .
so we have a file full of clu@@ es but no clear leads .
living plants shed dead body parts : fallen leaves , broken branches , and even underground roots .
you probably don 't eat ro@@ tting things , po@@ op , or pond sc@@ um directly , but your food sources probably do .
( appl@@ ause ) And then we have the aud@@ acity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action .
we 've lost it with one another .
forty @@@ -@@ @ year crime low , so much so , I had other commanders call me , " He@@ y Mel , what@@ cha do@@ in ' , man ?
and we celebrated , because we had learned to become great servers , become great servers first .
on the other hand , something strange has happened .

tat@@ to@@ os have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and devi@@ ant or tren@@ dy youth f@@ ads .
but have you ever wondered how tat@@ to@@ oing really works ?
and it is this very process that makes tat@@ to@@ os permanent .
der@@ mal cells , however , remain in place until they die .
but with time , tat@@ to@@ os do f@@ ade naturally as the body re@@ acts to the alien pig@@ ment particles , slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system 's macro@@ ph@@ ages .
technically , yes .
so a single tat@@ too may not truly last forever , but tat@@ to@@ os have been around longer than any existing culture .
you 've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth , but how does it work ?
this is where we enter the quantum realm .
every atom and molec@@ ule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electr@@ ons .
one that do@@ es@@ n 't appear to be emitting light at all : Earth .
the hot@@ ter an object gets , the higher frequency the light it em@@ its .
95 % of the light they em@@ it is invisible to our eyes .
so with that , I will leave you .
in his " Med@@ itations on First Phil@@ osoph@@ y , " Ren@@ é Des@@ car@@ tes tried to answer that very question , demol@@ ishing all his pre@@ conceived notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations .
are you persuaded ?

so Ger@@ tr@@ ude Ste@@ in , who 's a human , is able to write a po@@ em that fo@@ ols a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer .
this has led me to understand that the human is not a cold , hard fact .
H.@@ M. ' s seizures virtually disappeared , with no change in personality , and his I@@ Q even improved .
so , why does music rely so heavily on repetition ?
to investigate , psychologists asked people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition .
in this way , repetition can open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing .
it says that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a met@@ aph@@ or in everything from literary criticism to sports commentary .
the real origin is much deeper and more amazing .
wa@@ vel@@ ength is essential for quantum physics because an object 's wa@@ vel@@ ength is related to its momentum , mass times velocity .
both position and momentum are now uncertain , and the uncertainties are connected .
if you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave pac@@ ket , you need to add more waves , which means a bigger momentum uncertainty .
and preferably among them , some drought @@@ -@@ @ tolerant crops .
now , making drought @@@ -@@ @ tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world .
you and I are 65 percent water -- we lose one percent of that , we die .
ann@@ uals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies .
seeds are energy @@@ -@@ @ rich so there 's a lot of food cal@@ ories , you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine , but there 's a down@@ side .
they just don 't need them .
am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer ?
but above all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy .
in a sense , if I am allowed to be provocative , China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century .
" come on , Your Hon@@ or , we all learned it in school .
" H@@ mm . why is celebrating this Colum@@ bus so important to you , anyway ? "
" and what about the struggles of Native Americans who were nearly wi@@ ped out and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from poverty and discrimination ?
traditions and holidays are important to all cultures , but a hero in one era may become a vil@@ la@@ in in the next as our historical knowledge expands and our values evolve .
a single electr@@ on is@@ n 't choosing to go left or right but left and right simultaneously .
but while our brain is busy dre@@ aming , it 's letting plenty of signals slip by .
for example , a li@@ ar might say something like , " Sor@@ ry , my stupid phone battery died . I hate that thing . "
judgment and evaluation are complex things for our bra@@ ins to compu@@ te .
the statement is short and direct , calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life .
it was the first green fluo@@ rescent e@@ el that we found , and this just changed my trajectory completely .

( music ) They 're the most cryp@@ tic fish .
so we started using sub@@ mar@@ ines , and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here .
so what are you expecting ?
the gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanc@@ tum , and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve .
though his experiments were dis@@ credited , much like the rest of vit@@ alism , traces of his theory still come up in popular culture .
but when white cap@@ tains came offering manufactured goods , weapons , and r@@ um for slaves , African kings and merchants had little reason to hesitate .
they viewed the people they sold not as fellow Africans but criminals , debtors , or prisoners of war from rival tribes .

if we are the only intelligent beings in the gal@@ axy , we should make sure we survive and continue .
yet I 'd sit on these silent ret@@ reats , swe@@ ating through T @@@ -@@ @ shirts in the middle of winter .
but over time , as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions , we let go of old habits and form new ones .
so Amsterdam was bri@@ m@@ ming with wealthy , skilled merchants and traders who displayed their prosperity by living in man@@ sions surrounded by flower gardens .

knowing that your own brain is lying to you while not being able to resist its commands can be agon@@ izing .
the trick was in the spin .
too fast and it ho@@ oks too late .
the ball 's spin creates a pressure differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it in the direction of the spin .
periods work best here because these are two totally different ideas .
a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on 's job is to re@@ unite two independent clauses that will benefit from one another 's company because they refer to the same thing .
worse than that , countries like India , Russia , South Africa , Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and , in many cases , actually regres@@ sing .

it could 've stopped something .
no one thought they could participate in sports , let alone be a valued member of society .
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves .
but she only sees one , so she deduc@@ es that her hat is also black .
this is confidence .

in medieval times , al@@ chem@@ ists tried to achieve the seemingly impossible .
but to understand how this precious metal became embedded in our planet to start with , we have to gaz@@ e upwards at the stars .
however , at that point nuclear fusion no longer releases enough energy , and the pressure from the core pe@@ ters out .

well , it 's because mass transit h@@ as@@ n 't yet fig@@ ured out how to get to everybody 's door@@ step .
and once we introduced u@@ ber@@ PO@@ OL , well , you see there 's not as many bright colors .
and so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago .
now , in China everything is super@@ sized , and so we 're doing 15 million u@@ ber@@ PO@@ OL trips per month , that 's 500,000 per day .
and when I talk to my team , we don 't talk about , " He@@ y , well , 100,000 people car@@ pooling every week and we 're done . "
how do we get that to a million ?
now , I 'm as excited as anybody else about self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars but do we have to really wait five , 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality ?
and so what we did was almost what I would call an im@@ mature version of a luxury brand that looked like a bad@@ ge on a luxury car .
ca : OK , that 's cool .
and so what that means is more trips per hour , more minutes of the hour where they 're productive and actually , earnings come up .
so I think there 's a lot of good .
Group A physically practiced one @@@ -@@ @ handed free thro@@ ws while Group B only mentally practiced them .

beyond dry@@ ness , tar@@ di@@ grades can also tolerate other extreme stresses : being frozen , heated up past the boiling point of water , high levels of radiation , and even the vacuum of outer space .
in the process , tar@@ di@@ grades could even help us answer a critical question : could life survive on planets much less hosp@@ itable than our own ?
lower fiber means less fuel for the gu@@ t bacteria , essentially star@@ ving them until they die off .

and this guy pul@@ ls up in this red Maz@@ da and he starts looking through my stuff .
and the voice in my head goes , " Wa@@ it , what ? "
now , that 's a natural social bias .
but what 's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix , in this case , with reviews .
one is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what the others know and uses this to predict their reasoning .

Christop@@ her 's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such , but I did@@ n 't think bran@@ ding him a fel@@ on for the rest of his life was the right answer .
we stick to an outdated method , counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want , and that 's safer communities .
they have little appreciation for what we can do .
which means that there are a lot of family events .

there 's no other way .
a lot of it 's on this stage .
so how are we going to do it ? how are we going to do it together ?
this means there 's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States .
so this , to me , is a tragic but a sol@@ vable problem .
we started by talking to college survivors .

literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
these are people who were nurses , bankers , pa@@ inters , engineers and lots and lots of PhD students .
these people were writing with intense frustration about what proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this Mon@@ key had done to them .
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on .
this pre@@ m@@ ie@@ res in Monaco -- it 's in September 2009 . if by any chance you can 't make it , another idea with this project -- here 's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
and I 'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage , so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like .
this is by far the far@@ thest he 's stra@@ yed from Te@@ w@@ k@@ s@@ bury Hospital , I can tell you that , because he 's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music .
but what about expression ? what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ? you know , do our technologies allow us to express ?
and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen .
so , in hearing this piece , as I mentioned before , the most important thing is the music 's great , and it 'll show you who Dan is .

thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today .
we all together build Human@@ ae .
so your work has a very special place in my heart and it 's very important for me . "
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
there 's a lot of people who make small , small changes .
L@@ t : ye@@ ah , I think I was the proto@@ typical ner@@ d .
I was not a people person back then .
shall we say , " my@@ op@@ ic " when it comes to other people 's feelings , and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people .
I 'm not a people person ; it 's not something I 'm particularly proud of , but it 's part of me .
what is the difference between these two ?
good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinc@@ tively knowing what 's the right way to do things .
and I am not a vi@@ sionary .
and people love T@@ es@@ la .
I mean , there are people who name their companies after him .
let me paint the picture for you .
now we recognize WA@@ LL @@@ -@@ @ E as having an eye .
I came in one morning and checked the previous night 's work .
but if it gets exposed to the enzy@@ mes that reside in our blood@@ stream or our tissues , it degra@@ des within seconds .
first , let 's start with the nan@@ op@@ article core .
the two op@@ pos@@ itely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction , and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the si@@ R@@ NA from degrading in the blood@@ stream .
this is truly remarkable .
there are all these written and un@@ written rules of the road , and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you , usually without consequence .
( la@@ ughter ) So you 're driving somewhere , thus te@@ ed up to be angry , and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit .
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .
let 's call them On@@ co@@ Search .
we all know that exploration is risky .
so instead of staying with it , we create something new .
but the same goes for that , then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated .
riding into Rome on the carriage , they always had a companion whis@@ pering in their ear , " Rem@@ ember , you 're only human . "
build space elev@@ ators , or impossible miles of transport belts that te@@ ther your planet of choice to our home planet ?
well , it turns out we 've already done things like this .
and that comes down to finding common ground , where what I want overl@@ aps with what you want .
and a lot of those people are children .
enough .
it 's estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion US dollars a year .
now , Min@@ es@@ we@@ eper is awesome , but it 's not the driver of the effect , because if you play the game first before you learn about the task , there 's no creativity boost .
a lot of people think they will .
thank you .
now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies .
China and Japan have an even longer history of rival@@ ry and have been deploying their air forces and navi@@ es to show their strength in island disputes .
we are the cells and vessels pul@@ sing through these global connectivity networks .
but first , a few fascinating facts about where we 're going .
it was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans , and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon .
maybe they can .
it 's a reverse fuel cell , essentially , that suc@@ ks in the Mar@@ tian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen .
but the secret to this -- and that 's just for testing -- the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get @@@ -@@ @ go to be scal@@ able by a factor of 100 .
at first we can use infl@@ atable , pressuri@@ zed buildings as well as the landers themselves .
so we really have to go underground .
that sounds like a lot of hu@@ bris , but the truth is that the technology to do everything I 'm about to tell you already exists .
when that happened , people looked at each other and said , " If we can do this , we can do anything . "
and so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more .
see , there was a change in government , and six years later , all that new money disappeared .
we needed a sustainable movement , not one that is susceptible to the fluctu@@ ating mo@@ ods of a politician or the h@@ int of an economic downturn .
we needed to somehow turn that short @@@ -@@ @ term excitement of people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign into long @@@ -@@ @ term passion .

he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon men@@ stru@@ ating girls and women by their own families and their society .
during my research , I was collecting a lot of stories .
and then , in East Africa , an un@@ promising species of ap@@ e evolved the odd trick of senti@@ ent thought .
thus , multi@@ t@@ ud@@ inous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of f@@ ossi@@ ls , each one a small miracle , but collectively , inevitable .

that 's not how to think of a TED Talk .
Sir K@@ en Robinson -- creativity is key to our kids ' future .
( video ) Sir K@@ en Robinson : my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
ideas are complex things ; you need to sl@@ ash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you 're most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
but ...
they are not trusted .
they 're tex@@ ting their friends , they 're looking up directions , they 're browsing the Internet and they 're even making financial transactions .
J@@ eni@@ ph@@ er answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device .
these things are systems that are designed to un@@ fold over time , to make us feel .
and what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema .
it 's listening to the 9@@ 11 feed of the New Orleans Police Department , so that anytime there 's a shooting reported in New Orleans , ( gun@@ shot sound ) the gun fires .
when you do it right , it 's illuminating .
that 's 17,000 a day , and I have them all .
on some days , we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours .
but like me , they are human beings .
that problem started when the Gaza tunnel was being built .
and Gaza is the only place in the Arab world where Muslims and Christians live in strong brotherhood .
but here -- here 's the intri@@ gu@@ ing part .
what amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human ?
that 's a fr@@ actional precision of 0.@@ 0000@@ 0000@@ 4 .
objects of this size hit the Earth every 50 years or so .
I wrote a letter that started out , " De@@ ar Res@@ ear@@ cher . "
we met Ar@@ up@@ a and her staff , and Ar@@ up@@ a said that when I told her not to feel guilty , that it was a relief , and that she had@@ n 't seen it from our perspective .
( la@@ ughter ) But it 's not only about convenience .
so when you hear about gene drives in the coming months , and trust me , you will be hearing about them , remember that .
so if we take J@@ im O '@@ Gra@@ dy and sc@@ ram@@ ble the words , we 'll get a list of words .
worldwide , over two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today .
I 'd say , " I don 't know ! "
that 's one rule .
and they 're the same ones that I have today .
it was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . and she said , " Save a man from dro@@ w@@ ning , you are responsible to him for life . "
and what I need , in effect , is a focus .
this is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read about relevant theory .
and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential .
if you did , could you please raise your hand ?
we have been playing gu@@ essing games with children all over the world .
as it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
are you ready ?
what about , can parents detect their own children 's lies ?
so in the last five years , we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions .
and as I was working on this piece and reading about the case , I became outra@@ ged .
with that , I want to leave you with one additional name : Peter Bu@@ x@@ tu@@ n .
can you afford to take the risk ?
and even if it 's possible in principle , getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money .
if prohibition is this harmful , you might ask , why it so popular ?
I don 't think this is an accident .
the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections , allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest .
that 's true of prostitution , but it 's also true of agricultural work , hospitality work and domestic work .
here in the UK , I 'm part of sex worker @@@ -@@ @ led groups like the Sex Wor@@ ker Open University and the English Collective of Pro@@ stitu@@ tes .
I 'm just one sex worker on the stage today , but I 'm bringing a message from all over the world .
I 'll tell you .
and I 'm a writer .
the modules can self @@@ -@@ @ assemble into a large 3@@ x@@ 3@@ x@@ 3 cu@@ be , with each individual module placed anywhere in the cu@@ be , and at any orientation .
you 've painted a total of 54 faces red at this point , so you 'll need the same number of faces for the green and purple cu@@ bes , too .
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it do@@ es@@ n 't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
( la@@ ughter ) But it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
in the remaining time , I 'd like to tell you two features of them .
so J@@ ay@@ nes 's theory is that consciousness , at least in the way we perceive it today , where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development .
and just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
so it 's no wonder that some men don 't want to be bo@@ thered and ski@@ p going to the doctor altogether , especially if they feel fine .
if you look up high enough , you could see me .
ne@@ ural pathways carry this sen@@ sory input through the spinal cord and up to the brain .
the patient places the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b into a box behind a mirror and the intact lim@@ b in front of the mirror .
they 're afraid their baby will die .
I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better .
this is where we need to make our voices heard .
that 's when I heard , maybe not for the first time , " Sti@@ f@@ le yourself , Je@@ an@@ ette , I 'm going . "
( la@@ ughter ) So ...
the truth was my grand@@ father took me to par@@ ades , we had lots of those .
the truth is he would write an occasional letter , and I did pick up those little envelop@@ es .
NL : an impact on him -- I was hes@@ itating over the word , " change . "
how old do you feel ?
each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes .
the fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs .
so this is the photograph I created of Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite .
this is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic .
the best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night .
you can see Michel@@ le waiting with the children , the president now gre@@ ets the crowd , he takes his oath , and now he 's speaking to the people .
( appl@@ ause ) I 've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work .
it keeps on occurring again and again , from many theories and many experiments , as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathemati@@ cians .
at that time , I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Prin@@ ce@@ ton -- for many years , the home of Albert E@@ in@@ stein and argu@@ ably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world .
and together with my former student and main collabor@@ ator Cl@@ é@@ ment Mou@@ hot , in Paris at the time , we had been working for months and months on such a proof .
( la@@ ughter ) Just moving on , let 's take the world @@@ -@@ @ famous Vincent Van Go@@ gh , who is very well @@@ -@@ @ represented on this platform .
coming back to gold very quickly , I wanted to search for gold and see how the machine tag@@ ged all the gold .
and then at lun@@ ch@@ time , I watched with an increasingly sick feeling as the el@@ dest girl in the family cooked por@@ ri@@ dge as a substitute for lunch .
so for the next 10 minutes , let 's not be sad about the state of the world .
and then we sur@@ round all that with training .
she has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hard@@ working person on the planet .
anybody can give , but we need more leadership .
if you 're interested in these ideas , check out this website .
we need more leaders .
humanity has put people on the moon .
we are an exceptional people .
we just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody .
in America , even a bank@@ rupt gam@@ bl@@ er gets a second chance .
your debt f@@ atten@@ s the profit of the student loan industry .
many years ago my teacher wrote , " When students are treated as consumers , they 're made prisoners of addiction and en@@ vy . "
and it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt .
but the philosophy student , as a consequence , is subsidi@@ zing the engineering student .
who then , by the way , goes on and ear@@ ns more money .
we know about statistics , right ?
but what most people don 't know is that people have stood up to ISIS using non@@ violent action .
so , that 's great .
what if your lab@@ s can go from the central lab to your home , to your phone , to even inside our bodies to measure drug levels or other varieties ?
and of course , we 're in the age of gen@@ om@@ ics .
and I can start to understand my pharmac@@ ogen@@ om@@ ics -- how my genes impact whether I need high dose , low dose , or maybe a different medication altogether .
so instead of taking six medications , for example , I could integrate them into one .
and when we hit print , you print your combination of medications that might be needed by you on any individual day .
how long is it until , say , that nursing @@@ -@@ @ home patient that you mentioned is able to print their pills in their home ?
and it was the most amazing meeting .
so she said to us , " Lo@@ ok , I 've been heading this department for the last two years .
and addressing these non @@@ -@@ @ obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
I 'll give you an example .
how do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers ?
similar to this early stage of this medium , in V@@ R , we also have to move past the spectac@@ le and into the stor@@ yt@@ elling .
composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you .
so I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see .
and we started seeing this all over In@@ st@@ agra@@ m .
only I think this one sur@@ passes it .
my vision is to make genetic research more native , to indi@@ gen@@ ize gen@@ ome sequ@@ encing technology .
as the leader of the NGO there , I spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities .
one of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we 've discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
( la@@ ughter ) But what he meant was that what we 've done , really , is stamp collect there .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
so all the exquis@@ itely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be possible without an extra bit .
but in the last few minutes , I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cos@@ m@@ ology .
it was big enough to be transparent to light , and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smo@@ ot described as looking at the face of God .
( la@@ ughter ) And I thought you might like to know who you are .
they all gather together .
it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation .
sometimes it 's an internal stimul@@ ant , from your body .
Don 't follow me .
it reminds me that the world 's in flux , and we have to respond to those changes .
and on this job site , 15 years after the Rwandan genocide , Bru@@ ce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds , and that half of them be women .
it 's exactly the same way that we do our own learning .
this is what happens if Alex uses his own face as a guide image during that optimization process to re@@ construct my own face .
Buddhism , imported from India .
around the same time as Egyptians were incub@@ ating eggs , Pho@@ en@@ ician merchants introduced chick@@ ens to Europe , where they quickly became an essential part of European livestock .
so along with my collaborators , we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound .
you will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume .
( digital h@@ um and whi@@ st@@ ling sound ) The ( whi@@ stles ) is fro@@ gs at home , don 't pay attention to that .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone , and I was almost one of them .
the sc@@ out is the one going out , mapping the terrain , identifying potential obstacles .
and we can get to a type of vertical agriculture .
if we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recycl@@ ers , then we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have to remove any more rain@@ forests to make the food and the goods that we consume .
but those ideas are ones that sign@@ ify fear and alien@@ ation .
our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point .
the reason : there is a lot of it .
so this can be used for making amazing things , like super @@@ -@@ @ fabrics for industrial and medical applications .
the reason is that in nature , there is no one there that actually takes my head and scre@@ ws it onto my neck , or takes my skin and gl@@ ues it onto my body .
the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
I 'm really glad we 're here .
I have a forest in the back@@ yard of my own house .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since Ali@@ a was six months old .
we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia .
tra@@ g@@ ically , after 40 generations of very careful stewardship by the K@@ ong@@ ō family , K@@ ong@@ ō G@@ umi succ@@ um@@ bed to a spectacular lap@@ se in the ability to apply a principle of prudence .
so , we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .
they have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa .
so what about Mars ?
( la@@ ughter ) This is a master@@ piece , and one of my all @@@ -@@ @ time favorite films .
that 's friction .
and these companies have the right to say " no . "
in a digital world , money can reach much far@@ ther and is much faster , but we 're at the mercy of these g@@ ate@@ keeper institutions .
so when I decided to create an art piece in Man@@ shi@@ yat N@@ aser , the neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt , I never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that I would ever live .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt .
the calligraphy , actually -- I used a white g@@ low @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ dark paint for the calligraphy so at the end of the project , we rented some black light projec@@ tors and lit up the whole neighborhood , surprising everybody around .
maybe some@@ day we could read out a memory .
this is an actual bi@@ op@@ sy from a human breast cancer patient .
thank you very much .
and first , just knowing what they 're going through .
all of us .
if you 're a person with privilege , it 's easier for you to advocate for allies .

so it 's time for Spo@@ t to come back out , and we 're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility , de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity and perception .
now , Spo@@ t has a set of cameras here , stere@@ o cameras , and we have a feed up in the center .
in fact , we look identical to the one next door , except that we 're bright yellow .
instead of pursuing the American dream , where we might have been isolated in our single @@@ -@@ @ family homes , we instead chose co@@ housing , so that we can increase our social connections .
when you eat together , you share more things .
we follow up , we check in , we speak our personal tru@@ ths and , when appropriate , we apolog@@ ize .
and in the library , I found the images that really captured the ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist of the Great De@@ pression .
my dog is in fact a mal@@ am@@ ute .
and it 's correct , there is a mal@@ am@@ ute in the image , but just given this label , we don 't actually know that much about what 's going on in the image .
I work on a problem called object detection , where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects , put b@@ ounding boxes around them and say what those objects are .
and at night , we would leave , get in the water , and we would swim and let the current carry us .
but after having lived through that with Lu@@ cho , after having faced fear together , united , not punishment , not violence -- nothing -- could ever again divide us .
I called the man up@@ stairs , and he sent me the patrol that rescu@@ ed me from the j@@ ung@@ le . "

thank you .
so .
he asked whether I 'd be interested in designing a program called a " conviction review unit . "
right ?
but my research showed that juvenile confessions without a parent present are prone to error .
we knew what really happened ; someone told them to say this .
I knew my baby did@@ n 't do this . "
if there 's anything that we 've learned , anything that I 've learned , with this conviction integrity work , it 's that justice do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
we make justice happen .
but the truth is that the challenges of making this happen have less to do with what we do and more to do with the wealth position in which we are born .
( audio ) Dr. G@@ lor@@ ia Mark : so we find that when people are stressed , they tend to shift their attention more rapidly .

I decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated .
and they do the paper@@ work , they do the insurance , they do all of the other forms that I can 't do quickly .
if you live in a city of eight @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ half million people , you can do this .

and imagine how this could revolu@@ tion@@ ize the way we manage aller@@ gies and chronic disease .
it 's a remote , mountainous zone , a blue zone , where super longevity is common to both sexes .
now , to return to the beginning , why do women live longer than men ?
we have knowledge .
( guitar ) And then there 's you .
the New York Post filed a Freedom of Information Act request , got all the teachers ' names and all their scores and they published them as an act of teacher @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ming .
( appl@@ ause ) And the rest of you , the non @@@ -@@ @ data scientists : this is not a math test .
and I g@@ lan@@ ced upward , and I was just du@@ mb@@ struck .
and so let me tell you : before you die , you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar ec@@ lip@@ se .
( la@@ ughter ) Because you 're using ammonia , you get h@@ ug@@ ely high pressures if you heated them wrong ; it top@@ ped 400 p@@ si .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
their alignment enables their autonomy , and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible .
now , today , to know how things are going , instead of looking at status reports , he needs to walk down to the team floors to attend one of their sessions .
now they have releases every few weeks , and without the hand@@ overs and the red tape , the whole organization becomes more efficient .
OK , so now you might understand what I said : modern A@@ Is do not read , do not understand .
and To@@ da@@ i Ro@@ bot chose the correct answer , too .

so this facility contains 2,@@ 650 mirrors which are ar@@ ra@@ yed in con@@ centric circles around an 140 @@@ -@@ @ meter @@@ -@@ @ tall tower at its center .
it 's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion and natural disasters , but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid .
so we 're already finding photographs to complete a digital reconstruction of this .
but cultural heritage offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people for future generations .
you 've got just a minute to jump through the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him str@@ an@@ ded in history .
these are smo@@ g @@@ -@@ @ free bicycles which -- I 'm Dutch , yes ? -- I have this " bicycle DNA " inside of me somewhere .
but going to this camp , I was further shocked to realize that it was actually really fun .
and what 's really tragic is that of@@ ten@@ times there 's no one profile .
how do we get rid of terrorist content ?
it 's not just recruiting combatants ; it 's trying to build a state .
I spent four years trying to analyze it , using standard academic tools , to guess what would happen , and I 'm here to tell you what I found .
this is your life : you start and you end , really simple .
but I tri@@ pled my money , and I tri@@ pled my money because I got lucky .
and that was because the computer could make decisions much faster , it could process a lot more information and it can process decisions much more -- less emo@@ tionally .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Now , if you 'd waited for one more year , you would have heard this .
( music ) The 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old , on every eight notes .
he was the president of a corporation in Ohio .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
the audience gas@@ ped when they heard the difference .
you ad@@ ore classical music . your FM is always on that classical dial .
now comes the third group : people who never listen to classical music .
and then there 's a very small group .
you cou@@ ld@@ n 't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome .
but I tell you what .
of course , I 'm not sure they 'll be up to it . "
when I started , you thought , " How beautiful that sounds . "
( music ) " I don 't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year . "
then your companion will di@@ g you in the ribs and say , " W@@ ake up ! it 's culture ! " and then you feel even worse .
we have a B. This is a B.
the next note is a C.
( la@@ ughter ) Now , it goes down to A.
( music ) That might have been a flu@@ ke .
or they say , " Ham@@ let has an O@@ edi@@ pus complex . "

so what the general straight public saw was this very aw@@ ful thing happening to a group of people who were already on the fr@@ ing@@ es of society .
but Jonathan insisted on paying , so he went to the store and bought something he did@@ n 't need to make change .
of course , for many of us , that happens through work .
of course , you don 't have to find purpose at work , but purpose gives you something to live for , some " why " that drives you forward .
one study had students look up at 200 @@@ -@@ @ feet @@@ -@@ @ tall e@@ uc@@ aly@@ p@@ tus trees for one minute .
of course , the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones .
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean .
so this is definitely physics happening here -- there 's lots of things -- this is definitely physics .
that 's allowed .
and if you go to some places like black holes in the beginning of the universe , we know that these are frontiers in physics , right ?
there 's plenty of physics research going on here .
but because it do@@ es@@ n 't involve pointing at stars , people for some reason think it 's not that .
I want you to tell me which one is which .
( audience responds ) The one on the left -- yes !
this is the Hu@@ b@@ ble Space Tel@@ es@@ cope .
Hu@@ b@@ ble has been floating in free space for 25 years , not touching anything .
Hu@@ b@@ ble kind of rot@@ ates around them , and so it can orient itself .
so the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use , also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time .
so this is the fun bit of physics , that you learn these patterns and then you can apply them again and again and again .
so I think we should play with these patterns .
magne@@ ts that you can play with in your kitchen get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation .
and being familiar with these concepts means we 're not helpl@@ ess .
it 's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions .
all of us can have fun playing with toys , and we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be embar@@ ras@@ sed about it .
I 'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are te@@ ac@@ ups around .

there are days when you feel as if you 're floating among the clouds .
these are fragile ecosystems .
Mike lost his job to a machine .
so what he 's talking about here is shared production , and efficiency is the name of the game .
it 's that simple .
El@@ iss@@ a 's question to me , back when she first came to my lab , indeed had been a life @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ death question .
can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone ?
a lot of things could be studied , but look at that : 30 years ago , we were still poor in China .

think about it .
and do you know how much it costs for a company to even have an office ?
but that is going to change by the convergence of two technologies : augmented reality and tele@@ presence robots .
a vehicle carrying a squ@@ ad@@ ron of d@@ ron@@ es .
so that 's two .
now , what was the third reason why people move to cities ?
a recent study made in the UK by the Office for National Statistics showed a higher life satisfaction rating among people living in rural areas .
( la@@ ughter ) I just think they will once they realize they can have the same benefits the city has .
I had just seen The Green Lady .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
I did@@ n 't bring one with me , but they really work much better off @@@ -@@ @ board .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
I 'm willing to suspect some of you had@@ n 't even heard of them before .
so what I want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out .
you see them , so they must see you .
on that -- well , that year , I had just begun my master 's at the University of Cape Town .
and so I started con@@ j@@ uring her mentally , spirit@@ ually and through dress .
this is what I have called " Africa 's knowledge imperative . "
African universities are now all too content to have e @@@ -@@ @ connections with libraries elsewhere , having given up ambitions on building libraries to which the world would come for intellectual edi@@ fication .
these are from YouTube .
but what Sil@@ v@@ arre@@ t has done here is that what he wanted to make was not a real city .
this is a fantasy city , even though it looks real .
like , it 's not enough to have a hospital .
so we need the solutions and these people , playing the game , they are trying out different kinds of solutions .
they 've been more likely to do worse at school , to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money .
reading to children every day seems to be really important , too .
were the children going to bed at regular times , or did they go to bed at different times during the week ?
so wait , does that actually mean , then , that poverty do@@ es@@ n 't matter after all ?
now , as you can imagine , the answers are@@ n 't quite as simple as that .
he had an idea .
I 'm talking about the creature in the box , not my cat .
but it will probably take a lot of time .
but I needed to know . like , I wanted to know .
I don 't have infinite olive branches to extend to people who , like , would not want to see me on this planet . right ?

just so that people will trust you with their money . "
and so you don 't get change by asking them or even y@@ elling at them .
( la@@ ughter ) So , now before I get to my four @@@ -@@ @ point plan for the revolution -- yes , I have a four @@@ -@@ @ point plan -- I have two pieces of very good and important news for you .
but the good news is , we exist , and there is a vast amount of un@@ tapped potential over here .
fact : women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets .
if we can figure out how to make our movies and deliver them to the audiences that want them , that 's it .
if you can give a female fil@@ m@@ maker 25 dollars in a crow@@ d@@ funding campaign , great , do that .
come pick it up .
looking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact that not much has changed in the education curricula in Africa .
I was in the United States in Washington , DC studying towards my doctorate , and I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region .
he said , " Oh , when I go to Africa , it 's so easy .
my bos@@ ses are happy with me . "
you own the knowledge . you know it all .

all my bad habits have got to , got to go .
we were at the border .
this time , an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm , because I lost my coat on the frozen river while batt@@ ling with one of these soldiers .
and I 'm in this place where I read and hear about North Korea provo@@ king the US .
but what we care about in food is nutritional value .
so this is where we enter the picture .
but he hears some voices up in the stair@@ well , so he clim@@ bs up the stair@@ well , comes around the corner , and finds a group of young African @@@ -@@ @ American men playing dic@@ e .
and so for instance , one thing the gang would do is -- the gang leaders would have big ent@@ oura@@ ges , and they 'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry .
one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like -- the gang leader always got paid .

you take an air@@ plane , you fly over the top , you 're weigh@@ tless for 25 seconds .
and my partner By@@ ron L@@ ich@@ ten@@ berg and I carefully suspended him into zero @@@ -@@ @ g .
and so her lawyers and I asked L@@ ily , did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her .
instead , we filed a civil lawsuit , and we eventually won the case , and her case became a r@@ all@@ ying cry for domestic workers everywhere .
we live in a time of moral choices everywhere we turn : at the border , at the ballot box , in our workplaces , right in our homes , full of moral choices .

to truly understand DNA decision @@@ -@@ @ making , we need to see the process of k@@ not formation in atomic detail .

you CA@@ N@@ NOT have a 100 percent mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic environment when there is a human element involved in the evalu@@ ative equation , because by definition , that makes it subjective .
it was almost two years later when I realized what this person should be called .

but here 's where the other currency is now most important .
un@@ concerned , pra@@ e@@ tor Cla@@ u@@ dius G@@ lab@@ er took an army of three thousand men to the rebel 's refuge at Mount Ve@@ su@@ vi@@ us , and blocked off the only passage up the mountain .
after failed attempts to build rafts , and a stin@@ ging betra@@ yal by local pirates , the rebels made a desperate run to break through Cra@@ s@@ sus 's lin@@ es@@ - but it was no use .
of course , I was immediately intri@@ gu@@ ed .
and as we started talking , I saw him y@@ ell something , and Eu@@ n @@@ -@@ @ So@@ ok came and brought us some food .
so the two of us were just like , " Oh my God , oh my God . "
this has got to be a night@@ mare , this can 't be happening .

and you know what ?
at some point , I realized that it is up to us as first respon@@ ders and as a community to solve this problem , to find better ways to deal with those that are suffering .
the education that I have received and continue to receive on a street level in Hun@@ ting@@ ton has been both eye @@@ -@@ @ opening and life @@@ -@@ @ changing for me .
as a team , they go out and visit people who have over@@ dos@@ ed within 72 hours of that re@@ su@@ sc@@ itation .

one treatment changed everything .
ne@@ ur@@ ons in the brain communicate via electrical signals , which influence our brain chemistry , contributing to mood and behavior .
EC@@ T also stimulates the flow of hormones that may help reduce symptoms of depression .
the first challenge is to re@@ think , fundamentally , the issue of the time .
the absolute majority of the world 's population are below 20 , and they are growing larger and faster .
but indeed , in recent crashes the lap @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ shoulder se@@ at@@ belts , actually , are doing even better than the car seats .
they say , " Well , that 's impossible , that can 't be . "
we can 't risk alien@@ ating them by testing se@@ at@@ belts relative to car seats . "
so , in some sense , what this is suggesting is that it 's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong , which is putting children at risk . it 's just that , fundamentally , the car seats are@@ n 't doing much .
it seems to me that this can 't be a very expensive solution , and it 's got to work better than what we already have .
I 've made him run into a wall here , over and over again .

what you see is it takes steps back@@ wards , it tries to counter @@@ -@@ @ balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land .
so I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take @@@ -@@ @ a@@ ways , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year .
I 'm very proud because I think I 'm the only person in America to out Bible @@@ -@@ @ talk a Jehovah 's W@@ itness .

that means you don 't actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold all the ra@@ bb@@ its - and the reproduction is already underway !

so imagine you 're at home and you break your favorite fig@@ urine or a mu@@ g or something like that ?
so where do you go ?
we need to scale this up , ideally maybe train car scale .
and here 's something else that we can do .
and then , we want to make an adhesive bond , or joint , and so we take another piece of metal and we put it on there and just position it .
this is a tube with lead shot in it , nothing fancy .
and it 's stuck .
it 's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce , so for us , it 's pretty exciting . it 's pretty cool .
but maybe more importantly , here , it 's also degra@@ dable , and we can de@@ grade it under very mild conditions , with water .
it 's just aw@@ ful . it hur@@ ts .

gal@@ ax@@ ies themselves are not stre@@ wn randomly in space ; they tend to cluster .
can we see it more visually ? yes , we can .
now , unfortunately , there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy , so it will be hard to tell the difference .
sometimes it draws circles , even slides back@@ wards , and that generations can make the same mistakes that their great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ fathers had made .
so even stronger than my emotions is my awareness that not only gender , not only identity , but life itself is fluid .
I think we need to go back to the basics , back to the colors of the alphabet .
and I think I 'll take off this one .
yes , yes , OK .

the question is , what 's the good you can do with it ?
what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow , and creating the peace space that allows us to move on .
it 's about non @@@ -@@ @ lethal technologies , because if you fire real amm@@ o into a crowd of women and children ri@@ oting you 're going to lose friends very quickly .

he was like , I try and I make .
first of all , Africans , we need to get better at telling our stories .
and we give them business development services , as well as financing loan and equity .
and basically , we started this because we were tired of complain@@ ing about our politicians .
what are they doing ?
they come from us .
you know , my vision is that my daughter , and any other African child being born today , can be whoever they want to be here , without having to leave .

S@@ W : ye@@ ah . she would get really , really excited .
E : [ spac@@ eship noise ] S@@ W : even if it do@@ es@@ n 't have a laser ?
one of the things that we did with the An@@ s@@ ari X PR@@ I@@ Z@@ E was take the challenge on that risk is OK , you know .
we know -- 20 million dollars today , you can go and buy a ticket , but how cheap could it get ?
it 's about 5.7 gig@@ aj@@ ou@@ les of energy .
I have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
you get publicity increase , and when it 's won , publicity sho@@ ots through the roof -- if it 's properly managed -- and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor .
history really matters .
and like him , I loved everything about it : the show@@ manship , the athle@@ tic skill , the drama .
and " my long @@@ -@@ @ term partner has this kind of business , " and " I 've done research on this for months .

here are two images of a house .
so what do we mean when we talk about noise ?

narr@@ ator : stir@@ red by the prospects of mass communication and making big buc@@ ks on advertising , David Sar@@ no@@ ff commerci@@ alizes radio .
and that 's the kind of resolution that you need to begin to image that little spec@@ k of dust as it comes around the sun and see if it has a blue @@@ -@@ @ green signature .
and as you 're looking at this stuff , here 's kind of a country view at a 400 base pair resolution level , and then you zoom in to 550 , and then you zoom in to 850 , and you can begin to identify more and more genes as you zoom in .
DNA is a really powerful information storage device .
and a lot of us think , " Oh no , we never want to re@@ design humans . "
he 's had the precursor of the R@@ NA be absorbed by the cell and then he 's had the cells divide .
so we 're getting to the point where we can rebuild most of our body parts , in the same way as if you break a bone or burn your skin , it reg@@ rows .

people who are high in openness to experience just cra@@ ve novel@@ ty , variety , diversity , new ideas , travel .
you can predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to and what kinds of food they like to eat .
let 's find out .
are@@ n 't they the foundations of xenophobia , author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism and pur@@ it@@ anism ?
you have the markings of V@@ ish@@ nu on the left , so we could think of V@@ ish@@ nu as the conservative god .
and to them , call@@ outs for civil@@ ity are really very much like what George Or@@ well wrote in " 1984 " -- he called it " new@@ speak . "
when you have a specific word , though , to describe a problem like that , you know you really have a problem .
but therein lies the third rule : Don 't mistake decor@@ um for civil@@ ity .
so I think civil@@ ity , with that understanding , is not a dirty word .
thank you .

so what made James Bal@@ d@@ win lo@@ om so large in the imag@@ inations of both the public and the authorities ?
it was popular with both black and white readers .
you can 't get an exact number for that kind of probability , but what I 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhel@@ med psych@@ ologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
and this is a real crisis for them .
now , the end product of that action is up on the board here .
Richard W@@ ur@@ man : that 's the end ! Ke@@ ith Bel@@ lows : ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah .
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
so books , music , video , software . there 's only 50,000 titles of it .
good stor@@ yt@@ elling is cra@@ fting a story that someone wants to listen to .

this is the US@@ DA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
this is available on my website in English and Spanish , and it 's a visual way to talk to kids about food .
these are your children and grand@@ children that are totally melting down when you pick them up , because they haven 't had lunch .
but we really have to educate .
instead of the National School Lun@@ ch Program being under the US@@ DA , I think it should be under C@@ DC .
that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools , 80 to 90 cents . in L.@@ A. , it 's 56 cents .
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .
it was@@ n 't going anywhere toward , you know , saying what the gene was ; it was just nuclear science . and oh , that 's the book , little book .
it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an R@@ NA molec@@ ule , and then how do you go from R@@ NA to protein ?
and , you know , I want to make it bl@@ ink and do all that at the same time .
and I started working with Sol@@ id Works and a whole other group to do that .
so you see -- he@@ y , come on . He@@ y , did you feel that ?
you 've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it , or else you can .
I want to know the size of the market . why is this market worth getting at ?
there 's never been a company with no competition , even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
so , one day , while we were sitting in the office , a farm worker comes in .
I first traveled there in 2003 , and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. P@@ les .
and if we had only recovered the sk@@ ull , we might have called it one thing ; if we had only recovered the pel@@ vis , we might have called it another .
why is there so much morph@@ ological variation in the gen@@ us Hom@@ o ?

who did it evolve from ?
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
he studied how our process of perception do@@ es@@ n 't just register sen@@ sory inputs , but trans@@ forms them .
patients suffering from the same mental illnesses also performed similarly , making the test a reliable diagnostic tool .
by the 1960s , it had been officially administered millions of times in the U.S. alone .
bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns behind our perceptions .

I would never have the money to actually pay for the install@@ ment or pay for all the bil@@ l@@ boards or the production of these , so there 's always a client attached to them .
now , based on what I know about the game of Go , I would 've gu@@ essed that it really ought to be on the safe side of that line .
but the fact that it is@@ n 't , and that Google solved this problem , suggests that that line is going to be very dynamic .
that 's something that we should absolutely strive to move toward .
now , basic income is becoming a very important idea .
Don 't worry , I 'm not going to give you my whole speech in the dark .
we also need electricity , we need the energy .
now , families are approaching us from all around the Gaza Strip .
now I can control my source of energy .
each pix@@ el in a black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white photo is simply a zero or a one .
it 's really hard to grasp what 's important today , or what will be important for future generations .
instead of asking the current generation -- us -- what might be important in the future , we could store everything in DNA .
so I came to realize once again , as I did when I needed help to go to university , that while I could dream or have a dream , I could not make it come true all by myself .
none of us will see that day , but we must start in the hope that future generations will be able to finish the job .
you talked about , we need to do an experiment on this .
that lim@@ e is going to get out there .
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol , for example .
what I want to suggest to you , though , in the next couple of minutes is that there 's also a hopeful response to this .

what does it mean to say that there 's an Islamic democracy ?
( la@@ ughter ) He ran ads on TV that my kids thought made me look like Vol@@ dem@@ ort , and sent out little g@@ ems in the mail , like this .
now , why is that story and that approach so novel ?
over 150 programs had their funding reduced because they could not demonstrate success .
I thought that was nice .
the research we have today is creating a new definition of what real clean@@ liness is .

now , artificial intelligence has started bol@@ stering their business as well .
that 's why you see it in every supermarket .
now , the problem is@@ n 't solved if he do@@ es@@ n 't publish it , because there are already companies that are developing this kind of technology , and a lot of the stuff is just off the shelf .
this simple t@@ weak .

I just want to get that out of the way .
the reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it .
he did@@ n 't actually buy anything , just some data .
this is happening in your local cities too , you 're probably just not aware of it .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
without it , the problems faced in the real world -- poverty , war , disease and genocide -- lack the le@@ vity they should .
a well @@@ -@@ @ designed video game will seam@@ lessly we@@ ave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience .
I 'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization .

being surrounded by many cultures was the norm , but also a very confusing experience .
in both Chinese and Native folk , I sense this inherent sound of l@@ onging and holding onto the past , an emo@@ tion that greatly drives the music I create today .
in my father 's words , " Being Native is not about wearing long hair in bra@@ ids .

if they did , it probably was right there at Ground Zero .
( la@@ ughter ) I also did -- and I don 't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection .

the new thing now is that computers can find their own rules .

it 's a bit sc@@ ary , I know .
sometimes , the cur@@ l might completely enclose part of the wave , forming a moving tube of water known as the barrel .
after months of strategic planning and controversy , thousands of women gathered in Washington D.C.
as a dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised group , women had no voice in the laws that affected the@@ ir@@ - or anyone else '@@ s@@ - lives .

it can sometimes seem that we are doomed to take sides , be stuck in echo chambers and never agree again .
I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours , a tool that you might not expect : abstract mathematics .
and then at the top , we have 30 , which is a product of three prime numbers -- two times three times five .
now maybe it can be clear that it do@@ es@@ n 't really matter what those numbers are .
and there are many things we can learn from this diagram , I think .

this actually used to be a cor@@ n@@ field nine months ago , and with the Rwandan government , we level@@ ed it and built this center in a couple weeks .
and from the moment it leaves the end of the laun@@ cher , it 's completely autonomous .

this is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue .
J@@ im@@ my , you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia 's success .

I 'm showing to you different sections of the show right now , just to give you a taste of it .
in this case too , you have a mixture of scientists and designers .
so , we 'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future .
one of the most important topics of the show -- you know , as anything in our life today , we can look at it from many , many different viewpoints , and at different levels .
it takes seven days today to manufacture a chair , but you know what ? one day it will take seven hours .
Eli@@ o C@@ acc@@ av@@ ale : he took the idea of those dol@@ ls that explain le@@ uk@@ emia .
it 's quite amazing how these things can make you smile , can make you laugh , can make you cry sometimes .
pol@@ lin@@ ator decline is a grand challenge in the modern world .
we 're finding out now that in rural areas , there are 150 plants on average in a sample of honey .
we now have a baseline measure of honey , honey DNA from before and after the storm .
( la@@ ughter ) And even now , a decade and a half later , even now that we are married , I look for her still , whenever she is not in the room .
I backed away .
it was our first show .
( music ) Than@@ k you .
this is a sal@@ ve that our democracy so@@ rely needs .
and it 's not just a matter of gl@@ amor@@ izing cleaning your floor .
the other is a letter to the in@@ mate with specific suggestions for how to manage themselves .
I just have to work a lot harder at it . " ( laugh@@ s ) And here 's Thomas .
and yet , look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold .
and you get all the disease @@@ -@@ @ protective substances .
and it can be labor @@@ -@@ @ intensive , it 's sometimes costly .
but again , just like school @@@ -@@ @ based initiatives , this is hard work .
what makes this disease so deadly ?
this leaves the patient with a deficit in the amount of heart muscle that they have .
so if we could do eight points in the clinic , I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact on human health .
little do they know it , but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death .
but in that case , if the mat@@ uring brain is to blame , then why are te@@ ens more vulnerable than children , even though their bra@@ ins are more developed than those of children ?
in short , I wanted to conduct a research study to answer one big question : why do te@@ ens keep making ou@@ trage@@ ous choices that are harmful to their health and well @@@ -@@ @ being ?
but , you see , I attended a high school in South Dakota with limited opportunity for scientific exploration .
can positive risk @@@ -@@ @ taking escalate with repeated exposures ?
I turned around to a tall , broad @@@ -@@ @ shoul@@ dered man , pure hate in his eyes .
and I began to think about what I could potentially offer to build safety and power for women .
and we mean those words .
and for that to happen , we need all hands on deck .
so I 've given you my secret recipe , and now it 's up to you .
H@@ T : well , thank you very much for that fantastic question .
so don 't ever think you don 't have power if you don 't sit in a position of power .
and that 's to say nothing of his idea of a go@@ ose machine that could go to the Moon .
in 1981 , it flew 163 miles from Paris to England , solely on the power of sun@@ beams , and established a basis for the P@@ ath@@ fin@@ der .
OK .
and with a large weight , you get a large contraction .
if you put different communication technologies on this log@@ arith@@ mic graph , television , radio , telephone were adopted in decades .
the most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions .
my main message is that progress in technology is expon@@ ential , not linear .
how can you be stressed on one side of your body and not the other ?
so I waited and he came back .
we 've had people whose hair stands on end on one arm 20 minutes before a seizure . "
he explained how this could happen in the brain , and he got interested . I showed him the data .
this is a really great thing , a really positive step .
she is , like , everything .
they were sons and daughters , brothers and sisters .
this is possible if we do the work .
ca : that 's an amazing story , thank you .
KB : thanks for letting me show these .
painted with squ@@ ir@@ rel @@@ -@@ @ hair brush@@ es on vel@@ l@@ um or par@@ chment by monks , n@@ un@@ s , and urban craf@@ ts@@ people , these b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re images pop@@ ulate the margins of the most pri@@ zed books from the Middle A@@ ges .
more parents were divorced in this generation than any generation prior .
they 're incredibly pragmatic , they 're hopeful and they 're determined .
I 've been spending some time thinking about this and research@@ ing this , and fellow researchers and I are@@ n 't exactly sure that these generations are real .
thank you very much .
so , the guy replies , " Y@@ ea@@ h , I know , I know .
the blood moving through your ar@@ teries .
for example , the motion of the atmosphere is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the earth 's rotation .
Ke@@ ith Sch@@ ach@@ t : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
( appl@@ ause ) So what 's the significance of this dry liquid ?
thank you .
and I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex @@@ -@@ @ combatants , as they like to be called .
no , once we 're done with that , we wait a few days , and then , we an@@ esthe@@ tize those sp@@ id@@ ers .
te@@ ens who use tobacco products are more likely to use m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety as a teen or as an adult .
the trick lies in a phenomenon known as total internal reflection .
so we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
he was a creativity researcher in the ' 6@@ 0s and ' 7@@ 0s , and also led the Stan@@ ford Design Program .
I need you to turn that piece of paper over ; you should find that it 's blank on the other side .
( la@@ ughter ) There we go .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you , thank you , thank you .
helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
now , an adult en@@ countering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categor@@ ize it just as quickly as we can , you know .
I suspect , actually , that the evolutionary bi@@ ologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categor@@ ize new things very , very quickly .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stri@@ py thing : is that a ti@@ ger just about to jump out and kill us ?
of course they will . but they 'll also ask , " What can I do with it ? "
any parents of young kids in the audience ? there must be some .
he gave each of them some m@@ escal@@ ine , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
now , that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lis@@ a and the Mac@@ int@@ os@@ h .
so I put it through a G.@@ C. , a Gas Ch@@ ro@@ mat@@ o@@ graph that I have in my office , and it 's about 400 .
like , at no concentration , even pure , you know , if you smel@@ t pure ethanol , it do@@ es@@ n 't smell of ro@@ tten eggs .
if you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
the bad news is they 're rocket fuels .
OK , great , we smell vibrations . how ? all right ?
and this is our new baby , called ton@@ k@@ ene .
this is a new 33 @@@ -@@ @ million @@@ -@@ @ pound college of further education that was mostly funded by the European Union .
he was fed up with it .
and this entire referendum took place in darkness , because it took place on Facebook .
( appl@@ ause ) Our parliament has been the first in the world to try to hold you to account , and it 's failed .
democracy is not guaranteed , and it is not inevitable , and we have to fight and we have to win and we CA@@ N@@ NOT let these tech companies have this un@@ checked power .
so , about three years ago I was in London , and somebody called How@@ ard Bur@@ ton came to me and said , I represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
we have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well .
it took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea .
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
no matter what any one nation @@@ -@@ @ state does , they will not be able to solve the problem alone .
Rwanda itself was not seen as news@@ worthy , and amaz@@ ingly , genocide itself was not seen as news@@ worthy .
why no hearings , no den@@ unci@@ ations , no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House ? what 's the deal ?
evangel@@ icals have joined it . Jewish groups have joined it .
now because it 's student @@@ -@@ @ driven , there 's some amazing things that the movement has done .
and that 's all the Bush administration 's leadership , and it 's all because of this bottom @@@ -@@ @ up pressure and the fact that the phones haven 't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis .
he 's the vic@@ ero@@ y . he has to decide on tax policy , on currency , on border patrol , on policing . he has to make all these judgments .
and sometimes , it 's better to be lucky than good .
ca : so you started capturing huge amounts of data .
ca : ye@@ ah , that is amazing .
so tell us more about what we 're actually looking at here .
ca : and so when we think of a black hole , you think of these huge rays j@@ et@@ ting out of it , which are pointed directly in our direction .
now , we 're too close to really see all the jet structure , but it 's the base of those j@@ ets that are illuminating the space @@@ -@@ @ time .
you 're just going to drift right through that event horizon .
today , this shared universe is called the C@@ th@@ ul@@ hu My@@ th@@ os , named after L@@ ov@@ ecraft 's in@@ famous blend of dra@@ gon and oc@@ top@@ us .
unfortunately , L@@ ov@@ ecraft 's fear of the unknown found a less sav@@ ory expression in his personal views .
I came here to give you a science lesson about animal m@@ ating systems and why defining mon@@ og@@ amy has been a challenge for scientists .
now , " OP@@ P " is a call @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ response song .
now , in the song , the MC h@@ ints that it 's a five @@@ -@@ @ letter word , but to keep it rated PG , he simply refers to it as " property . "
now , before that technique , we were never ever certain about , 100 percent , who the parents of baby birds were .
we now call this " serial mon@@ og@@ amy . "
" it 's OP@@ P , time for other people 's what you get it there 's no room for relationship , there 's just room to ... "
you down with E@@ PC ?
and often , I 'm driving in a taxi , and I see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I 'd never seen happen before .
how can I ever make anything as beautiful as G@@ ret@@ a Gar@@ bo ?
so actually , check this out .
so you 'll have to go check it out and come see me or something , because it 's mor@@ ti@@ fying .
again , I don 't know where inspiration comes from .
there I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
that 's just that .
and I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
IM : ye@@ ah , it is . exactly .
in any day , the cells in your body will collectively accumulate billions of these single @@@ -@@ @ letter sw@@ aps , which are also called " point mu@@ tations . "
base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe .
two companies I co@@ founded , Be@@ am Ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tics and pa@@ ir@@ wise Plants , are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases and to improve agriculture .
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
E@@ B : looks kind of like an ice cream con@@ e , more or less .
it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product .
but there was something b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re about it .
( la@@ ughter ) OK , al@@ right . but enough about me .
OK , so I think this is the science behind the whole thing .
but it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the tough@@ est problems we 're facing .
the Canadian government allows any five Canad@@ ians to privately sponsor a family of refugees .
we saw that the more money people gave to S@@ pread the Net , the hap@@ pier they reported feeling after@@ ward .
each night , a local business sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal .
let 's take a snap@@ shot at aviation .
well , what did I do when I was a k@@ id ?
sol@@ idi@@ fying into surface , mol@@ ded by fire .
we can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
( la@@ ughter ) And this is my -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space .
some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a gh@@ o@@ stly woman reaching out her window .
( la@@ ughter ) What would they know ?
this place is remote . it 's over 200 miles from any major city .
that 's a 2,000 @@@ -@@ @ foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
thank you very much .
and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular gal@@ ax@@ ies and first stars to these more advanced gal@@ ax@@ ies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
and it 's mat@@ uring up to the present time .
what happens is , you take pictures as the Earth rot@@ ates , you get a fan across the sky .
do you see the fan @@@ -@@ @ like scans made across the sky ?
and you start seeing these networks , this cosmic web of structure forming .
and at that point , the universe myster@@ iously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger @@@ -@@ @ scale structure .
but what we 're hoping when we get to Plan@@ ck , we 'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asym@@ metric advantage .
and it was quite an experience to be there .
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the sanitation trucks were par@@ ked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rub@@ ble away .
it was quite a compelling experience , but not really , I suppose , a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books .
now , just imagine what that $ 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education .
so given that we know and should believe -- because Mo@@ ore 's Law 's been , like , a constant , I mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 .
we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that 's a property of carbon fiber also .
the inside of the nano@@ tubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nan@@ ometers -- that it 's basically a quantum world .
and so we begin to see , and we 've seen business plans already , where the kind of things Lis@@ a R@@ and@@ all 's talking about are in there .
new materials that can make water , new materials that can make fuel cells work better , new materials that cataly@@ ze chemical reactions , that cut pollution and so on .
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .
the third area that we 're working on , and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York .
we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly .
we can 't fight at a million @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one disadvantage .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
what I want to do is I want to we@@ ave computing , AI and internet as part of us .
as part of human cogn@@ ition , freeing us to interact with the world around us .
one of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks that we do as human beings .
people don 't want to be read , they want to write .
perhaps a greeting , like , " Hello , how are you ? "
I feel like this is amazing , it 's innovative , it 's cre@@ ep@@ y , it 's terri@@ fying .

he was right .
the history of fo@@ ie gr@@ as .
mega @@@ -@@ @ farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long @@@ -@@ @ distance travel , food processing .
we see them on the front of the bus , on the bak@@ ery 's facade , on the keyboard we write on , on our cell phones -- everywhere .
now , dealing with an un@@ familiar language was at times very frustr@@ ating and uncomfortable .
[ no t@@ res@@ passing ! ] I could also tell when something was made to last forever .
after a few days in the city , I was on the loo@@ k@@ out for something tasty to take back home .
so I walked and walked and walked until I found the perfect bak@@ ery .
telling stories by drawing letters -- that 's my job .
now , my friends who don 't want kids , all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies .
and yet , despite all this chaos , I still think we should have babies .
I believe we can and should fight for the earth and humanity , side by side .
where there was once hope , now there is convenient space , and good mile@@ age , good mile@@ age .
according to the World Health Organization , we need to average about 2.1 children per woman today just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation .
it seems every generation is indeed connected .
even after ending its one @@@ -@@ @ child policy in 2015 , China 's birth rates have largely declined .
he said families where the women have four or more kids will no longer pay income tax .
( audience gas@@ ps ) It has been a challenging week .
it has been a challenging week .
but that 's not the reason you have babies .
we 're going to be stuck in the screens with our faces not seeing the world around us ?
we worked with my collaborators , who were not engineers .
how can we go from one product to many products ?
I 'm not talking about creating another gad@@ get you get bo@@ red with and throw in the back of your draw@@ er and forget about .
that 's what it looks like , and it 's a small device which will be connected to things we want to make smart and connected and interactive .
to temp@@ t us to act differently with del@@ ight@@ ful creative sc@@ ra@@ ps .
and they lived together happ@@ ily ever after .
the experience left him with a far more p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic view of social reform , and his focus shifted toward spiritual concerns .
in the community of Athens , Tennessee , a fe@@ i@@ sty leader named Wh@@ it@@ ney Kim@@ ball Co@@ e leads h@@ ers in an art and fra@@ ming shop with a youth cho@@ ir and lots of little flags .
binding ourselves this way actually liber@@ ates us .
the " them " is those who don 't .
I know civic religion is not enough to remedy the radical inequities of our age .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT un@@ pollu@@ te our politics if we clean only downstream .
they don 't really have so many of the exten@@ sor muscles that are the weight @@@ -@@ @ bearing muscles ; instead , they rely on re@@ tractor muscles to pull themselves along .
and we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction .
I 'm a pretty speedy character .
but the fifth world still was@@ n 't truly established .
that would keep it from forming the t@@ angles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
and this is a connection that most people are@@ n 't pursuing right now , but which we 're fasc@@ inated by .
you can see the range of the Coast Red@@ woods . it 's here , in red .
this butt@@ ress is less than half@@ way up the tree .
these are mill@@ ennial structures -- portions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
there are four humans in this shot -- one , two , three , four .
well , I think they can tell us something about human time .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
and we 're doing it without a sales @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ marketing team .
now , what we 're doing is , we 're doing one that will be both front@@ lit and back@@ lit .
so we 're targeting 50 dollars in 2010 .
are we dre@@ aming ? is this real ?
one is that if you went into space you 'd be able to begin again .
so that 's kind of the idea -- we as humans cra@@ ve the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible .
we 're very sensitive to that as humans .
gener@@ ically , what we use the Web for is to organize , exchange , create and consume information .
you are always there with other people .
one of my favor@@ ites . I had this feature that I built into Second Life -- I was really passionate about it .
there is a new sky every night .
but the fact remains : the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same .
I think this should be concerning , considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now .
typically , pain helps the body avoid further injury or damage .
we 're only beginning to un@@ cover the mechanisms behind the experience of pain , but there are some promising areas of research .
it 's got an unfortunate level of detail , unfortunately .
( la@@ ughter ) You can see every por@@ e , every wr@@ ink@@ le .
it 's business that must take a side .
you see , we 'd just been to the gro@@ cery store , and my mom refused to buy us the jar of O@@ val@@ tine that had the coupon for the Cap@@ tain Mid@@ night dec@@ o@@ der ring in it .
good news : ch@@ ari@@ ot 's coming .
that she@@ en , perfect !
and you don 't have to be on one side of the spectrum or the other side of the spectrum , or fit into someone 's m@@ old , your mom 's m@@ old , whoever 's m@@ old that you are trying to fit into .
these roles were stereotypes and cou@@ ld@@ n 't have been further from my own reality or from the roles I dre@@ am@@ t of playing .
and our goal was to prove that this sensor would work really well to detect that hydrogen gas .
the thing is , I 've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades .
look , tens of thousands of people died from antibio@@ tic @@@ -@@ @ resistant super@@ bugs in North America just last year .
I 'm sca@@ red .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I got lucky .
I 'd see an ad for a product I had just whis@@ pered to a friend about yesterday .
and it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Gu@@ t@@ ten@@ berg Bible .
you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Gu@@ t@@ ten@@ berg in 14@@ 55 .
the room is a theatre . it changes colors .
( appl@@ ause ) TED is all about patterns in the clouds .
achieving this goal and improving healthcare in general is in everyone 's best interest , from individual people to society as a whole .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
( la@@ ughter ) We feel it throughout our teenage years , as my mom can certainly att@@ est to with me .
and we compare simulated univers@@ es like that -- I 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky .
but they will have a dark side .
metallic objects -- albeit very small ones , a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the Earth .
now , the idea is simple when we 're applying it to coin tos@@ ses , but in fact , it 's not very simple in everyday life .
until about a dozen years ago , when I was really captured by ca@@ ves , and I really re @@@ -@@ @ focused most of my research in that direction .
now , to wrap this up , I want to talk for two seconds about ca@@ ves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural out@@ growth of the work that we do in ca@@ ves .
beneath a surface layer of ice thick@@ er than Mount E@@ ve@@ rest , there exists a liquid ocean as much as 100 kilometers deep .
they hope to send a probe to test whether the ge@@ y@@ sers " plum@@ es of vap@@ or contain life @@@ -@@ @ enabling material from that hidden sea .
this guy is now five generations removed from the General ; this guy is about seven .
they looked at " The Young and The Re@@ st@@ less . " it was@@ n 't that , either .
but at some point , all these people had a very similar experience that conver@@ ged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant .
birthday party ? cake and cand@@ les .
an expec@@ tant mother I know was dre@@ ading her baby shower .
what about a hypo@@ the@@ tical tense Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving dinner ?
rules are powerful , because they allow us to temporarily change and harmonize our behavior .
the way we gather matters because how we gather is how we live .
and then , out of the blue , some physician 's assistant called me at work to tell me that I had stage IV cancer , and that I was going to need to come to the hospital right away .
( la@@ ughter ) I believed that hardships were only de@@ tours on what I was certain would be my long , long life .
I had to face the fact that my life is built with paper walls , and so is everyone else 's .
but the Danish word for design is " form@@ gi@@ v@@ ning , " which literally means to give form to that which has not yet been given form .
they did@@ n 't have TV screens , and they did@@ n 't have any football games to watch .
( la@@ ughter ) So I started developing -- you know , George 's d@@ ad had a lot of help . I just had my brother .
but I was@@ n 't worried , by the way , about , you know , the explosion causing the destruction of the planet .
but if you go to authority , and you always don 't -- you don 't always get the right answer , see .
OK . all scientists are@@ n 't like that .
and they we@@ ren 't the curious little boys that liked to put fro@@ gs up in the air .
so the temperature has been , sort of , in@@ ching up .
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
so if you just average that and the daytime temperature , it looks like it went up about .@@ 7 degrees in this century .
it 's a paper that came out in February , and most of you probably had@@ n 't heard about it .
so you still get heated , but you don 't dissip@@ ate any .
so the planet should get war@@ mer .
these papers should have been called , " The End to the Global W@@ arming Fi@@ as@@ co , " you know .
it may seem like we 're all standing on solid earth right now , but we 're not .
if you only lived for a day .
and they can do this with a ton of different elements .
they can do this with sulphur , iron , man@@ ganese , nitrogen , carbon , some of them can use pure electr@@ ons , straight up .
but the fact that it erupted illustrates perfectly that if you want to look for where carbon dioxide gas is coming out of this oce@@ anic plate , then you should look no further than the volcan@@ oes themselves .
everything is interconnected .
if people think they can 't do their work , there 's no chance of getting the local buy @@@ -@@ @ in you need for the area to be successful .
it already has .
Don 't forget : a computer came out ; it had no software .
and so in Japan , I began to experiment with people .
in the end , he drew a house . it was the most b@@ oring thing .
and so I never developed the ability to have a staff .
he was the first digital media producer in Tokyo .
in fact , I think that most of it has to do with body size -- the size you are when you inherit a vacant Eco@@ Space from whatever natural disaster .
a pre@@ dat@@ or . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .

some of them -- the most important -- are mental .
they 're usually students who 've never seen a desert .

here 's an example .
so these researchers edited H@@ 5@@ N1 's gen@@ ome and made it every bit as deadly , but also wil@@ dly contag@@ ious .
and the keys to the kingdom are these tiny , tiny data files .
let 's say it 's 20@@ 26 , to pick an arbitrary year , and a brilliant vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ist , hoping to advance science and better understand pan@@ dem@@ ics , designs a new bug .
( la@@ ughter ) I was raised by my grand@@ parents , and they were anti@@ ques dealers , so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things .
how many versions of you are there ?
again , another medical example here .
so , the thing that we designed , much less sex@@ y but much more human and practical , was this .
they 're now called k@@ ick@@ start .
but they 're real examples in urbanization and the change that 's occurred in the last number of years , and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
and it 's that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves .
if you don 't come back now , you 'll never come back . "
he said that there are people in jail who , like slaves , don 't want to think about their condition , because it 's too painful .
let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question .
did reading save his life ?
reading gave him a language for what he had lost .
the link between reading and writing is so powerful .
and -- and you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once , but they won 't eat it again if they don 't like it , right ?
O.@@ K. ? radical , not subtle .
and instead of a short answer , Jesus replied with a par@@ able .
a road like in this country has been rooted in things like mis@@ og@@ y@@ ny .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commodi@@ tized .
we seek to attract energetic , talented and diverse scientists from around the world , at all career stages , to join us .
there was no format .
( la@@ ughter ) S@@ ame color , same message , same words .
so , this was the contents page originally .
got no way of tracking it , so I could be totally wrong .
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .
a lot of very hand@@ some and pretty people here , sk@@ in@@ ny , ch@@ ub@@ by , different races , cultures . we are all 9@@ 9.9 % genetically equal .

a trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manip@@ ulates them with l@@ asers .
super@@ conducting circuits , meanwhile , make operations much faster than trapped ions , and it 's easier to scale up the number of circuits in a computer than the number of ions .
moreover , I 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success .

it 's worth noting , and I 'll leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or not , that all three of these countries are currently led by women .
I think we owe that to this generation .
it 's why experts and forec@@ asters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out .
countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions , multiple forms of renewable energy , not just one .
try some experiments .
so now this form of nursing has prolif@@ erated across the Netherlands and around the world .

on the other hand , by talking , a group could exchange knowledge , correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas .
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what 's happening , showing us our impact on the Earth .
and fortunately , in our time , we 've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
and with knowing comes caring .

natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , water@@ sh@@ eds and wildlife .
that 's another great idea .

I 'm not going to get into details here , but let me tell you so much : we are in a point of history that the most destructive force on the planet is humanity itself .
so let 's give it a try , let 's rock and roll , let 's flood the world with climate activists .
there are also chemical pathways .

in a sil@@ o , it might work for the one agency that has control over it , but not connecting this data means we don 't know how many are unique .
the first is with law enforcement : helping them identify new victims faster , stopping abuse and stopping those producing this content .
the second is with companies : using it as clu@@ es to identify the hundreds of millions of files in circulation today , pulling it down and then stopping the upload of new material before it ever goes viral .

( la@@ ughter ) I kept on doing this for a while .
here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predic@@ tably all the time .
it turns out that because we don 't en@@ code duration in the way that we en@@ code intensity , I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower .
we call this like a personal f@@ udge factor .

we don 't have a draft . we don 't have declarations of war anymore .
they also record everything that they see .
but we have to remember , these are just the clips .
as anyone who 's played Grand The@@ ft Auto knows , we do things in the video world that we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't do face to face .
and so you have this question : what does this lead to issues like war crimes ? robots are emo@@ tion@@ less , so they don 't get upset if their bud@@ dy is killed .
and now , we 're using our creativity in a certain direction , to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities , maybe even one day an entirely new species .
they cried .
and cried .
I remember as the youngest of these five kids feeling heard for the first time .
( la@@ ughter ) Al@@ ways listen to your parents .
( la@@ ughter ) I wanted to be Z@@ em@@ ec@@ k@@ is , Luc@@ as and Spi@@ el@@ berg .
the last thing I wanted to talk about was my own cultural identity , my ethnicity .
I heard from voices from the sky ...
OK , fine , it was Twitter .
and then I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I am Hollywood .
also , some tech founders out here started to post stuff on social media , write stuff about us in articles in the " LA Times , " in " The Hollywood Re@@ porter " and " Entertainment Week@@ ly . "
what an amazing thing to witness .
it became more physical when I went to the movie theater .
so I have a challenge for myself and for anyone here .
there are certain very important but sensitive drugs that are easily degraded by enzy@@ mes in the blood .
and here we see the illustration of blocking the liver .
and that ends with a little cli@@ p of my father , of L@@ ou , talking about something that is very dear to him , which is the accidents of life .
we were the first film crew in there .
NK : thank you .
he is not a political man , but in this gu@@ ise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
despite that , 15 years ago , I left medical school , as I missed mathematics .
since then , I 've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data .
it would be really nice if there was just one chemical that they detected , but it 's not that simple .
now three of the s@@ ocks have been worn by children who were un@@ infected , and just one of the s@@ ocks was worn by a child who was infected with malaria .
and if you cou@@ ld@@ n 't predict , you died .
it 's becoming asym@@ metrical in its activity , biased towards the right , which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world , as opposed to step back .
to enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty .
so where can we find a@@ we , given how important it is ?
( appl@@ ause ) Please , come up .
part of the problem from creating us versus them is it 's hard to do .
these kids , these parents , they don 't get lawyers .
this is@@ n 't about kids and borders .
with five decision @@@ -@@ @ makers there are a lot of linkages -- 120 , as a matter of fact , if you remember your fac@@ tor@@ ials .
five fac@@ torial is 120 .
does that mean we 've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know , from 120 to 240 ?
and everybody 's best friend , Ahmad@@ ine@@ jad . how are things going for him ?
but in any event , by the end of this year , beginning of next year , we get to a stable equilibrium outcome .
these fol@@ ks are the mone@@ yed interests in Iran , the bankers , the oil people , the ba@@ z@@ a@@ aries .
OK , so I 'd like you to take a little away from this .
so De@@ tro@@ it has this -- open land , fertile soil , proximity to water , willing labor and a desperate demand for healthy , fresh food .
my city is a long way from succeeding .
they never gave up .
when I was little , my sister and I would have contests to see who could spell " M @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ p @@@ -@@ @ p @@@ -@@ @ i " the fastest .
now , I 've introduced this to a number of industrial @@@ -@@ @ water users , and the common response is , " Y@@ ea@@ h , but who is going to use my salt ? "
I could tell you story after story , but I haven 't forgotten Fernan@@ do .
can we stop them ?
but it also means that those jum@@ ps between species , which are so important to understand , but so rare for most viruses , for rab@@ ies , they 're actually happening by the thousands .
so , can we vacc@@ inate b@@ ats ?
it might sound like a crazy question , but the good news is that we actually already have edi@@ ble rab@@ ies vaccines that are specially designed for b@@ ats .
now we have a whole laundry list of questions .
an im@@ am was present who made it clear that their religion was wrong , and the only good path was to accept Islam and marry a Muslim man .
these women and girls are healing .
and what I 've noticed is that most people 's stories tend to circle around two key themes .
she asked me what she should do .
they 're the people who , when you try to offer them a suggestion , they reject it with , " Y@@ ea@@ h , no , that will never work , because ... "
and so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do .
it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies .
and finally , we worked with elected representatives to launch these revived P@@ HC@@ s , who shared the citizen promises with the community with a lot of fan@@ fare .
the public health system was getting back into business .
and a great way to trigger the motivation is to increase transparency to the citizen .
understanding this ancient type of biological computation is the critical first step .
but mortal guards and ordinary weapons w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't suffice , so the vi@@ sionary god devised an in@@ dom@@ itable new defender .
Me@@ dea 's promise reson@@ ated deep within his core .
none of these cre@@ ations were as famous as TA@@ LOS , who appeared on Greek coins , v@@ ase paintings , public fres@@ co@@ es , and in theat@@ rical performances .
the web , mobile devices , virtual and augmented reality were res@@ crip@@ ting our nervous systems .
but I am grap@@ pling with an ethical dilemma .
that seems to make more sense .
and we 'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
and these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
ours is on the demand side .
but what we 're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature , so we can extend the nature from the park into the city .
that looks very fit into this painting .
it 's a museum created by George Luc@@ as , the creator of the " Star Wars " movies .
it 's nature .
they are monitored by private security firms in order to ensure that they don 't talk to journalists .
delete .
( music ) We need to watch for it .
that is actually the device .
because without chemistry , what is an information super@@ highway that we love , would just be a really expensive , sh@@ in@@ y paper@@ weight .
well it turns out it can do a lot more than just that .
but once true 5@@ G is here , it 's going to be a lot more than how many movies we can put on our device .
on a random visit to T@@ es@@ la on some afternoon , I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
and we said , " What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? "
( la@@ ughter ) He actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
and what would it do to our economy ?
and time to land .
to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that .
the way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es and extra chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , so we go from 46 to 47 or 48 .
and they depend too much upon history , upon philosophy , upon religion , upon culture , upon politics .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
it 's here , right now , under our feet .
there 's also evidence that the fun@@ gi are good at infl@@ ating the price of nutrients .
so rather than pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ sizing , tap into the network , steal the carbon and give nothing in return .
so our group helped pioneer a method , a technology , whereby we could tag nutrients with nan@@ op@@ articles , fluo@@ res@@ cing nan@@ op@@ articles called quantum do@@ ts .
this is important , because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources .
and we have been trying to scream to the world that we need to protect our territory , our nature .
you know , back in the late ' 8@@ 0s , this Big Mac clam@@ shell was the symbol of a garbage crisis .
the last 10 years , I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers .
me and my team thought , re@@ us@@ ables ?
the kitchen area is dirty and gri@@ my .
their behavior .
and make it from recycled office paper .
they care , they have passion , we 're just not different .
we measured it during the decade of the ' 9@@ 0s , and over 10 years we reduced 300 million pounds of waste .
now , animal rights , obviously they don 't want animals used for meat .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'm just going to stick to the pa@@ stries .
and that is , they said , " You should work with Dr. Temple Gran@@ din . "
so I end up meeting her , and she 's the very best type of cri@@ tic , in a sense that she just loves the animals , wants to protect them , but she also understands the reality of the meat business .
but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left , maintaining that f@@ us@@ el@@ age position as long as possible .
and so his entire body really is underwater .
and then I took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
so don 't hang on till the bitter end .
thank you very much .
and if the ble@@ aching do@@ es@@ n 't go away -- if the temperatures don 't go down -- reefs start to die .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
we started out , Chris@@ sy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathem@@ atically perfect models .
and the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
so it would seem sensible to guess the lowest number possible .
and so I have given over 25 years of my life to this sport , during which I have sw@@ um in all five oceans of the world , crossed the English Channel -- which is also known as the Mount E@@ ve@@ rest of swimming -- and set a world record in the freezing Antarctic ocean .
you had to learn about aer@@ onau@@ tics .
even the most common type , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ritis , is tr@@ ick@@ ier to prevent than one might think .
it 's a general mis@@ conception that ar@@ th@@ ritis is confined to old age .
this leads to the flood of enzy@@ mes and degradation seen in o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ritis , but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cy@@ tok@@ ines .
to a technique called micro@@ frac@@ ture , where surge@@ ons create small holes in the bone , allowing bone mar@@ row stem cells to leak out and form new car@@ til@@ age .
but even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition , not the cause .
a typical day in space starts with the perfect comm@@ ute .
so we take our urine , we store it , we filter it and then we drink it .
and it 's actually delicious .
but it 's the gathering around the table that 's important , I think both in space and on Earth , because that 's what cements a crew together .
so we prepared her for the process of turning herself over to CB@@ P to ask for asylum .
seeing these hor@@ rors day in and day out has changed me .
these refugees , many of whom are families , are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world , where they 're being raped , kidnapped and extor@@ ted by criminal groups .
they 've created parallel , fascist @@@ -@@ @ style legal systems in which migrants have none of the rights that form the basis of a democracy , the alleged foundation of the countries in which they 're seeking refuge .
we need to call our elected representatives and demand these changes .
gender is easy . it 's easy to design advertising based on gender , it 's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender .
this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
this was eight years ago , some people were more Republican back then .
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
and I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis .
from the Mon@@ ong@@ a@@ hel@@ a River to the F@@ lin@@ t River , in the words of W.@@ E.@@ B. D@@ u Bo@@ is , " The town , the whole valley , has turned its back upon the river .
General Mo@@ tors has been cited for dumping chemicals in the F@@ lin@@ t River for decades .
the 30 @@@ -@@ @ foot bil@@ l@@ board is made of three large color neg@@ atives with the message " Water Is Life , " spelled out in Ne@@ stle water bottles by The Si@@ ster Tour .
I asked A@@ mber , " What can I do ? "
Moses , an officer , R@@ anger , veteran , was very clear about his water rescue mission : bring relief of free , clean water to the people in F@@ lin@@ t .
it mechanically creates conden@@ sation , which produces 2,000 gall@@ ons of water per day .
and , " What has it been like living without access to clean water ? "
no matter how dark a situation may be , a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive .
it can be something that they love , something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity .
they come to school with trauma , and when I go home every day , that goes home with me .
I think back to my under@@ graduate training at the University of Georgia , where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed .
I had a student who I 'll call " David . "
and it was on the last day of school , I told David to have a great summer .
and after a while , our souls become weighed down by the heav@@ iness of it all .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
the chain that han@@ gs in my classroom is more than just a decoration .
and they have hope .
somebody to reach out and make sure that we 're OK .
every now and then , we all just need a little help holding the sta@@ pl@@ er .
thank you .
embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ingly enough , I finished up with " If not this , what ?
if not us , who ?
and if not now , when ? "
the problem was that no one knew what they were expected to do .
and most importantly , they did@@ n 't know that I needed them .
the second big difference for collaborators is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan .
I remember the day really clearly .
people lean back in their chairs , maybe impressed but not engaged .
they know that meetings are not just min@@ dless calendar f@@ ill@@ ers .
it requires us to be open and transparent and vulnerable , and that 's not what traditional leaders have been trained to do .
and if we 're going to solve the challenges that the world is facing today , we have no alternative , so we had better start getting good at it .
my own journey in bi@@ of@@ ab@@ rication started with a project called " Bi@@ oc@@ ou@@ ture . "
using a certain species of bacteria in a nutrient @@@ -@@ @ rich liquid , we fer@@ mented threads of cell@@ ul@@ ose that self @@@ -@@ @ organized into a sheet of fabric .
I dried the fabric I had grown and cut and se@@ wed it into a range of garments , shoes and bags .
in fact , there 's a growing global community of inno@@ v@@ ators re@@ thinking materials with biology .
the bacteria produce cry@@ st@@ als that form around each grain of sand , locking together all the loose particles to form a solid brick .
if , in any market , you dramatically increase supply , you should expect prices , profitability and growth to go down for existing players .
this is the same car becoming 40 percent more productive .
you can give it to the drivers -- more passengers , more income .
and one of the reasons for that is because they have decided to actively invest in African entrepreneurs , to grow them into the digital age .
some common ideas include Cap@@ tain Ho@@ ok , Harry Pot@@ ter and many well @@@ -@@ @ known characters in Chinese literature .
we are realizing that this is true .
how do you decide what is important ?
so tell me , are you making a lot of money ?
so this leads me to my third question : " what do your elected officials know about nuclear weapons , and what types of decisions are they likely to take on your behalf ? "
ask them , " How would you choose to spend US national treasure ?
after all , this is " national security . "
and the answer can 't be " Because they 're super rich and they live in your zi@@ p code . "
Oh , that 's a great school , are you guys very involved there ?
Oh , at Santa Clar@@ a , that 's awesome .
right ?
you don 't get extra points for knowing how to use Google .
I 'm looking for , like , a thum@@ bs up , thum@@ bs down .
once you 've made the ask -- " W@@ ould you consider supporting us at the 10,000 @@@ -@@ @ dollar level ?
let 's explore what these new medicines are made of , how they 're different and what 's causing this incoming ti@@ dal wave of new and exciting medicines .
in the spring , I 'd smell the head@@ y fra@@ gr@@ ance of l@@ il@@ acs .
for example , J@@ anu@@ via , which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes , is made partially with enzy@@ mes .
and by that I mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
well let 's take a look . let 's take a look at the Great De@@ pression .
and so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited , as a consequence , in their language abilities at an older age .
it 's a very simple experiment where a mon@@ key has been trained in a task that involves it manip@@ ulating a tool that 's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spo@@ on .
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries .
and 700 or so tries later the mon@@ key is performing it f@@ law@@ lessly -- never fails .
we can look down in the brain of the mon@@ key .
we can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behavi@@ ors across time .
in other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps in this most organized of cor@@ tical areas of the surface of the skin of the body .
now actually we 've looked in several different cor@@ tical areas in the mon@@ key learning this task .
this is constructed by physical change .
think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general .
you are constructed , your self is constructed from these billions of events .
the point is is that you can train the brain out of this .
a way to think about this is you can actually re @@@ -@@ @ refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it .
it means that most people who are at risk for sen@@ ility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position .
I 'm specifically interested in things like au@@ tism , and cere@@ br@@ al pal@@ sy , these great childhood catastro@@ ph@@ es .
and of course , a well @@@ -@@ @ ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key .
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here , I thought to myself that well , it 's TED .
and these TE@@ D@@ sters are -- you know , as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthro@@ pi@@ sts and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .
and then I thought no , no . I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because , after all , this is the great unve@@ iling .
Oh my ! there 's so many of you .
frankly , I 'm k@@ vel@@ ling just to be here with all the lumin@@ aries you have attending something like this , you know .
really , it 's amazing .
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful gi@@ ants of the industries but the celebrities .
I am Dominican @@@ -@@ @ American .
so , basically like DA BO@@ MB -- what Dominican @@@ -@@ @ American Ben@@ evol@@ ent Organization for Mo@@ thers and Bab@@ ies does is , basically , we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me .
I mean , I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different , whatever .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because I 'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that 's my new title .
so , I 'm very happy that you 're , you know , doing this kind of thing , making the talks available online .
for example , a friend of mine .
so , I accused my daughter to have like a secret boy@@ friend .
she said , " No M@@ om . I mean , I don 't like boys . I like girls .
I am originally from Jordan .
so you will get the extra credit I promised you .
Bou@@ v@@ ard knew that his predictions were perfect .
but we 're now up to 55 countries in the world , have had this virus emerge , in either birds , or people or both .
al@@ right , so I 've got you nervous .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than I 'd anticipated .
[ green is the new black ... ] ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I like that , too .
so I started asking a very simple question : what does it mean to you to be a good woman or a good man today ?
its job is to recre@@ ate the conditions that were present less than a bil@@ lion@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
sometimes , we 'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster .
and when these concepts under@@ lie our teaching and what we think about the world , then we have a problem , because we sty@@ mi@@ e support for everything .
the arts and sciences are av@@ at@@ ars of human creativity .
infrastructure , museums , theat@@ ers , movie houses across the country are dis@@ appearing .
so we have to really stop and think : what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts ?
I just want to tell you quickly what I 'm doing -- ( Appl@@ ause ) I want to tell you what I 've been doing a little bit since ...
and as a dan@@ cer , I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body , just as I knew how to sense colors .
it was the idea of isol@@ ating the t@@ acti@@ le component of sculpture , and then putting it into a communication system .
so if we could roll the next film here .
so it could land in a park , for example .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
( la@@ ughter ) Video : actor : clean coal -- you 've heard a lot about it .
Al G@@ ore : finally , the positive alternative m@@ esh@@ es with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
for the first time , I identified as somebody living with depression , and I felt good about it -- like I was@@ n 't a bad person for it .
bring some hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er .
can I call you every day ?
so that 's a lot of dos and don '@@ ts and may@@ bes , and it 's not by any means a definitive list .
and these at@@ oms are extremely durable .
this implies that somewhere in the universe , there 's a super@@ no@@ va explosion every second or so .
and as they started t@@ wee@@ ting , they immediately sent the stock market crashing , wi@@ ping out 140 billion dollars in equity value in a single day .
think about it this way : when you go to the gro@@ cery store to buy food to consume , it 's extensively lab@@ eled .
and that 's potentially incredibly dangerous .
this distributed approach also avo@@ ids the problem of the single point of failure .
we 've stopped actually asking really tough questions about what is the difference between value creation and value extraction , productive and un@@ productive activities .
the farmers , creating value , were called the " productive class . "
well , mechan@@ ization has for centuries , actually , taken jobs , but as long as profits were being rein@@ vested back into production , then it did@@ n 't matter : new jobs appeared .
and I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form .
as I will show to you , it is actually the main@@ stay of modern life .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre @@@ -@@ @ packaged , which I 'm told is called a Won@@ der@@ bread .
now you may prefer this lo@@ af of bread .
and this is where I have to query all of you .
let 's go back to small @@@ -@@ @ scale , to farmers ' markets , small bak@@ eries and all that . " wonderful .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
and let me just do one simple conceptual thing : if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale .
we 've moved towards large @@@ -@@ @ scale and very high control .
we need more science and not less . and we need good science .
and above all , to me , food is about respect .
never before , as I said , has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few .
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
eat it , and feel privileged .
that people on the fr@@ ing@@ es can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
that here@@ tics look at the status quo and say , " This will not stand . I can 't abide this status quo .
and I did@@ n 't know what I was doing -- like I said , mid @@@ -@@ @ 20@@ s -- and I 'm the Internet generation , so we started a website .
and we met , literally , a couple of months ago .
it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa .
of course , some people will still need to seek asylum at the border .
picking fruit , cleaning cra@@ bs , landscap@@ ing in a 100 @@@ -@@ @ degree heat .
how much would a low @@@ -@@ @ wage job help a Hondur@@ an , like Juan or Cin@@ tia ?
the members of the resistance have positioned a crane over the train tracks that can pl@@ uck the arti@@ fact once it 's exposed .
fortunately , we now live in a time when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem .
in addition , academic research has shown that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention .
eventually we began asking what they wished they could do .
my grand@@ kids just got arrested last weekend .
but today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
the final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you did@@ n 't think of India as a market , you did@@ n 't really b@@ other about a single market , because it did@@ n 't really matter .
the other thing that you can do is you can do this -- electro@@ ence@@ ph@@ alo@@ graphy -- you can put these electro@@ des on your head , OK ?
it 's actually connected to a suite of automated hardware and software that read in real time and feed back to a design team the growth conditions of the micro@@ be .
we have to start to think about how do we connect to water .
you know the expression , " Beg@@ ging only gets you so far . "
now , weekend in Paris , weekend in Rome -- these are different things .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don 't know our preferences that well .
in her A@@ unti@@ e An @@@ -@@ @ Me@@ i 's home , J@@ ing @@@ -@@ @ Me@@ i reluc@@ tan@@ tly takes her seat at the eastern corner of the ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong table .
they stimulated her g@@ ums with a to@@ oth@@ pick , to see if that was doing it .
anyway , these women sat in front of an X @@@ -@@ @ ray device .
and Masters and Johnson looked to see if the sem@@ en was being suc@@ ked up .
why don 't you have the farmers do that ?
( la@@ ughter ) Sh@@ y but ambitious pig farmers , however , can purchase a -- this is true -- a so@@ w vibr@@ ator , that han@@ gs on the sperm fee@@ der tube to vibr@@ ate .
this did not stop Masters and Johnson .
so I was 18 ; I was very excited .
maybe I will never be able to do it , but I have plans for my children .
the replacement smokers for addic@@ ted adult smokers who died or quit .
my women friends are my source of renewable energy .
so let 's use all our power .

you are the women who will build the world as it should be .
you 're going to write the next chapter in history .
it was built by the timber of Her Majesty 's Ship Res@@ olu@@ te and given by Queen Victoria .
why was men@@ str@@ uation so different ?
why can 't we talk about periods ?
and it 's not about the blood , as Fre@@ ud would have you say , because if it were , there would be an ear , nose and throat surgeon up here right now , talking about the tabo@@ os of nose ble@@ eds , right ?
( audience gas@@ ps ) Right .
you could have a condition called end@@ ome@@ tri@@ osis , where the lining of the uter@@ us is growing in the pel@@ vic cav@@ ity , causing inflammation and scar tissue and adhe@@ sions .
and I 'm not going to stand for it .
that means it 's moving during the entire respiratory process , so that thin membrane , the blood @@@ -@@ @ gas barrier , CA@@ N@@ NOT be too thin or it will break .
and then we over@@ laid that with a map of places where journalists were being murdered .
they give charity . they solve disputes .
well , it turns out , quite a lot .
and within that one , to continually narrow the focus , learning more and more about less and less ; this , despite the evidence all around us of the inter@@ connec@@ tedness of things .
as one moves up the lad@@ der , values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion .
social activists , business leaders , lawyers , politicians , professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good .
it under@@ cuts self @@@ -@@ @ righteousness , radically al@@ ters the tone and character of controversy , and enrich@@ es dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground .
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense , and the working conditions were horri@@ ble .
it was@@ n 't too bad , but they 're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .
here 's something that 's far more labor @@@ -@@ @ intensive , which is the making of shoes .
that 's cu@@ bed metal . this is ar@@ mat@@ ures , electrical ar@@ mat@@ ures , where they 're getting the copper and the high @@@ -@@ @ end steel from electrical motors out , and recycling them .
and to teach them , to me , would be a fantastic wish , and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into .
I mean this went through thick and thin , through war and peace , through boom times and rec@@ essions .

look around the room : Chairs , wood , everything around us has to change or we 're not going to l@@ ick this problem .
now , every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network .
there are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone .
so on one side of the boundary , everything where there was a market exchange was counted .
how many of you have done a bit of cleaning , a bit of vacu@@ um@@ ing , a bit of sweeping , a bit of ti@@ dying up the kitchen ?
yes .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " Rel@@ ying on per capita GDP , relying on these growth figures , " they said , " do@@ es@@ n 't appear to be the best way to proceed to make public policy . "
you see , to measure GDP , you have to assume that some kind of production or service delivery or consumption occurs inside a nation @@@ -@@ @ state , and you know where that is .
but once their population exceeds about 23@@ ,000 , it changes course .
I make sculp@@ tures like " FO@@ RE@@ V@@ ER " as a way of giving physical , tangible forms to language and time .

the engineers had a really good idea .
ok@@ ay , there it goes .
and that was great .
can I get you all to stand up ?
it 's easy to feel totally overwhel@@ med .
and so a lot of fol@@ ks who are seeing the urgency of the situation are like , " We 've got to motivate you .
and we become cheer@@ leaders for solutions .
so imagine that you go see a therap@@ ist , and you 've got a double bind .
what 's it going to take ? "
here 's some simple things you can do .
so here 's the thing , all of this work exists , we have the tools to create these conditions that can allow us to show up as our brilliant selves .
what matters here is@@ n 't technical capital , it 's social capital .
these tools don 't get socially interesting until they get technologically b@@ oring .
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to .
and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
if you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by am@@ ate@@ urs .
through the cap@@ ill@@ aries , they reach larger blood vessels and exit the bone .
thirteen point eight billion years ago , the universe as we know it began with a big ban@@ g , and everything that we know and are and are made of was created .
these symbols connected like @@@ -@@ @ minded people , and they are all extraordinary .
we declared small@@ po@@ x eradicated in 1980 .
this is confl@@ u@@ ent small@@ po@@ x , in which there is@@ n 't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by le@@ sions .
you 've got these long instruments , and you 're working off your c@@ enter@@ line .
and we can take special cameras , and we can look at it .
so if we break it down , go get a poster board .
for a lot of us in that hood , there was only one person you could already turn to for food , shelter , warmth , love , discipline : our mothers .
" come on Adam , don 't be so w@@ ish@@ y @@@ -@@ @ wash@@ y . take a b@@ ite . " " I did . "
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT .
so I want to end by saying : many of life 's pu@@ zzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
so your G@@ mail account , your Twitter account , your In@@ st@@ agra@@ m account , your i@@ Cl@@ oud , your Apple ID , your Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , your T@@ ik@@ T@@ ok -- I had to figure out what a T@@ ik@@ T@@ ok was .
you can do that quite fast .
so this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy .
if the Security Council do@@ es@@ n 't commit to security over the course of a decade , you don 't get the reas@@ surance which produces private investment .
one is improvements in basic services -- especially health , which is a disaster during conflict .
there is@@ n 't any construction going on . and so the sector shri@@ vels away .

meanwhile , there are other things that we can do today to support our hormones and their effects on the brain that do not require medications but do require taking a good look at our lifestyle .
women on this diet have a much lower risk of cognitive decline , of depression , of heart disease , of stroke and of cancer , and they also have fewer hot fl@@ ashes .
some phy@@ to@@ e@@ stro@@ gens have been linked to a possible risk of cancer , but not the ones in this diet , which are safe .
nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
this is America . this is liberty .
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon .
in turbul@@ ent times , is@@ n 't it cheaper , and s@@ mar@@ ter , to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later ?
but ide@@ alism allied with prag@@ m@@ atism , with rolling up your sle@@ eves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . it 's very real . it 's very strong .
you know , there 's lots out there .

the Asian and African V@@ ulture Crisis has led to an epidemic of rab@@ ies in India , where infections kill roughly 20,000 people each year .
they wanted a letter on official government let@@ ter@@ head .
the government can 't pay huge salary bonuses , so we ended up making our own awards .

she 'd led the team developing the pioneering in @@@ -@@ @ flight software , so she knew this mission had no room for error .

I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
I 'm happy , actually , today , to present her .
so I think micro@@ reactors is going to be important for the future .
who decides what reality is ?
that 's another work we are doing in our lab : trying to access this inner voice in dreams .
and you can even see this inner voice as the missing link between thought and actions .
( la@@ ughter ) And while the bab@@ ay@@ lan was a female role , there were also , in fact , male practitioners in the spiritual realm .
in all , he appeared more a woman than a man . "
well , any other ju@@ ic@@ y details in the colonial archives ?
and these vary tremend@@ ously from region to region .
and if they insert in the middle of the gene , they disrupt its function .
this organism is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous on the planet , and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there .
so here I am with the couple , the three of us shrinking at the foot of Cal@@ vary about to be up , you know .
and more and more , less and less awareness of the pain of the other .
and I title things because I think people speak in organic po@@ ems , and this is called " A Mir@@ ror to Her M@@ outh . "
they have a lot of respect , as I do , for Dr. Martin King .
and they had to se@@ w me up and stra@@ igh@@ ten my nose out .
and bone mar@@ row is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients , most of whom have advanced mal@@ ign@@ ancies like le@@ uk@@ emia and lym@@ ph@@ oma and some other diseases .
and just in case you 're won@@ dering what your answers are to those two questions , I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it .
Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I 've ever seen , and over the last one year , Musa 's business has grown .
so next time class met , I apolog@@ ized , and I made an announcement .
now what happened in our history ?
so we have , in skin pig@@ mentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
they said , " Let 's march . "
what is a sno@@ b ?
so I 'll just add a couple more . bl@@ ink . bl@@ ink .
we 've got to go back to square one and start again . "
so this person showed this to Dar@@ win and said , " This proves that evolution does not come about in a natural way .
Mil@@ k@@ weed is toxic .
let 's just pick one -- for example , the one in the green shirt .
and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules , the ways that rules can keep people in the dark , look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night .
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Den@@ g X@@ ia@@ oping could copy , when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model .
and we can scale this model .
the final thing we need are choices for leaders .
allow many people to come in .
others will hold back . but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country . "
so there are many other details like this .
my specialty is looking at populations and health systems , what happens when diseases move on the large level .
that 's why it 's novel .
some cor@@ on@@ a@@ viruses , like CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 , also transmit person to person .
part of that is about climate change and the way a warming climate makes the world more hosp@@ itable to viruses and bacteria .
we can get better at qu@@ aran@@ tines and travel restrictions , and we should , but they 're not our only option , and they 're not our best option for dealing with these situations .
China 's taken a lot of criticism for its response to CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 .
if a hospital -- or a country -- runs out of face masks or personal protective equipment , there 's no big warehouse full of boxes that we can go to to get more .
they would have shared honest information with citizens so that we did@@ n 't see these crazy rum@@ ors spreading on social media in China .
my mother was like the woman in Tom and Jer@@ ry .
and I looked at it beneath the micro@@ scope . and some of it was flat .
so I decided to sl@@ ice these up with the tool that I make by -- I shar@@ pen the end of a needle into a blade .
I remember one time I was doing it , and the window was open .
good morning everybody .
it 's got bum@@ ps on the back of its wing covers .
they 're really only using the blue@@ prints or the recipes from the organisms .
but then right after that , they em@@ it a protein that actually ga@@ thers and aggregates those nan@@ op@@ articles so that they fall out of solution .
because when the t@@ acks are out of the box , it 's pretty easy is@@ n 't it ?
a few times a year they tell their engineers , " Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want , as long as it 's not part of your regular job .
radical amounts of autonomy .
and I 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
and especially , it 's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years , because I have my oldest son now working for Google , after Google acquired this software .
so , how could we make better sense about this ?
as a street perform@@ er , I have learned that everybody wants to connect .
and that usually , if you 're a bit extraordinary , if you 're not exactly of human appearance , then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .
it 's happening .
I 've been fasc@@ inated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now , ever since I stum@@ bled across a fairly obsc@@ ure academic article by a guy named Jack Har@@ lan .
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ...
because , quite literally , if agriculture do@@ es@@ n 't adapt to climate change , neither will we .
in An@@ u@@ rad@@ ha@@ pur@@ a , however , trees were sacred .
the technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
I grew up in a family where my father managed all of the money .
we would sit at the kitchen table , and he 'd show me all the bank books .
and how many of us know someone that has an elderly parent or a relative that can no longer take care of themselves , and they 're left to rely on others , sometimes handing over their homes , their money and other assets .
using two of these , we can tri@@ ang@@ ulate your gaz@@ e direction to get a focus estimate .
our participants could see more clearly , they could focus more quickly and they thought it was an easier and better focusing experience than their current correction .
now , I did@@ n 't really understand that until I met this guy who was then an 80 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old , slightly sha@@ mb@@ olic man who lived on tom@@ ato sou@@ p and thought ironing was very over@@ rated .
nothing like the resources of a CER@@ N or a DA@@ RPA or an IBM or a Du@@ pon@@ t .
and the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
so let me explain that .
the truth is that future generations will look back at this precise moment with a@@ we as we stand at the crossroads between a regener@@ ative future and one where we have thrown it all away .
genuine success is possible in this transition , and genuine failure is possible , too , which makes this the most exciting time to be alive .
right now , all of these things are possible .
but it was around this time that I began to realize mental health was much a bigger problem than just for me personally .
a par@@ ach@@ ute jump from the very edge of space .
we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do them without technology .
thank you very much for your time .
the outer sol@@ es of most shoes are made of rubber that 's gone through a process called vul@@ can@@ ization .
the dispersion of factories fuels another problem as well : labor abuse .
so no matter what your style , we can all take steps towards a sustainable future .
over the next five years , we will train an additional 1,000 health workers to use Sen@@ tin@@ el detection tools and empower them to train their colleagues .
at least I have the privilege to see family today , and then I 'm sure tomorrow I 'm heading back in the tren@@ ches .
so how are we going to do it ?
well , we 're creating a compound training library and with collaborators applying these molecules to SA@@ RS @@@ -@@ @ Co@@ V @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ infected cells to see which of them exhibit effective activity .
95 percent of the gl@@ aci@@ ers in the world are ret@@ re@@ ating or shrinking .
actually , there 's still a camera out there right now .
that 's the cru@@ x , and some@@ day I hope to embl@@ az@@ on that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places .
we 're now at the Columbia Gl@@ ac@@ ier in Alas@@ ka .
a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these val@@ leys as it 's ret@@ re@@ ated and defl@@ ated , gone back up valley .
the temperature difference on a Moon base could be anything up to 200 degrees .
to make matters worse , 16@@ 92 brought one of the col@@ dest w@@ inters on record .
let 's start by trying 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to see what happens .
Mol@@ dev@@ ort could escape those numbers in just three moves .
J@@ a : I was really young then .
and I have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice .
and the message was very clear : climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
and I remember standing under@@ ne@@ ath the hot shower and trying to de@@ frost my fingers .
narr@@ ator ( Video ) : we 're just sailing out of harb@@ or now , and it 's at this stage when one can have a bit of a w@@ ob@@ ble mentally .
you did it ! you did it man !
we 've come a long way . we 're doing good .
and I found myself won@@ dering : how could vast numbers of people have the opportunity to really connect with people that have very different views ?
and then I met Jo@@ an .
but if we don 't know that these kinds of strategies exist or how they work , we can 't know what kind of impacts we may be having , even in the deep sea .
I think it 's always been wrong , because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative , and it 's probably been largely interactive .
the first is : imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying , " I 've got a fantastic idea .
those were the two places .
they want to be part of that flow of information .
if this is so critical , do we not need it funded , organized , supported in much more structured ways ?
it won 't be so clear @@@ -@@ @ cut ; it won 't be Microsoft versus Linux -- there 'll be all sorts of things in between .
did@@ n 't go into the Internet , kept his money , decided to go into computer games .
he runs a company called Shan@@ da , which is the largest computer games company in China .
it takes children a long time to break into the system .
and Ivan puts his sand@@ wich over here , on top of the pir@@ ate chest .
so the three @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old does two things differently .
RS : should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua 's sand@@ wich ?
grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder , which is sugar .
and her friend drinks the coffee , and is fine .
some people think she should deserve more blame , and other people less .
this is@@ n 't just a nice way to get your to @@@ -@@ @ do list done .
Red -- immediately life @@@ -@@ @ threatening .
that first feeling is@@ n 't the problem .
recently , Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work .
so just like with a bike , we don 't talk about it .
so for the first time , I got invited to speak at the National Parliament .
and what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert . it has no vegetation .
( appl@@ ause ) Yes , maybe just to round off .
so I said , " What sort of things ? "
but she was blind .
last year , I was coming back from a trip , and I was singled out by the T@@ SA agent .
the lead T@@ SA agent proceeds to ask - no , acc@@ use - me of bringing a weapon into the airport .
and then he started to get very nervous .
doing so does not mean that we necessarily dis@@ lodge education , but it means that if racism and white supremacy are a rock fortress , we assemble greater arsenal weapons to break the dam@@ n thing down .
in order to wage this big campaign against racial violence , the NA@@ ACP organized mass demonstrations in the streets .
it was this massive , extraordinary , in @@@ -@@ @ your @@@ -@@ @ face campaign that forced America to confront ly@@ n@@ ching and mob violence against African Americans .
but it really did@@ n 't begin there .
I 'm pleased to say that , thanks to massive government funding , about three years ago we finally fig@@ ured out how be@@ es fly .
and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project .
( la@@ ughter ) They 'll fund anything these days .
why are they engaging with cyber@@ space ?
so what happened is that a 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old man , a Chinese man , died in prison custody .
( la@@ ughter ) But I think the biggest conceptual pit@@ fall that cyber@@ top@@ ians made is when it comes to digital n@@ atives , people who have grown up online .
I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
so I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
so , the history of East Asia in fact , people don 't think about nations and borders .
then there is Turkmenistan , which most people think of as a frozen basket case .
so Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
but I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent .
important ? not so very .
but this was@@ n 't always the way .
now this gent@@ l@@ eman , Is@@ amb@@ ard Kingdom Brun@@ el , designed many great things in his career in the 19th century , including the C@@ lif@@ ton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Tha@@ mes tunnel at Ro@@ ther@@ hi@@ the .
because they brought the cost down from $ 200 a pair , down to just $ 4 a pair .
they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
so why design thinking ?
but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today ?
so I 'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest High Street products .
that is the Tor@@ ah and everything else is only commentary . "
and I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate comp@@ assi@@ onate thinking .
you also have to do it .
the same applies to educators .
but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a school@@ girl .
so what if I told you that you did@@ n 't really need a million @@@ -@@ @ dollar robot to provide remote surgery ?
doctor 2 : if you see here , that 's the upper part , the most outer part of your tumor .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'm not that far .
I 'm sure most of you know from school physics that it 's basically splitting a white light into colors .
in the core , we have ther@@ mon@@ uclear reactions going on , creating chemical elements .
but you know , everything is relative .
and we need nine centi@@ meters per second to detect an Earth @@@ -@@ @ like planet .
if , one day , and I think it will be within 15 years from now , or 20 years .
and then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that sur@@ round my house , and attacked me during my morning walks .
I think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sab@@ b@@ atic@@ al .
Scot@@ ch tape came out of this program , as well as Art F@@ ry developed stic@@ ky notes from during his personal time for 3@@ M .
this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few str@@ and of companies , and not for everybody else .
and mostly also because I realized out of a R@@ em Ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as presentation to the city of Porto , where he talked about a con@@ gl@@ om@@ eration of various layers of meaning .
and I understood that the building itself was a logo .
this is after a week .
( la@@ ughter ) I think you see , you see them sweeping . you see them sweeping right here .
H@@ ank W@@ ill@@ is Thomas : I 'm De@@ b 's son .
but I thought about also that black photographers were missing from the history books of photography , and I was looking for ways to tell a story .
( la@@ ughter ) D@@ id you see her po@@ ke me ?
I grew up in a house full of photographs .
how are we going to build all of this ?
however , the approach I built here is actually high @@@ -@@ @ resolution , low @@@ -@@ @ cost , and probably most importantly , very scal@@ able .
you can imagine a new kind of sculp@@ ting tool , where I 'm kind of warming something up , making it m@@ alle@@ able , and then letting it cool down and sol@@ idi@@ fying in a certain state .
this is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . they need each other .
and this changes everything .
now it 's anonymous .
by the way , these can be men as well .
it will be des@@ pa@@ iring hostility .
and we have to du@@ ke it out every day , so we resort to politics .
it had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something .
she asked where I had learned to speak English so well , and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language .
show of hands : how many people think it 's the gray one ?
let me show you what I mean .
there 's no inherent meaning in information .
now I want you to look at that do@@ t between the green and the red .
so , illu@@ sions are often used , especially in art , in the words of a more contemporary artist , " to demonstrate the fragility of our senses . "
well , one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound , and we enable people to hear their visual world .
and this is a six @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child com@@ posing a piece of music for a 32 @@@ -@@ @ piece orchestra .
so , if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain , I 'd like to do this one .
I 'm going to put the middle nine under a pur@@ pl@@ ish light .
here 's another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
there were definitely hang @@@ -@@ @ out spots .
take this place for example .
and I 'd like to tell you the story in three acts , and if I have time still , an ep@@ il@@ o@@ gue .
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the mead@@ ow and the forest and the cli@@ ffs make habitats for plants and animals .
and it 's a remarkable map . it 's in the National Archives here in Ke@@ w .
so , the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan , places that are close to water , places that are near the harb@@ or to fish , places protected from the winter winds .
and we might think of these as abandoned .
and that you can put these on a grid that 's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way .
they are the connections that actually make nature resilient .
the next day , the farmer 's son ri@@ des one of the wild horses , is thrown off and breaks his leg .
it tastes great within the borders of that country , but absolute sh@@ ite if you take it anywhere else .
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders .
" can the brain build such a perception ? "
so it 's very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circu@@ itry .
I started off in Uganda .
( la@@ ughter ) Ac@@ tually , do you know that old philosophical thing , " If a tree falls in a forest , and nobody hears it , did it happen ? "
and when they got out of the room , he said to her mother , " Just stand and watch her . "
our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip @@@ -@@ @ mine the earth for a particular commodity .
if all human beings disappeared from the Earth , within 50 years , all forms of life would flourish . "
( jack@@ ham@@ mer ) for more than a few seconds , you 'd feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you 'd be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
in these communities , the fishermen developed a kind of social contract that told each one of them to hold back a bit to prevent over@@ fishing .
so today , we pump millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the air , we dump plastics , fertilizers and industrial waste into the rivers and oceans , and we cut down forests that absorb CO2 .
it shows leverage , tren@@ ded out from 1919 to 2009 .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households .
so we see with em@@ pa@@ thy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession .
then we look at the High Line in New York City , an excellent use of re@@ imag@@ ining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand @@@ -@@ @ new park in New York City .
you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body .
Ric@@ car@@ do M@@ ut@@ i , please .
it 's not true . when he was a young man of about 30 , he wrote what he called " The Ten Comm@@ and@@ ments for Conduc@@ tors . "
so it 's not about my story . it 's not about your story .
now I can tell you , even the Berlin Phil@@ harmon@@ ic do@@ es@@ n 't know when to play .
that is another story .
it 's suffering , like , enjoying himself in a Jewish way , as they say .
and for the last video , I think this is simply the best title .
it was my daughter who reminded me of how much I used to feel .
so I cur@@ led up next to her and I dri@@ zz@@ led sand on her other arm and then her legs .
we know , and I know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
nothing new was learned .
consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons .
H@@ w@@ ami has fantastic takes on what it means to be an African and an African life .
we rolled up our tro@@ users , and waited for mosqu@@ it@@ oes that were coming to b@@ ite us so we could collect them to check if they were carrying malaria .
but I do this mostly to improve people 's lives and well @@@ -@@ @ being .
it turns out we actually know very little .
one : that society equ@@ ates living in a permanent structure , even a sh@@ ack , with having value as a person .
at first , living in the van was great .
either they 're the same , or this one 's bigger than this one , or this one 's bigger than that one .
and that 's an informal way of presenting it -- that 's why there 's a difference .
it 's another way of getting the in@@ tuition .
and in fact , if this is the prevalence of the disease , about 100 will have the disease and the rest won 't .
and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that 's unlikely , because of the presumption of innocence .
well , the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with .
so rotate along half@@ way along the edge , and they all match up .
so I think it 's a great example of things un@@ seen , which the power of mathematical language allows you to create .
if you look at all the world religions , all the main world religions , you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion .
therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
you have to act comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately .
we know it all .
and he said , " That 's ridic@@ ulous . you can 't make a needle by rub@@ bing a lump of iron with a cloth . "
so he says , " Well , I 'll put my tongue on the dog 's flesh .
and then , suddenly , there 's a p@@ ff@@ t , a noise like that .

it 's not just medicine .
I 'm going to take off some of that weight , and I 'm going to buy a Hum@@ mer that 's 11 miles per gall@@ on . "
this is a typical insul@@ in injection .

and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting , which is , the yellow seems to disappear , get through the blue , and then get through the red .

that 's the good news .
so here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
also , these are intermit@@ tent sources .
I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
local power , central power , now , people power .
now , here is King C@@ nut , king a thousand years ago .
anyone thinking , " I could do that service better , I could deliver it cheaper , " it 's all available there .

the principal did@@ n 't want to stand up to the parent because he did@@ n 't want to get dra@@ gged into some legal proceedings .

now , I had this brain scan done several years ago , and I used to jo@@ ke around about having a gig@@ antic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cor@@ te@@ x .
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
but you know what ? I was getting work experience .
well , that 's the end of my talk .
you know , the slaughter plants I worked with in the ' 8@@ 0s ; they were absolutely aw@@ ful .
you directly observe a few simple things .

the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin par@@ sing the world is dynamic information .
that 's my mother . I love her to bits .
the rest of my family are b@@ oring academics , busy collecting I@@ vy League dec@@ als for our classic Ambassador car .
I work with children all over the world , and that 's an entirely different talk , but I want to leave you with one story that really , really inspired me .
you have that much uncertainty .
do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? it 's completely static .
it 's a static image . how many people see this illusion ? it 's completely static .
but what this also did was it started mar@@ rying the two most important things in Indian c@@ ric@@ ket , which is c@@ ric@@ ket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
they started going to the c@@ ric@@ ket to watch Sha@@ h Ru@@ kh Khan .
and so it started resem@@ bling the Indian movies more and more .
and so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
so with that , I thank you .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , " What am I doing out here ?
so , what can we synthe@@ size out of all this ?
well , I think number one is curi@@ osity .
but they are not applicable in all situations .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us ch@@ efs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
it do@@ es@@ n 't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
" that 's right , " he said . " we 're so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . "
it 's the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
you st@@ are out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are floo@@ ded can@@ als and this thick , rich marsh@@ land .
and then he 's off , launching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aquatic plants .
Oh , and by the way , those flam@@ ing@@ os , they shou@@ ld@@ n 't even be there in the first place .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
now , I don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
that 's been the motivation , it 's been the justification : it 's been the business plan of American agriculture .
and if I 'm going to be really honest , they 're a better ch@@ ef than I 'll ever be .
OK . we 've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .

bacterial spo@@ res are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive , but in suspended animation for as long as 250 million years .
yet , it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
I 'd like to buy some concentrated , compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas , see , about wanting to suspend people .
so that 's kind of a tough day , but I said , " There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this . "
and it 's the whole field that we 've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel .
I was like , " Ac@@ tually it was your idea . you said it in a For@@ tune Magazine article .

J@@ a : the ram@@ ps are made of simple material -- the kind of pl@@ y@@ wood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point .
