we have about , you know , 38@@ ,000 places that are not worth caring about in the United States today .
unless the people that live here are Mun@@ ch@@ kins , nobody 's going to be using that .
the same is true if we look at a Chinese individual versus an African , the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ thal will match the Chinese individual more often .
so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als , but far back and then have a long independent history .
when I travel with my work across Europe and the United States , one question always comes up : where is the Palestinian G@@ and@@ hi ?
so I 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MI@@ T are working on to achieve this self @@@ -@@ @ assembling future .
can we really scale this up ? can we really emb@@ ed robo@@ tics into every part ?
it basically em@@ beds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
so what this means is that the user can start plug@@ ging in what they want the bric@@ ks to do .
and it was really her strength , I believe , that became the kind of m@@ ud@@ ra and im@@ pri@@ mat@@ ur that has been a guiding light in my life .
now let 's advance to 10,000 years before the present .
and politically , it was aw@@ ful .
Thomas E@@ dis@@ on would have been very , very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today .
and so we have to understand that if we 're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life , we need to power it somehow .
and they had a look at what was in the sou@@ p , and they found am@@ ino acids , but nothing came out , there was no cell .
many of our faith @@@ -@@ @ based organizations have tremendous amounts of wealth that can be utilized for social change .
and unfortunately , for mort@@ als like you and me , we probably can 't understand it very well .
but what about the real cyber@@ criminals ?
they are recruiting h@@ ackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age activities -- are mobilizing them on behalf of the state .
they 're just relent@@ less and ob@@ ses@@ sive about what they do .
we want to work with you . "
I teach courses in physical computing and we@@ arable electronics .
everybody 's got one -- all of you .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's fairly self @@@ -@@ @ explanatory .
what kind of an experience do they have ?
and so the In@@ flat@@ able Heart is an external organ that can be used by the we@@ arer to express themselves .
so they can express everything from admiration and l@@ ust to anxiety and ang@@ st .
these are initial mus@@ ings for this project .
and just as with the wall , how I wanted to be more wall @@@ -@@ @ like , with this project , I 'd actually like to take more a of gl@@ ac@@ ial pace .
sorry boys , but it 's just a tiny little thing that makes you different .
how many are there in the human gen@@ ome ? three billion .
is that a big number ?
that was all done on a machine like this .
it costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it .
and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra 5 , 10 , 20 years , just because of this one thing .
do you think that 's not going to happen ?
anybody ? nobody .
they all h@@ ated each other , and all moved to different parts of the planet .
they call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
we love to watch TV .
W@@ inst@@ on Chur@@ ch@@ ill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fat@@ eful year of 1938 .
( la@@ ughter ) Now again , we kind of ca@@ ved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
in fact , it 's as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
[ the ] Tas@@ man@@ ian devil is found only on the island of Tas@@ man@@ ia , which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia .
for these survivors , life can be compared to another health emergency .
however , many continue to bear intermit@@ tent pain .
people are living far longer now , and for the first time in human history , it 's common for four generations to be living side by side .
she was re@@ su@@ sc@@ itated , stabilized , whis@@ ked over to a CAT scan suite right next to the emergency room , because they were concerned about blood clo@@ ts in the lung .
and Con@@ an Do@@ y@@ le , writing about Bell , described the following exchange between Bell and his students .
she says , " I did . "
and so when Au@@ en@@ bru@@ gg@@ er became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
and that is how ste@@ th@@ os@@ cope and aus@@ cul@@ tation was born .
I 've often wondered , what would Fil@@ des have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era , in the year 2011 ?
when are they going to come by and explain things to me ?
it had a beautiful facility , giant atri@@ um , val@@ et parking , a piano that played itself , a con@@ ci@@ erge that took you around from here to there .
but to her , it mat@@ tered deeply .
I say that because these are difficult patients .
and so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and I tried not to interrupt them .
I took this to my colleagues at Stan@@ ford in anthro@@ pology and told them the same story .
we marry , for example , with great p@@ om@@ p and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of sol@@ itude and misery and lon@@ eliness to one of eternal bl@@ iss .
and out of that sense of failure , I remember , I would always examine the patient .
and employers who kept complain@@ ing that the kids coming out of school we@@ ren 't actually ready for real work , did@@ n 't have the right attitudes and experience .
it 's not perfect yet , but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands , possibly millions , of teenagers who are really bo@@ red by schooling .
a democracy could be upheld peacefully .
the kids got the pills , and their performance improved .
something happened in the 7@@ 0s that is sometimes referred to as " the software crisis , " where suddenly , computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for , from a design perspective .
what mat@@ tered was that it was there at all .
they would look and say , " Oh , the progress bar is half done .
the rope became a big thing when women 's clothes became more fitted and the pan@@ t@@ alo@@ on came into being .
those ro@@ pes created a space where we were able to contribute to something that was far greater than the neighborhood .
the button and the butt@@ on@@ hole is such a great invention .
she would hit herself and give herself bloody nos@@ es and she had hygiene problems -- she had big hygiene problems .
when I was 10 years old , I treated another human being like some worth@@ less other ...
the first step is starting to recognize the hate inside ourselves .
and then second : if we want to challenge the hate in our societies , we need to promote policies and institutions and practices that connect us as communities .
but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
in urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
they find themselves sort of sand@@ w@@ ich@@ ed between the urban areas and the rural areas .
most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside , but they don 't have the sense of belonging .
so any accusations of corruption or back@@ door dealings between authorities or business would ar@@ ouse a social out@@ cry or even unrest .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
who on Earth would write something as con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted and complex and in@@ ane ?
so you 'd think , with all this extra space , we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff .
so I 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
my office fol@@ ds away , easily hidden .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) But -- ( Appl@@ ause ) Here we are , a few years later .
and , actually , I think we can dust off Stephen Ma@@ ther 's play@@ book .
and so I and many others were finally able to go to high school , a regular high school , and take regular classes .
my medical exam was something completely different .
so what 's it like to be a baby ?
there was no official investigation into his death .
what I saw was the three men trying to pull him down below the seats .
now you probably know the answer to this already .
it is@@ n 't just about nice .
Kok@@ o was taught to communicate via sign language .
ask a dec@@ ep@@ tive person to tell their story , they 're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places .
bare@@ foot technology : this was 1986 -- no engineer , no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rain@@ water from the roof@@ s .
there 's a little w@@ imp@@ y box on top there .
I 've got this experience , I 'm in the world .
that 's because you 're making a prediction .
so you 're not going to see C @@@ -@@ @ 3@@ PO .
I know a lot of people who invented the micro@@ processor .
and these pre@@ emp@@ tive attacks might not just remain in cyber@@ space .
the cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes .
about 15 years ago , when I learned of our new @@@ -@@ @ found ability to create quantum effects that don 't exist in nature , I was excited .
( la@@ ughter ) And here you can see , on J@@ esse 's chest , when he just tried to do three different things , you can see three different patterns .
so A@@ man@@ da , when you first started using this arm , how long did it take to use it ?
so if it stopped working , I just had to take it off .
but it 's also used to assign a temperature range .
you all know the truth of what I 'm going to say .
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .
on that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies .
we collected data on problems with social gradi@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social lad@@ der .
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
and he makes this complicated thing .
so what happens during the Second World War ?
well how many clou@@ dless sk@@ ies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?
this got us very excited .
we 've completed , now , clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
I made an artist book that 's in stainless steel instead of paper .
it is a paper@@ cutting , and then after , I added color on the computer .
and after university , I wanted to do something -- probably na@@ Ã¯@@ vely -- to help .
it 's realizing we have the power to create the world ane@@ w together and to do it ourselves when our governments refuse .
or clergy and teachers engaging in civil dis@@ obedience to block water shu@@ to@@ ff trucks .
it means tr@@ usting those who know the problems best -- the people who live them -- with solutions .
or any date for that fact , it 's like , " I don 't exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . "
I would tell them , " He@@ y guys , this is where I 'm going . this is my flight .
so if I understood the chemistry of trust@@ worthiness , I might help alleviate poverty .
that 's not what we found .
and we have testosterone .
and it 's so easy to cause people 's bra@@ ins to release oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in .
Dr. Love says eight hu@@ gs a day .
if it 's helping to unite the world , I think it 's definitely the fish of the future .
we have a carbon fiber safety c@@ age that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car .
when we do have to do something truly out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ box , we use an incremental design , build , test , re@@ design cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you .
and in neuro@@ science , we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain .
but apart from that , everything else goes through contrac@@ tions of muscles .
so it 's really important to remember that sen@@ sory , memory and cognitive processes are all important , but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements .
now of course there are other moves , but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution .
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be .
so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is , for example , sen@@ sory feedback is extremely nois@@ y .
forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in d@@ arts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
now both these sources of information carry important information .
ca : well that was quite fascinating . thank you very much indeed .
and above all , it is a right , it is everyone 's right .
we call ourselves P@@ ors and Ra@@ o , and we live and work in India .
on the right side you can see my colleague So@@ ren , who 's actually in the space .
well , I 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while I 've been speaking , you have been scanned .
I want you to understand , each one of these is a hypothesis ; it is subject to revision .
already this morning there were some all@@ u@@ sions to the Africa that you hear about all the time : the Africa of HIV / AIDS , the Africa of malaria , the Africa of poverty , the Africa of conflict , and the Africa of disasters .
I 'm working on an initiative now , along with the World Bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries ' mone@@ ys -- to get that sent back .
( la@@ ughter ) But that would actually get you oriented pretty fast , right ?
this is a little trick that you 're taught to use as kids .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
so maybe it 's working in people the same way .
but we 've fig@@ ured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this .
education shapes our children . it shapes the way we teach .
somehow , we live in this world where , in 2017 , the US Constitution is held up as the supreme law of the land , right ?
we are medicine men , we are medicine women , we are sun dancers , we are pipe carriers , we are traditional language speakers .
A@@ fro@@ be@@ ats has played the strongest role so far , if you ask me , as far as emancip@@ ating the youth is concerned .
so I started shooting time @@@ -@@ @ lap@@ se photography .

I believe that journalism is a public good .
they 're under pressure to communicate their science outside of the academy .

should they share in the profit ?
the astr@@ on@@ aut is asleep .
here 's how it works .
( la@@ ughter ) they contain S@@ no@@ op D@@ og@@ g .
and the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
right now , the web is parti@@ tioned into multiple languages .
the problem with that is it 's not yet good enough and it probably won 't be for the next 15 to 20 years .
if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is even at the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
if this is what you want to do , you quickly realize you 're going to run into two big hur@@ dles , two big obstacles .
for example , this garden spi@@ der can make seven different kinds of sil@@ ks .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
you can see that the repeat units differ in length . they also differ in sequence .
here are stress @@@ -@@ @ strain curves generated by tensile testing five fi@@ bers made by the same spi@@ der .
that 's what the spi@@ der has to interact with their environment .
but you may not know that he tried to perform lo@@ bo@@ tom@@ ies in the brain , non@@ inv@@ a@@ sively , with focused ultrasound in the ' 50s .
so this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
pain is something that can make your life mis@@ erable .
and doing that in the U.S.
everyone 's listening . we 're responding .
it got a little bit more rhyth@@ mic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
what was my motivation ?
when I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water .
( la@@ ughter ) But my point is that ... and I call it the " then what ? "
and I think that 's the issue , you know ; it 's the " then what " that most clients who hire architects -- most clients are@@ n 't hiring architects for that .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'm going to make it for you !

you CA@@ N@@ NOT know when and how , but it 's worth trying .
so how do we stop this ?
thank you .
it was late fall , and we were getting ready for next spring .
ultimately , this technology is helping us to re@@ write our history .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
so we go back and we do that again , and again .
however , we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molec@@ ule for one @@@ -@@ @ time use .
" you know , I 'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey .
that 's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally .
I 'd just take a shar@@ pi@@ e , draw one panel after the other , fig@@ uring out what I wanted to say as I went .
as of 2007 , we went from being a primarily rural planet to being a primarily urban one , and that has implications for how we 're going to feed these people , how we 're going to get the food to the people in the cities .
they have a choice .

people like Mahmoud are agents of change .
that 's Na@@ j@@ m@@ ud@@ din , the one with the white coat .
I thought , " Oh my g@@ os@@ h . I 'm going to become a Cro@@ t@@ ch@@ ety old lady . "
and here 's the third factor , which is totally different .
we are now inter@@ locked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before .
for us , I think , part of the equation for our survival .
some of you might actually right now be thinking , it 's down@@ right crazy to have 10 TED Tal@@ ks summarized into just six words .
but the thing about this filter is that it always leaves the same things in .
when asked to describe their lives , what is interesting is how few people said " m@@ ess . "
you view your life like this instead of the m@@ ess that it is or it ought to be .
just imagine yourself pressing a button every time you tell the good versus evil story , and by pressing that button , you 're lowering your I@@ Q by ten points or more .
you 'll hear this in so many contexts .
most of the others either never responded back , said they did@@ n 't have the time or did@@ n 't have the equipment and cou@@ ld@@ n 't help me .
I 've also entered in her age , her gender and her height .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
and what is dialogue really about ?
I was lucky that while he may not have even known about this concept of reasonable adjustments , to him , it was just common sense .
so what should be a manager 's first response when somebody says that they 're sick and they don 't know how it 's going to impact their work ?
it 's involved with the growing of the micro@@ tu@@ b@@ ules , and it 's able to transi@@ ently couple onto them .
people in the community need to be able to get from one place to another as quickly as possible .
some water @@@ -@@ @ cooled reactors run at over 70 atmos@@ p@@ heres of pressure , and others have to run at as much as 150 atmos@@ p@@ heres of pressure .
the reactors we have today use uranium oxide as a fuel .
it 's a ceramic material similar in performance to the ceramics we use to make coffee cups or cook@@ ware or the bric@@ ks we use to line fire@@ places .
do we have enough thor@@ ium ?
this year even more people will get caught up in the illegal drug trade .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
and the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul @@@ -@@ @ like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
and they don 't really change much .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therap@@ ists , the po@@ ets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
and that 's what religions do .
that 's something we can learn from .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
there 's so much we can absorb .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
so he designed a different kind of son@@ ar ping , one that looks random .
so what do these patterns look like again ?
they teach us how to think critically .
the first metric is : is it sustainable ?
one is a closed photo@@ bi@@ ore@@ actor that you see here , and what you see on the other side is our species - we are currently using a species called S@@ cen@@ ed@@ es@@ mus di@@ morph@@ us .
now the problems with closed photo@@ bi@@ ore@@ actors are : they are quite expensive , they are automated , and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale .
there is a draw@@ back to algae , however : it 's very expensive .
and the answer is : yes .
what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world , where there 's barre@@ n desert .
if you are a farmer , you need five things to be successful : you need seeds , you need soil , you need water and you need sun , and the last thing that you need is fertilizer .

we understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch , you put them together , and you create a watch .
but inte@@ res@@ tingly , it 's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuro@@ science .

so now what do I do ?
I understand this tim@@ eless dic@@ tum as a statement about the problems , or more exactly , the con@@ fu@@ sions , of consciousness .
this fasc@@ ination led me to subm@@ erge myself in art , study neuro@@ science , and later , to become a psycho@@ therap@@ ist .
imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight .
because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women .
in South Korea and Indonesia , women own nearly half a million firms .
and that 's just to start .
and two days later , this package shows up on your door@@ step .
so let me tell you where I first bum@@ ped into this problem .
I was out in the Bay area in ' 99 , 2000 , the do@@ t com boom .
I worked for a fab@@ ulously spectacular flame @@@ -@@ @ out called Web@@ van .
and it really came down to the fact that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do it cost effectively .
and that 's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home .
so long story short , during my one year at Web@@ van , what I realized by talking to all the material @@@ -@@ @ handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking .
so we said , there 's just got to be a better way to do this .
so how did I arrive at this notion ?
take a blank sheet , of course , but then test your ideas at the limits - in@@ fin@@ ity , zero .
diet Co@@ ke walks up to the front - pick it , put it in the to@@ te , away it goes . "
so these are patients who had received surgery , high dose radiation to the head and first @@@ -@@ @ line chem@@ otherapy , and that had failed and their tum@@ ors had grown back .
we divided the patients into two groups .
he won the gold medal in Moscow in the 4,000 meter pursuit .
he received the standard treatments .
and on one side of the bun@@ k bed , I had put out all of my G.@@ I. Jo@@ e soldiers and weaponry .
so I did the only thing my fran@@ tic seven year @@@ -@@ @ old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
but normal is merely average .
my colleague , Dr. Paul F@@ ent@@ on , was living this reality .
it 's also designed for the environment that it will be used in .
it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts .
so we 're thr@@ illed .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
what 's that new state that the world is heading toward ?
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
so now we 've spe@@ eded up the time scales once again .
and I think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
and let 's reproduce them by a process of re@@ combination analogous to sex . "
so I 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
but they do the job .
and in fact , I know , I 'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
no other major assembly in our lives is constructed like this .
your car do@@ es@@ n 't come to you in pieces with an extra 10 percent just in case , to be assembled at the mercy of the elements .
in fact , truly sustainable housing should be available to everyone and affordable for all .
but something was still bu@@ gging me , something was still keeping me up at night .
wrap your head around that number .
like the time at a bar in college when a b@@ oun@@ cer physically removed me by the back of the neck and threw me out of a woman 's rest@@ room .
but for me , the possibility is what this child , who will grow to be a teen@@ ager and then a real @@@ -@@ @ life adult , will call me for the rest of our lives , was both extremely sc@@ ary and exciting .
it felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in .
( la@@ ughter ) So , option one is to ignore the assumption and allow fol@@ ks to continue to refer to me as " mom , " which is not aw@@ k@@ ward for the other party , but is typically really aw@@ k@@ ward for us .
and move on .
only men can be d@@ ads . "
and I 'll say that over time , my ability to navigate this complicated map has gotten easier .
the techn@@ ician saw a vul@@ va and sl@@ apped the words " It 's a girl " on the screen and gave us a copy and sent us on our way .
I had to choose option two .
I 'm working against limiting myself .
and as the conversation shifted to our pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian , I saw Sarah and Bec@@ ky 's interaction continue , and it went something like this .
it would have been easier for Sarah .

in a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the bur@@ ger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others ?
we 're here , we 're part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them .
our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
and I think with time , in the years to come we 'll be learning a lot about our Pic@@ asso@@ s , our Leg@@ ers and our Ce@@ z@@ ann@@ es .
we do have artists , but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet .
it 's important for two things .

Government institutions were completely dec@@ ap@@ itated , including the presidential palace .
out of this rub@@ ble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TE@@ RA -- the Tr@@ il@@ og@@ y Emergency Response Application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
so these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines .
the incredibly high price of flying food into these remote Northern aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival .

in addition to that , it harb@@ ors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth , and much of it we don 't know about .
and so 10 years ago , an international program began called the Census of Marine Life , which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans .
now one of the other things that you may think about is that , when you go to the supermarket and you buy things , they 're scanned .
the Ocean Bio@@ geographic Information System is the database for all the census data .
one of the things that we 're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
so whether you 're a y@@ ak her@@ der living in the mountains of Chile , whether you 're a stock@@ broker in New York City or whether you 're a TE@@ D@@ ster living in Edinburgh , the oceans matter .
in this tw@@ il@@ ight zone , much of the data seems to point to one conclusion .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
the eminent scientists of the Global Foot@@ print Network , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 Ear@@ ths to sustain this economy .
the Earth can support that if we choose the right path .

this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
let me give you an example .
now we talk about water wars .
because we live on a water planet .

my goal in this was to get people to notice this going @@@ -@@ @ through @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ motions holiday thing that I 'm sure we 've all felt before .
and I did that through a holiday card , of course .
( la@@ ughter ) This card is literally a four @@@ -@@ @ frame documentary about receiving the card .
( la@@ ughter ) So it 's a recur@@ sive experience .
far more awesome , in fact , than the format of wedding invitations .
so I began spending an in@@ ordinate amount of time thinking about need@@ les : like , would we find need@@ les with the right f@@ idel@@ ity ?

on Earth , we 've seen how dramatically technology can accelerate in just 100 years .
you go into the water and once you hit the water , it 's amazing .
he said , " What 's inertia ? " and his d@@ ad said , " Ah .
but for most of human history , we had to discover these things using our eyes and our ears and our minds .
it 's actually hitting a tooth .
what happens when you look at what the disco@@ ve@@ rers were thinking about when they made their discoveries , is you understand that they are not so different from us .
and when that happens , the feeling is ec@@ static and we reach for met@@ aph@@ ors of up and down to explain these feelings .
and they un@@ locked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction .
we 're not locked into cooperation the way be@@ es and ants are .
nonetheless , when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement , they can move mountains .
those things came along too recently .
we broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
we hope that we can make computing a user model you 're familiar with , and really derive insights from you , from all different directions .

( appl@@ ause ) You know why this place is amazing ?
I know your d@@ ad really was@@ n 't in Luxembourg , he was in S@@ ing S@@ ing .
for women , the best example I can give you is En@@ j@@ oli , the commercial .
and he said , " That 's convenient . "
you don 't look at him and say , " He 's an ampu@@ tee with a pros@@ thetic . "
and that 's what I 'm going to talk to you today about .
but as we all know , that process grew also on a kind of macro scale as well .
now , there 's nothing wrong with shopping m@@ alls , there 's nothing wrong with highways , and there 's nothing wrong with high @@@ -@@ @ rise buildings or sub@@ urban development .
it 's like the economic system in the world today -- it 's really not a sustainable system , and we have to find ways of addressing it .
so where are we headed from here ?
this stuff is everywhere .
but no , I 'm not . I own stocks .
you can 't -- ok@@ ay .
that is , it 's going to be a small part , because you can 't rely on it .

it may seem we@@ ir@@ d , but this comes back from Hy@@ per@@ Card .
it 's a conversation amongst rab@@ bis about this article in the New York Times , about the fact that religious workers don 't get a lot of time off .
and my own story with September 11 has really become a more intr@@ icate one , because I spent a great deal of time working on a piece of the 9 / 11 Memorial in Manhattan .
when you read stock prices , think about them in a human context .
( appl@@ ause ) Now let 's get started .
( la@@ ughter ) Un@@ til Vol@@ ta , nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use .
this is the starting point for designing a battery -- two electro@@ des , in this case metals of different composition , and an electro@@ ly@@ te , in this case salt dissolved in water .

RD : sure .
in Liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
like the concrete block , the transi@@ stor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
and keep your eyes on the big screen .
( la@@ ughter ) So ...
and so in 2006 , I founded a new political party .
and the European elections , the last European elections , we became the largest party and the most co@@ ve@@ ted youth demographic , sub @@@ -@@ @ 30 .
but applying these -- and we 've done this dozens of times , we know that this works .
shoot for the moon !
we work for autonomy , ma@@ stery and purpose .
those three factors are : speed , trust and scal@@ ability .
it was not abused once .

how do we feed the world without destroying it ?
we transformed our apartments into our laboratories , and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way .
Oh , you thought I was playing .
it 's already a big advance over many other animals who w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be able to do that .
so that 's what you see on the upper @@@ -@@ @ left , an animated head that y@@ aw@@ ns .
and that 's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that under@@ lies em@@ pa@@ thy , and that is universal in the mammals , basically .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts sp@@ itting water and intim@@ idating them -- then the choices go down .
so what we did is we put two Cap@@ u@@ chin mon@@ keys side @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ side .
this year , if you think about it , over a billion couples will have sex with one another .
people who spoke the same language made that change as a group .
in Germany , this transition started in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , and it took just 50 years for family size to stabilize in this country .
I think , as we go through this history , it 's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue .
she was incredibly optimistic about her family 's future .
and I thought it was just an amazing day .
the thought of the war@@ far@@ in was really quite frigh@@ tening .
it then comes back into a round form , and then tap@@ ers and curves off .

because of this , all three brothers and their families had to vac@@ ate their home .
to do that I 'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic .
but I just started again an hour ago . "
and so , we made this game , and she got it .
I don 't think the New World felt too new worl@@ dly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships .
so this is a game called " S@@ Ã­@@ och@@ Ã¡n le@@ at . " it 's " peace be with you . "
it 's an expression of beauty , it 's how they say they love you .
we conven@@ tionally divide space into private and public real@@ ms , and we know these legal distinctions very well because we 've become experts at protecting our private property and private space .
but one thing I can say is that it 's a combination of icon@@ o@@ cl@@ asm and ad@@ oration .
four @@@ -@@ @ fif@@ ths of the world 's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the ro@@ tted remains of pri@@ me@@ val sw@@ amp go@@ o .
but they also have rising costs to our security , economy , health and environment that are starting to erode , if not out@@ weigh their benefits .
so let 's start by making auto@@ s oil free .
last year , Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ agen announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gall@@ on .
I look at this picture and it f@@ rea@@ ks me out .
so I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
so what I you to take away from my talk , the lesson of all of this , is to just be Ste@@ vie Nic@@ ks .
we see that the world is feeling " used " at 3.3 times the normal level right now .
we see " better " is the most frequent feeling , followed by " bad . "
( la@@ ughter ) " I love how I feel today . "
and in classical music we can follow these changes very , very accurately because of the music 's powerful silent partner , the way it 's been passed on : no@@ tation .
in 200 B.@@ C. , a man named Se@@ kul@@ os wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gra@@ vest@@ one in the not@@ ational system of the Greeks .
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pin@@ point the pitch 's location .
Moz@@ art was the same way .
and by the 14@@ 00@@ s , music was being written that tried to mirror God 's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
it 's just these two notes in the middle .
now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
this is when those big forms arose -- the sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , the son@@ at@@ as , the concer@@ tos .
what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance ?
it 's the passing on part . it 's the ' why ' part of it .
the culture in which we live now is aw@@ ash with music of impro@@ vis@@ ation that 's been s@@ lic@@ ed , dic@@ ed , la@@ ye@@ red and , God knows , distributed and sold .
what 's the long @@@ -@@ @ term effect of this on us or on music ?
( music ) And he said , " Yes , yes . I was a little boy .
you don 't need to worry about knowing anything .

( la@@ ughter ) And then life was fine , dan@@ dy .
Oh , some of you have seen it .
and as it ran , this thing was saying , " Give me input . give me input . "
and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and dig@@ estive tissue .
when I moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
and by this time I was ho@@ oked .
and this is about 23 years into this process .
are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it ?
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
back in the 1980s , actually , I gave my first talk at TED , and I brought some of the very , very first public demonstrations of virtual reality ever to the TED stage .
everything you know about Be@@ eth@@ oven -- basically wrong .
the very first thing that happens is : it re@@ defines the product .
so the product becomes sheet music , becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home .
every time this happens , we take away some social interaction .
with each of these disruptions , it changes the amount of social interaction .
but there 's also less choice , because in a global pyramid , you can 't always tell what you want .
now , this little boy here , Pam@@ el@@ o , from Zambia , he has tr@@ ach@@ oma .
they CA@@ N@@ NOT eliminate tr@@ ach@@ oma unless they get more .
well , we believe that we can eliminate tr@@ ach@@ oma in 12 African countries and across the Americas and all across the Pacific .
I was drawn to oce@@ an@@ ography by just this kind of challenge .
the wild thing that happened on that trip is that we discovered what everyone who looked before had completely missed : pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thetic cells smaller than anyone thought possible .
we now know those tiny cells are the most abundant pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thetic organisms on earth .
it 's exceed@@ ingly large , span@@ ning from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean and around the globe .
these animals and their movements help connect the surface and deep ocean in important ways .
this could have irreversible global @@@ -@@ @ scale impacts on marine life and food web@@ s .
we need to get out ahead of fishing impacts and work to understand this critical part of the ocean .
methane pollution causes one quarter of the global warming that we 're experiencing right now .
and not only is no one talking about it , but we refuse to acknowledge that the source of this crisis is rooted in the same injustice that first propelled the civil rights movement .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
believe it or not , the picture on your right remains a very popular tourist s@@ nor@@ k@@ eling spot on the island of Mau@@ i , even though it 's lost most of its coral cover over the past decade or so .
if we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime , then that is the change we need to spread .
we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .

one of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy when I was a k@@ id is how it was always presented so two @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sionally and so static .
so here 's a little black hole that we probably don 't want to get too close to .
because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now are the result of short @@@ -@@ @ term thinking , and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 , 100 , or 1,000 years out .
the population density of the UK is 250 people per square kilome@@ ter .
half of the world 's population lives in countries that are already above that line .
so in an attempt to prepare their men for any future conflicts , they founded the National R@@ if@@ le Association to promote rifle practice .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
so Athens and The@@ bes went out to fight Philip of Maced@@ on .
but this is just a further evolution of a journey of uncomfortable learning throughout my life .
for many , it was difficult to see how bringing controversial speakers to campus could be valuable , when they caused harm .
it 's my belief that to achieve progress in the face of ad@@ versity , we need a genuine commitment to gaining a deeper understanding of humanity .
it was really crowded , as it is around the holidays , and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused .

we 're bringing the first stages back , and we 're landing them on federal property on an Air Force base .
GS : ye@@ ah . so we 've got a video , this is a cro@@ pped video from others we 've shown , and then there 's a couple of new bits to it .

fundamentally , it 's another place to explore , and that 's what makes humans different from animals , it 's our sense of exploration and sense of wonder@@ ment and learning something new .
evaluating Egypt on this basis alone , however , igno@@ res the real revolution .
now , let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime , and that is , SE@@ TI , I think , is important , because it 's exploration , and it 's not only exploration , it 's comprehensible exploration .
you GO@@ T@@ TA get them with your thum@@ b before they find the sugar or something .
now , look , a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country .

you 're not ner@@ ds if you say yes .
so it turns out that we have upgraded .
so the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens ; the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around .
and as they pick that , these become bone , and then they pick another road and these become plat@@ ele@@ ts , and these become macro@@ ph@@ ages , and these become T cells .
that turns out to be a big deal because now you can take , not just mouse cells , but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells .
and I 'm about to show you some stop @@@ -@@ @ motion foot@@ age that I made recently where you 'll see bacteria accum@@ ulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour .

so within the company , there 's no difference in the forward c@@ itation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries .
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations , because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms .
without that , you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today .
in 2009 , they had 400,000 employees , by which time the U.S. employees had moved to 10@@ 5,000 , whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000 .
Ah : Oh my God , it 's harsh up here .

the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .

on the right , you see it looks very ug@@ ly , the cells continue to grow , the normal ones stop .
this is what we got .
I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body .
we let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver 's seat .
and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does .
child : TV . ( children react ) Child : Oh my God .
now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side .
and some even said , this would be St@@ asi 2.0 .
but then after a while I realized , this is my life .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
and this is a photo now , it 's not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
after decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it 's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even .
people are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
what does this mean ?
until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor , who was looking at people and giving them me@@ ds .
DM : that 's aw@@ ful .
there 's a counter@@ intuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let 's look at the first metric here , over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survival .
so the problems of be@@ es today is@@ n 't necessarily something new . it has been happening since over a thousand years ago , but what we don 't really notice are these problems in cities .
why are be@@ es doing better in the city ?
1971 , we saw it spread to Europe and South America , and then , when we get to the 1980s , and specifically to 1987 , the var@@ ro@@ a m@@ ite finally came to North America and to the United States , and that is when the game changed for hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es in the United States .
well , really , just change your perspective .
maybe in Germany , in German language , it may be just " A@@ ha ! "
Chinese is always che@@ ating , right ?
it became the media .
so that 's why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government , they want the em@@ peror to settle the problem .
so , what 's the future ?
Don 't let them ho@@ ok [ up ] with the Chinese cats .
and in this particular case , this is the clim@@ ax of the movie , and , you know , the weight of achieving it was simply take a model , throw it out of a helicopter , and shoot it .
and he said , " Hu@@ h , that 's pretty good . can we use it ? "
that do@@ es@@ n 't move . "
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " And the thing without the wheels , that moves . "
he was the master of his universe , and we wanted Hu@@ go to feel the same way , so we created this shot .
( music ) Ok@@ ay , I hear you were laugh@@ ing ner@@ v@@ ously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the int@@ on@@ ation was a little questionable . ( la@@ ughter ) Let 's watch just another cli@@ p .
this is going to be a piece called " ap@@ ha@@ sia , " and it 's for hand ge@@ stures synchronized to sound , and this invites yet another role , and final one I 'll share with you , which is that of the chore@@ ograph@@ er .
so for me , chore@@ ography is very much a process of physical thinking . it 's very much in mind , as well as in body , and it 's a collaborative process .
so all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand .
they 're using the information that they receive to generate the begin@@ nings of a phrase .
so they 're solving this problem for me , having a little -- They 're constructing that phrase .
they 're starting it already , and this is a task @@@ -@@ @ based method , where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves .
I 'm going to think about it in 3D space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that 's in front of me , it 's a space that my body can go inside of .
thank you very much . ( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you . ( appl@@ ause ) Here we go . ( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause )
( la@@ ughter ) You can always fo@@ ol yourself into seeing a decline if you compare bleeding head@@ lines of the present with rose @@@ -@@ @ tin@@ ted images of the past .
in the 19th century , We@@ ster@@ ners worked more than 60 hours per week .
but my science story do@@ es@@ n 't have that spectacular Hollywood ending .
he had taken a lot of pills and a lot of vod@@ ka .
then in February of last year , when I was on patrol in Afghanistan , I stepped on an I@@ ED .
( la@@ ughter ) But he would say , " But you 're African .
I 'm not sharing this to sens@@ ation@@ alize Ken@@ sing@@ ton .
and so I 'm here to explain what that is .
what you see here is two male ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es who are the same size , but one is walking up@@ right , has his hair up , has a big rock in his hand , and he 's the alpha male .
you don 't need to be the biggest and strongest male .
people who don 't like each other need to embrace each other and stand together , and that 's absolutely essential for the unity of the party , and if you don 't do that , the party may fall apart .
or Jenn@@ y , who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master 's degree .
they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job , and we know many students who did .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
this is from Stan@@ ford 's Computer Science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color @@@ -@@ @ correct that blur@@ ry red image .
so we had to come up with a different solution .
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale , and is also a useful learning strategy for the students , because they actually learn from the experience .
this is the San Francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world .
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis @@@ -@@ @ driven mode to the data @@@ -@@ @ driven mode , a transformation that , for example , has revolu@@ tion@@ ized biology .
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer .
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it 's kind of hard to miss .
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone .
so the goal here is to try and push , and see how far we can get towards the green curve .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
I was helping clean the on@@ sen , the communal on@@ sen , the huge giant bath@@ tu@@ bs .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
it means that organizations mostly can 't do what George and Al@@ ice so trium@@ ph@@ antly did .
so , recently , I worked with an executive named Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medical device company .
they 're ultra @@@ -@@ @ low cost , and we all know what happens .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it 's too late .
last one , this is " Who 's Go@@ ing To Buy You Ri@@ b@@ bons , " another traditional folk tune .
" the worlds are the important thing .
( music ) We know this tune , right ? we know it ?
that is " When the World 's on Fire , " a very old mel@@ ody , in this case performed by the Car@@ ter Family .
you should have seen my parents ' reaction !
B@@ ing Capital 's acquisition of Ed@@ con , a large retail@@ er , is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .

but with Africa , let 's start being careful about this .
for Africa to truly be sustainable , we have to move beyond to other industries .
as the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [ we will need ] poles for rolling out electricity .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard & amp ; Po@@ ors , Mo@@ ody 's and F@@ itch 's .
they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
I can feel the brush of swe@@ at@@ y bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can 't see much else .
recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
Kofi was rescu@@ ed from a fishing village .
when I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be ampu@@ t@@ ated .
and my hero@@ ine here -- like S@@ atis@@ h 's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Bur@@ ma .
if we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dre@@ ad@@ ful moments and it can give us real inner power .
because at the beginning I was so outra@@ ged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
we should inventory the donations piling up here .
emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient .
but if you give locals the tools , if you show them what they can do to recover , they become experts .
over 80 percent are in low@@ - and middle @@@ -@@ @ income countries , and many have no access to hearing care .
and yet , when we look back on the printing press in the early years , we like what happened .
this , graph@@ ically , was the answer . ( la@@ ughter ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And that is indeed part of the problem , but only part .
it has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics .
the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
these days it 's very popular to believe that this push for transparency , this kind of a combination between active citizens , new technologies and much more transparency @@@ -@@ @ friendly legislation can restore trust in politics .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , trust , if we 're going to rebuild it , we have to understand its component parts .
would you give me some sense of whether or not you 're here voluntarily ?
( la@@ ughter ) But fortunately , it 's often the case that our logic is sound , but it 's our ability to communicate the logic that is in jeop@@ ar@@ dy .
you don 't want to have an authenticity w@@ ob@@ ble ? be you .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
and he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end , he had such popular support in London that he won .
now , you can learn three interesting things from this .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human @@@ -@@ @ centered design -- " Let 's figure out what people want . "
so it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution .
I just heard the best jo@@ ke about B@@ ond Emer@@ u@@ wa .
it comes from popular culture .
you 've been seas@@ oned by wind , d@@ us@@ k and sunlight .
you can have a camera ; you can get photos of your entire head .
Sydney . I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney .
the description read : " the sub@@ urban streets of M@@ into become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of M@@ into . "
to understand this , I think it kind of makes sense to look where we 've come from .
artists can take us to a far @@@ -@@ @ fl@@ ung part of the city that we haven 't explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . I saw their amazing show in New York at the Stat@@ en Island Fer@@ ry Terminal at rush hour .
we , the audience , were given head@@ sets and seated on one side of the terminal .
festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well @@@ -@@ @ being .
we want to get everybody out of the hole , over the social foundation and into that green dou@@ gh@@ nut itself .
cities like London , Glas@@ gow , Amsterdam are pioneering circular city design , finding ways to turn the waste from one urban process into food for the next .
but how meaningful is this calculation , really ?
her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , spe@@ ech@@ less .
over the next two years , I watched as she switched jobs five times , eventually landing a luc@@ r@@ ative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory .
she recently returned to D@@ ong@@ gu@@ an on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cran@@ es , temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village .
by opening up their lives to me , they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world .
when you talk to workers , that 's what they want .
I mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that 's not why they 're in the city , and that 's not what they care about .
all of this is happening openly , and above@@ board .
it 's that the G@@ ala sa@@ usage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called UA@@ C foods that 's active throughout Africa and the Middle East , but the G@@ ala sa@@ usage roll is not sold in stores .
( la@@ ughter ) And when I looked up in the catalog to see how much this three @@@ -@@ @ foot @@@ -@@ @ high mouse cost , here 's how it was described ...
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's when I knew .
I see some nod@@ ding heads there .
we have a precedent for this . good old Henry II here , in the 12th century , invented the jury .
in fact , if you fly over Germany , for example , and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages , they 're all about a mile apart .
now there 's some trends that will impact cities .
it 's also involved in social interaction , understanding other people , and self @@@ -@@ @ awareness .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
the World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe 's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities . we can do better than that .
He@@ y , let 's all be interior sound designers , take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that 's effective and appropriate .
I went to my school kitchen , and I said , " Give me the sc@@ ra@@ ps that my school friends have turned their nos@@ es up at . "
so I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
I ran down the street and collapsed , and the ambulance guys intu@@ b@@ ated me on the side@@ walk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming .
they kind of have this va@@ ult where they 're stored in high @@@ -@@ @ de@@ f , and George Luc@@ as did all the sound effects . ( la@@ ughter ) So sometimes , rememb@@ ering them , it 's like , it 's not like any other kind of memories .
but first of all , I want you to do me a favor .
where does it come from ?
and for what ?
we are also influenced by our non@@ verb@@ als , our thoughts and our feelings and our physi@@ ology .
so I 'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that 's hormones . I look at hormones .
this one is very low @@@ -@@ @ power .
so it seems that our non@@ verb@@ als do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it 's not just others , but it 's also ourselves .
we then have these co@@ ders look at these tapes , four of them .
you 're going to stay , and this is what you 're going to do .
and from day one , No@@ am and I decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the Web .
to anyone considering NA@@ ND@@ 2@@ Te@@ tr@@ is , it 's a tough journey , but you 'll be profoundly changed . "
I have to say that I 'm very glad to be here .
so that was 20 years ago , and I was always on the periphery of art .
you know , when people say , " I don 't get art .
so they 'd go to an antique shop , and they 'd look at this cup , and they 'd say , " T@@ ell us about this cup . "
and as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , I 've spent my whole career making new media art .
now the ir@@ ony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behavi@@ ors that are hard @@@ -@@ @ wired in all of us .
the interesting thing about studying cogn@@ ition has been that we 've been limited , in a way .
now we have multi @@@ -@@ @ language , instantaneous , automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices , all the way down to smartphones .
and if any of us have used these , we know that they 're not perfect , but they 're decent .
not anymore .
it was written by an algorithm .
I want to ask : what have been the most important developments in human history ?
so when you do this and when you plot the data , you pretty quickly come to some we@@ ir@@ d conclusions .
they don 't run on capital , they don 't run on labor .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information .
they connect in a man@@ hole like this . literally , this is where the 5,000 @@@ -@@ @ mile cable pl@@ u@@ gs in .
well , I became a tap@@ e@@ stry histor@@ ian .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you , thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
all you do , go into the timeline , double @@@ -@@ @ click the item , and I 've set it to Toronto , because that 's where I 'm from .
feelings are tunnels .
there 's an area of your brain you 've probably heard referred to as the " reward center . "
it 's actually three intertwined but separ@@ able systems .
how bad ? "
number 13 : on occasion , the victim , female or male , may experience a physical response , but this is not a sexual response in the sense of desire or mu@@ tuality . "
this brings me one step closer into the darkness , and then I promise we will find our way into the light .
that kind of story can give a person all kind of feelings , from rage to shame to confused ar@@ ous@@ al because it is sex @@@ -@@ @ related , even though it is appalling .
I can see it helping people , even as I say the words .
but do have one brave conversation .
one in six men .
say it to a judge you know or a lawyer you know , or a co@@ p or anyone who might sit on a jury in a sexual assault case .
so for every brave conversation you have , thank you .
thanks .
en : the question I get asked most often is actually the question under@@ ne@@ ath pretty much all the other questions , so , can you get addic@@ ted to your vibr@@ ator , please help me with my erectile dysfunction ?
like , do you just want normal sex or do you want awesome sex in your life ?
every street is generally perceived as a straight line , and we kind of ignore the little t@@ wi@@ sts and turns that the streets make .
the cognitive map in your mind may tell you , " Ar@@ is , go back to the main cathedral square , take a 90 @@@ -@@ @ degree turn and walk down that other side street . "
the second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines .
she 'll tell you the pu@@ b where her sister used to work , and ... " go past that church where I got married , " that kind of thing .
so we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning .
you might add little symbols along the way .
if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you 've just drawn , you 'd realize your streets and the distances -- they 'd be way off .
no , what you 've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schem@@ atic .
of course , what you don 't know is that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart .
I research@@ ed how each and every bus route moved through the city , nice and logical , every bus route a separate line .
ok@@ ay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive .
but it 's not an easy road . after the bomb , the victims are not into this .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @@@ -@@ @ up calls for us ?
what else do we need ?
here 's some so@@ bering statistics just to give you an idea .
they certainly do .
and yet , the ir@@ ony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being .
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
I 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
it 's actually about three percent .
a second reason has to do with peer pressure .
he 's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants , the answer is about 24 percent . that 's their guess .
and they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
that was not my intention . I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book .
slightly embar@@ ras@@ sing admission : even when I was a k@@ id , I used to have these little sp@@ y books , and I would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down .
our printing press is the Internet . our coffee houses are social networks .
so there 's a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there 's a few more coming on board .
in America , you have the Cy@@ ber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act .
this is from an anti @@@ -@@ @ gay website , where they said g@@ ays are " worthy of death for their v@@ ile ... sex practices . "
and what they 've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physi@@ ologically aroused when you show them dis@@ g@@ usting images like the ones that I showed you .
that 's the first line of defense for the body .
what it is , it 's a lam@@ ination of two different metals together .
my initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know @@@ -@@ @ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
what I and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were mad@@ ly in love , into a functional M@@ RI brain scanner .
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been won@@ dering about this question since they sat around their cam@@ p@@ fires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
it 's very slow .
and I say back into the job market , because this is not new .
in short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
and it 's going to have an impact .
these three brain systems -- l@@ ust , romantic love and attachment -- don 't always go together .
with org@@ asm , then you get a real rush of oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in and vas@@ op@@ res@@ sin -- those are associated with attachment .
in fact , you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else .
and these drugs are going generic .
you fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your " love map , " an un@@ conscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .
and I CA@@ N@@ NOT remember the first moment I encountered au@@ tism , but I CA@@ N@@ NOT recall a day without it .
wounds are sc@@ ary , they are nasty , they are ick@@ y , it is why most of us look away when we don@@ ate blood .
in all those years , with that guy cha@@ ined to my side , I got a lot done .
they 're a little bigger . they 're a prototype .
so I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals .
this is considered the Five Bless@@ ings .
they 're going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone .
so this is where we are right now , but what about the future ?
nobody ? one ? how about 10 years ?
this bat is my@@ o@@ tis bran@@ d@@ ti@@ i . it 's the longest @@@ -@@ @ living bat .
we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it , and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks .
they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries .
but you drop 25 of those veterans in Jo@@ pl@@ in , Missouri , they get that sense of community back .
music : D@@ J Sh@@ ad@@ ow .
( music ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Pret@@ ty cool , hu@@ h ? we think so .
you just did@@ n 't want to respond to that person that time .
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it 's not going to be accurate all the time .
first , lying online can be very dangerous , right ?
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do I want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon .
you need first funds .
( shooting no@@ ises ) The name of the game is to get after your enemy z@@ om@@ bie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
well , I 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
it 's better than those that don 't play .
so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
[ " yellow " ] DB : Red . audience : yellow .
right ? so these kinds of results really makes two main points .
the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .
I mean , you have the typical European cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity .
I so@@ aked it up and I thought , " How could I ever have taken this for granted ? "
how beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island .
but that 's still not reason for us to dis@@ engage , because we 've seen that movie before , in Afghanistan .
what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of pol@@ arized light in the sky that you and I can 't see . it 's the way our eyes are built .
in fact , I think my kids will be the first Vi@@ kings who will have a hard time growing a be@@ ard when they become older .
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source , and in this case , these guys were New York food blog@@ gers .
and that , I guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
so for me , it 's a collaboration .
but it turns out that try@@ p@@ top@@ han also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate .
so there you have it : the evolution of a head@@ line .
so when this came up in my local shop , naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims .
so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
and in some cases , oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in can even decrease cooperation .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old standing in that exact spot .
you have Palestine @@@ -@@ @ Lo@@ ves @@@ -@@ @ Israel .
and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe [ with ] effort , we can avoid it .
the American people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issues , to fiscal issues , are moderate , pragmatic centri@@ sts .
you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a Key@@ ne@@ sian liberal economist , and these people did@@ n 't go to each other 's weddings , they s@@ nu@@ bbed each other at conferences .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , J@@ ake .
the ver@@ b is the chassis of the sentence .
you can also say , " B@@ iff went from sick to well . "
the mind that we rely upon to be happy , content , emo@@ tionally stable as individuals , and at the same time , to be kind and though@@ tful and consider@@ ate in our relationships with others .
let 's say this is an anxious thought .
if you think about the last time you had a w@@ ob@@ bly tooth .
and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those stor@@ y@@ lines and patterns of mind .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it 's actually ready .
the males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go .
once again , the same process repe@@ ats .
think of it like this .
so my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books .
Mrs. Al@@ is@@ ch was there . Mr. Sh@@ il@@ ale was there . Mrs. Cas@@ ey was there .
and for him , it 's only his second .
and I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights .
and she responded with , " I 'm here . " ( la@@ ughter ) That 's true . you are alive , and that 's pretty good right now .
all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving C@@ eline with no alternatives .
now , I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally @@@ -@@ @ funded research .
I 'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan Africa , so attractive for these HIV clinical trials ?
public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate .
the final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me , in six seconds .

Rwanda is a place that ha@@ un@@ ts me a lot .

these mechanisms , these facilities are not in the gift of Cra@@ ig@@ s@@ list or G@@ um@@ tree or Ya@@ ho@@ o , they 're controlled by the state .

so there 's a new block that says how much video motion there is , and then , if there 's so much video motion , it will then tell the ballo@@ on to pop .

it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible .
it has taken away exc@@ uses from those who are complac@@ ent .
but this is different .
to explain what this means and what this thing is , please let me quickly take a couple of steps back .
I ended up in physics by accident .
and it gets even better , because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence .
the nodes in the network are the system 's components , and the links are given by the interactions .
and it has implications for systemic risk .
so we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007 .
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
is it a place where you can express your inf@@ anti@@ le wishes ?
committed sex is pre@@ med@@ itated sex .
secondly , we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet , and start moving them around .
a lot of very so@@ ber @@@ -@@ @ minded physi@@ ci@@ sts , believe it or not , have had exactly the same thought .

my wife counts them among her most trea@@ sured moments as a mom .

our instinc@@ t as parents is to order our kids around .
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the water@@ fall as much as possible .
just yesterday , we were having our family meeting , and we had voted to work on over@@ re@@ acting .

there were these three people and me , and I am taking the pictures , that 's why I am not in .
the feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement , of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility , of making sure everything is safe .
here is a close @@@ -@@ @ up of the fossil , after five years of cleaning , preparation and description , which was very long , as I had to expose the bones from the sand@@ stone block I just showed you in the previous slide .
so she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the Luc@@ y species , known as Austr@@ al@@ opi@@ th@@ ec@@ us af@@ aren@@ sis .

when I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much @@@ -@@ @ vil@@ ified livestock to address climate change and desertification , I was faced with a real dilemma .
I believe I 've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this .
we 've only explored about five percent of our ocean .
I use the garden , the soil , like it 's a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that 's my emb@@ ell@@ ishment for that cloth .
( la@@ ughter ) My finishing move was going to be The Tra@@ sh Comp@@ actor .
( la@@ ughter ) Li@@ ke a bo@@ omer@@ ang , the thing I loved came back to me .
I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship .
and so if we really want , like Buc@@ k@@ min@@ ster Ful@@ ler said , a world that works for everyone , with no one and nothing left out , then the non@@ profit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation .
but it do@@ es@@ n 't seem to be working .
why have our breast cancer ch@@ arities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer , or our homeless ch@@ arities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city ?
why has poverty remained stuck at 12 percent of the U.S. population for 40 years ?
and the answer is , these social problems are massive in scale , our organizations are tiny up against them , and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny .
we have one for the non@@ profit sector , and one for the rest of the economic world .

and a final possibility is that there 's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyper@@ activity , but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in AD@@ HD .
you get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes fal@@ cons .
everybody thought is was finished .
you know , do you want extin@@ c@@ t species back ?
but it 's heart @@@ -@@ @ stopping . it 's mind @@@ -@@ @ blowing stuff .
it 's not going to kill you .
we were like , " Holy ... ! " -- I can 't say that .
R@@ H : that 's the bit@@ ch about the internet -- it moves fast , you know ?
so then you have a lot of par@@ ano@@ ia about what 's coming next , and that 's part of the founding eth@@ os , is really worrying about what 's coming next .
so that 's an advantage .
and we try not to make it intense , like y@@ elling at each other -- nothing like that .
R@@ H : ye@@ ah , it was super exciting at the time ; this was about 2007 .
which ones of these are your best movies ? "
but are@@ n 't there risks with this , if this go @@@ -@@ @ only @@@ -@@ @ with @@@ -@@ @ revealed @@@ -@@ @ values approach is taken too far ?
ca : but -- yes , indeed .
R@@ H : in practice , you 're right that you can 't just rely on algorithms .
I think you 're right , which is , when people talk about Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , they talk about the shows that move them : " 13 Re@@ as@@ ons Why " or " The Crown . "
and if we 're as great as we can be , and we have a variety of mo@@ ods , then more often , people will choose us .
R@@ H : it depends on the k@@ id .
well first of all , because I am a maker .
Jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and did@@ n 't work , so others could study and reproduce it .
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
there was basically a factory of industrial machines .
and I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it 's actually kind of fragile .
ca : I mean , this is a beautiful but expensive car .
em : more from solar than any other source .
it was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one ?

( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
there 's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis , because they 're picking zero or one .
very complicated . the right brain schem@@ atic is the un@@ informed person , and the left is the informed .
that is , it looks as if the un@@ informed brain activity is happening first , and then it 's followed by activity in the informed brain .
and by the way , these were trials where their deals were made .
here 's the case where the disagreements occur .
ok@@ ay , so the next part of this study I 'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of T@@ et@@ sur@@ o Mat@@ su@@ z@@ awa .
it 's s@@ prin@@ k@@ led around , but if you average the ch@@ im@@ ps out , they 're really , really close , within .@@ 01 .
the ch@@ im@@ ps are playing better than the humans , better in the sense of adhering to game theory .
none of them are close to where the ch@@ im@@ ps are .

and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently , you can really change things .
it 's involved in every physical interaction you do every day , every manipulation task , anything you do in the world .
we can do this for all kinds of surfaces and it 's really a lot of fun .
what happened in the S@@ is@@ y@@ phic condition ?
no , the taste was great .
when you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
and then we emb@@ ed elastic .
and we 're developing a new paradigm for piping .
so this is@@ n 't expensive pumps or valves .
the third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win .
there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena .
and I remember thinking , this is it .

you can 't really directly sense the world around you .
before we address the kidnapping , I 'll first address this bu@@ zz@@ ard / vul@@ ture question I get all the time .

hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es can be considered a super @@@ -@@ @ organism , where the colony is the organism and it 's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual be@@ e organisms .
for example , we study hygiene , where some be@@ es are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest , from the colony , and it keeps the colony healthy .
so seven years ago , when hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e colonies were reported to be dying en mas@@ se , first in the United States , it was clear that there was something really , really wrong .
the very farms that used to sustain be@@ es are now agricultural food deser@@ ts , dominated by one or two plant species like corn and so@@ y@@ beans .

there was a huge pit or shaft called a mou@@ lin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the gl@@ ac@@ ier .
it was so cold outside , we actually had to sleep inside the cave .
well not too much lives in them because they 're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year .
someone who is , as the It@@ alians say , " g@@ ago@@ ot@@ z . "
and let me tell you this story .
that proved to be a lot of bo@@ vine ster@@ cus .
and they tried everything they had .
well , I was a grown man who had all of these rit@@ uals , and it got so there was a th@@ rob@@ bing , there was a fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ous fear in my head .
things change .
something from childhood comes back to ha@@ unt you .
through this act of immense open @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ tedness , he was to become the embo@@ di@@ ment of what in South Africa we call " u@@ buntu . "
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet .
now these studies are ing@@ en@@ ious , but they 're simple .
and it stays with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical organism .
by 2010 , De@@ tro@@ it had become the poster child for an American city in crisis .
there are very important people , business and land assets in De@@ tro@@ it , and there are real opportunities there .
well , I could think of a million things , but there 's what you want and what you can have , and ' O@@ um@@ u@@ am@@ ua was moving away and f@@ ading very rapidly .
so this is about all the time we were going to have to study it easily .
we 're part of a much larger environment , and in fact , we may even be surrounded by inter@@ stell@@ ar visitors and not even know it .
will future technologies like the Large Syn@@ optic Survey Tel@@ es@@ cope help us detect these things sooner ?
JI : awesome , thanks so much . let 's thank Karen again .
industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see , hear , feel a lot more than ever before , generating pro@@ di@@ gious amounts of data .
they are self @@@ -@@ @ aware , they are predic@@ tive , reactive and social .
it 's self @@@ -@@ @ learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss .
or take healthcare .
second , there is a concern that in the future , there will only be room for engineers , data scientists , and other highly @@@ -@@ @ specialized workers .
they 've made our lives healthier and more rewarding .
we also saw that our users had modified it in other ways .
it 's an expedition of some 30 people .
he approaches as the red truck successfully stops .
there 's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top lab@@ s all over the world , show@@ casing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse .
a lot of people with CP don 't walk , but my parents did@@ n 't believe in " can 't . "
( la@@ ughter ) But one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
College was im@@ itating life .
and she looked at me and she went , " Five , four , three , two ... "
" yo , is she ret@@ arded ? "
I like one of the definitions that Al@@ an K@@ ay has for technology .
and the trick that Richard D@@ aw@@ kins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
this is not on another planet . these are things that are hidden away on our planet .
and if we take the long @@@ -@@ @ term trends of life , if we begin to say , what does evolution want ? there 's several things that we see .
in fact , you can buy , for 50 buc@@ ks , a stone @@@ -@@ @ age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago .
that 's the definition of " infinite game . " a finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing .
that 's what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms .
imagine Van Go@@ gh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints .
all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology . this is the infinite game .
and if you play that well , you 'll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone .
five years after a diet , most people have reg@@ ained the weight .
what if we told all those di@@ e@@ ting girls that it 's ok@@ ay to eat when they 're hungry ?
and Andrew had been doing his own bits of research , and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from studying the literature was that there 's actually a big bottlenec@@ k .
so we took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open @@@ -@@ @ source license to anybody that wanted it .
and we had a long list .
I 'd like to now switch to talk about another key short@@ coming of today 's vaccines , and that is the need to maintain the cold chain .
I met one of them , I was in Beijing .
about taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world .
he shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm .
in the end , I accepted the job without actually having been here .
so , it was just before the time that the Leon@@ ardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Me@@ t , to New York , to see my new domain .
to see what European sculpture and decorative arts looked like , beyond those Renaissance collections with which I was so already familiar .
there was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and , in fact , if there was any emo@@ tion going on , it was a kind of rep@@ ulsion .
( la@@ ughter ) So , I started thinking about why it was , in fact , that I dis@@ liked this object so much .
where all the little girls would come either as a prin@@ cess or a fairy .
it was a Dum@@ bo night@@ mare . ( la@@ ughter ) But something more profound was happening as well .
the label had told me that these pieces were made by the S@@ Ã¨@@ v@@ res Manu@@ factory , made of porcelain in the late 17@@ 50s , and designed by a designer called Jean @@@ -@@ @ Cla@@ ude du@@ Pl@@ es@@ sis , actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned .
but , that tu@@ tu for example -- actually , this is a piece that does dance in its own way .
we 've eliminated , in a sense , that constant of the imagination that these v@@ ases represented in people 's lives .
I think it 's beginning to happen .
and it 's based , actually , on a more elevated piece of porcelain .
I used to play it on the guitar , you know .
usually , when we feel anno@@ yed , hatred or upset with someone , or obs@@ essed with something , the mind goes again and again to that object .
and now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time .
but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates , in fact , to the basic pillars of management .
improve inter@@ personal feelings , the more people like each other , the more they will cooperate .
you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the bu@@ ff@@ ers that make us self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient .
just knowing my ro@@ om@@ mates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
now , when you experience fear , your sympa@@ thetic nervous system kic@@ ks in .
( music ) Than@@ k you .
it 's also been a real issue in terms of access .
we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
so why are we fighting it in the classroom ?
so rather than driving our kids into a classroom , her@@ ding them out there at 8 o 'clock in the morning -- I h@@ ated going to class at 8 o 'clock in the morning , so why are we forcing our kids to do that ?
they can re@@ wind the professor .
some are never graded .
and these kinds of technologies really help , the bl@@ ended model can really help revolu@@ tion@@ ize education .
so basically , they cou@@ ld@@ n 't be scaled or transferred to other places .
and every single judge in the United States of America can use it , because it 's been created on a universal data set .
well , I 'm a science journalist and multimedia producer , who has always been fasc@@ inated by gross stuff .
people online , and sometimes even in real life , were dis@@ respectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
how about from Wh@@ ite@@ boy@@ 77@@ AG@@ S : " people always need something to ( female dog ) about . "
in a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
for most people , these experiences disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize .
that then sti@@ rs up the same feelings of panic and helpl@@ essness as if they 're experiencing the trauma all over again .
so how would you divide a 4@@ x@@ 4 , 10@@ x@@ 10 , or 32@@ x@@ 32 canvas ?
" about 115 mill@@ igra@@ ms oxy@@ co@@ done , " I responded .
what happened next really came to define my entire experience of medical trauma .
the result , put another way , was hell .
I would swe@@ at prof@@ us@@ ely almost constantly , and yet if I managed to get myself out into the hot August sun , I might look down and find myself covered in go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps .
you can 't make that one up .
and one day , I was thinking about how all data has a location , and I realized that the answer had been st@@ aring me in the face .
here 's Mount Pin@@ at@@ u@@ bo in the early ' 9@@ 0s . that put a whole bun@@ ch of sul@@ fur in the strat@@ osphere with a sort of atomic bomb @@@ -@@ @ like cloud .
that 's what the world looks like , under one particular climate model 's view , with twice the amount of CO2 in the air .
the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their lab@@ s .
there 's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
it 's using this as risk control , not instead of action .
I 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to trans@@ gress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
and I 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retro@@ fitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on ster@@ oids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
seated in this audience are 9@@ 96 small figures .
it could be a few cl@@ aps or a strong appl@@ ause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
so to us , I think we 're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that 's also got a sort of musical @@@ -@@ @ like quality to it , an instrument .
so here 's a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of cl@@ ashing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the tension .
and here is a prototype .
it comes out of the idea of a window .
this is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it 's made up of three different thick@@ nesses of wooden sections .
you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
and so , given this one equation , it 's natural to ask , so what can you do with this ?
but it 's not true ! we only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds .
it is a sort of poetry of deliberate aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness .
forty percent food waste is a major problem .
but that 's really big in the U.@@ K.
they 'd say , " Le@@ yl@@ a , how do I make it technically efficient ? "
or , " How do I make it green materials ?
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
building on this strength , they attracted investment and started to process , being able to export higher @@@ -@@ @ value products like st@@ arch from c@@ assa@@ va .
hence , Sam@@ in@@ u left to the city , where he soon realized that life was not easy .
but if we can tap into commercial debt , it is a small number -- only 0.1 percent of all the debt in the world today , 10 cents out of every 100 dollars .
I think it 's reck@@ less to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long @@@ -@@ @ term returns .
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
the aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments , which have fallen for two consecutive years .
but it took an innocent question from my then @@@ -@@ @ four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter to make me appreciate that .
so I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money ch@@ asing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon .
now inte@@ res@@ tingly , the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network .
there were no str@@ angers . right ?
it 's about 40 kil@@ ow@@ att @@@ -@@ @ hours .
so you can really wrap a business around that .
ca : cool . thank you for that .
so it 's no wonder that the values that under@@ ly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that under@@ ly the Internet .
and it 's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just was@@ n 't going to be possible in the few months that they had .
in one Saturday afternoon , they were able to pop@@ ulate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions , but more importantly than that , they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government .
and I 'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation .
they actually love it .
here , I discovered something obvious : wilderness is our natural habitat , too .
now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to te@@ ase out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions .
and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English @@@ -@@ @ specific .
and that 's evident here with the slower conduc@@ tion .
John I saw just last week in the clinic .
but I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist called Yam@@ an@@ aka .
and I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration , repair and hope .
[ " I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist ; on his present showing this is quite ridic@@ ulous . " ] So they did@@ n 't think much of him then .
drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this .
that 's straightforward , because that 's what pl@@ uri@@ potent cells can do .
but cru@@ cially , you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts , ideally from an un@@ affected relative .
that way , you 're matching for genetic variation .
so here I 've asked John what his hopes are for the future .
and as laboratories , to describe gal@@ axy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
and , in fact , if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around this cluster .
so that was very big .
this is in false color .
and the question is , if it 's not gal@@ ax@@ ies , what is emitting this light ?
so , it 's very funny .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul , not just a trim@@ ming at the margins .
after my neuro@@ surgery , part of my brain was missing , and I had to deal with that .
but even if we don 't run across it in our life@@ times , we can still think there is one out there , and we 're just trying to get closer and closer to it .
I collect bran@@ ding ir@@ ons that were used to mark slaves as property .
I collect sh@@ ack@@ les for adults and restraints for adults as well as children .
it 's a ca@@ vi@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ ven@@ ding machine .
( la@@ ughter ) These are people who don 't necessarily regularly engage with science .
this is what that looked like .
and it started to make me think about a couple of things .
I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal .
now , when we go , fewer and fewer businesses close for si@@ e@@ sta , reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24 @@@ -@@ @ hour competition .
but in fact , the change is actually already happening .
so , people like to call Africa a mobile @@@ -@@ @ first continent , but actually it 's mobile @@@ -@@ @ only , so while everybody else is doing all of those things , we 're solving the world 's problems .
males have a spi@@ ked , bar@@ bed penis that they literally sta@@ b into the female , and they don 't sta@@ b it anywhere near her vag@@ ina .
was there a neuro@@ logical cause for their condition ?
the heavy metal door s@@ lam@@ med shut behind me .
when you think about it , it is ir@@ onic that our current solution for people with stressed am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ ae is to place them in an environment that actually inhib@@ its any chance of further growth .
but the travel options are very limited ; plane tickets cost nearly half of their monthly salary .
now you can imagine looking at Jon@@ as at only 14 , that male pu@@ ber@@ ty is early in this family , because he looks more like a 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old .
time and again , a thin@@ ker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was inde@@ f@@ en@@ sible , ir@@ rational , inconsistent with values already held .
and yes , this is ambitious , but there is momentum on this issue , and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum , and it 's just starting on this issue .
you really can make this change happen .
now , a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word .
global citizens , inno@@ v@@ ators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .
but it did@@ n 't even slow down the animal .
and in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot .
when you touched the cock@@ ro@@ ach leg , what did it feel like ?
we discovered they work by inter@@ molecular forces alone .
and here is Ri@@ SE .
as a sy@@ sad@@ min , you had access to their systems , and you began revealing certain classified documents to some hand@@ picked journalists leading the way to June 's re@@ vel@@ ations .
they were only tried by a secret court .
the N@@ SA was previously asked by Congress , was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ball@@ park estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercep@@ ted .
the prerogatives of people like D@@ ick Ch@@ en@@ ey do not keep the nation safe .
ca : but it 's alleged that you 've stolen 1.7 million documents .
ca : come here , because I want to ask you about this particular revelation .
it 's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here , but I see them .
( appl@@ ause ) I mean , The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you .
and even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 , 74 shuttle flight , the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so -- one in 35 , one in 40 .
you get lighter and lighter , the force gets on us heavier and heavier .
until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we 're weigh@@ tless .
so I think absolutely , fol@@ ks do have a right to privacy , and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected .
now what you 'll see people say publicly is there is no " but for " case , and so there is no case where , but for that , the threat would have happened .
this is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government , and President Mad@@ ison would have been proud .
when people have the knowledge , they can find solutions without having to helped out .
and I went and searched , and this is what I found .
you 're working because you want to change the world .
until the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life .
but when she enters her te@@ ens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort .
is it maybe protecting its si@@ bl@@ ings ?
now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
this is Tox@@ o@@ plasma gon@@ di@@ i , or Tox@@ o , for short , because the terri@@ fying creature always deserves a cu@@ te nick@@ name .
estimates vary a lot , but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Tox@@ o in their bra@@ ins .
now typically , this do@@ es@@ n 't lead to any over@@ t illness .
it did@@ n 't look all that special from the outside , as I said , but when we walked inside , I was immediately struck by three things : first of all , it was ple@@ as@@ antly cool despite the op@@ pressive heat outside .
but I wondered , what about when it ra@@ ined ?
Bi@@ onics has defined my phy@@ sic@@ ality .
technology is inadequate .
how do my bi@@ onic lim@@ bs move like flesh and bone ?
indeed , Bi@@ onics is making a profound difference in people 's lives .
we the people need not accept our limitations , but can trans@@ cend disability through technological innovation .
it is her expression . it is her art form .
he was@@ n 't sharing in my celebration .
I 'm not going to fail that .
and as we have mar@@ ched , people around the country have begun to say , " Can we do the same thing in our state ? "
thank you very much .
so when I was eight years old , I was at a fi@@ e@@ sta in the Philippines celebrating these myster@@ ies .
but the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger , ro@@ iling pot of universal stuff .
there was a lot we did@@ n 't know .
Ma : ye@@ ah , in ' 97 , we read an article about diar@@ rhe@@ al diseases killing so many kids around the world , and we kept saying to ourselves , " Well that can 't be .
and I kept hearing from women , over and over and over , the more I traveled , " I want to be able to use this shot . "
we go from 20 million not long after I was born to now we 're down to about six million .
measles was killing a couple million a year .
that 's down to a few hundred thousand .
we can actually accelerate the progress .
but we don 't every minute together , that 's for sure .
B@@ G : because we built this thing together from the beginning , it 's this great partnership .
she 's got a lot of insight .
thank you .
so here you see a familiar sight .
they not only look des@@ olate , they feel down@@ right dangerous .
but architects love them .
our city cou@@ ld@@ n 't possibly handle any more cars .
but I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans .
where Broad@@ way traffic used to run , there are now tables and chairs .
we think we know most of the animal kingdom , but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered .
what civilization creates this society ?
from this to here , that , it 's gen@@ ius .
P@@ tol@@ emy , Er@@ at@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es , E@@ in@@ stein , things like that .
that means , when your brain is not enough big , when you don 't understand , you go , " Ah , it 's God , it 's God . " that 's ridic@@ ulous .
Gab@@ by G@@ if@@ for@@ ds : yes .
you 've got to find a replacement for me . "
PM : this is a picture of family and friends gathering , but I love these pictures because they show the Gab@@ by and Mark relationship now .
and Gab@@ by , what 's on the agenda now ?
mountains . gor@@ geous mountains .
OK ? you 're nod@@ ding .
and I know many people are going to struggle with that term , " false confession , " and with believing that false confessions actually occur .
and I get that .
B@@ ren@@ dan : like , if his story is , like , different , like I never did nothing or something .
but it 's certainly possible .
of course , che@@ ating is far from murder , and I know that .
therefore we must be saved by that final form of love , which is forgiveness . " thanks .
these two guys shared a similar vision .
turns out , it 's actually significant .
if we make the edges of those pe@@ tals exactly right , if we control their shape , we can control diff@@ r@@ action , and now we have a great shadow .
this looks more like bric@@ k@@ laying than type design , but believe me , this is a good bit@@ map O , for the simple reason that it 's sym@@ metrical in both x and y axes .
that 's a victory . that 's good , right there .
will they out@@ live the now @@@ -@@ @ obsolete screens and the flood of new web fon@@ ts coming on to the market ?
what should I do ? what can I do ?
now this is I@@ TER , pronounced in French : EE @@@ -@@ @ ta@@ ir@@ h .
for example , it took them about three years to decide where to put it .
but you have to compare that to the cost of making Mo@@ ore 's Law .
so finally , most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen , but as a matter of fact , fusion is getting very close .
they said these are path@@ ological curves , and we don 't have to discuss them .
anywhere you go in the Sahel , you 'll see this windscreen .
so all these little P@@ DA@@ s and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa .
science starts with observation , but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence , isolate them , and test them with scientific rig@@ or .
even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago , we 've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I 'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now .
and the image on the left is from our satellite , and we see buildings are being built .
if you took the difference between today 's image and yesterday 's image , you 'd see much of the world news - you 'd see floods and fires and earthquakes .
you see , this will be an entirely new global data set .
they 're not at the top of Mount E@@ ve@@ rest or buried in a gl@@ ac@@ ier .
but why would you want to cool at@@ oms down that much ?
you need context to tell whether you 're hearing Russian , Spanish , or English .
in addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause au@@ tism .
you 're going to f@@ ry them like if they were in a microwave .
the second thing : machine learning .
they are his heart@@ be@@ ats .
the record is always tren@@ ding downward , but it 's punc@@ tu@@ ated by these steep cli@@ ffs .
that is a huge challenge .
all of those things are emer@@ gent properties .
the erup@@ tion of Mount Pin@@ at@@ u@@ bo in 1991 put an enormous amount of aerosols , small particles , into the strat@@ osphere .
models are successful at modeling lake out@@ bursts into the North Atlantic 8,000 years ago .
so what 's the play if you 've landed here and you 're 50 or 55 or 60 ?
do what you need to do to go another round .
first of all , for those of you who are not familiar with my work , I create multicultural characters , so characters from lots of different backgrounds .
and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of appl@@ ause .
of course , I could just make up an answer and you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't know , so I come prepared for that .
where is he , would you stand up , 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit guy ?
so you can actually , honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size .
now , I have to apolog@@ ize to our mag@@ ician friend L@@ enn@@ art Green .
Oh , I did this row already .
Y@@ uck .
so , without any more st@@ alling , here we go .
next , I do 57 squ@@ ared , which is 3,@@ 249 , so I can say , three billion .
thank you .
my mother looked at me and she said , " How did they treat you ? "
now , color blind@@ ness , in my view , do@@ es@@ n 't mean that there 's no racial discrimination , and there 's fairness .
he is the first person to develop a mathematical calculation for diversity .
now , I also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands that this progress will help them , because they 're expecting us to be great role models .
you see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave , it 's wo@@ ven into the fabric of America .
much as the Victor@@ ians f@@ aked their mechanical mar@@ vels , we can add a layer of dec@@ eption to help us feel more comfortable with our robo@@ tic friends .
and now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
it 's very hard to know who needs to have information and who do@@ es@@ n 't .
and he says , " They 're their personnel records . "
so as a consequence , what we did was we changed the idea of information , instead of knowledge is power , to one where sharing is power .
H@@ W : thank you so much . thank you .
I can now tell you that the only thing worse than getting a terrible night 's sleep is to have your smart bed tell you the next day that you " missed your goal and got a low sleep score . "
we were seeing what the IS@@ P could see , but more importantly , what they could sell .
it 's been sampled 5@@ 47 times .
it runs a risk of being completely bl@@ and .
so the most familiar resource for ants is a pic@@ nic , and this is a clu@@ stered resource .
now , we 've seen this before in the savings and loan deb@@ acle , and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders , and that no honest l@@ ender would ever infl@@ ate the appraisal , because it 's the great protection against loss .
the Fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals .
but I asked him , " What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance ? "
he said , " You listened .
this is what suicide does .
and my initial conclusion was that they 're just better people .
it 's hor@@ mon@@ ally supported .
half a second later , I heard du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ h .
ordinary people matter .
fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy do@@ es@@ n 't cook the way that they like their food prepared .
and so we were very happy , thus far .
thank you .
and B , we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tom@@ ato sau@@ ce , then they would embrace it .
then remember those billions of information pac@@ kets ?
as I 've traveled around the world , I 've met many though@@ tful people who have told me that God put fi@@ ref@@ lies on Earth for humans to enjoy .
we can actually see the gift - it 's shown here in red - as it 's being passed from the male to the female .
you might not notice when the first few fl@@ ames fl@@ ick@@ er out , but in the end , you 're left sitting in darkness .
well , we really ought to talk about ar@@ mp@@ its , and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones .
so we asked ourselves , how many countries do we need to focus on , keeping in mind that the European Union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy ?
but in the oceans , we don 't have that war .
which is to say , you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell .
but I was at war with myself , and I du@@ g terrible wounds into my own psych@@ e .
we don 't seek the painful experiences that he@@ w our identities , but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences .
and that 's what they did .
so who can forge meaning and build identity ?
and yet , every step forward is so sweet .
wild tur@@ keys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea ot@@ ters , and pan@@ d@@ as are twice as lo@@ vable as lad@@ y@@ bugs .

science can , in our life@@ times -- even in a decade -- transform what it means to have a specific illness .
but not for all illnesses .
it 's a strategy that has worked again and again and again .
and that challenge is that we 'd like to learn from the bra@@ ins of hundreds of thousands of living people .
and today , it 's increasingly possible to make progress on a scale that was never possible before .
there are hundreds of places in our gen@@ om@@ es that shape risk for brain illnesses , and any one of them could lead us to the next molecular insight about a molec@@ ule that matters .

our medical assistant asked some routine questions .
" let 's get your vital signs " - measure your blood pressure and your heart rate , but let 's also ask something equally as vital to Ver@@ on@@ ica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles .
" Ver@@ on@@ ica , can you tell me about where you live ?

we can see how our ve@@ ins and ar@@ teries are pul@@ sing in our bodies .

shared memories -- that 's where the old BBC building was ; and personal memories -- that 's where I gave my first k@@ iss .
many cou@@ ld@@ n 't use cur@@ sive , could barely print .
that moment made me think a lot that for most of them , it was surely the very first time that someone applauded them for something they had done .
now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999 .
he gradu@@ ted from I@@ owa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country .
so then we said , how many people were executed on March 29 , 1984 ?
so we 're going to focus on Gra@@ ve 15 .

I 'm standing there thinking , " This is very confusing . I don 't know what 's going on . "
so I came home once again and said to my mom , " Dol@@ ly and Gir@@ l@@ friend said I deserve pleasure , that I should be having org@@ as@@ ms , and that white men should figure out how to find the cl@@ itor@@ is . "

weeks later , we met at the local Star@@ buc@@ ks , and I started right in with the tough @@@ -@@ @ love budget conversation .
I know that we can break free from the gri@@ ps of money shame , because I did .

when communities come together with health care workers , work together , that 's when this disease can be stopped .
MS@@ F rapidly set up an Ebola treatment center , as many of you know , in the area .
we know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus and probably sic@@ k@@ ened by it .

the idea is that listening to Moz@@ art makes you s@@ mar@@ ter and improves your performance on I@@ Q tests .
now , what 's also really interesting , that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it .

these c@@ ater@@ pillars did@@ n 't do anything for their own welfare .
so I said , I 'm going to do something else .
and you say , ah , I need some leisure time , and so forth .
why are we building these headquarters ?
and so the courses are World Cup S@@ occer , or building a bicycle .
but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon .
I was aw@@ k@@ ward , insecure , and I h@@ ated it .
that 's huge .
on the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new ty@@ polog@@ ies , new solutions for the way that we live today .
growing up in a family with three generations , I 've always been very close to my grand@@ father .
motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom .

the tor@@ o@@ idal geometry made for a very efficient building : every beam in this building is the same radius , all lam@@ inated wood .
and so I made a counter @@@ -@@ @ proposal : I said , " No building . " there was a cave on the site ; we tunnel into the hill , des@@ cend through the rock into an underground chamber .
let 's get back to the town and walk to the site . "
and this is where it is ; it 's sort of evolving .

regarding her country , which trea@@ sured what has been called the Arab Spring , she said , " I 've always dre@@ am@@ t of discovering a new bacteria .
I said , " You mean he rented all five of them in one hour ? "
she 'll be with us as we drive , she 'll help us manage the children .
five of the grand@@ children are boys .
and my response to that is this : " I don 't have the luxury of being angry , and I also know the consequences of being en@@ ra@@ ged . "
pretty interesting , right ?
we have lots of questions .
but if you want to get somewhere quickly , you now know to set your alarm for 4 : 45 in the morning and you 're all set .
have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF and make sense of it ?
and I thought to myself , typical government response , all right , moved on with my life .
she and her patients experienced something that goes by a number of nam@@ es@@ -- im@@ poster phenomenon , im@@ poster experience , and im@@ poster syndrome .

Rus@@ lan was the most brutal man I ever met .
we wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die .

perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition .
if you examine newspaper or magazine articles , you 'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets P@@ MS .
I 'm not saying women don 't get some of these symptoms .
but it gets strange , because even at that sl@@ ice of reality that we call home , we 're not seeing most of the action that 's going on .
ok@@ ay , just like the movies .
so light and oxygen are polar op@@ pos@@ ites from one another from a chemical point of view , and if we can control spati@@ ally the light and oxygen , we could control this process .
they can 't et@@ ch w@@ af@@ ers that well .

soon he was homeless and 60,000 dollars in medical debt , including a fee for di@@ aling for an ambulance .

America today is a sp@@ rightly young body , hit by one of those strokes that suc@@ ks the life from one side , while leaving the other wor@@ ry@@ ingly perfect .
what I observe is a pair of sec@@ essions from the unifying center of American life .

we found that that was so exciting for folk , and people were so responsive to the work , that we had to then find bigger buildings .
we traveled the country and showed the images , and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path , where I decided to become silent no more , to talk about those things .
I was taken completely by surprise .

we have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly 40 countries .

this guy is an American . his name 's Gra@@ ham All@@ ison .
there 's another country too , and that 's called the U.S.
and worldwide , act further , like you 've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fi@@ sts apart .
but the heart must also find a way to re@@ imagine the possibilities of the America @@@ -@@ @ China relationship , and the possibilities of China 's future engagement in the world .
I think it 's time , across the world , that we 're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind .
Ke@@ pl@@ er is a space teles@@ cope that measures the subtle di@@ m@@ ming of stars as planets pass in front of them , blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us .
together , this helps us understand whether these planets are small and roc@@ ky , like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System , and also how much light they receive from their parent sun .
2014 was the ho@@ tt@@ est year on record .
these planetary @@@ -@@ @ scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly out@@ pac@@ ing our ability to alter their course .
each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Solar System .
Mars is small and roc@@ ky , and though it 's a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habit@@ able world if found by a mission like Ke@@ pl@@ er .
our ro@@ vers , like Cu@@ ri@@ osity , cra@@ wl across its surface , scrat@@ ching for clu@@ es as to the origins of life as we know it .
it is hu@@ bris to believe that inter@@ planetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves , but planetary preservation and inter@@ planetary exploration can work together .

I asked my father if I cried when I was a baby and he says I did not .
and that 's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
but the fact is , it 's because I did@@ n 't draw them on the same scale .
we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency -- basically , young kids and babies , because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation .
and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life , and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us .

when I was 27 , hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was about to be sold to a bro@@ the@@ l made me angry .

so , we have been making progress in our understanding of habit@@ ability , but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on Earth .

she also tells me that her father had affairs , but her mother , she found one little receipt in the pocket , and a little bit of lip@@ stick on the coll@@ ar .
so for the partner who had the affair , for N@@ ick , one thing is to end the affair , but the other is the essential , important act of expressing guilt and re@@ mor@@ se for hur@@ ting his wife .
what were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me ?
in other words , the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage .
the main question that I 've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about inf@@ idel@@ ity is , for or against ?

and while people may have the gen@@ itals of a male or a female , the gen@@ itals don 't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity .
but finally , for 25,000 dollars and agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get , they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug .
they said , " Oh , Mar@@ tine , there 's no medicine for J@@ ene@@ sis .
we either saw the launches from our back@@ yard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape .
it was a four @@@ -@@ @ minute and 27 @@@ -@@ @ second descent .
because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system , we could do it with a ballo@@ on that was five times smaller than that , and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger ballo@@ on .
( la@@ ughter ) So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video , but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release .
actually , what we expect is what we call our next @@@ -@@ @ generation Hu@@ b@@ ble teles@@ cope .
but I did@@ n 't start out wanting to be a part of somebody 's crime reduction strategy .
you would listen in the neighbor@@ hoods on any given night , and to the un@@ trained ear , it s@@ ounded like fire@@ works , but it was gun@@ fire .
I was doing fun@@ erals of 18 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , 17 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , and 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact .
you all have heard of rap music , right ?
and he said , " Don 't do that again , Rev@@ . "
( la@@ ughter ) But I pre@@ ached and I built these programs , and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference .
they met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dor@@ chester , and they were killed .
and as a result of that , we said to them , " How do you see this church , how do you see this institution helping this situation ? "
after 9 / 11 , the F@@ BI was given an e@@ dict : never again .
to do this , agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 inform@@ ants nationwide , all looking for anyone who might be dangerous .
but here 's what 's interesting : the lead under@@ cover agent -- you can see him in this picture with his face blur@@ red -- would go back to the T@@ amp@@ a field office with his recording equipment on .
he 's one of more than 175 so @@@ -@@ @ called terrorists , for whom the F@@ BI has created Hollywood end@@ ings .
how can you back this up ?
I 've got the family , spent the better part of a day talking with them .
I 'm setting it up and I 'm setting up , and the light 's just about to go , and I want it to be golden , I want it to be beautiful .
and they start scre@@ aming , and then one of the men turns around and starts scre@@ aming , shou@@ ting , and the whole tree collap@@ ses , not the tree , but the people in the tree .
what 's your story ? who are you ? "
it was about a boy@@ friend . the girl on the top , she 'd kis@@ sed the wrong boy , and they 'd started having a fight .
I had to get to know every single one of them , right down to whose boy@@ friend is who and who is allowed to k@@ iss who .
I wanted to put these people on a pe@@ de@@ stal .
until , it was quite am@@ using , about a year ago somebody said , " You 've been invited to do a TED Talk . "
he said , " No , a TED Talk . " I said , " But who 's T@@ ed ?
and I thought , ok@@ ay , chief dying , right , you know , look up at the stars again , look at the cam@@ p@@ fire .
let 's find out .
it do@@ es@@ n 't get better than that .
of course babies give toys to their m@@ om@@ mies when they can 't make them work .
human minds generate research and discovery , and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater , and human minds take care of other humans : our old , our young , our sick .
in the years to come , we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even en@@ vision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approxim@@ ating the compu@@ tational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthe@@ size a chro@@ mos@@ ome ?
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
when we first sequ@@ enced this gen@@ ome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we knew there 's a mechanism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here 's an example of it : there 's an organism called De@@ ino@@ coc@@ cus radi@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
here 's an actual micro@@ graph of the molec@@ ule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together automatically .
these are pictures over about a six @@@ -@@ @ second period .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple ; it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
with bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ ea , the chro@@ mos@@ ome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete trans@@ plant of a chro@@ mos@@ ome from one cell to another and activate it .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
U@@ ber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too .
you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
why ?
because she had saved me .
you probably think about a young girl or woman , who 's been brut@@ ally forced into prostitution by a violent p@@ im@@ p .
we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl .
forced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking .
and it 's found in cotton fields , and col@@ tan mines , and even car wash@@ es in Norway and England .
they then located winners of the green card lottery , and they told them , " We 'll help you out .
so what have we done about it ?
having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty , leave abuse , or leave prostitution , if that person so desires .
I 'd like to add one more element to that .
they worked so hard they f@@ ain@@ ted in the fields .
and don 't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you ? "
I found multiple layers of pl@@ au@@ sible den@@ i@@ ability between grow@@ er and distributor and processor , and God knows who else .
a confession : I am an archae@@ ologist and a museum cur@@ ator , but a paradox@@ ical one .
yet these claims p@@ ale in comparison to those made by Native Americans .
in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , anthro@@ polog@@ ists began to collect them as evidence of American Indian religion .
they came to be seen as beautiful , the precursor to the stark sculp@@ tures of Pic@@ as@@ so and Paul Kle@@ e , helping to usher in the modern art movement .
after things were quickly under control , I immediately called a meeting in the school 's aud@@ itorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal .
we took the chains off the front doors of the school .
that brings me to my second slogan : so what ? now what ?
they are clear about my expectations for them , and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.@@ A. system .
then we thought that the Earth is the un@@ moving center of the Universe , again because it looks that way .
then we thought that the Earth is the un@@ moving center of reality because it looks that way .
thank you very much .
so I think that we 'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it .
so class , hopefully you 'll recognize what you just heard me say as the -- ?
right ? this was also known as a mobile phone .
and the val@@ ence is actually quite negative , so you must have been a big fan .
women in their 20@@ s smile a lot more than men the same age , perhaps a necessity for dating .
we are expres@@ sive when we 're em@@ ailing , tex@@ ting , shopping online , or even doing our taxes .
in education , imagine if your learning apps sense that you 're confused and slow down , or that you 're bo@@ red , so it 's sp@@ ed up , just like a great teacher would in a classroom .
so what if I click this down to zero ?
we have a wonderful 14 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter , who did all my illustrations .
you don 't need to worry , though : that I am not fully human is one of the things that my family loves the most about me .
we get there at 10 o 'clock , the scheduled start time , and we are handed number 59 .
there is no middle , there is no gray , just pol@@ arity .
pol@@ arity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other ; a diame@@ tr@@ ical opposition .
but if we are pulled in these two directions , but it 's not really where we exist -- pol@@ arity is not our actual reality -- where do we go from there ?
can we have the courage to hold both things ?
her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico .
( la@@ ughter ) That line actually went the other way .
but we were united by our similarities , not separated by our differences .
she left , did the same thing -- it was a 10 @@@ -@@ @ second conversation , such a short interaction .
it was@@ n 't Jesus or As@@ h .
or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective ?
now , when you put all of this together , what you get is something called social capital .
I have passionate opinions about gender equality , but I worry that to freely accept the label of " femin@@ ist , " would not be fair to good fem@@ ini@@ sts .
( la@@ ughter ) So , what started as a bit of an inside jo@@ ke with myself and a will@@ ful provocation , has become a thing .
( la@@ ughter ) Th@@ ink about it .
so over the next eight years , Bon@@ ica would talk about it .
K@@ anner knew about this competing paper , but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work .
bacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes .
and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality .
now , conventional wisdom would say that we 'll just take these driver assistance systems and we 'll kind of push them and incre@@ mentally improve them , and over time , they 'll turn into self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars .
similarly , the orange box on the side here , it 's a school bus , and we have to treat that differently as well .
and when a police officer stood in the road , our vehicle should understand that this means stop , and when they signal to go , we should continue .
Cap@@ t A : listen ... saving that k@@ id is all that matters .
maybe there 's something we can learn here .

as a four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child , it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine .
age 10 , it was saving my school dinner money change .
every single day for eight years , I had m@@ ashed potato and ba@@ ked beans , which cost 4@@ p each , and gra@@ vy was free .
I felt like my life depended on that moment , and incredibly , he said yes .
after three months at sea , age just 24 , I finished in second position .
materials would be defined as either technical or biological , waste would be designed out entirely , and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term .
all of this sounds amazing , but these are@@ n 't just ideas , they 're real today , and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy .
so how would you shift from linear to circular ?
I believe yes .
the pick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players , two on offense and two on defense .
it turns out in modern basketball , this pick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ roll is perhaps the most important play .
and knowing how to run it , and knowing how to defend it , is basically a key to winning and losing most games .
it would make our lives a lot easier , but it turns out movement is very mess@@ y .
coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations .
can it know more than person could know ?
we can look at all their vel@@ o@@ cities and we can build a model that predic@@ ts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances ?
( la@@ ughter ) Those are N@@ BA players .
people who are good are at the top , bad at the bottom .
Miami was down by three , there was 20 seconds left .
a gent@@ l@@ eman named Le@@ Br@@ on James came up and he took a three to tie .
and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second , and the likelihood of them getting a re@@ bound at every second can illumin@@ ate this moment in a way that we never could before .
down three .
[ calculating shot probability ] [ S@@ hot quality ] [ Re@@ bound probability ] W@@ on 't go !

( la@@ ughter ) That 's roughly how it happened .
( appl@@ ause ) So when the bill passed , we tex@@ ted them back , " Than@@ k you for supporting the bill . "
now , in Malawi , 18 is the legal marriage age , from 15 to 18 .
we can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain .
we can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people .
and these are actually 15 different ty@@ polog@@ ies I 've been collecting over time , and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new met@@ aph@@ or .
you probably cou@@ ld@@ n 't find more dispar@@ ate topics , yet they are using the same met@@ aph@@ or , the same visual model , to map the never @@@ -@@ @ ending complexities of its own subject .
but networks are not just a scientific met@@ aph@@ or .
this is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement .
how would I know what the right decision was ?
coming of age on the beaches of Southern California , I grew up in the middle of our nation 's abortion wars .
I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Ro@@ e vs. W@@ ade .
everyone was pro @@@ -@@ @ life .
and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life .
the first thing we did was create a talk @@@ -@@ @ line , where women and men could call to get emotional support .
Je@@ an@@ ie , Will and Ad@@ ina are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship .
we often think that as we age , we lose the desires held in our youth .
I did@@ n 't do it as well , but we managed to get Y@@ ous@@ so@@ u N '@@ D@@ our , S@@ ting , T@@ racy Cha@@ p@@ man , and Bru@@ ce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en to go ' round the world for Amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
at first , we were safe in the camp .
but later the government soldiers began mi@@ stre@@ ating us a lot .
so it 's not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it 's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously cou@@ ld@@ n 't be presented before .
the two @@@ -@@ @ headed sli@@ der is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds , in forward or reverse .
he says , " Well , reading is this jun@@ k they give me in little books to read .

but that 's just not the case .
people have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for mill@@ enn@@ ia .
and the idea is that what 's true for a person will also be true for the white rat .
well , the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find un@@ ner@@ ving about them .
people would admit sha@@ me@@ ful secrets about themselves , and other people would say , " Oh my God , I 'm exactly the same . "
I think they were clu@@ eless : I think this was a unique moment when the beautiful n@@ ai@@ ve@@ ty of Twitter was hitting the increasingly hor@@ rific reality .
J@@ us@@ tine was fired , of course , because social media demanded it .
and of course , that 's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for , like having children out of wedlock .
what 's true is that we are cle@@ ver and stupid ; what 's true is that we 're grey areas .
( la@@ ughter ) The key phrase is " was , " phe@@ w .
imagine what it would be like if the English alphabet had four letters .
I don 't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras , which are recording what I 'm saying .
human rights , just like God and heaven , are just a story that we 've invented .
( la@@ ughter ) To conclude , then : we humans control the world because we live in a dual reality .
when I rented a gun , the gent@@ l@@ eman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind , until I showed him my New York City driver 's license .
the reality is that many white Americans are aff@@ able and kind .

in the US , the average American spends three percent of their income on energy .
look -- given our rockets to Mars and our pocket @@@ -@@ @ sized AI , we have the tools to address these systemic inequities .
cost of rene@@ wa@@ bles , insulation , micro@@ grids and smart home technology are all decreasing .
our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities , utilities and government agencies alike to provide equitable access to clean energy , energy efficiency and energy technology .
in fact , there is a 47 @@@ -@@ @ billion @@@ -@@ @ dollar home @@@ -@@ @ energy affordability gap , so assistance alone is not sustainable .
but for this pill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stomach , intestin@@ es and various other organs first .
one day , I sat and thought , " Can we deliver anti @@@ -@@ @ HIV directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? "
before you even know it , the induced hole becomes immediately repaired .
so , after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call -- anytime , anywhere -- you might imagine that government officials are not very happy .
and so , my message to you is this : we need to use these tools .
and what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood .
and by and large , factors that we know are required for the development of tissues , for the maintenance of tissues -- they start to decrease as we get older , while factors involved in repair , in injury and in inflammation -- they increase as we get older .
and what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group , about half the factors changed significantly .
and the way this looks is shown in this graph .
so in our lab , we 're trying to understand these factors better , and many other groups are trying to understand , what are the true aging factors , and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age @@@ -@@ @ related diseases ?
so to summarize , we find the old mouse , and its brain in particular , are m@@ alle@@ able .
young blood factors can reverse aging , and what I did@@ n 't show you -- in this model , the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old .
zoom in a bit more .
watch the two white balls .
we still don 't know yet how important it is ; this is still an open question .
it 's an object that beha@@ ves like a wave , so that it do@@ es@@ n 't just move in one direction or the other , but can follow multiple pathways at the same time .

and of course now they have relatively quie@@ ter bar nights .
that 's why the NY@@ PD , along with other departments throughout the United States , are training all of their officers in implicit bias .
that 's another key component .
and number three : we must also make sure that truth and telling facts is painful .

it 's very remote , it 's very dry and it 's very beautiful .
we have an array of existing teles@@ cop@@ es already , in the An@@ des mountains in Chile , and that 's soon to be joined by a really sens@@ ational array of new capability .

( appl@@ ause ) It also includes a number of institutions across the United States , including Harvard University , the S@@ mi@@ th@@ s@@ onian and the Car@@ ne@@ gie Institutions , and the Universities of Ari@@ z@@ ona , Chicago , Texas @@@ -@@ @ Austin and Texas A & amp ; M University .
this happens under@@ ne@@ ath the football stadium at the University of Ari@@ z@@ ona .
it 's tuc@@ ked away under 5@@ 2,000 seats .
it 's what allows us to have the precision that we will have .
what gets measured gets done .
so you have to keep on top of the business .
and in fact , bringing science into the investing world has improved that world .
( appl@@ ause ) CA : J@@ im , here 's another project that you 've supported philanthro@@ p@@ ically : research into origins of life , I guess .
JS : well , I 'll save that for a second .
and what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live .
there are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness , and into ever older age .
( appl@@ ause ) So you can have a law , but it 's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it .
so both men and women got a lot out of it , but different things .
if you need some inspiration to jo@@ g your memory , read Oc@@ ta@@ via But@@ ler 's " Par@@ able of the S@@ ower . "

now remember , I was the only man in this group , so when I witnessed this , I went , " Oh no . "
( la@@ ughter ) So let me be very clear : white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world .
their children have lower rates of absen@@ te@@ e@@ ism , higher rates of achievement .
so the store actually did really well .
but it brought in so many people -- teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody -- because it was street level . it was open to the public .
so they opened this place . inside , it 's like a Co@@ st@@ co for super@@ heroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form .
there are a million ways .
so , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomen@@ al job .
if you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who 's our director of national programs . he 'll be on the phone .
and he 'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
by yourself ?
so the article was published online on a Friday evening , and by Saturday , this had happened to the traffic on my blog .
I understand that this is part of the deal .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's an issue for all of us , and it 's an issue where we need more and more momentum .
and that 's what we have to do .
and then what happened ?
and I got total pop@@ si@@ cle head , if anyone 's ever sw@@ am in the Bay , and I 'm trying to just th@@ aw my face out , and I 'm watching people finish .
this was not fatigue .
how can a human being come from a concept ?
" I 'm not a national , " I proclaimed on@@ stage .
even that most glorious expression of country@@ hood , the World Cup , gives us national teams comprised mostly of multi@@ local players .
and here 's the day that it finally worked : [ video : ( Mac Stone nar@@ rating ) After setting up the platform , I look off and I see a k@@ ite coming over the cat@@ tails .
each man 's head was h@@ acked off in turn and held up to the crowd .
let 's look at our own history and our own cultural fasc@@ ination with these things .
but I di@@ gress .
more and more these days , di@@ gres@@ sion seems the most direct route through from where I 've lost or found myself out of place , mind , turn , time .

my body@@ guard got out , said , " I can answer you .
and if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
while in hospital , I desper@@ ately wanted to go home .
my parents were told I was as good as not there .
a vegetable , having the intelligence of a three @@@ -@@ @ month @@@ -@@ @ old baby .
my parents , in fact my entire family 's lives , became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how .
my personality was ent@@ om@@ bed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a ch@@ ry@@ sal@@ is .
no one would ever love me .
the first time it happened , I was shocked and filled with dis@@ belief .
how could they do this to me ?
there was no one to comfort me .
as I learned how the shad@@ ows moved as the hours of the day passed , I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home .
I began to resha@@ pe my destiny .
it can cause upset , it could cause cost .
all they hear is that they 're going to have to choose .
it 's a mou@@ thful to say .
Sha H@@ wan@@ g and Rac@@ hel B@@ in@@ x drew from their shared interests in carto@@ graphy , data visu@@ alization , travel , mathematics and design , when they founded M@@ esh@@ u .

you might think this is not much , compared to the billions of ne@@ ur@@ ons we have .
so why are these new ne@@ ur@@ ons important and what are their functions ?
and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new ne@@ ur@@ ons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , then we block certain memory abilities .
and this is especially new and true for spatial recognition -- so like , how you navigate your way in the city .
but moreover , if you just block neuro@@ gene@@ sis , then you block the efficacy of the anti@@ de@@ pres@@ sant .
ST : no , you don 't !
whether he ruled anyone , or even lived at all is , unfortunately , less clear .
your early investors are going to be really excited .
I was a first @@@ -@@ @ time founder .
and I think it in@@ spi@@ res a tough question : what 's our goal with entrepreneurship ?
for the first time , IC@@ Os had raised more money for young star@@ tu@@ ps than venture capital had .
and I believe that 's way more exciting than just trying to invest in the next billion @@@ -@@ @ dollar startup .
could we impl@@ ant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing ?
so let me end with some thoughts about model building .
why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago ?
what if we could create personal micro@@ biom@@ es that would scan our sk@@ ins , repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies ?
and this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision @@@ -@@ @ free manner .
and in a minute you 'll see it enter our lab , which is recogn@@ izable by the clu@@ tter that you see .
( la@@ ughter ) And I want to show you an example .
( la@@ ughter ) Just 6@@ 2.4 . just a tiny increase .
so what 's going on ?
but as you saw already , there is actually lots of noise around this trend line .
if we rely on economic growth alone , we 're going to get to 6@@ 2.4 .
and now let 's be even b@@ older still .

now , I 'm not saying whether you should take the st@@ atin or not .
you don 't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
so we launched Crisis Text Line , very quietly , in Chicago and El Pas@@ o -- just a few thousand people in each market .

M@@ organ was by no means the only word@@ sm@@ ith to share his work with me in this way .
the books I read that year opened my eyes to many things .
and it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world .
so we have all this , so why don 't we have the personal robot ?
so we have to lay the boundaries , the rules of engagement , before we actually start designing .
so I believe that the way to make robots s@@ mar@@ ter is to m@@ im@@ ic people .
I never thought I 'd have to understand things like child psychology , infant development .

now , today this do@@ es@@ n 't make any sense , because they are providing a global public good .
we have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying , for instance , that Muslims refugees should not be received .

to shift its electr@@ ons from the ground state to a higher level , a molec@@ ule needs to gain a certain amount of energy .
it gets that energy from light , which comes in more energy levels than you could count .
one that do@@ es@@ n 't appear to be emitting light at all : Earth .
it 's the same energy , but at a higher or lower level .
the second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regener@@ ated it algorith@@ m@@ ically , according to methods that I 'll describe a little bit later on .
so my final insight is that the computer , more or less , works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it .
this is an essentially philosophical idea , and it 's one that can 't be answered with software alone , but I think requires a moment of species @@@ -@@ @ wide , exi@@ st@@ ential reflection .

this mode of listening ties in with our suscep@@ tibility to musical ear wor@@ ms , where segments of music bur@@ row into our head , and play again and again , as if stuck on repeat .
critics are often embar@@ ras@@ sed by music 's repeti@@ tiveness , finding it chil@@ dish or regres@@ sive , but repetition , far from an embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment , is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience we think about as musical .
small things , like at@@ oms or electr@@ ons though , can have wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths big enough to measure in physics experiments .
we can know a particles position very well , but it do@@ es@@ n 't have a wa@@ vel@@ ength , so we don 't know its momentum .
by combining waves with different wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths , which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different moment@@ a .
the result has regions where we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all .

until then , the cat is a bl@@ ur of probability , half one thing and half the other .
we don 't see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wa@@ vel@@ ength decreases as the momentum increases .

and the funny thing is they call me Mr. R@@ amb@@ o in Gaza .
and there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing -- uncontrolled money printing -- leading to hyper@@ inflation .
and , as we 've learned with the money @@@ -@@ @ printing schemes , whatever concerns we have can be al@@ la@@ yed by rules .
it 's very well known . I 'm not going to spend a lot of time on those .
we currently have three locations in the Caribbean , and we 're planning a fourth one .
Africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to Africa .
an under@@ graduate can do it .
OK , so where does this leave us ?
that would be a game @@@ -@@ @ changing technology , right ?
I 'd say , " I don 't know ! "
and today , I 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made .
and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age .
are you ready ?
can they detect children 's lies ?
the lights were too bright .
everyone understands the situation they 're all in .
if prohibition is this harmful , you might ask , why it so popular ?
well , lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking .
but we need more allies .
see , now most people , especially TED people , would have run to the mailbox , right ?
that 's 162 faces , which is precisely how many the cu@@ bes have in total .
and we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .

how can that be ?
they were so weak from the treatment I had given them .
but here 's the thing : we 're already doing this in a limited way , and it 's already starting to make a big difference .
and my mother was selling the furniture , because we were leaving -- she did@@ n 't want to stay in that state of shame , in Chel@@ sea , Massachusetts .
NL : benefit in that it gave me that spr@@ ing@@ board .
the truth was my grand@@ father took me to par@@ ades , we had lots of those .
NL : here 's where my mind goes when I hear that rec@@ itation of all I accomplished .
which we 're trying to save and it requires saving .
anything I may have accomplished is -- my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in New@@ ington , Connecticut .
each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes .
and I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape .
they would walk up , take a picture , and then walk away .

what if we could re@@ imagine ways to help make your medicine @@@ -@@ @ taking easier ?
so instead of taking six medications , for example , I could integrate them into one .
I can now -- The automated process would rotate and cycle through , to make sure the micro@@ me@@ ds are loaded .
and this could evolve , I think , into an incredible way to improve adherence in medications across the globe .
these are@@ n 't going to evolve and start with printers on your bathroom counter .
how is this possible ?
you 're either on , and you 're connected and distr@@ acted all the time , or you 're off , but then you 're won@@ dering , am I missing something important ?
Th@@ ich N@@ hat Han@@ h is an international spokesperson for mind@@ fulness meditation .
now to do this you also need a new system , because you 're probably thinking , today 's Internet economy -- today 's economy in general -- is measured in time spent .
we solved it with organic , when we said we need to value things a different way .
we solved it with LE@@ ED Certification , where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustainability .
and what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that 's driven and run entirely on time spent , to world that 's driven by time well spent .
and addressing these non @@@ -@@ @ obvious core issues became a key part of the program .

one of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we 've discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
I 'll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
well , we had a long time to come up with good analog@@ ies .
there 's another issue , which is that the forces in nature -- it 's quite beautiful , actually -- seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
and I 'd say that it deserves , in the spirit of W@@ ade Dav@@ is ' talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high An@@ des and the frozen north .

I have a forest in the back@@ yard of my own house .

thank you .
when you think about it , using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done .
if you can do that , it 'll help other people see you that way , too .
now , of our three stories , this one probably surprised me the most , since as you all know , the country is still struggling with so many problems .
so what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability , and it 's not circumstances .
there 's no way that could go wrong !

voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had .
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined , and can be re@@ imagined .
and the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it 's so harmful .
but there 's another really interesting aspect of this , and this is that if you could control the evolution of vi@@ rul@@ ence , evolution of harm@@ fulness , then you should be able to control antibio@@ tic resistance .

so as we began to build these types of systems , we began to test them on ourselves in our research group .
we have no such anch@@ ors and benchmarks for decisions in mess@@ y human affairs .
I got in touch with my soul .
when we behave viol@@ ently towards robots , specifically robots that are designed to m@@ im@@ ic life , is that a healthy outlet for violent behavior or is that training our cruelty muscles ?
" yes , we understand the definition .

and that 's going to happen unless they have a better alternative .

it 's in legal offices , where it 's used to go through legal evidence better than a human par@@ al@@ aw@@ yer .
but it 's more than that .
so let me talk about those three different aspects .
we tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension , that it 's kind of like a note that gets lou@@ der and lou@@ der .
and this single I@@ Q intelligence is getting greater and greater .
innovation by definition is inefficient , because you make proto@@ types , because you try stuff that fails , that do@@ es@@ n 't work .

they were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug that they actually just listed it as a side effect , an adverse side effect .
and in depression and PT@@ SD -- here we have your stress exposure -- we only have pal@@ li@@ ative care .
anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants only suppress symptoms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the length of your own life .
we tried Pro@@ z@@ ac as well , and that had no effect .
if we had discovered ket@@ am@@ ine as a par@@ av@@ acc@@ ine first , it 'd be pretty easy for us to develop it , but as is , we have to compete with our functional fix@@ ed@@ ness and mental set that kind of interfere .
and we may find ourselves in that reality , and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today .
now , before I go on , some of you may hold up your hands and say , " Stop , Paul , wait a minute .
I also think it 's not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification .

( la@@ ughter ) Here 's the broader point .
right ? is this time different ?
the atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that 's seen here from the International Space Station , a photograph that some astr@@ onau@@ ts took .
Cher@@ yl talked about how , by the time Monday came , her kids ' hunger pan@@ gs were so intense that they cou@@ ld@@ n 't even begin to think about learning .

( in a lowered voice ) It has another quite surprising quality .
the images that more readily come to mind are things like ret@@ re@@ ating gl@@ aci@@ ers and polar bears ad@@ ri@@ ft on ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack to themselves .
so , I had this w@@ ish@@ bone , and I thought , it 's kind of like a co@@ w@@ boy who 's been on his horse for too long .
the result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony .

it 's called the S@@ any@@ u@@ an Bridge .
and just to remind you if you do , this won 't be the first time .
now , there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work .
would you cross this bridge ?
what 's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design , make and use .
where we 're moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown .
even our prejudices were alike .
the people who sent hate mails are workers , husbands , wives , parents like you and me .
but when I asked , " What about you ?
and finally , remember to finish the conversation in a positive way because you are going to meet again .
we hang out only with people who think like us and talk about the others in a category of dis@@ d@@ ain .
when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they 're finding , I believe that there are millions of un@@ discovered archaeological sites left to find .
we looked at open @@@ -@@ @ source data and mapped the entirety of looting across Egypt from 2002 to 2013 .
of course I agreed , but I did@@ n 't think we 'd find anything .
a hundred years ago , archae@@ ology was for the rich .

I wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people , not just the 49 percent who can get the numbers .
( la@@ ughter ) Ac@@ tually , in Ex@@ e@@ ter , it 's incredibly young , and I had underestimated the impact of the university in this area .

I never expected to be described by my own government in these terms : " l@@ ur@@ king , " " nef@@ arious , " " terrorist . "
I know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated I was because of my race -- and yes , I don 't think I would 've been detained if I were white .
rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers .

after all , shou@@ ld@@ n 't we include end users in the design process ?
adult planners marvel@@ ed at the students ' ideas as they shared a park constructed out of a j@@ el@@ ly brac@@ el@@ et .
and then , public art constructed from animal @@@ -@@ @ shaped plastic be@@ ads .
so if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaper food venues , we meet the needs of many other populations , too .
but most importantly , the blame transferred from Th@@ ord@@ is to me .

what I do think is a serious problem is when people share private images of others without their permission .
in the 1950s , seat belts .
and we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas .
and in a lot of states , you 're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim .
Jenn@@ if@@ er started missing school and her grades dropped .
ultimately , Jenn@@ if@@ er decided to end her own life .

there 's a growing body of research examining the relationship between chronic stress and illness .
but it turns out that the kind of stress we experience and whether we 're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough to keep our bodies working properly depends a lot on who we are .
in certain parts of the country , particularly the De@@ ep South , the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in Sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan African .
even nationally , black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women .
but here 's the thing : this problem , that racism is making people of color , but especially black women and babies , sick , is vast .
I could spend all of my time with you talking about it , but I won 't , because I want to make sure to tell you about one solution .
lastly , when you finally are called back to see the provider , you 've already taken your own weight in the waiting room , and done your own pe@@ e test in the bathroom .
this is a big departure from the traditional medical model , because it places responsibility and information back in the woman 's hands .
and that support provides a crucial buffer to the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day .
well , The J@@ J Way has almost entirely eliminated those problems , starting with what Jenn@@ ie calls " sk@@ in@@ ny babies . "
the beauty of Jenn@@ ie 's model is that she actually believes it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting .
they involve elaborate physiological mechanisms meant to protect us , that , when over@@ stimulated , actually make us sick .
we want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions is an integral part of their mission .
actually , it is .
it do@@ es@@ n 't care about the consequences because it can 't , because it 's just information being copied .
I have no idea .
it looks like the kind of thing we do .
current R@@ ow @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ ts contain things like toxic batteries .
how will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race ?
those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world @@@ -@@ @ makers who own and master time .
I fear that the future of our internet is out of our control .
what if I told you that our definition of " good person " is so narrow , it 's scientifically impossible to meet ?
Governments must create a safer internet by ensuring enforcement and up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date rules .
everyone was sharing this list of scripts that everyone had said that they loved , reading them and then loving them themselves .
production costs alone or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country .
so no wonder more and more authority is shifting from us to the algorithms .
and that should not be impossible , because people can have several layers of loyalty .
we look at these other groups which have formed which go outside of national bounds but still represent significant authorities .
and that that 's actually spar@@ ked a lot of the anger .
ca : well , depending on how things go , we may all be back in the forest soon .
Y@@ N@@ H : I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair , and that we should realize that .
if we don 't have a global governance , and if we suffer from climate change , from technological disruptions , the worst suffering will not be in the US .
you can use the same technology to create very different kinds of societies .
the trains did not tell you what to do with them .

( la@@ ughter ) And he said , " Women don 't do these things .

now I know that 's not enough .
and then I met Yo@@ yo , who is the native Rap@@ a Nu@@ i @@@ -@@ @ an guide , and if you look at Yo@@ yo 's face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
another thing I do is I inv@@ ent stuff .
it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extrater@@ re@@ stri@@ als in a very scientific way .
now , just five years ago , I really had no clu@@ e about ph@@ ages .
so living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together and have a totally different perspective , just like the couple of people I mentioned earlier in my stories .
there is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs .
140 million Americans voted for the next president of the United States , and yet , as all of us knows , in a few weeks time , somebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes to Donald J. Trump .
in fact , I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates .
some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine .
it has some background .
people need to take their medication so that they 're cured , and so that they don 't get other people sick .
so I believe he was listening to her before that speech .

it 's no@@ stal@@ gic ; it 's for the past .

and I teach at Y@@ ale .
GC : see , I understand how that happened .
ca : do you think enough of his supporters have a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ...
according to a lot of research , one of the best weapons is gratitude .
so knowing this , I started a new tradition in our house a couple of years ago .
then one day , my 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old son said , " You know , D@@ ad , those people are@@ n 't in our apartment .
I 'm not talking about claims like , " 9 out of 10 women recommend this anti @@@ -@@ @ aging cream . "
this is a total disaster .
if we don 't have this data , how can we observe discrimination , let alone fix it ?
one poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support ji@@ had , which is obviously pretty sc@@ ary , and it was reported everywhere in 2015 .
( la@@ ughter ) This was just the beginning of my team 's science project .
and when they came back and told us about it , we really started thinking about the ways in which we see Sty@@ ro@@ foam every day .

( la@@ ughter ) Diffe@@ rent types of images have very distinct features .
it 's part of the case file .
knowing how to do something is one thing , knowing how to take care of yourself is another .
how do we teach our kids to be safe online when we don 't have either ?
today , I use it .
the key was to overcome the initial shock and do something new .
what kind of information do you share ?
those kids need to know what the risks of being online are , how to take care of themselves , but also that , fundamentally , as with almost everything else , kids can learn this from any adult .
gro@@ oming shows us this in the most painful way : by involving our kids .
all of these researchers were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting bl@@ acks , but they provided no evidence .
this scale cap@@ tures ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not value is ch@@ ip@@ ped away on a daily basis .
this was true for all kinds of medical treatment , from the most simple to the most technologically sophisticated .
it is a subtle process , but it 's normal and it occurs even among the most well @@@ -@@ @ inten@@ tioned individuals .
there is institutional discrimination , which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions .

I know young women who are under so much pressure from family , from friends , even from work to get married , and they 're pushed to make terrible choices .
both men and women in Nigeria will say -- this is an expression I 'm very am@@ used by -- " I did it for peace in my marriage . "
they grow up to be women who silence themselves .
gender and class are different forms of oppression .
but also , culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people .
I have to think in a totally new way to do it , but I love it .
our video game was our attempt to share that world with people who had@@ n 't experienced it before , because we never could imagine that world until it became ours .
and I drew this sketch , something with two layers , transl@@ uc@@ ent with structure in between capturing light .
you all know this crazy search , letting the process take you , and you live for the surprises .
it let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them .

I have a loving , supportive family and incredibly loyal friends , yet I could not enter@@ tain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain .
globally , 75 percent of all mental illness cases can be found in low @@@ -@@ @ income countries .
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .
it can be for profit or not profit . it can be large or small .
right ? how do you capture that ?
( la@@ ughter ) I needed a better plan .
and in the spr@@ ing@@ time , those animals have babies .
how in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters ?

so I 'm g@@ onn@@ a take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence .
the human hand , in manipulation of objects , is the hand in search of a brain ; the brain is in search of a hand ; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way .
nobody mis@@ ses that dog I took a picture of on a Car@@ mel beach a couple of weeks ago .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
and I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly , " It 's really important to have a lot of data . "
it 's not just a whole lot of other plants .
by the time they 're 18 years old , 93 percent of first year college males and 62 percent of females have seen pornography at least once .
now , what the scientists are telling us we need to do over the next 80 @@@ -@@ @ odd years to the end of this century , is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by three percent every year , and draw three gig@@ at@@ ons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year .
it does , it 's one of the best options , but there are many , many possibilities .
direct air capture is a great example of a chemical path@@ way , and people are using that right now to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and manufacture biofuels or manufacture plastics .
you know , if we could cover nine percent of the world 's ocean in sea@@ weed farms , we could draw down the equivalent of all of the greenhouse gases we put up in any one year , more than 50 gig@@ at@@ ons .
how many ocean @@@ -@@ @ going sea@@ weed farms do we actually have out there ?
there 's no nutrients there that were used up long ago .
and with just a little bit of clean , renewable energy , you can pump that water up and use the nutrients in it to irrig@@ ate your sea@@ weed crop .
so I think this really has so many benefits .
and then came the internet , and the market exploded .
our dream was an alarm bell on the desks of officers all around the world so that if anyone dare post a new victim online , someone would start looking for them immediately .
this aud@@ acious commitment is part of that will .
they find an audience pri@@ med to believe them .
no way to explo@@ de a star in a lab to figure out why or how it ble@@ w up .
imagine the cost .
our subjects doubled their che@@ ating .
but in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
so , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
when we get bigger distance from che@@ ating , from the object of money , for example , people che@@ at more .
what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
and the difficulty of testing our in@@ tuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them .
so on my birthday , what did I do ?
and I feel like every day that I 'm speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me , I feel like I 'm falling out of that plane .
and TAP Pl@@ as@@ tics made me -- although I did@@ n 't photograph it -- a museum Vit@@ rine .
this access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented .
it gave people amazing content around the globe .
let 's try taking a seat by one of those cam@@ p@@ fires right now .
700 people that way -- but it 's great and really it 's just -- ES : so Co@@ h@@ h , what is going on in chat right now ?
as these pictures show , the gri@@ eving heart in the middle looks very different than the normal heart on the left .
both groups were fed a high @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ ole@@ ster@@ ol diet .
political carto@@ ons were born with democracy , and they are challenged when freedom is .
two in particular are iron and zinc .
there 's about one billion people who are zinc deficient .
and it 's not just us .
cattle are already being affected because the quality of their for@@ age is declining .
and , of course , it will be very helpful to know how these changes could affect our future health and the health of our children and the health of our grand@@ children .
let 's invest in ourselves , in our children and in our planet .
it 's the only Spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
anybody who was anybody had an apartment there .
and f@@ aux @@@ -@@ @ no@@ st@@ alg@@ ia works even in serious subjects like war .
this is the only fashion cover I 've ever done .
and so we proposed what 's at the lower diagram .
it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere , wherever you place it , the area under it is charged for theat@@ rical performances .
I 've had a heart for , like , 40 years now .
and of course , when I think of Monday , I 'll think of " Man@@ ic Monday " by the Bang@@ les . it 's a good song .
and public spending is not going up nearly fast enough .
I quickly took down the number , because it said " flexible hours , " and I needed that to work around my basketball schedule .
why would it be looking for human fingers if it 's trying to identify a fish ?
but what it looks like happened is the AI was trained to recognize trucks on highway driving , where you would expect to see trucks from behind .
my great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ father made a living gra@@ fting pe@@ ach or@@ ch@@ ards in Sou@@ the@@ a@@ stern Pennsylvania .
so this is of course Or@@ ville and Wil@@ bu@@ r W@@ right , and the W@@ right F@@ ly@@ er .
with this factory and 100,000 planes a year , we could make all of America 's electricity in about 10 years .
and it also has one of the higher productivity rates as well .
once upon a time , I was a stub@@ born five @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old who decided to become a marine bi@@ ologist .
and when you think about the issue of the border , I have more border than any other member of Congress .
so the question , then , is why does the administration continue to do it , when we 've seen 900 additional children separated from their parents since the summer of 2018 ?
I think we need more immigration judges in order to process these cases , and I think we need to ensure that fol@@ ks can get representation .
the world is in turmoil : robots have taken over , and only Eth@@ ic can set things right .
and this is for good reason : deep @@@ -@@ @ sea ven@@ ts are well @@@ -@@ @ known in the ancient rock record , and it 's thought that the early Earth had a global ocean and very little land surface .
if the rocks could talk , I suspect they might say this : life on Earth is precious .
on the second of July , 2015 , his life was cut short when he was killed by a tro@@ phy hun@@ ter .
this is quite common in Zimbabwe , as many people are not exposed to wildlife , even though it 's part of our heritage .
I made a commitment that day that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals .
thank you .
I 've heard there 's something new -- a million times more rad than my phone .
I want to say , " Lo@@ ok -- now I 'm cool " I stood in line and I 'll get mine .
who ca@@ res if it 's AT & amp ; T ?
that wa@@ vel@@ ength is called far @@@ -@@ @ U@@ VC light , and it 's just the short @@@ -@@ @ wa@@ vel@@ ength part of the ultra@@ violet spectrum .
and there 's a good , solid physics reason for that : far @@@ -@@ @ U@@ VC light is incredibly , strongly absorbed by all biological materials , so it simply can 't go very far .
one stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming in the last sort of 15 , 20 years generally don 't stop .
as you 've been walking through that world , we 've been cle@@ ver@@ ly causing the parts of it that you 're not in to van@@ ish , and the parts of it in front of you to appear .
and this is my personal favorite .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with HIV .
fortunately , I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that 's the only way that this work can really occur .
and that was some outreach .
and it da@@ wned on me , as we were there , I 'm going like , " Here we are in the seat of Mother Africa , and we 're trying to teach these people how to dance ? "
what I want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
we work in clay , which h@@ as@@ n 't changed much since Michel@@ angel@@ o started scre@@ wing around with it , and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too .
OK , it 's not marketing ; there 's a very interesting car concept here , but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here .
to@@ oth@@ brush , cool .
and so I had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
and so , in conclusion , my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you , was this one here . I 'm also going to steal a little quote out of " Little Prince . "
and there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstr@@ action .
and , lastly , under " Harmony , " they had this 13th @@@ -@@ @ century man@@ d@@ ala from Tibet .
you know , that 's not a big deal to accomplish .
and he took it upon himself to print 5@@ 5,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stic@@ kers , large ones and small ones .
that scene sounds like science fiction , but is battlefield reality already .
the soldier in that case was a 42 @@@ -@@ @ pound robot called a Pack@@ Bo@@ t .
and the tech term " kill@@ er application " takes on new meaning in this space .
the U.S. is currently ahead in military robo@@ tics right now , but we know that in technology there 's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .
or another way of thinking about this is , what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India ?
they also record everything that they see .
they lose the strategy .
my story begins when I opened the holy book for the first time ...
you can -- if you love anything , you can work hard and you can accomplish anything you want .
so I 'd get this beta software and hardware from places like HP and Sun and Rus@@ sell Brown at Adobe .
and I had no manual , so I 'd figure it out and I fell in love with it even more .
and then a couple years ago , I felt a little bit lost , cre@@ atively .
I felt lucky to be here , but at this moment , I realized that I was not just lucky to be here , I had the right to be here .
it became more physical when I went to the movie theater .
I got to be who I wanted to be when I needed to be it .
and as I was doing the finishing touches on this talk , I realized that all the powerful connections in my life were through generosity and kindness and love and hope .
and they will continue to circulate in the blood , giving them more time to find the tumor .
and here we see the cancer drug , the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters , inside the fire truck , the nan@@ op@@ articles .
and those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what , to me , is really his greatest building which is a building in Dha@@ ka , Bangladesh .
and this is the largest project he has got in here , the poorest country in the world .
but I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that 's why , he has given love for us .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
w@@ ow . ( laugh@@ s ) And si@@ gh , and , who@@ o , going to get blown away there .
( la@@ ughter ) But it is really incredible , and when we do this , what we find is that these dogs can correctly tell us when somebody is infected with malaria 81 percent of the time .
and if you cou@@ ld@@ n 't predict , you died .
if you 're a conservative , you become more conservative .
and it 's the experience of a@@ we .
well , others have demonstrated , for instance , Prof@@ essors Ha@@ id@@ t and Kel@@ t@@ ner , have told us that people feel small but connected to the world .
they actually seek risk , and they are better able at taking it .
they were more likely to give a positive response after the performance than they were [ before ] .
and the results are actually incredibly positive .
I know what it 's like to have the government say , " We 're going to kill you in the morning . "
but S@@ ally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three , and what they 're saying to Harry .
no . how about 10 times ?
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
you take a look at this , this is not based on statistics .
I want to be very clear here . I 'm not projec@@ ting some past data into the future .
and then the model makes predictions down the road .
that 's not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they 're not put under international pressure , if they 're allowed to pursue their own devices .
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today , this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 , early parts of 2011 .
that power dis@@ appears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011 .
these fol@@ ks are the mone@@ yed interests in Iran , the bankers , the oil people , the ba@@ z@@ a@@ aries .
they are growing in political cl@@ out , as the mul@@ la@@ hs are isol@@ ating themselves -- with the exception of one group of mul@@ la@@ hs , who are not well known to Americans .
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable .
ca : so you 're kind of trying to say , " People of Iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . "
ca : here 's hoping they hear it that way . thank you very much Bru@@ ce .
I 'm from De@@ tro@@ it .
they further go on to say that 40 square miles of the city is vacant .
and these are@@ n 't plots of land where we 're just growing tomatoes and car@@ ro@@ ts either .
keep G@@ rowing De@@ tro@@ it is a non@@ profit organization that had a lot to do with those farms .
today , as a physical organic chem@@ ist , I 'm committed to use my training to help protect rivers , like the Mississippi , from excessive salt that can come from human activity .
if we add one te@@ as@@ po@@ on of salt to this Olympic @@@ -@@ @ size swimming pool of ocean water , the ocean water stays ocean water .
so the point here is , because rivers , the volume is so small compared to the oceans , it is especially vulnerable to human activity , and we need to take care to protect them .
and these membran@@ es are negatively charged , and help to repe@@ l the negatively charged chloride ions that are in that dissolved salt .
now , I 've introduced this to a number of industrial @@@ -@@ @ water users , and the common response is , " Y@@ ea@@ h , but who is going to use my salt ? "
so you can see how circular salt can provide a barrier to our rivers from this excessive sal@@ ty discharge .
they keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do .
and what all of them had in common was that as they sle@@ pt , they 'd all been bit@@ ten by the only mam@@ mal that lives exclusively on a diet of blood : the v@@ amp@@ ire bat .
" who 's been getting bit@@ ten by a bat lately ? "
and so all we had to do was go to the right house , open up a net and show up at night , and wait until the b@@ ats tried to fly in and feed on human blood .
it 's that vacc@@ inating the animal source is the only thing that stops rab@@ ies .
so , can we vacc@@ inate b@@ ats ?
and what 's even better is that these vaccines can actually spread from bat to bat .
but it was very painful at times and continues to be so .
" Oh , ye@@ ah ? when ? "
that molec@@ ule is there , and they 're making light .
and we think by studying bacteria , we 're going to be able to have insight about mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ul@@ arity in the human body .
and how do you convince the mothers to actually bring their children for immunization ?
made of g@@ le@@ aming bronze ; endowed with super@@ human strength , and powered by I@@ ch@@ or , the life fluid of the gods , this autom@@ aton was unlike anything H@@ ep@@ ha@@ est@@ us had forged before .
to answer this , I had to build a machine .
( la@@ ughter ) I 've been developing an open @@@ -@@ @ source bi@@ ometric lab , an AI system which I call the lim@@ bic La@@ b .
this process will also be cataly@@ zed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
and serious competition from Europe , from Korea , and next is China , which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .
they make a little net money for the treasury .
let me focus a minute on the light vehicles , the cars and light trucks , because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here drives one .
so then of the energy that does get to the wheels , only an eighth of it , half of that , goes to heat the tires on the road , or to heat the air the car push@@ es aside .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And you know people , this is the problem with quote , objectivity , un@@ quote .
( la@@ ughter ) But here 's how I think I like to make change , and that is in making connections .
and they look quite similar .
it 's different , very different from the surrounding buildings , because other buildings are trying to build a wall around the nature .
here 's a short cli@@ p of our film .
civil rights groups often do not have any better option to quickly make their recordings accessible to a large audience than by uplo@@ ading them to social media .
we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience , which will create the new world .
well , I 'll tell you .
think about building a house of Leg@@ o blocks , with all of the no@@ oks and cran@@ n@@ ies that latch together , as opposed to smooth building blocks .
( la@@ ughter ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) And the more they publish , the more they inspire other Tun@@ ica people to get involved .
when these solar storms are moving in space , some of them will inevitably encounter space pro@@ bes that we humans have sent in order to explore other worlds .
and while these space pro@@ bes have been made for different scientific endeav@@ ors , they can also act like tiny cosmic meteorological stations and monitor the evolution of these space storms .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electr@@ ons , something interesting happens .
he said hy@@ bri@@ ds are like mer@@ ma@@ ids .
for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on range , not a reduction in range .
we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S.
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we 'll recover him .
( appl@@ ause ) OK , guys , time to go home .
and pretty soon it 's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
our colleagues in the Center for Qu@@ antum Compu@@ tation and sp@@ intr@@ onics are actually measuring with their l@@ asers dec@@ o@@ he@@ rence in a single electr@@ on spin .
I guess this crisis is teaching humanity that now you need to listen to us and to support indigenous peoples directly , to support their initiatives directly .
the kitchen area is dirty and gri@@ my .
collaborate with them on solutions that could work for society and for business .
and so I set up a breakfast meeting in New York City .
and that is , they said , " You should work with Dr. Temple Gran@@ din . "
and she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities .
and by the way , so@@ y is a key ingredient for chicken feed , and that 's the connection to Mc@@ Donald 's .
and I said , " How about working together ? "
she was very p@@ is@@ sed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice .
she came back . she goes , " Come on . I don 't have all day . "
and then I took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
that photo is of the semi @@@ -@@ @ fin@@ als of the Buenos Aires championships , four months later .
the interesting thing about this climb is it 's not that hard .
but if you 're the leader on it , at the hardest move , you 're looking at about 100 foot fall , onto some low angle s@@ lab@@ s .
so you 've got to focus .
fear really suc@@ ks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing .
just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the t@@ all@@ est models are about two or three feet high .
and I went home , and I told my sister Chris@@ tine .
and she nearly had a fit because Chris@@ tine is a professor at one of L.@@ A. ' s major art colleges , Cal@@ Arts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square @@@ -@@ @ foot gallery .
and to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center 's 3,000 square foot gallery .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
why not ch@@ is@@ el a coral ree@@ f out of marble ?
and they have different properties .
that 's our definition of a parallel line .
they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straight@@ ness , it 's called a geo@@ de@@ sic .
so we ask the question again , " How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? "
but that 's only because I 'm projec@@ ting it onto a flat surface .
how could they see this ?
it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an space .
I can touch it . I can play with it . "
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
we started out , Chris@@ sy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathem@@ atically perfect models .
we have these technologies . we use them .
but you can do it through playing with material objects .
economic game the@@ ori@@ sts have a way of modeling this inter@@ play between ration@@ ality and practic@@ ality called k @@@ -@@ @ level reasoning .
in each case , participants must weigh their own understanding of the best course of action against how well they think other participants understand the situation .
instead , I 'm going to begin with me in graduate school in New Jersey in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , earnestly studying US history , which is what I currently teach as a professor at Van@@ der@@ bil@@ t University in N@@ ash@@ ville , Tennessee .
they work hard .
here , again , the n@@ ati@@ vis@@ t answer is no , immigrants are permanently different from us and inferior to us .
but the distinction itself is at the heart of the way nations define themselves .
it 's reinforced in everyday ways that we talk and act and behave , down to the bor@@ dered maps that we hang up in our school@@ rooms .
the problem with this world@@ view is that it just do@@ es@@ n 't correspond to the way the world actually works , and the way it has worked in the past .
second , we need to ask questions about responsibility .
when immigrants send money or goods home to their family , it plays a significant role in narrowing these gaps , if a very incomplete one .
thank you .
but with that thought , also came a stronger , a more will@@ ful voice from deep within .
" now one more . "
so I took a second and a third stroke .
even the most common type , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ritis , is tr@@ ick@@ ier to prevent than one might think .
and the mission and the magic begin .
I had a signed authorization to act as Anna 's attorney , so I rush@@ ed over to the port of entry to see if I could speak with my client .
these refugees , many of whom are families , are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world , where they 're being raped , kidnapped and extor@@ ted by criminal groups .
it 's about who you live with .
especially if we have c@@ ites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethn@@ icities and different income groups .
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
and when She@@ a was@@ n 't driving the bus , she would be watching over Z@@ ion , making sure she was studying .
amber and I bonded over our battles with lu@@ pus .
Moses , an officer , R@@ anger , veteran , was very clear about his water rescue mission : bring relief of free , clean water to the people in F@@ lin@@ t .
as teachers , we work every day to provide support socially , emo@@ tionally and academ@@ ically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances .
like most teachers , I have students who go home every day , and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy , well @@@ -@@ @ rounded meal for them .
they come to school with trauma , and when I go home every day , that goes home with me .
so I changed almost everything about my teaching .
and I needed someone to listen , somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend .
but when it comes to teaching professionals , that urgency is lagging .
and after a while , our souls become weighed down by the heav@@ iness of it all .
they found that approximately one in 10 reported clin@@ ically significant de@@ pressive symptoms .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
these schools are making space for conversations that matter .
they remember what they wrote on it .
every now and then , we all just need a little help holding the sta@@ pl@@ er .
thank you .
embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ingly enough , I finished up with " If not this , what ?
now , B Corps are a group of companies who believe in business as a force for good .
and the leaders in this space are doing a few things very differently from traditional heroic leaders .
until 2014 , there was no protection for these workers .
once you 've seen problems like this , you can 't un@@ see them , so you have to ask others to help you to solve them .
the second big difference for collaborators is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan .
I remember the day really clearly .
so we changed the way we ran our innovation and planning meetings in two important ways .
and I was the foreigner , and I was the b@@ oss and I apparently had that intim@@ idating hero look .
and it 's not compelling and it 's not even interesting .
so , we changed it and we created these full @@@ -@@ @ day market@@ places , kind of like a big ba@@ z@@ aar .
so I 'm immediately in interdependence land .
my dream is that one day , someone will stand on this stage and tell you how radical interdependence saved my beloved r@@ hin@@ os .
I thought that in the elev@@ ation and separation that comes from heroic leadership , that I would be un@@ tou@@ cha@@ ble .
literally , fab@@ ric@@ ating with biology .
we 're just beginning to realize the potential of nature @@@ -@@ @ based technologies .
in the last century , we expected material innovation to come from the likes of Du@@ Pon@@ t , D@@ ow , BAS@@ F .
for example , if you 're a taxi driver in San Francisco and you decide to work 10 hours per day , then you 're actually having a paying passenger in your car for four hours out of the 10 .
by design , they create more value for the economy .
the negative extern@@ ality of U@@ ber cars becoming more productive is taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop by as much as 30 percent in New York , for example .
then , maybe , a motor@@ bike or a traditional taxi that you can order and pay for from within the same app .

and in doing so , I managed to kick a very small rock off a very big hill that turned into an av@@ al@@ anch@@ e that I found myself tum@@ bling in the middle of .
and I think , as you 'll see , there 's reasons for optimism , because I believe that the best is yet to come .
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies .
this lifelong capacity for plas@@ ticity , for brain change , is power@@ fully expressed .
the mon@@ key is getting more detailed information from these surfaces .
this is constructed by physical change .
it 's what you pay attention to .
it 's what the brain regards , itself , as positive and important to you .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we 're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .

and I 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sab@@ b@@ atic@@ al .
( la@@ ughter ) I think you see , you see them sweeping . you see them sweeping right here .
she 's taught me that love is an action , not a feeling .
you know , I had my camera , and I knew I needed to prove to myself that I would make a difference in photography .
I grew up in a house full of photographs .
it was the first time I had ever been on an air@@ plane and the first time that I had left my country , Rwanda .
are we going to follow a model of unsustainable building and construction similar to what I witnessed in China ?
and one out of 36 of these mothers dies during childbirth .
however , the approach I built here is actually high @@@ -@@ @ resolution , low @@@ -@@ @ cost , and probably most importantly , very scal@@ able .
now , you can see , I can use both of my hands to kind of squee@@ ze and put the bl@@ obs together .
and in fact , that 's true of every ancient city .
and the same of course was true for fish .
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .
it 's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they 've actually di@@ stan@@ ced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature .
and also they 've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we 've seen , are unsustainable .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
what would an alleg@@ ory of good government look like today ?
I don 't know anybody .
so it 's Stage Four . we 're great . who is not great ?
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
I had never been outside Nigeria .
and so we had , as was the norm , live @@@ -@@ @ in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
he felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
or about the millions of other Nig@@ er@@ ians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
let me show you what I mean .
because in the statistics of your past experience , it would have been useful to do so .
so , illu@@ sions are often used , especially in art , in the words of a more contemporary artist , " to demonstrate the fragility of our senses . "
well , one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound , and we enable people to hear their visual world .
and then we just simply translate that into sound .
we can also make music with color .
because now the light is going through a yel@@ low@@ ish filter and then a pur@@ pl@@ ish filter .
here 's another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
and there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging @@@ -@@ @ out space inside .
and they were very passionate about their collections and their ho@@ bb@@ ies .
and that you can put these on a grid that 's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way .
so then we took the Mu@@ ir web@@ s and we took them back to the maps .
every country has a contex@@ tual alcoholic drink . in France it 's Per@@ no@@ d .
the second reason is , we CA@@ N@@ NOT keep doing animal experi@@ mentation forever , and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model .
( la@@ ughter ) " And stop speaking like that . "
she did " C@@ ats " and " P@@ han@@ tom of the Opera . "
and when they got out of the room , he said to her mother , " Just stand and watch her . "
our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip @@@ -@@ @ mine the earth for a particular commodity .
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely , and that we avert some of the scenarios that we 've talked about .
with all that other stuff going on , it would be amazing if our behavior did@@ n 't change .
( jack@@ ham@@ mer ) for more than a few seconds , you 'd feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you 'd be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
we need to recre@@ ate the social contract of the fishing villages on the global scale .
I met global food companies , financial institutions and local government officials .
and you 've got to admit , over the last year and a half , consumers have been doing some we@@ ir@@ d things .
everything is focused on bet@@ ter@@ ment , training , development and moving forward .
so that was a sort of a success .
I mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the Vienna Phil@@ harmon@@ ic Or@@ chestr@@ a .
so it 's not about my story . it 's not about your story .
let 's see another super @@@ -@@ @ conductor , a German super @@@ -@@ @ conductor . Her@@ bert von Kar@@ a@@ jan , please .
now it 's a reversed thing . you 're telling the story . and you 're telling the story .
so I cur@@ led up next to her and I dri@@ zz@@ led sand on her other arm and then her legs .
and they are having great fun .
forget about pensions . think about life and where it 's going to be going .
and of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they 've been left out in one way or another .
and I was on death row at that time .
the basic thing I got to learn was that if I thought , and if you think , you can , you will .
and that 's part of our duty .
new ways to try and get new options that we can use together with things such as bed@@ nets to be able to get to zero .
the males go there for a dance , the females fly into that dance and select a male mosqu@@ ito of their choice , usually the best @@@ -@@ @ looking male in their view .
( la@@ ughter ) Well , except they 've been pre @@@ -@@ @ warned now , and they 'll know you 're making it up .
it 's another way of getting the in@@ tuition .
you know about the Human Gen@@ ome Project .
why do we care about that ?
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
he looked at some research , which said the chance of one cot death in a family like S@@ ally Clar@@ k 's is about one in 8,@@ 500 .
now , we probably think a pri@@ ori that 's unlikely .
even if you believe the number , just like the 73 million to one , that 's not what it meant .
and there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that .
and he wrote to the academ@@ icians in Paris , trying to explain his theory .
sym@@ metry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the Large Had@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der in CER@@ N .
b , for example , rot@@ ates the little yellow do@@ t to the B on the star@@ fish . and so on .
so what if I do B , which is a sixth of a turn , followed by C , which is a third of a turn ?
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six sym@@ me@@ tries .
and , like Chief Seattle said , " We did not spin the web of life .
he thinks , " What can I do to fix up this dog ?
and he had to close his eyes , it 's so dis@@ g@@ usting , and the smell and everything .
and then , among them , you think of your friends and loved ones , the circle at the table .
a the@@ ist Christian can think that all beings , even my enemies , are God 's children .
but anyway , that 's the " lovely love . " and then finally , the fifth step is compassion , " universal compassion . "
and you then feel you must act .
I mean , for example , none of us , probably , want to go to prison , but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison . right ?
good , because before I tell you about that good news , I 'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain .
it was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election , el@@ ici@@ ting various counter @@@ -@@ @ measures by Israel .
if you 're just talking about social structure , OK , clearly that 's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels .
by cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas .
and I would say the non @@@ -@@ @ zero @@@ -@@ @ sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
100 percent are using text .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intim@@ acy .
there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes .
and it was a simple idea . it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field .
good@@ b@@ ye , Martin Lu@@ ther King .
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they 're seen .
in fact , those 15 million cell@@ phones are the most connections that any country , including the U.S. and China , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
what 's interesting is the met@@ aph@@ or that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
indeed in my studies I was a gu@@ ine@@ a pig for a pharmaceutical industry .
I 'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .
they 're discoveries of people and the way people are , and new leadership .
Ben@@ ki knew this .
Ben@@ ki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
S@@ ang@@ ha@@ mit@@ ra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages , and she had a real breakthrough .
and the young women in the village spoke up and said , " We 've changed our dream .
they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it .
we can change the way we see ourselves in the world .
but , at the time , in the 13th century , it was the gad@@ get of the day .
and I will start the world like this .
and it 's increasingly clear that we are@@ n 't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever .
for every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
there is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that underp@@ ins this transition approach .
it 's open source . it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
transition groups in Chile , transition groups in the U.S. , transition groups here , what they 're doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
but , how far away is it ?
Chris An@@ derson : Oh ye@@ ah . DP : hold that and don 't let go .
with this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
so , we 're cra@@ m@@ ming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shou@@ ld@@ n 't proceed in that environment .
and on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger teles@@ cop@@ es , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy .
if you are well @@@ -@@ @ ver@@ sed with inches , nine inches , centi@@ meters , 16 [ centi@@ meters ] .
below the surface there is hard sal@@ ine water .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it become like this .
An@@ j@@ ali 's father , a drun@@ k@@ ard , sold his child for pornography .
yes , there were eight men who def@@ iled me , raped me , but that did@@ n 't go into my consciousness .
so here we have Pen@@ n and T@@ eller , same up@@ side @@@ -@@ @ down .
ok@@ ay , let 's go back to the slides .
he says , " We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan . "
but he says , " We want a nuclear @@@ -@@ @ free world . "
( la@@ ughter ) ... " who said , reach out and touch ... "
so you can imagine my surprise when one day the dean of engineering came and said to me , " K@@ ama@@ u , the students who spend most of the time in the Fa@@ b La@@ b are failing their exams . "
and some of these places are really quite famous .
so we 're really proud to be able to say that we have an original equipment manufacturer in Nairobi that 's provided what 's effectively an industrial robot to supply parts for General Mo@@ tors .
that 's just because , in the nature of the National Por@@ tra@@ it Gallery , it 's created to look at American lives .
he subsequently got married again at 102 , so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him .
it was all part of Cl@@ are Bo@@ o@@ the Lu@@ ce 's look .
Hello , everyone . because this is my first time at TED , I 've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit .
its videos are intended to show a kin@@ der , gent@@ ler face of Islam , for young people to deal with life 's challenges .
" the 99 . " the characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah : justice , wisdom , mercy , among others .
and I was one of those people .
in fact , I read it in the newspaper .
at the same time , while I was inter@@ viewing the Red Brig@@ ades , I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
they were constantly short of cash .
then comes the late 1970s , early ' 8@@ 0s , and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism .
now , I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime , terror , and illegal economy , before 9 @@@ -@@ @ 11 .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
they use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response .
and that they were definitely capable of diff@@ using it non @@@ -@@ @ aggres@@ sively .
and the cost of iter@@ ation is so cheap , you might as well .
keep that in mind .
it 's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia , including the Maldives .
what 's happening is they are breeding in the mon@@ soon rains here .
the sun is overhead there . summer rains in southern Africa .
it 's now back there . they come out , it 's time to come back .
he was flying off the coast of Go@@ a , 21 years ago , 1988 . October , 1988 .
but met@@ aph@@ or is a way of thought before it is a way with words .
when life brought about a series of death and near @@@ -@@ @ death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India , similar to 9@@ 11 in USA .
we have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
seven nations are involved in building this .
we have to get to this .
and on the other side there was a rising sun .
and when we drop the ballast over@@ board we climb .
( la@@ ughter ) And then he asked me -- and this is something I will never forget in my life -- he just asked me , " You 're the good pilot up there .
we are burning , as you heard , so much energy , not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life CA@@ N@@ NOT last for long .
that 's when you throw out all the ballast , all the certain@@ ties , in order to adapt to the new situation .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
but much more , to get ad@@ vices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air , of course it 's possible in the ground .
so , here again you have ne@@ ur@@ ons which are enrolled in em@@ pa@@ thy .
so , to avoid that -- I have to avoid it somehow -- is I use dead people .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
and they eat about eight times as much to@@ fu as Americans do .
and that diet is known as the Har@@ a , Hat@@ chi , B@@ u diet .
( la@@ ughter ) So , we turned to the data again .
and predic@@ tably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
her grand@@ son actually lives in the Twin Cities here .
she ri@@ des her bicycle .
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
what 's the point of all this ?
this was actually just taken last year .

it was incredible .
Google Map@@ Mak@@ er is a technology that em@@ powers each of us to map what we know locally .
( la@@ ughter ) Yes . I 'm sure ! just change it !
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h , I 'm at the De@@ pres@@ si@@ o , and I want to get over to Amaz@@ on@@ is so I plug it into the Mars map , and click the button and there 's my directions .
we 've got to change this stuff up fast .
October 9th , in France , Jean @@@ -@@ @ Pierre L@@ umin@@ et said that the universe is probably shaped like a do@@ dec@@ a@@ he@@ dr@@ on , based on information that they got from this probe .
MD affects his muscle strength , his pul@@ mon@@ ary system , distor@@ ts his body and makes everyday life more challenging than most .
ten billion video views on Sn@@ ap@@ chat , per day .
so , first of all , what are we looking for ? bright Green city .
here , for example , is Vancouver , which if you haven 't been there , you ought to go for a visit . it 's a fab@@ ulous city .
they 're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars , which is a pretty great thing .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start fig@@ uring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we 're actually using .
so we have a model in potential , an emerging model that we 're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in , and turn them into B@@ right Green cities .
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
basically you can suc@@ k any water through this and it will become dr@@ ink@@ able by the time it hits your lips .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
while I 'm talking I 'd like you to also be thinking about : how many places have you lived ?
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
very nice , and there my older , senior lun@@ gs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
but none of that 's in my medical record .
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . right ?
so with that , I 'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
so I can go back to my story .
and those can be environmental bonds .
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dum@@ b .
now , in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
A@@ gn@@ es was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was female gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ til@@ ated .
we will not cut you .
I am connected to everything and everyone . I was born like that .
as a researcher , every once in a while you encounter something a little dis@@ concer@@ ting .
adherence rates . how many people are taking their insul@@ in every day ?
and you take those data , and we find the patients like him , and we bring their data together . and we bring their hi@@ stories into it .
it ev@@ o@@ kes the g@@ id@@ dy dis@@ orientation that you feel in an un@@ familiar place .
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
SS : so Kan@@ zi is very interested in fire .
do that real fast part that you did . ye@@ ah , that part .
how do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with ?
if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease , we can take it enorm@@ ously the other direction , and obviously , that 's where we need to go , going forward .
so , the website of the National Can@@ cer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease .
and I think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
we have designed , and we have worked on the modeling -- and much of these ideas came from D@@ anny and from his team -- the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system .
you know , I 've been using it for two and a half months .
the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun .
you think of yourself as the servant .
she has six years to live .
St@@ acy does her best , but she 's third @@@ -@@ @ generation as well ; she was never taught to cook at home or at school .
he has to bury the people , OK ?
the big brands , you know , the food brands , need to put food education at the heart of their businesses .
now , this shows up when you try to get the intermit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you 're using .
the main problem we have here -- it 's kind of like with AIDS : you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
we have vast budget deficits .
we have only , in government and in politics , started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution .
we 're being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book .
so , it 's not just about the words .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emo@@ tionally or both .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bus@@ hel of tomatoes .
the teachers did@@ n 't know a switch had been made .
the case went on for two years ; I think he 's still appealing the case .
I grew up in the South and wh@@ iled away the sum@@ mers fishing .
this is the hardest hur@@ dle .
the problem is , we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values .
( appl@@ ause ) So , what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .
people have a hard time fig@@ uring that out .
he studied Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's patients that had fron@@ tal temporal lo@@ be de@@ men@@ tia .
and the de@@ men@@ tia ate out the language parts of the brain .
and then this art@@ work came out of somebody who used to install stere@@ os in cars .
let 's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance .
they can do graphic design , all kinds of stuff with computers , photography , industrial design .
I CA@@ N@@ NOT emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : thank you so much for that .
the thing is , au@@ tism comes in different degrees .
you know , the slaughter plants I worked with in the ' 8@@ 0s ; they were absolutely aw@@ ful .
how many cattle are MO@@ O@@ ing their heads off ?
( la@@ ughter ) I had to have long conversations with my wife .
so , it 's an important demonstration of the power of motion .
I met Bel@@ in@@ da when she was 16 .
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride , and touch children and be honest .
so we have the rememb@@ ering self and the experiencing self , and they 're really quite distinct .
and it was such a good tro@@ m@@ pe l '@@ o@@ e@@ il that people got irrit@@ ated when they tried to talk to the woman and she w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't respond .
princes patron@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ing@@ rati@@ ating themselves to the British rulers .
England invented 20 overs c@@ ric@@ ket , and said , " The world must play 20 overs c@@ ric@@ ket . "
it was not like re@@ engineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
and look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
( appl@@ ause ) Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , I might think , " Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? "
I 'm going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
so with that , I thank you .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hips , all that stuff .
I was end@@ lessly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the textbook .
I pe@@ stered my father until he finally found a s@@ cu@@ ba class in Bu@@ ff@@ alo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I did@@ n 't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
so , with " Termin@@ ator 2 , " which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
so , drawing a line through those two do@@ ts of experience came to , " This is going to be a whole new world , " this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
and it was an experience that Hollywood cou@@ ld@@ n 't give me .
after the success of " Tit@@ anic , " I said , " OK , I 'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I 'm going to go be a full @@@ -@@ @ time explo@@ rer for a while . "
they don 't survive on sunlight @@@ -@@ @ based system the way we do .
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? "
I also talked about community @@@ -@@ @ generated data -- in fact I edited some .
and so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
well , at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars , that 's 8.3 hours per day . the average wage in the U.S.
and again , here are some of the lessons .
so you could feel good about selling it .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us ch@@ efs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear @@@ -@@ @ cut forests .
it 's hard to over@@ state the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mons , s@@ word@@ fish -- they 've collapsed .
not very sustainable .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
he said he did@@ n 't know . he would ask around .
let 's call him Don too .
( la@@ ughter ) I fell out of love with this fish .
I actually am .
you st@@ are out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are floo@@ ded can@@ als and this thick , rich marsh@@ land .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanz@@ anian Gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
what 's the feed conversion ratio ? "
well , he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild .
they 're fe@@ asting . "
how are you going to feed the world ?
instead , let 's look to the ecological model .
OK , this is Mount E@@ ve@@ rest .
camp Two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what 's called the Western c@@ w@@ m .
and , after actually two months of preparation , we built our camps all the way up the mountain .
and this is at Camp Four .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the needle .
w@@ ow , what a great day that will be once we 're allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
this super@@ computer was called the Global Ex@@ tin@@ ction Awareness System , of course .
except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in Gen@@ Bank , Mo@@ ore 's Law is right here : it 's the blue line .
Oh , ye@@ ah , and it takes about 5.6 million Indians .
and I said , " I think she 's dancing . "
so I re@@ thought the whole thing , and then we all came to a consensus .
and here was the introduction of this great British icon called " Elizabeth . "
you remember how India was . there was no pollution .
find that which is not .
of course , all the British press got really upset .
I was trying to find a my@@ thic reason to make the film .
are you with child ?
but you get up at 4 a.m.
there may come a time when we med@@ dle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ athon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
very , very interesting planet .
water is the key ingredient in the evolution , the origin of life on a planet .
a lot of heating , fric@@ tional heating . it 's going 18 thousand miles an hour .
there 's no need to play the market .
it 's about helping people to build lives of dignity , stability , economic autonomy , citizenship .
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dump@@ ed .
which really bo@@ thers me .
and they are heter@@ os@@ ex@@ uals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .
not for nothing do we call it the Laz@@ ar@@ us Effect .
no , and I call it the " compassion con@@ und@@ r@@ um . "
it 's all politics .
from the point of view of a public health ner@@ d , jun@@ k@@ ies are doing dum@@ b things .
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
and then the surgeon pointed out , with a lot of anger , he said , " Why is it ? at the end of the Civil War , they were shooting each other with mus@@ kets . if somebody lost an arm , we gave them a wooden stick with a ho@@ ok on it .
so with this , now the top body is ligh@@ ted up ; it 's walking in our lab .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
but images don 't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
and after the first week , they ignored us .
and I always wondered what happened under that web .
but we 're just going to zi@@ p right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid @@@ -@@ @ ocean ri@@ dge , which I think is even more extraordinary .
I think Marg@@ aret Me@@ ad said it best .
and I bring this up because it 's important to locate this practice in history .
after his lecture , a student got up and said to him , " Give us a po@@ em . "
that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world .
and the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence .
well , that was the question that 19th century French physi@@ ologist Rap@@ hael Du@@ bo@@ is , asked about this bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ es@@ cent cl@@ am .
so , for example , this fish has a built @@@ -@@ @ in head@@ light behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate .
this is a vi@@ per@@ fish , and it 's got a l@@ ure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arch@@ es in front of the to@@ oth@@ y ja@@ w that gives the vi@@ per@@ fish its name .
and this one has a l@@ ure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it .
so , I 've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .
and I had my window into the deep sea .
and she did@@ n 't answer the dam@@ n question !
if they call back any of my friends , they 're not going to ... Well , you see the story .
very simply won .
the marsh@@ m@@ allow has to be on top .
and if they lose their booklets , their records can still be pulled by searching with their names .
so dealing with a lack of water is quite in@@ gra@@ ined in my soul .
taking me to lesson three : look below the surface .
( gas@@ ps ) All right .
maybe you 're tired .
she dre@@ am@@ t she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed .
that had an impact , too .
SB : ye@@ ah , and I think we are crow@@ ding , and there is losses going on .
and then George Church says , " That 's all right .
these people face grave threats to their safety , their livelihoods , their dignity .
it 's issued by the state government , and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions .
we then try and find out every little thing we can about that record -- the artist , the label and super@@ vital information like " Who 's that playing trum@@ pet on track three ? "
embrace cur@@ ators ; we are alternative voices to the mainstream music channels , digital or otherwise .
go beyond the algorithm .
your job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects as you can think of .
now , one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it 's going to do , in general .
I mean , with the health system , you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side , but in terms of the system itself ?
I 'll give you three examples .
the technology is there , the infrastructure is there , and yet it do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
in fact , that is the leading cause of under @@@ -@@ @ five mortality .
" not so fast , " say other people .
we made it easy -- I 'll tell you how in a moment .
this is where gu@@ t decisions come from .
these people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me , helped them when they were on the ver@@ ge of destroying each other .
we 're un@@ doing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future .
and it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
so , obviously , you CA@@ N@@ NOT have two principles of justice , one for yourself and one for others .
so , fairness to one and to the other is not divi@@ sible .
an anonymous , fac@@ eless , nam@@ eless person gets in contact with the network , and then gets an identity .
any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment , only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something .
( appl@@ ause ) Lo@@ ok at what Ro@@ j@@ ade@@ en has done .
and then the next line over says if your friend 's friend 's friend , someone you probably don 't even know , is ob@@ ese , your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher .
now , what is the point of this ?
there 's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find h@@ emo@@ zo@@ in .
and you 're not reading that in the Post .
they 've just been sold a bag of goods .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'm the pro @@@ -@@ @ logic guy .
so long as you 're an adult , just think .
if Jo@@ e jumped in a coral ree@@ f , there are many things the alien could see .
the cor@@ als are doing better here . lots of small fish .
this is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
none of it 's a distr@@ actor , so we lose that .
we need more patient problem sol@@ vers . thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
it is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an am@@ us@@ ement park ...
because she knows that I adopted her and that I can 't have kids .
KS : that was spectacular .
moderator : you played all of that by yourself .
I am a former cared @@@ -@@ @ for patient myself .
we see beautiful beaches , cu@@ te animals , beautiful nature , cultural rites and stuff .
but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we 're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool .
there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
one is fast food , where everything is standardized .
I heard this amazing story about Mi@@ uc@@ cia Pra@@ da .
here 's what he had to say .
in other countries there is protection for our ar@@ tful designs . "
very low novel@@ ty standard , anybody can register anything .
there 's a bun@@ ch of other industries that don 't have copyright protection , including the food industry .
then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
you took a path@@ ogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
beautiful stuff .
it 's just gor@@ geous .
it dances to music .
indeed , I was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan to be the Republican nom@@ inee for president .
ok@@ ay .
great , here we go .
computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hi@@ de@@ ously in@@ sens@@ ate when it comes to space .
let 's just come down a bit and fly around .
and finally , I 'd like to leave you with a g@@ lim@@ pse that takes us back to the world of imagery .
what do you think , what in your mind is the first kill@@ er app for this ?
this was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shri@@ mp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
you have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end .
they got it taken offline and managed to p@@ iss off part of the Internet .
but if I ask them , is the TED website going to go down ?
and it 's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
and the element hel@@ ium was discovered just by st@@ aring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
that 's a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
that 's quite an incredible prediction .
in fact , that one is a carbon @@@ -@@ @ oxygen d@@ war@@ f .
little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust , and they fall out of the tracks , the exact angles makes it hard to get right .
small stuff stin@@ ks , but , of course , it 's essential , right ?
and so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
and sometimes , in deep trauma and deep tragedy , there is a spark of clarity .
and essentially we have three mandates .
you only get one chance to make a first impression , and that 's true if you 're a robot as well as if you 're a person .
the thing that I learned about robots that day is that they kind of do their own thing , and they 're not totally aware of us .
he was not only supposed to be able to navigate the physical world , but also be able to navigate my social world -- he 's in my space ; it 's a personal robot .
I want to go over the horizon and find new things , find we@@ ir@@ d stuff , like this volcanic cal@@ der@@ a in Niger .
I also loved looking at how animals have adapted to the African landscape .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well ?
we have already resha@@ ped conservation in the entire country .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you very much .
just interested , did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all ?
and she came across a similar example of something that fasc@@ inated me as being something which , in a business context or a government context , would simply be so tri@@ vial a solution as to seem embar@@ ras@@ sing .
this is based on ranges from data , but if you look at nuclear , it would be the size of Rho@@ de Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet .
when there was one boat , not much of an impact .
so let me tell you the story about Mars .
this is Van Qu@@ ach .
she came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam .
they 're about demo@@ graphics .
( la@@ ughter ) And only from the air did I see the big picture .
two of us are doing it .
you 're the only person that decides how far you go and what you 're capable of .
I don 't have time to explain it , but it has to do with DNA and R@@ NA .
and this is for a chapter that I 'm doing in a book , and the chapter is on honor .
this is what you can do with some household tin@@ foil .
each one of them is completely different .
so I might ask : " who is it for ? "
it will str@@ ati@@ fy society as much as it liber@@ ates it .
and the Dark A@@ ges are the time between when you put away the LE@@ GO for the last time as a k@@ id , and you decide as an adult that it is ok@@ ay to play with a k@@ id 's to@@ y .
walked into the LE@@ GO store .
I suppose we are . "
I love the guy who 's like running away with his cl@@ as@@ ps , his ho@@ oks .
and the guy that made this , he made a slot machine out of LE@@ GO .
there 's people getting drunk building LE@@ GO , and you 've got to finish the thing before you pu@@ ke .
this is my house .
so , this is for grow@@ n@@ ups , but it 's also for T@@ hel@@ on@@ ious , when he 's old enough to read it : the world will say to you , " Be a better person . "
not with my words and not with my actions . "
when you help just one person to be more secure , a nation is more secure .
change @@@ -@@ @ making does not belong to one group of people ; it belongs to all of us .
designing .
there are other candidates of course , but LO@@ L@@ cats will do as a general case .
researchers at the C@@ DC and other places have increasingly been linking sub@@ urban development patterns with se@@ d@@ ent@@ ary lifestyles .
and then there 's finally -- there 's the affordability question .
in 1932 , that 's the picture .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's reas@@ suring .
a farmer in a rural village -- a k@@ id needs to measure and modify the world , not just get information about it on a screen .
the only problem with that is it breaks everybody 's boundaries .
we maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
why grow homes ? because we can .
we 've got Mc@@ People , Mc@@ Cars , Mc@@ Houses .
it is the landscape , right ?
it could have been an English T@@ ud@@ or or Spanish Colonial , but we kind of chose this shape .
the simple action of an individual raising a hand led many others to do the same .
for example , if even one fish sees a pre@@ dat@@ or and fle@@ es , this can alert many others to danger .
we know that humans are in@@ nat@@ ely innovative , because if we we@@ ren 't , we 'd all be using the same ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads that we were using 10,000 years ago .
be inclusive of our diversity -- the way we look , think and act .
but it is not so .
thank you very much .
and I 'm thinking , no , this is not possible .
but I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long @@@ -@@ @ term at things like the food system and make change .
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here .
and they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation .
to put that in context : more people visit the Ver@@ mont T@@ ed@@ dy Be@@ ar Factory each year than are followers of the J@@ ain religion in America .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , a couple of interesting things about N@@ ones are : there are a lot of us , and we ske@@ w young .
and that is much harder to change .
and they can handle water .
they don 't have another thing they can do .
parts of the ocean there look just absolutely ap@@ oc@@ aly@@ p@@ tic .
there 's a lot you can 't see , also , underwater .
these guys have to swim around through it .
he said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago ; like about a week ago , and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what 's going on .
that guide 's entire calendar year is cancel@@ ed bookings .
now , in the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez spill , about 30 percent of the kill@@ er wh@@ ales died in the first few months .
also , for all the sho@@ reline that has bo@@ oms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of sho@@ reline -- all of the sho@@ reline that has bo@@ oms , there 's adjacent sho@@ reline that do@@ es@@ n 't have any bo@@ oms .
( appl@@ ause ) Not just BP .
we 've been here before with energy , and people saying the economy CA@@ N@@ NOT withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery .
and that 's because they 're both designed to fit the human hand .
it 's an extraordinary phenomenon , but it 's true .
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
it 's not confined to its own line@@ age .
no other animal does it .
ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee troops have different cultures in different troops .
and why does exchange raise living standards ?
O@@ z takes one hour to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
that 's what we 've achieved as a species .
there 's no working for each other across the colonies .
it is@@ n 't always quite that simple , but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
you also see seas@@ hel@@ ls -- as discovered by a team here in Oxford -- moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
and it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
it basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size .
in the next 15 years , almost 500 planets were discovered or@@ biting other stars , with different methods .
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different bio@@ chem@@ i@@ stries wherever we find them ?
and they would tell these kids , some as young as six years old , that society do@@ es@@ n 't want them , and their own parents never wanted a broken child , so they should just kill themselves .
so I went to his a@@ unt , who is the contact that I have for him .
how many of you have a will ?
and what I 'd like to talk to you today about , a little bit , is really transforming the relationship , or the inter@@ play , between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet .
and to the right hand side of us was this great K@@ hum@@ b@@ u Gl@@ ac@@ ier .
and luc@@ k@@ ily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gas@@ p of air .
and I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt . E@@ ve@@ rest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly .
now , if you get a Ph.D. , and you decide not to teach , you don 't always end up in a place like this .
we need Co@@ ke to work with P@@ ep@@ si .
so , the where : we 've identified 35 places globally that we need to work .
why is 25 percent important ?
by companies asking for this , we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .
why is Car@@ g@@ ill important ?
but when we looked at their genes , it turns out that what they wanted to eat was the food we were already feeding them .
I mean , honestly , that is all speculation , but the only thing I know for certain is that there are a hundred billion billion bil@@ l@@ lion living micro@@ b@@ ial cells underlying all the world 's oceans .
( la@@ ughter ) He had no idea what that was .
in Niger , one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth .
they sold the milk for cash .
join the movement .
feel hap@@ pier and help save the world .
and there was a huge row online about , " He@@ y , this can 't be real . "
it 's that simple .
I said , " Well , he 's passed away , but his name was K@@ hos@@ ro . "
that 's what I try and show in my stand @@@ -@@ @ up , good people everywhere .
so you have living din@@ osa@@ urs and space aliens , animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions .
and this should be presented fac@@ tually , straight@@ for@@ war@@ dly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
another review@@ er called it " hil@@ arious . "
question : was domes@@ tic@@ ation good for sheep ?
life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet .
I am helpl@@ ess over this . "
this is an early @@@ -@@ @ on photograph -- you can see , we had these g@@ ush@@ ers .
I mean , we 've essentially been exporting oil sp@@ ills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations .
it 's a very important period -- it 's roughly half the period when we 've been fully modern humans on the planet .
you solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector , while at the same time , stimulating innovation -- examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level .
and what I mostly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me .
these are essential skills for us , our families , our communities .
it costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid .
but then let 's go up from there .
and I wanted to join that team .
the Ar@@ mill@@ aria is actually a pre@@ datory fun@@ gu@@ s , killing certain species of trees in the forest .
the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection .
and aside from coral , the answer is no .
and then , you might have heard of this giant cl@@ am that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old .
and it actually never sh@@ eds those leaves , so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom .
and what that means is that it 's not dor@@ man@@ t -- it 's actually been living and growing for half a million years .
I said , " No , use the method of the grand@@ mother . "
I said , " Well , what you 've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time .
each group of four can use one computer and not four computers . "
( la@@ ughter ) The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time , sitting in their homes , one day in a week .
teacher : I 'm the g@@ ing@@ erb@@ read man .
you know , stuff which I don 't know anything about .
after watching eight TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ ks , he wants to become Leon@@ ardo da V@@ inc@@ i .
this is what I 'm building now -- they 're called sol@@ es : self Organized Learning Environ@@ ments .
so how far can we go ? one last little bit and I 'll stop .
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year @@@ -@@ @ old students .
so it went on like that , and I did@@ n 't know where else to find myself .
and one of those competitions , I just won a small , little transi@@ stor Philips radio .
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
that means the power of others things is rising .
and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it .
you can see there 's some signals there .
so one of the things we 're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabol@@ ic energy to build and maintain their shells .
it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two .
print scaled .
women typically listen expan@@ sively .
protect your ears in that way .
if we take many images of many sl@@ ices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional image .
girls ' bra@@ ins are like sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti ; everything in their life is connected to everything else .
likewise , every connec@@ t@@ ome changes over time .
what kinds of changes happen ?
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connec@@ t@@ ome -- an idea that you may find empowering .
and if you 'll allow me to asc@@ end to met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical heights , I will remind you that ne@@ ural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuro@@ scientists think -- of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connec@@ tom@@ es .
and they are working with me up to today .
over the past two years I had the opportunity to interview over 100 people from all walks of life about their experience of design .
their clients are orphaned children in Kenya , foster children in Chicago and pregnant women in Malawi .
one of my favorite conversation partners is my 90 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old grand@@ mother , Aud@@ rey Gor@@ witz , from O@@ sh@@ k@@ os@@ h , Wisconsin .
it 's a part of the Village Development Bank ; it 's not a real bank , but it 's a fund -- microcredit .
according to the U.@@ N. , new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent , and according to the World Bank , 7.7 million lives were saved .
they want to spend less and save more .
now bl@@ u@@ ef@@ in , in general , goes to one place : Japan .
and from our data that gets collected , when that tag comes back , because a fish@@ er returns it for a thousand @@@ -@@ @ dollar reward , we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now , on a back@@ b@@ oned animal .
both the electronic tags I 'm talking about are expensive .
same thing with Lay@@ san al@@ bat@@ ross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tun@@ as use .
they 're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
they 're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Pol@@ es .
and the reason here for Africa is especially important , because ' 9@@ 0s was a bad decade , not only in Kenya , but across Africa .
welcome to a decent life .
take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband , Bill .
let 's look at a country like India .
so what 's the end@@ game ?
to me , that is deep happiness .
it 's so que@@ er that physi@@ ci@@ sts resort to one or another paradox@@ ical interpretation of it .
the history of science has been one long series of violent bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ms , as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of que@@ er@@ ness in the universe .
but here is the bomb@@ shell : you we@@ ren 't there .
miracles are just events that are extremely impro@@ b@@ able .
and these turb@@ ans meant to represent our commitment to serve cast us as terrorists .
and I have to reck@@ on with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given .
" we already for@@ gave you . "
( la@@ ughter ) So here 's a series of projects over the last few years where I 've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection .
and I promise you , if you take that walk inside Google Stree@@ t@@ view , you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face .
and I collected those moments -- the photos inside Google Stree@@ t@@ view and the memories , specifically .
it had ' Chad ' written in magic marker on it .
he died long after he left the pil@@ low at my house , but we never got around to returning it . "
so because of having cooked food , it 's easier to dig@@ est .
it 's a very big signal ; it 's sent to the brain says , " Go and eat . "
we have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward , as you know .
every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe .
they are shaping our very desires .
and that 's why I call it a transform@@ ational innovation .
p@@ s@@ ori@@ asis is very dre@@ ad@@ ful disease of the skin .
so let me step back and ask : what 's power ?
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what I call soft power .
this is what the green list says .
so you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
but when I got there , I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .
they 're very low to the water , and they 're all un@@ inhabited , except one island has about 35 care@@ tak@@ ers on it .
in the west we have the Gil@@ bert Islands .
in the center we have the Pho@@ eni@@ x Islands , which is the subject that I 'm talking about .
and when I was first going up there , I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago , and people would ask me , " Why are you going to this place called Kiribati ? "
in 2012 , 50 percent of all Americans had a single chronic disease , resulting in 86 percent of the $ 3 trillion US health care budget being spent for treating such chronic diseases .
( la@@ ughter ) But then something amazing happened .
but why is this a problem ?
to put things in perspective , half of the students completing high school today in Australia are not prepared to understand any argument about rates of change in data .
but once the excitement settled down , there were a few concerns that cre@@ pt in our minds .
so , from a purely economic point of view : if we don 't use immediate incentives , we are under@@ investing in student outcomes .
she said to me , " M@@ o ...
there is a reason we keep going down one rab@@ bit hole after another , even when we know it 's going to make us feel worse .
it 's like " Love , Ac@@ tually " meets " The F@@ ast and the Fu@@ rious . "
this is , like , half the total spent on education in the US .
and so we built it .
and there 's a helpful , friendly square that push@@ es the ball up the hill , and then a mean triangle push@@ es the ball back down .
even greater pain than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself .
this creates a beautiful fairness circle .
whether worn by refugees or world @@@ -@@ @ changing entrepreneurs , when people are allowed the freedom to present themselves in a manner that celebrates their own unique identities , a magical thing happens .
