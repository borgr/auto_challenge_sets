a business designed specifically for dancers in their country who have outstanding talent and passion , but have trouble overcoming the hardships of the shallow path of employment and unfortunately decide to give up on their dancing career .
the founder of Dance Plan@@ ner had also had the same experience as above , and had eventually been employed to a foreign dance company . therefore even before the corporation establishment ( which was in 2016 ) had been held , he has helped dancers in his surrounding and gradually started with the service .
from recommending dance companies suitable for each dan@@ cer , to audi@@ tion examination , audi@@ tion tour@@ ing planning ( accommodations , travel paths , reservations for flights ) , arrangements for practice spaces + contract consulting ( helping with contract adjustments and being issued with a V@@ ISA ) .
dance Plan@@ ner helps dancers focus on nothing but simply audi@@ tioning and getting into foreign countries without any unnecessary hardships and is with the dan@@ cer through the whole audi@@ tion process step by step . also , Dance Plan@@ ner 's proceeds to help the dan@@ cer even when it is time to sign the contract form , and guides dancers into safely entering their desired dance companies .
we accept counseling starting from October , in order for dancers to pre@@ p for audi@@ tioning season which is held in January to March each year .

in the C + + programming language , new and delete are a pair of language construc@@ ts that perform dynamic memory allocation , object construction and object destruction . [ 1 ]
overview
where p is a previously declared poin@@ ter of type T ( or some other type to which a T poin@@ ter can be assigned , such as a super@@ class of T ) .
the default construc@@ tor for T , if any , is called to construct a T instance in the allocated memory buffer .
calls a single @@@ -@@ @ argument T construc@@ tor instead of the default construc@@ tor when initi@@ alizing the newly allocated buffer .
a different variant alloc@@ ates ar@@ rays of objects rather than single objects :
this requests a memory buffer from the free store that is large enough to hold a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous array of N objects of type T , con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ously , and calls the default construc@@ tor on each elements of the array .
memory allocated with the new [ ] must be deal@@ located with the delete [ ] operator , rather than delete . using the inappropriate form results in un@@ defined behavior .
C + + compil@@ ers are not required to generate a diagnostic message for using the wrong form .
the C + + 11 standard specifies an additional syntax ,
that initi@@ alizes each p [ i ] to initi@@ al@@ iz@@ eri .
over@@ loading
relation to mal@@ lo@@ c and free
in contrast to the C routin@@ es , which allow growing or shrinking an allocated array with real@@ lo@@ c , it is not possible to change the size of a memory buffer allocated by new [ ] .
the C + + standard library instead provides a dynamic array that can be extended or reduced in its st@@ d : : vector template class .

Linux startup process is the multi @@@ -@@ @ stage initi@@ alization process performed during boo@@ ting a Linux installation . it is in many ways similar to the B@@ SD and other Uni@@ x @@@ -@@ @ style boot processes , from which it derives .
overview
early stages of the Linux startup process depend very much on the computer architecture .
on shut@@ down , all in@@ it is called to close down all user space functionality in a controlled manner . the in@@ it then termin@@ ates and the kernel execu@@ tes its own shut@@ down .
boot load@@ er phase
in U@@ EF@@ I systems , a pay@@ load , such as the Linux kernel , can be executed directly . thus no boot load@@ er is necessary . below is a summary of some popular boot load@@ ers :
SY@@ S@@ LIN@@ U@@ X / ISO@@ LIN@@ U@@ X is a boot load@@ er that specializes in boo@@ ting full Linux installations from FA@@ T fil@@ es@@ y@@ stems . it is often used for boot or rescue fl@@ op@@ py discs , live US@@ Bs , and other lightweight boot systems . ISO@@ LIN@@ U@@ X is generally used by Linux live CDs and boo@@ table install CDs .
kernel loading stage
kernel startup stage
according to Red H@@ at , the detailed kernel process at this stage is therefore summarized as follows : [ 1 ]
at this point , with interrup@@ ts enabled , the schedul@@ er can take control of the overall management of the system , to provide pre @@@ -@@ @ emp@@ tive multi @@@ -@@ @ t@@ asking , and the in@@ it process is left to continue boo@@ ting the user environment in user space .
early user space
this applies to Sy@@ s@@ V @@@ -@@ @ style in@@ it .
the developers of system@@ d aimed to replace the Linux in@@ it system inherited from UNI@@ X System V and Berk@@ ele@@ y Software Distribution ( B@@ SD ) operating systems . like in@@ it , system@@ d is a da@@ emon that manages other da@@ em@@ ons .
all da@@ em@@ ons , including system@@ d , are background processes .
system@@ d is the first da@@ emon to start ( during boo@@ ting ) and the last da@@ emon to terminate ( during shut@@ down ) .
system@@ d is also capable of aggressive parall@@ el@@ ization .
up@@ start operates as@@ yn@@ chron@@ ously ; it handles starting of the tasks and services during boot and stopping them during shut@@ down , and also supervises the tasks and services while the system is running .
R@@ unit features parall@@ el@@ ization of the start up of system services , which can speed up the boot time of the operating system . [ 14 ]

mod@@ probe is a Linux program originally written by Ru@@ sty Rus@@ sell and used to add a load@@ able kernel module ( L@@ KM ) to the Linux kernel or to remove a L@@ KM from the kernel . it is commonly used indirectly : u@@ dev relies upon mod@@ probe to load drivers for automatically detected hardware . [ c@@ itation needed ]
as of 2014 [ update ] mod@@ probe is distributed as part of the software package " k@@ mo@@ d " [ 1 ] ( maintained by Luc@@ as De M@@ arch@@ i and others ) . it was previously developed as :
" module @@@ -@@ @ in@@ it @@@ -@@ @ tools , " [ 2 ] for Linux kernel version 2.6 and later ( maintained by J@@ on Masters and others ) " mo@@ du@@ til@@ s " [ 3 ] for use with Linux versions 2.2.@@ x and 2.4.@@ x@@ . .
operation
the mod@@ probe program offers more full @@@ -@@ @ featured " Swiss @@@ -@@ @ army @@@ -@@ @ knife " features than the more basic in@@ smo@@ d and r@@ m@@ mo@@ d utilities , with the following benefits :
if invoked with no switches , the program by default adds / inser@@ ts / install@@ s the named module into the kernel . root privileges are typically required for these changes .
any arguments appearing after the module name are passed to the kernel ( in addition to any options listed in the configuration file ) .
in some versions of mod@@ probe , the configuration file is called mod@@ pro@@ be@@ .@@ con@@ f , and in others the equivalent is the collection of files called < mod@@ ul@@ en@@ ame > in the / etc / mod@@ pro@@ be@@ .@@ d directory .
features
black@@ list
there are cases where two or more modules both support the same devices , or a module inval@@ idly claims to support a device : the black@@ list keyword indicates that all of a particular module 's internal ali@@ ases are to be ignored . [ 4 ]
there are two ways to black@@ list a module using mod@@ probe , employing the mod@@ pro@@ be@@ .@@ con@@ f system , the first is to use its black@@ listing system in / etc / mod@@ pro@@ be@@ .@@ d / black@@ list :
an install primitive is the highest priority in the con@@ fig file and will be used instead of the black@@ listing method above , requiring this second method :

in computing , a load@@ able kernel module ( or L@@ KM ) is an object file that contains code to extend the running kernel , or so @@@ -@@ @ called base kernel , of an operating system .
L@@ K@@ Ms are typically used to add support for new hardware ( as device drivers ) and / or fil@@ es@@ y@@ stems , or for adding system calls .
when the functionality provided by a L@@ KM is no longer required , it can be un@@ loaded in order to free memory and other resources .
advantages
disadvantages
imple@@ mentations in different operating systems
binary compatibility
other operating systems , such as Sol@@ aris , Free@@ B@@ SD , OS X , and Windows keep the kernel API and AB@@ I relatively stable , thus avoiding this problem . for example , Free@@ B@@ SD kernel modules compiled against kernel version 6.0 will work without re@@ compilation on any other Free@@ B@@ SD 6.@@ x version , e.g. 6.4 . however , they are not compatible with other major versions and must be re@@ compiled for use with Free@@ B@@ SD 7.@@ x , as API and AB@@ I compatibility is maintained only within a branch .
security
while load@@ able kernel modules are a convenient method of modifying the running kernel , this can be abused by attackers on a compromised system to prevent detection of their processes or files , allowing them to maintain control over the system .
many ro@@ ot@@ kits make use of L@@ K@@ Ms in this way . note that on most operating systems modules do not help privilege elev@@ ation in any way , as elevated privilege is required to load a L@@ KM ; they merely make it easier for the att@@ acker to hide the break @@@ -@@ @ in . [ 8 ]

there are several imple@@ mentations of buffer over@@ flow protection , including those for the GNU Compil@@ er Collection , LL@@ V@@ M , Microsoft Visual Studio , and other compil@@ ers .
overview
there are three types of can@@ aries in use : Termin@@ ator , random , and random X@@ OR . current versions of St@@ ack@@ Guard support all three , while Pro@@ police supports termin@@ ator and random can@@ aries .
in this way , once the can@@ ary or the control data is cl@@ ob@@ bered , the can@@ ary value is wrong . random X@@ OR can@@ aries are random can@@ aries that are X@@ OR sc@@ ram@@ bled using all or part of the control data .
bounds checking is a compil@@ er @@@ -@@ @ based technique that adds run @@@ -@@ @ time bounds information for each allocated block of memory , and checks all po@@ inters against those at run @@@ -@@ @ time .
for C and C + + , bounds checking can be performed at poin@@ ter calculation time [ 4 ] or at de@@ reference time . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
St@@ ack@@ Guard and Pro@@ police CA@@ N@@ NOT protect against over@@ flows in automatically allocated structures that over@@ flow into function po@@ inters .
Pro@@ police at least will re@@ arrange the allocation order to get such structures allocated before function po@@ inters . a separate mechanism for poin@@ ter protection was proposed in Po@@ int@@ Guard [ 28 ] and is available on Microsoft Windows . [ 29 ]
Microsoft Visual Studio
the compil@@ er suite from Microsoft implements buffer over@@ flow protection since version 2003 through the / GS command @@@ -@@ @ line switch , which is enabled by default since version 2005 . [ 30 ] Using / GS@@ - dis@@ ables the protection .
a can@@ ary example
normal buffer allocation for x@@ 86 architec@@ tures and other similar architec@@ tures is shown in the buffer over@@ flow entry . here , we will show the modified process as it pertains to St@@ ack@@ Guard .
by over@@ writing RE@@ TA , the function can be made to execute other code ( when it attempts to return ) , either existing functions ( ret@@ 2@@ lib@@ c ) or code written into the stack during the over@@ flow .
details
this is a common vulnerability because format bugs were previously thought harm@@ less and resulted in vulnerabilities in many common tools .
Mit@@ re 's C@@ VE project lists roughly 500 vulnerable programs as of June 2007 , and a trend analysis ranks it the 9th most @@@ -@@ @ reported vulnerability type between 2001 and 2006 . [ 2 ]
format string bugs can occur in other programming languages besides C , although they appear with less frequency and usually CA@@ N@@ NOT be exploited to execute code of the att@@ acker 's choice . [ 3 ]
prevention
many compil@@ ers can st@@ atically check format strings and produce warnings for dangerous or suspect formats .
in the GNU Compil@@ er Collection , the relevant compil@@ er flags are , -@@ Wall , -@@ W@@ format , -@@ W@@ no @@@ -@@ @ format @@@ -@@ @ extra @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ gs , -@@ W@@ format @@@ -@@ @ security , -@@ W@@ format @@@ -@@ @ non@@ liter@@ al , and -@@ W@@ format = 2 . [ 9 ]

Pa@@ x works on x@@ 86 CP@@ Us that do not have the N@@ X bit , such as 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit x@@ 86 . the Linux kernel still does not ship with Pa@@ X ( as of May , 2007 ) ; the patch must be merged manually .
Pa@@ x provides two methods of N@@ X bit em@@ ulation , called SE@@ G@@ ME@@ X@@ EC and PA@@ GE@@ EX@@ EC .
SE@@ G@@ ME@@ X@@ EC does not cause programs to use more system memory ( i.e. RAM ) , it only restricts how much they can access .

Windows
when N@@ X is supported , it is enabled by default . Windows allows programs to control which pages dis@@ allow execution through its API as well as through the section head@@ ers in a PE file . in the API , runtime access to the N@@ X bit is exposed through the Win@@ 32 API calls Vir@@ tu@@ al@@ Al@@ lo@@ c [ Ex ] and Vir@@ tu@@ al@@ Protect [ Ex ] .
API
the program stack in fo@@ o ( ) with various inputs :
A. - Before data is copied .

the Linux API is composed out of the System Call Interface of the Linux kernel , the GNU C Library ( by GNU ) , lib@@ dr@@ m , li@@ bal@@ sa and li@@ be@@ v@@ dev ( by fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org ) .
the GNU C Library is a wrap@@ per around the system calls of the Linux kernel .
the Linux kernel and GNU C Library together form the Linux API . after compilation , the bin@@ aries offer an AB@@ I .
released under the GNU Less@@ er General Public License , g@@ lib@@ c is free software .
history
the G@@ lib@@ c project was initially written mostly by Rol@@ and Mc@@ Gr@@ ath , working for the Free Software Foundation ( F@@ SF ) in the 1980s .
in February 1988 , F@@ SF described g@@ lib@@ c as having nearly completed the functionality required by AN@@ SI C. [ 3 ] By 1992 , it had the AN@@ SI C @@@ -@@ @ 1989 and PO@@ SI@@ X@@ .1 @@@ -@@ @ 1990 functions implemented and work was under way on PO@@ SI@@ X@@ .@@ 2. [ 4 ]
in the early 1990s , the developers of the Linux kernel for@@ ked g@@ lib@@ c . their for@@ k , called " Linux lib@@ c , " was maintained separately for years and released versions 2 through 5 .
the last used version of Linux lib@@ c used the internal name ( son@@ ame ) lib@@ c.@@ so@@ .@@ 5. Following on from this , g@@ lib@@ c 2.@@ x on Linux uses the son@@ ame lib@@ c.@@ so@@ .@@ 6 [ 9 ] ( Alpha and IA@@ 64 architec@@ tures now use lib@@ c.@@ so@@ .@@ 6.1 , instead ) . the * .@@ so file name is often abbre@@ vi@@ ated as li@@ bc@@ 6 ( for example in the package name in Debian ) following the normal conventions for libraries .
installation of a steering committee
starting in 2001 the library 's development had been over@@ seen by a committee , [ 11 ] with Ul@@ rich D@@ rep@@ per [ 12 ] kept as the lead contributor and main@@ tain@@ er . the steering committee installation was surrounded by a public controversy as it was openly described by Ul@@ rich D@@ rep@@ per as failed hostile take@@ over maneu@@ ver by R@@ MS . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
switch to g@@ it
while previously in a CVS repository , in 2009 g@@ lib@@ c was migrated to a G@@ it repository on S@@ our@@ ce@@ ware . [ 16 ]
version history
for most systems , the version of g@@ lib@@ c can be obtained by executing the li@@ b file ( for example , / li@@ b / lib@@ c.@@ so@@ .@@ 6 ) .
Mal@@ verti@@ sing
there are many different Bit@@ Tor@@ rent websites . these sites typically contain multiple tor@@ rent files and an index of those files .
the following table compares the features of some of the most popular Bit@@ Tor@@ rent websites ; it 's not comprehensive as regard to tor@@ rent trac@@ kers , especially private trac@@ kers . [ 1 ] The Alex@@ a global ranking is accurate as of January 21 , 2016 .
protection from return @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ lib@@ c attacks
address space layout random@@ ization ( AS@@ L@@ R ) makes this type of attack extremely unlikely to succeed on 64 @@@ -@@ @ bit machines as the memory locations of functions are random .
for 32 @@@ -@@ @ bit systems AS@@ L@@ R provides little benefit since there are only 16 bits available for random@@ ization , and they can be defeated by bru@@ te force in a matter of minutes . [ 3 ]

PIC is commonly used for shared libraries , so that the same library code can be loaded in a location in each program address space where it will not overlap any other uses of memory ( for example , other shared libraries ) .
history
an improvement on this situation was the ability to relocate execu@@ table programs when they were loaded into memory . only one copy of the program was required , but once loaded the program could not be moved .
IBM OS / 360 programs ( 1966 ) fit this model .
in seg@@ mented systems such as Mul@@ tics ( 1964 ) , code is inherently position @@@ -@@ @ independent , since addresses in a program are relative to the current segment rather than absolute .
position @@@ -@@ @ independent code was developed to eliminate these restrictions for non @@@ -@@ @ seg@@ mented systems . a position @@@ -@@ @ independent program could be loaded at any address in memory .

often , a volume rendering system will have a system for identifying regions of the volume containing no visible material . this information can be used to avoid rendering these transparent regions . [ 12 ]

consequences
an accidental over@@ flow may result in data corruption or unexpected behavior by any process which uses the affected memory area . on operating systems without memory protection , this could be any process on the system .
a deliberate exploit may result in data at a specific location being altered in an arbitrary way , or in arbitrary code being executed .
for example , a Microsoft J@@ PEG G@@ DI + buffer over@@ flow vulnerability could allow remote execution of code on the affected machine . [ 1 ]
iOS jail@@ breaking often uses he@@ ap over@@ flows to gain arbitrary code execution , usually for kernel explo@@ its to achieve the ability to replace the kernel with the one jail@@ break provides .
detection and prevention
as with buffer over@@ flows there are primarily three ways to protect against he@@ ap over@@ flows . several modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux provide some implementation of all three .

because performing bounds checking during every usage is time @@@ -@@ @ consuming , it is not always done . bounds @@@ -@@ @ checking elimination is a compil@@ er optimization technique that eliminates un@@ needed bounds checking .
index checking
mainstream languages that enforce run time checking include Ad@@ a , C # , H@@ ask@@ ell , Java , JavaScript , Lis@@ p , PHP , Py@@ th@@ on , Ru@@ by , and Visual Basic . the D and O@@ Cam@@ l languages have run time bounds checking that is enabled or disabled with a compil@@ er switch .
data validation
in the context of data collection and data quality , bounds checking refers to checking that the data is not tri@@ vi@@ ally invalid . for example , a percentage measurement must be in the range 0 to 100 ; the height of an adult person must be in the range 0 to 3 meters .

most graphics editing programs , like Adobe Photoshop and G@@ IM@@ P , allow the user to modify the basic blend modes - for example by applying different levels of op@@ acity to the top picture .
in the formulas shown on this page , values go from 0.0 ( black ) to 1.0 ( white ) .
normal blend mode
this is the standard blend mode which uses the top layer alone , [ 2 ] without mixing its colors with the layer beneath it . [ examples needed ]
dissolve
multiply and Scre@@ en
multiply
multiply blend mode multipl@@ ies the numbers for each pix@@ el of the top layer with the corresponding pix@@ el for the bottom layer . the result is a dar@@ ker picture .
, where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value .
with Scre@@ en blend mode the values of the pixels in the two layers are in@@ ver@@ ted , multiplied , and then in@@ ver@@ ted again . this yields the opposite effect to multiply . the result is a brigh@@ ter picture .
, where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value .
where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value .
depending on the value a of the base layer , one gets a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation between black ( a = 0 ) , the top layer ( a = 0.5 ) , and white ( a = 1 ) .
hard Light
hard Light combines Multi@@ ply and Scre@@ en blend modes . equivalent to Over@@ lay , but with the bottom and top images sw@@ apped .
soft Light
this is a sof@@ ter version of H@@ ard Light . applying pure black or white does not result in pure black or white [ examples needed ] .
these three results coincide with gam@@ ma correction of the bottom layer with γ = 2 ( for top black ) , unchanged bottom layer ( or , what is the same , γ = 1 ) ( for top neutral gray ) , and γ = 0.5 ( for top white ) .
the formula used by Photoshop has a dis@@ continuity of local contrast ( was [ du@@ bi@@ ous - discuss ] ) , and other formulas correct it . Photoshop 's formula is : [ 5 ]
P@@ eg@@ top 's formula [ 5 ] is smo@@ other and correc@@ ts the dis@@ continuity [ < span title = " See above . also , this source uses the term " dis@@ continu@@ ance , " not " dis@@ continuity . " however the function is continuous despite being piec@@ e@@ wise ( November 2012 ) " > better source needed ] at b = 0.5 :
a third formula defined by illu@@ sion@@ s.@@ hu [ 6 ] correc@@ ts the dis@@ continuity in a different way , doing gam@@ ma correction with γ depending on b :
for b = 0 , one still gets γ = 2 , for b = 0.5 one gets γ = 1 , for b = 1 one gets γ = 0.5 , but it is not a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation between these 3 images .

Tom@@ o@@ yo Linux is a Linux kernel security module which implements Man@@ datory access control ( MAC ) .
overview
Tom@@ o@@ yo Linux focuses on system behavior .
Tom@@ o@@ yo Linux allows each process to declare behaviours and resources needed to achieve their purpose . when protection is enabled , Tom@@ o@@ yo Linux acts restricts each process to the behavi@@ ors and resources allowed by the administrator .
features
the main features of Tom@@ o@@ yo Linux include :
system analysis Increased security through Man@@ datory Access Control Automatic policy generation Sim@@ ple syntax E@@ ase of use
history and versions
Tom@@ o@@ yo was merged in Linux Ker@@ nel main@@ line version 2.@@ 6.@@ 30 ( 2009 , June 10 ) / [ 2 ] It is currently one of four standard L@@ SM modules , along with SE@@ Linux , App@@ Arm@@ or and sm@@ ack .
the Tom@@ o@@ yo Linux project started as a patch for the Linux kernel to provide MAC .
however , more ho@@ oks are needed to integrate the remaining MAC functionality of Tom@@ o@@ yo Linux . consequently , the project is following two parallel development lines :

de@@ bug symbol
implementation
uses
an object file will contain a symbol table of the identi@@ fiers it contains that are externally visible . during the linking of different object files , a lin@@ ker will use these symbol tables to resolve any unresolved references .
at that time of accessing variables and allocating memory dynamically , a compil@@ er should perform many works and as such the extended stack model requires the symbol table .
example
consider the following program written in C :
a C compil@@ er that par@@ ses this code will contain at least the following symbol table entries :
symbol name Type Scope bar function , double ex@@ tern x double function parameter fo@@ o function , double global count int function parameter sum double block local i int for @@@ -@@ @ loop statement
in computer software , strings is a program in Uni@@ x @@@ -@@ @ like operating systems that finds and prints text strings embedded in binary files such as execu@@ tables . it can be used on object files and core dum@@ ps .
common usage includes piping its output to gre@@ p and fold or re@@ directing the output to a file . [ 1 ]
it is part of the GNU B@@ inary Utilities ( bin@@ util@@ s ) , and has been ported to other operating systems including Microsoft Windows . [ 2 ]
example
using strings to print sequences of characters that are at least 8 characters long ( this command prints the system 's B@@ IOS information ; should be run as root ) :

gas is cross @@@ -@@ @ platform , and both runs on and assem@@ bles for a number of different computer architec@@ tures .
released under the GNU General Public License v@@ 3 , GAS is free software .
General syntax
gas supports a general syntax that works for all of the supported architec@@ tures . the general syntax includes assembl@@ er directives and a method for commenting .
directives
comments
gas supports two comment styles : [ 2 ]
as in C multi @@@ -@@ @ line comments start and end with mir@@ r@@ oring sl@@ ash @@@ -@@ @ aster@@ isk pairs :
/ * comment * /
single line comments have a few different formats varying on which architecture is being assembled for .
usage
being the back @@@ -@@ @ end for a popular compil@@ er suite , namely GCC , the GNU Assembl@@ er is very widely used in compiling modern open source software .
gas is often used as the assembl@@ er on GNU / Linux operating systems in conjunction with other GNU software .
a modified version of GAS can also be found in the Mac@@ int@@ os@@ h operating system 's development tools package since OS X.
example Programs
a standard " Hello , world ! " program for Linux on IA @@@ -@@ @ 32 using the default AT & T syntax :
those more accustomed to writing in Intel syntax have argued that not supporting the Intel syntax for assembly on the x@@ 86 and x@@ 86 @@@ -@@ @ 64 platforms , as many other assembl@@ ers do , is a f@@ law .
however , since version 2.10 , Intel syntax can be used through use of the .@@ inte@@ l _ syntax directive . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]

standard signals
the C standard defines only 6 signals . they are all defined in sign@@ al.@@ h header ( c@@ Sig@@ nal header in C + + ) : [ 1 ]
S@@ IG@@ AB@@ RT - " abor@@ t , " abnormal termination .
S@@ IG@@ IL@@ L - " illegal , " invalid instruction .
S@@ IG@@ INT - " interrupt , " interactive attention request sent to the program .
S@@ IG@@ SE@@ G@@ V - " seg@@ mentation violation , " invalid memory access .
S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M - " terminate , " termination request sent to the program .
additional signals may be specified in the sign@@ al.@@ h header by the implementation . for example , Uni@@ x and Uni@@ x @@@ -@@ @ like operating systems ( such as Linux ) define more than 15 additional signals ; see Uni@@ x signal . [ 2 ]
a signal can be generated by calling raise ( ) or kill ( ) system call@@ s. raise ( ) sends a signal to the current process , kill ( ) sends a signal to a specific process .
make successful calls to the function signal ( ) assign values to objects of type volatile si@@ g _ atomic _ t return control to its call@@ er
if the signal reports an error within the program ( and the signal is not as@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous ) , the signal hand@@ ler can terminate by calling abor@@ t ( ) , exit ( ) , or long@@ j@@ mp ( ) .

in 1973 , Cla@@ ude der@@ on and Daniel Denis , both former members of Belgian " Ze@@ u@@ hl " band Ark@@ ham ( which had disban@@ ded the previous year ) , set up a new group , Nec@@ r@@ onom@@ icon .
in 1977 , they released their first e@@ pon@@ y@@ mous album Uni@@ vers Zero , later re@@ mixed and renamed as 13@@ 13 .
the album shows a heavy rock and roll approach despite the fact that the instrumentation was largely acoustic .
the group disban@@ ded in 1987 but reformed in 1999 . in the interim , dr@@ um@@ mer Daniel Denis released two solo albums and joined Art Zo@@ y@@ d , a similar band from France .
since 1999 , Uni@@ vers Z@@ ér@@ O have released five studio albums .
Uni@@ vers Zero ( also known as Uni@@ vers Z@@ ér@@ O and Uni@@ vers @@@ -@@ @ Zero [ 1 ] ) are an instrumental progressive Belgian band formed in 1974 by dr@@ um@@ mer Daniel Denis . the band is known for playing dark music heavily influenced by 20th century chamber music .
according to a booklet that was included in their first album , the band 's name was a reference to a fic@@ tional character , a " gentle giant " that happens upon a band of musicians and is en@@ thr@@ alled with their music . the character is remin@@ is@@ cent of those from the Renaissance tales of Franç@@ ois Rab@@ el@@ ais . [ 7 ]
the band 's first album was the self @@@ -@@ @ titled G@@ ent@@ le Gi@@ ant in 1970 . combining the collective band members ' influences of rock , bl@@ ues , classical , and 1960s British soul , it was an immediately challenging effort , though sometimes critic@@ ised for a slightly disappointing recording quality .
gentle Gi@@ ant at the Mu@@ si@@ k@@ hal@@ le , Hamburg , April 1974
in 1976 , this side of the band was captured on the live album Pla@@ ying the Fo@@ ol , recorded during the European tour for Inter@@ view .
while G@@ ent@@ le Gi@@ ant 's skill as performers remained un@@ diminished , their creative peak was now behind them . affected by changes in popular style ( including the growth of pun@@ k rock ) , the band made a mutual decision to refine their writing and performance style in pursuit of a broader market , particularly in America .
over the next two years , the band gradually j@@ et@@ tis@@ oned many of their complicated styl@@ ings in order to attempt to write simpler pop music and attempt to create hit singles .
the album is a significant departure for Mc@@ Car@@ t@@ ney , as much of it relies heavily on synthe@@ siz@@ ers and studio experi@@ mentation . it was re@@ issued on 13 June 2011 as part of the Paul Mc@@ Car@@ t@@ ney Archive Collection .

there are six major considerations when examining a construct 's validity through the MT@@ MM matrix , which are as follows :
a variety of statistical approaches have been used to analyze the data from the MT@@ MM matrix .
one of the most used models to analyze MT@@ MM data is the Tru@@ e S@@ core model proposed by Sar@@ is and Andre@@ ws ( [ 6 ] ) . the Tru@@ e S@@ core model can be expressed using the following standardized equations :
3 ) Y@@ i@@ j = q@@ ij@@ Fi + ri@@ j@@ mi@@ j@@ M@@ j + e * where : qi@@ j is the quality coefficient , which is equal to : qi@@ j = Ri@@ j • Vi@@ j Con@@ sequ@@ ently : q@@ ij@@ 2 = ri@@ j@@ 2 • vi@@ j@@ 2 = σ@@ 2@@ Fi / σ@@ 2@@ Y@@ i@@ j where : q@@ ij@@ 2 is the quality
the assumptions are the following :

in this example the first row and the first column display the tra@@ it being assessed ( i.e. anxiety or depression ) as well as the method of assessing this tra@@ it ( i.e. interview or survey as measured by fic@@ ti@@ tious measures ) . the term heter@@ om@@ eth@@ od indicates that in this cell the correlation between two separate methods is being reported .

main points
denial of materi@@ alistic existence , in itself , does not constitute sol@@ ip@@ si@@ sm .
a feature of the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sical sol@@ ip@@ si@@ stic world@@ view is the denial of the existence of other minds . since personal experiences are private and ine@@ ff@@ able , another being 's experience can be known only by analogy .
the theory of sol@@ ip@@ si@@ sm also merits close examination because it relates to three widely held philosophical pre@@ sup@@ positions , each itself fundamental and wide @@@ -@@ @ ranging in importance :
history
Gor@@ gi@@ as of Leon@@ tin@@ i
sol@@ ip@@ si@@ sm was first recorded by the Greek pres@@ oc@@ ratic soph@@ ist , Gor@@ gi@@ as ( c . 483 @@@ -@@ @ 375 BC ) who is quoted by the Roman skep@@ tic S@@ ex@@ tus Emp@@ ir@@ ic@@ us as having stated : [ 4 ]
nothing exists . even if something exists , nothing can be known about it . even if something could be known about it , knowledge about it can 't be communicated to others .
much of the point of the S@@ op@@ hi@@ sts was to show that " objective " knowledge was a liter@@ al im@@ possibility . ( see also comments credited to Pro@@ tag@@ or@@ as of Ab@@ der@@ a ) .

history
origin
this innovation was met with interest from other persons needing a lighter artificial leg ; and it resulted in the founding of the Des@@ out@@ ter Company , headed by Mar@@ cel Des@@ out@@ ter .
product lines
from the outset , Des@@ out@@ ter needed to develop specific pneumatic tools to ensure that the aluminum components of the artificial lim@@ bs were dr@@ illed efficiently .
logo
this horse@@ power concept was developed in many of the brand 's advertisements for about twenty years . the managing board at the time even decided that it was the embo@@ di@@ ment of the company 's identity .
in 1973 , the horse 's head was combined with the Des@@ out@@ ter logo script , which was a facsimile of Louis Albert Des@@ out@@ ter 's [ 9 ] signature , [ 10 ] one of the company 's founders .
to mark the cen@@ ten@@ ary of the brand , the emblem recently adopted a more contemporary graphic design .

an initial value problem is a differential equation
together with a point in the domain of f { \ dis@@ play@@ style f }
a solution to an initial value problem is a function y { \ dis@@ play@@ style y } that is a solution to the differential equation and satisfies
for a large class of initial value problems , the existence and uniqueness of a solution can be illustrated through the use of a calculator .
Hiro@@ shi Ok@@ am@@ ura obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique . this condition has to do with the existence of a Ly@@ ap@@ un@@ ov function for the system .
start by noting that y ′ = d y d t { \ dis@@ play@@ style y ' = { \ fra@@ c { dy } { dt } } } , so
now re@@ arrange the equation so that y { \ dis@@ play@@ style y } is on the left and t { \ dis@@ play@@ style t } on the right
now integrate both sides ( this introduces an unknown constant B { \ dis@@ play@@ style B } ) .
eliminate the l@@ n { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ l@@ n }
this gives the final solution of y ( t ) = 19 e 0.@@ 85 t { \ dis@@ play@@ style y ( t ) = 19@@ e ^ { 0.@@ 85@@ t } } .
the solution of
can be found to be

the procedure for calculating the numerical solution to the initial value problem via the improved E@@ ul@@ er 's method is :
by way of He@@ un 's method , is to first calculate the intermediate value y ~ i + 1 { \ dis@@ play@@ style { \ til@@ de { y } } _ { i + 1 } } and then the final approxim@@ ation y i + 1 { \ dis@@ play@@ style y _ { i + 1 } } at the next integration point .
where h { \ dis@@ play@@ style h } is the step size and t i + 1 = t i + h { \ dis@@ play@@ style t _ { i + 1 } = t _ { i } + h } .

typ@@ es@@ cript is a free and open @@@ -@@ @ source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft . it is a strict super@@ set of JavaScript , and adds optional static typing and class @@@ -@@ @ based object @@@ -@@ @ oriented programming to the language .
typ@@ es@@ cript is designed for development of large applications and trans@@ compil@@ es to JavaScript . [ 7 ] As typ@@ es@@ cript is a super@@ set of JavaScript , any existing JavaScript programs are also valid typ@@ es@@ cript programs .
the typ@@ es@@ cript compil@@ er is itself written in typ@@ es@@ cript , trans@@ compiled to JavaScript and licensed under the Ap@@ ache 2 License .
typ@@ es@@ cript 0.9 , released in 2013 , added support for gener@@ ics . [ 19 ] typ@@ es@@ cript 1.0 was released at Build 2014 . [ 20 ] Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provides built @@@ -@@ @ in support for typ@@ es@@ cript . [ 21 ]

on September 22 , 2016 , typ@@ es@@ cript 2.0 was released ; it introduced several features , including the ability for programmers to optionally prevent variables from being assigned null values . [ 23 ]
typ@@ es@@ cript developers sought a solution that would not break compatibility with the standard and its cross @@@ -@@ @ platform support . knowing that the current EC@@ MA@@ Script standard proposal promised future support for class @@@ -@@ @ based programming , typ@@ es@@ cript was based on that proposal .
typ@@ es@@ cript adds support for features such as classes , modules and an arrow function syntax as proposed in the EC@@ MA@@ Script 2015 standard .

typ@@ es@@ cript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time . this is optional and can be ignored to use the regular dynamic typing of JavaScript .
typ@@ es@@ cript supports EC@@ MA@@ Script 2015 classes that integrate the optional type annotations support .

development of the concept
the categor@@ ical view of psycho@@ sis is most associated with Em@@ il Kra@@ ep@@ el@@ in , who created criteria for the medical diagnosis and classification of different forms of psycho@@ tic illness .
in contrast , psychi@@ atr@@ ist E@@ ug@@ en B@@ le@@ ul@@ er did not believe there was a clear separation between san@@ ity and mad@@ ness , believing instead that psycho@@ sis was simply an extreme expression of thoughts and behaviours that could be present to varying degrees throughout the population . [ 2 ]
the concept of psycho@@ sis as a spectrum was further developed by psychologists such as Hans E@@ ys@@ enc@@ k and G@@ ordon Clar@@ id@@ ge , who sought to understand unusual variations in thought and behaviour in terms of personality theory .
E@@ ys@@ enc@@ k conceptu@@ alised cognitive and behavi@@ oral variations as all together forming a single personality tra@@ it , psycho@@ ticism . [ 3 ]

Hu@@ gh of Saint Victor , C.@@ R.@@ S.A. ( c . 10@@ 96 - 11 February 1@@ 141 ) , was a Sax@@ on can@@ on regular and a leading the@@ olog@@ ian and writer on my@@ s@@ tical the@@ ology .
as with many medieval figures , little is known about Hu@@ gh 's early life .
Hu@@ gh was influenced by many people , but chiefly by Saint Aug@@ us@@ tine , especially in holding that the arts and philosophy can serve the@@ ology .
various other works were wrong@@ ly attributed to Hu@@ gh in later thought . one such particularly influential work was the Ex@@ position of the Rule of St Aug@@ us@@ tine , now accepted to be from the Victor@@ ine school but not by Hu@@ gh of St Victor . [ 24 ]
Hu@@ gh was heavily influenced by Aug@@ us@@ tine 's ex@@ eg@@ e@@ sis of Gene@@ sis . divine Wis@@ dom was the arch@@ e@@ typ@@ al form of creation .
his works are in hundreds of libraries all across Europe . he is quoted in many other publications after his death , and Bon@@ a@@ venture p@@ raises him in De reduc@@ ti@@ one Ar@@ tium ad the@@ olog@@ i@@ am .
he was also an influence on the cri@@ tic Edward Said , who cited this passage from Hu@@ gh of St Victor in numerous published works :

as referen@@ tial transparency requires the same results for any given set of inputs at any point in time , a referen@@ tially transparent expression is therefore determin@@ istic .
consider a function that returns the input from some source . in pseud@@ o@@ code , a call to this function might be G@@ et@@ In@@ put ( Source ) where Source might identify a particular disk file , the keyboard , etc .
even with identical values of Source , the successive return values will be different . therefore , function G@@ et@@ In@@ put ( ) is neither determin@@ istic nor referen@@ tially transparent .
as an example , let 's use two functions , one which is referen@@ tially opa@@ que , and the other which is referen@@ tially transparent :
the referen@@ tial op@@ acity of R@@ Q makes reasoning about programs more difficult . for example , say we wish to reason about the following statement :
one may be temp@@ ted to simplify this statement to :
such mathematical identities will hold for referen@@ tially transparent functions such as r@@ t .
however , a more sophisticated analysis can be used to simplify the statement to :
this takes more steps and requires a degree of insight into the code in@@ feasible for compil@@ er optimization .

the L@@ TR x@@ 86 instruction stands for load task register and is used in operating systems that support multi@@ t@@ asking .
L@@ TR is supported only in protected mode and long mode , not in real mode or virtual 80@@ 86 mode . it must be executed when the CP@@ L is 0 , and therefore CA@@ N@@ NOT be used by application programs .
L@@ TR loads the special x@@ 86 task register with a segment selec@@ tor that points to a task state segment .
after executing the L@@ TR instruction , the T@@ SS pointed to by the argument is marked busy , but no hardware task switch occurs .
the opposite of the L@@ TR instruction is the S@@ TR instruction , which copies the value of the task register to the specified location . note that the x@@ 86 task register is only accessible directly through the L@@ TR and S@@ TR instructions .

to invest is to allocate money ( or sometimes another resource , such as time ) in the expectation of some benefit in the future .
investors , particularly no@@ vices , are often advised to adopt an investment strategy and diversify their portfolio . diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk .
investment differs from arbit@@ rage , in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk .
speculation involves a level of risk which is greater than most investors would generally consider justified by the expected return . an alternative characterization of speculation is its short @@@ -@@ @ term , opportun@@ istic nature .
investors famous for their success include W@@ arre@@ n Bu@@ ffe@@ t@@ t .
in the early 19@@ 00@@ s purch@@ asers of stocks , bonds , and other securities were described in media , academia , and commerce as spec@@ ulators .
by the 1950s , the term investment had come to den@@ ote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum , while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vo@@ gue at that time .
since the last half of the 20th century , the terms speculation and spec@@ ulator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures .
a popular valuation metric is Ear@@ nings Before Interest , Tax , De@@ preciation and Amor@@ tization ( EB@@ IT@@ DA ) , with application for example to valu@@ ing un@@ listed companies and mergers and acquisitions . [ 7 ]

his sixth son , Maj@@ id bin Said , became ruler of an independent Sultan@@ ate of Zan@@ zi@@ bar on October 19 , 18@@ 56 . [ 1 ] The Sul@@ t@@ ans of Zan@@ zi@@ bar were thereafter obliged to pay an annual tribute to Mus@@ cat . [ 2 ]
the discovery of oil in the Persian Gulf exacerbated the dispute between the Sul@@ tan in Mus@@ cat and the Im@@ ams of Oman .
oil exploration had begun in the early 19@@ 20@@ s by the Angl@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Persian Oil Company . [ 3 ] The course of the second world war severely disrupted such activities .
in 1976 , again with British aid , the Sul@@ tan secured his hold over the entire interior and suppressed the D@@ ho@@ far rebellion .
the So@@ har Sultan@@ ate lasted from 1920 until about 1932 .
in 1920 , She@@ ik Ali Ban@@ u B@@ u Ali , a relative of Sul@@ tan T@@ aim@@ ur bin Fa@@ is@@ al , rebel@@ led in the northern town of So@@ har and proclaimed himself Sul@@ tan but was de@@ posed by the British in 1932 .

the last I@@ mam of Oman , Ghal@@ ib Bin Ali , started an uprising in 1954 when the Sul@@ tan granted licenses to the Iraq Petroleum Company despite the fact that the largest oil fields lay inside the Im@@ am@@ ate .
the hostilities were put down in 1955 , but the longer conflict would evolve into the Je@@ bel Ak@@ hd@@ ar rebellion , where Sul@@ tan Said bin T@@ aim@@ ur relied heavily on continued British military support . Iraq Petroleum , along with its operator of oil exploration , Petroleum Development Oman , was owned by European oil gi@@ ants including Angl@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Iranian Oil 's successor British Petroleum which encouraged the British government to extend their support to the Sul@@ tan .

examples of trans@@ cend@@ ental functions include the expon@@ ential function , the log@@ arith@@ m , and the trig@@ onom@@ e@@ tric functions .
formally , an analy@@ tic function ƒ ( z ) of one real or complex variable z is trans@@ cend@@ ental if it is alge@@ bra@@ ically independent of that variable . [ 3 ] This can be extended to functions of several variables .
a function that is not trans@@ cend@@ ental is alge@@ bra@@ ic . simple examples of alge@@ bra@@ ic functions are the rational functions and the square root function , but in general , alge@@ bra@@ ic functions CA@@ N@@ NOT be defined as finite formulas of the elementary functions . [ 4 ]
differential alge@@ bra examines how integration frequently creates functions that are alge@@ bra@@ ically independent of some class , such as when one takes poly@@ nom@@ ials with trig@@ onom@@ e@@ tric functions as variables .
most familiar trans@@ cend@@ ental functions , including the special functions of mathematical physics , are solutions of alge@@ bra@@ ic differential equations . those that are not , such as the gam@@ ma and the z@@ eta functions , are called trans@@ cend@@ entally trans@@ cend@@ ental or hyper@@ trans@@ cend@@ ental functions .
in general , finding the exceptional set of a function is a difficult problem , but it has been calculated for some functions :

dimensional analysis
the following functions are trans@@ cend@@ ental :
the indefinite integral of many alge@@ bra@@ ic functions is trans@@ cend@@ ental . for example , the log@@ arith@@ m function arose from the reciprocal function in an effort to find the area of a hyper@@ bol@@ ic sector .

a stati@@ stic ( sing@@ ular ) or sample stati@@ stic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . it is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
observ@@ ability
more formally , statistical theory defines a stati@@ stic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . the term stati@@ stic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .
properties
it can be shown that choosing the optimal coefficient
we would like to estimate
and U follows a uniform distribution [ 0 , 1 ] . using a sample of size n den@@ ote the points in the sample as u 1 , ⋯ , u n { \ dis@@ play@@ style u _ { 1 } , \ c@@ do@@ ts , u _ { n } } . then the estimate is given by

where
is the correlation coefficient of m and t . the greater the value of | ρ m , t | { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ vert \ r@@ ho _ { m , t } \ vert } , the greater the variance reduction achieved .
using Mon@@ te Car@@ lo integration . this integral is the expected value of f ( U ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style f ( U ) } , where
using n = 1500 { \ dis@@ play@@ style n = 1500 } real@@ izations and an estimated optimal coefficient c ⋆ ≈ 0.@@ 47@@ 73 { \ dis@@ play@@ style c ^ { \ star } \ approx 0.@@ 47@@ 73 } we obtain the following results

equals 1 on the closed interval [ b , c ] and van@@ ishes outside the open interval ( a , d ) .
approxim@@ ation of the smooth @@@ -@@ @ everywhere , but nowhere @@@ -@@ @ analy@@ tic function mentioned here . this partial sum is taken from k = 20 to 2500 .
where we used the fact that cos ( K@@ X ) = 1 for all k > q . as a consequence , at any such x ∈ R
this function h is also smooth ; it equals 1 on the closed interval [ − 1,@@ 1 ] and van@@ ishes outside the open interval ( − 2,@@ 2 ) . using h , define for every natural number n ( including zero ) the smooth function
with the smooth transition function g as above , define
which agrees with the mon@@ om@@ ial x@@ n on [ − 1,@@ 1 ] and van@@ ishes outside the interval ( − 2,@@ 2 ) . hence , the k @@@ -@@ @ th deri@@ vative of ψ@@ n at the origin satisfies
involving the Su@@ pre@@ m@@ um norm of ψ@@ n and its first n derivatives , are well @@@ -@@ @ defined real numbers . define the scaled functions
and the b@@ oun@@ de@@ dness theore@@ m implies that ψ@@ n and every deri@@ vative of ψ@@ n is b@@ ounded . therefore , the con@@ stants
by repeated application of the chain rule ,
and , using the previous result for the k @@@ -@@ @ th deri@@ vative of ψ@@ n at zero ,
the function Ψ@@ 1 ( x ) in one dimension .
it remains to show that the function
is well defined and can be differentiated term @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ term in@@ finitely often . [ 2 ] To this end , observe that for every k
where the remaining infinite series conver@@ ges by the ratio test .
for every radius r > 0 ,
with Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an norm | | x | | defines a smooth function on n @@@ -@@ @ dimensional Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an space with support in the ball of radius r , but Ψ r ( 0 ) > 0 { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ P@@ si _ { r } ( 0 ) > 0 } .
one of the most important applications of smooth functions with compact support is the construction of so @@@ -@@ @ called mol@@ li@@ fiers , which are important in theories of generalized functions , like e.g. Lau@@ rent Sch@@ war@@ tz 's theory of distributions .
the functions below are generally used to build up partitions of unity on differenti@@ able manif@@ olds .
the non @@@ -@@ @ analy@@ tic smooth function considered in the article .
consider the function
the function f has continuous derivatives of all orders in all points x of the real line , given by
where p@@ n ( x ) is a poly@@ nom@@ ial of degree n − 1 given recur@@ sively by p@@ 1 ( x ) = 1 and
the proof , by induction , is based on the fact that for any non@@ negative integer m ,
this implies that all f ( n ) are continuous and differenti@@ able at x = 0 , because
by the power series representation of the expon@@ ential function , we have for every natural number m ( including zero )
because all the positive terms for n ≠ m + 1 are added . therefore , using the functional equation of the expon@@ ential function ,
the induction step from n to n + 1 is similar . for x > 0 we get for the deri@@ vative
as seen earlier , the function f is smooth , and all its derivatives at the origin are 0 . therefore , the Taylor series of f at the origin conver@@ ges everywhere to the zero function ,
note that although the function f has derivatives of all orders over the real line , the analy@@ tic continuation of f from the positive half @@@ -@@ @ line x > 0 to the complex plane , that is , the function
the smooth transition g from 0 to 1 defined here .

a paper where the differenti@@ ability of solutions of el@@ lip@@ tic partial differential equations is investigated by using mol@@ li@@ fiers .
in mathematics , mol@@ li@@ fiers ( also known as approxim@@ ations to the identity ) are smooth functions with special properties , used for example in distribution theory to create sequences of smooth functions approxim@@ ating non@@ smooth ( generalized ) functions , via con@@ v@@ olution .
it must be pointed out that there is a little misunderstanding in the concept of mol@@ li@@ fier : Fried@@ rich@@ s defined as " mol@@ li@@ fier " the integral operator whose kernel is one of the functions nowadays called mol@@ li@@ fiers .
however , since the properties of a linear integral operator are completely determined by its kernel , the name mol@@ l@@ fier was inherited by the kernel itself as a result of common usage .
definition 1 . if φ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ var@@ ph@@ i } is a smooth function on ℝ@@ n , n ≥ 1 , satisfying the following three requirements
note 2 .
as briefly pointed out in the " Historical notes " section of this entry , originally , the term " mol@@ li@@ fier " identified the following con@@ v@@ olution operator : [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
where φ ϵ ( x ) = ϵ − n φ ( x / ϵ ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ scrip@@ t@@ style \ var@@ ph@@ i _ { \ ep@@ sil@@ on } ( x ) = \ ep@@ sil@@ on ^ { -@@ n } \ var@@ ph@@ i ( x / \ ep@@ sil@@ on ) } and φ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ var@@ ph@@ i } is a smooth function satisfying the first three conditions stated above and one or more supplementary conditions as posi@@ tivity and sym@@ metry .
consider the function φ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ var@@ ph@@ i } ( x ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style ( x ) } of a variable in ℝ@@ n defined by
the function φ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ var@@ ph@@ i } ( x ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style ( x ) } in dimension one
all properties of a mol@@ li@@ fier are related to its behaviour under the operation of con@@ v@@ olution : we list the following ones , whose proof@@ s can be found in every text on distribution theory . [ 14 ]
for any distribution T { \ dis@@ play@@ style T } , the following family of con@@ v@@ olutions inde@@ xed by the real number ϵ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ ep@@ sil@@ on }
where ∗ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ ast } den@@ o@@ tes con@@ v@@ olution , is a family of smooth functions .
for any distribution T { \ dis@@ play@@ style T } , the following family of con@@ v@@ olutions inde@@ xed by the real number ϵ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ ep@@ sil@@ on } conver@@ ges to T { \ dis@@ play@@ style T }
for any distribution T { \ dis@@ play@@ style T } ,
where s u p p { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ ma@@ thr@@ m { Sup@@ p } } indicates the support in the sense of distributions , and + { \ dis@@ play@@ style + } indicates their Min@@ k@@ ow@@ ski addition .
the basic applications of mol@@ li@@ fiers is to prove properties valid for smooth functions also in non@@ smooth situations :
in some theories of generalized functions , mol@@ li@@ fiers are used to define the multi@@ plication of distributions : precisely , given two distributions S { \ dis@@ play@@ style S } and T { \ dis@@ play@@ style T } , the limit of the product of a smooth function and a distribution
defines ( if it exists ) their product in various theories of generalized functions .

consider the ordinary differential equation
the backward E@@ ul@@ er method compu@@ tes the approxim@@ ations using
if this sequence conver@@ ges ( within a given tolerance ) , then the method takes its limit as the new approxim@@ ation y k + 1 { \ dis@@ play@@ style y _ { k + 1 } } . [ 2 ]
alternatively , one can use ( some modification of ) the New@@ ton @@@ -@@ @ Rap@@ h@@ son method to solve the alge@@ bra@@ ic equation .
now approximate the integral on the right by the right @@@ -@@ @ hand rectangle method ( with one rectangle ) :
finally , use that y n { \ dis@@ play@@ style y _ { n } } is supposed to approximate y ( t n ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style y ( t _ { n } ) } and the formula for the backward E@@ ul@@ er method follows . [ 3 ]
the same reasoning leads to the ( standard ) E@@ ul@@ er method if the left @@@ -@@ @ hand rectangle rule is used instead of the right @@@ -@@ @ hand one .
the pink region outside the disk shows the stability region of the backward E@@ ul@@ er method .
the backward E@@ ul@@ er method has order one . this means that the local trun@@ cation error ( defined as the error made in one step ) is O ( h 2 ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style O ( h ^ { 2 } ) } , using the big O no@@ tation . the error at a specific time t { \ dis@@ play@@ style t } is O ( h ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style O ( h ) } .
the backward E@@ ul@@ er method is a variant of the ( forward ) E@@ ul@@ er method . other variants are the semi @@@ -@@ @ implicit E@@ ul@@ er method and the expon@@ ential E@@ ul@@ er method .
the backward E@@ ul@@ er method can be seen as a Run@@ ge @@@ -@@ @ Ku@@ tta method with one stage , described by the But@@ cher tabl@@ eau :
the backward E@@ ul@@ er method can also be seen as a linear multi@@ step method with one step . it is the first method of the family of Ad@@ ams @@@ -@@ @ M@@ oul@@ ton methods , and also of the family of backward differentiation formulas .

the tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ idal rule is given by the formula
where h = t n + 1 − t n { \ dis@@ play@@ style h = t _ { n + 1 } -@@ t _ { n } } is the step size . [ 1 ]
integrating the differential equation from t n { \ dis@@ play@@ style t _ { n } } to t n + 1 { \ dis@@ play@@ style t _ { n + 1 } } , we find that
the tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ idal rule states that the integral on the right @@@ -@@ @ hand side can be approxim@@ ated as
now combine both formulas and use that y n ≈ y ( t n ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style y _ { n } \ approx y ( t _ { n } ) } and y n + 1 ≈ y ( t n + 1 ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style y _ { n + 1 } \ approx y ( t _ { n + 1 } ) } to get the tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ idal rule for solving ordinary differential equations . [ 3 ]
it follows from the error analysis of the tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ idal rule for quad@@ r@@ ature that the local trun@@ cation error τ n { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ tau _ { n } } of the tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ idal rule for solving differential equations can be b@@ ounded as :

( note : H@@ ask@@ ell documentation uses the same arrow for both function types and kinds . )
H@@ ask@@ ell 's kind system [ 3 ] has just two rules :
examples
standard H@@ ask@@ ell does not allow poly@@ mor@@ phic kinds . this is in contrast to parame@@ tric poly@@ morph@@ ism on types , which is supported in H@@ ask@@ ell . for instance , in the following example :
because the kind of [ ] , ∗ → ∗ { \ dis@@ play@@ style * \ righ@@ tar@@ row * } does not match the expected kind for z , which is always ∗ { \ dis@@ play@@ style * } .
for instance : higher @@@ -@@ @ order type operators are allowed however .
for example : GH@@ C has the extension Poly@@ Kin@@ ds , which , together with K@@ ind@@ Signat@@ ures , allows poly@@ mor@@ phic kinds .

packing circles in simple b@@ ounded shapes is a common type of problem in recreational mathematics . the influence of the container walls is important , and hex@@ ag@@ onal packing is generally not optimal for small numbers of circles .
there are also a range of problems which permit the sizes of the circles to be non @@@ -@@ @ uniform .
one such extension is to find the maximum possible density of a system with two specific sizes of circle ( a binary system ) .
circle packing has become an essential tool in orig@@ ami design , as each ap@@ pend@@ age on an orig@@ ami figure requires a circle of paper . [ 10 ] Robert J. Lan@@ g has used the mathematics of circle packing to develop computer programs that aid in the design of complex orig@@ ami figures .

in Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an space
in geometry , a uniform til@@ ing is a t@@ ess@@ ell@@ ation of the plane by regular poly@@ gon faces with the restriction of being verte@@ x @@@ -@@ @ transi@@ tive .
uniform til@@ ings can exist in both the Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an plane and hyper@@ bol@@ ic plane . uniform til@@ ings are related to the finite uniform poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a which can be considered uniform til@@ ings of the sphere .
finally til@@ ings can be described by their verte@@ x configuration , the sequence of poly@@ g@@ ons around each verte@@ x .
Co@@ x@@ e@@ ter groups for the plane define the W@@ y@@ th@@ off construction and can be represented by Co@@ x@@ e@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ D@@ yn@@ kin diagrams :

it is one of three regular til@@ ings of the plane . the other two are the square til@@ ing and the hex@@ ag@@ onal til@@ ing .
the verte@@ x arrangement of the triangular til@@ ing is called an A2 lat@@ tice . [ 2 ] It is the 2 @@@ -@@ @ dimensional case of a simpl@@ ec@@ tic hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b .
the A * 2 lat@@ tice ( also called A@@ 3 2 ) can be constructed by the union of all three A2 lat@@ tices , and equivalent to the A2 lat@@ tice .
+ + = dual of =
the ver@@ tices of the triangular til@@ ing are the centers of the den@@ s@@ est possible circle packing . [ 3 ] Every circle is in contact with 6 other circles in the packing ( kis@@ sing number ) . the packing density is π ⁄ √ 12 or 9@@ 0.@@ 69 % .
since the union of 3 A2 lat@@ tices is also an A2 lat@@ tice , the circle packing can be given with 3 colors of circles .
the vor@@ on@@ o@@ i cell of a triangular til@@ ing is a hex@@ agon , and so the vor@@ on@@ o@@ i t@@ ess@@ ell@@ ation , the hex@@ ag@@ onal til@@ ing has a direct correspondence to the circle pack@@ ings .
this til@@ ing is top@@ ologically related as a part of sequence of regular poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a with Sch@@ l@@ ä@@ fl@@ i symbols { 3 , n } , continuing into the hyper@@ bol@@ ic plane .
it is also top@@ ologically related as a part of sequence of Catal@@ an solids with face configuration V@@ n.@@ 6.6 , and also continuing into the hyper@@ bol@@ ic plane .
like the uniform poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a there are eight uniform til@@ ings that can be based from the regular hex@@ ag@@ onal til@@ ing ( or the dual triangular til@@ ing ) .
drawing the tiles colored as red on the original faces , yellow at the original ver@@ tices , and blue along the original edges , there are 8 forms , 7 which are top@@ ologically distinct . ( the trun@@ c@@ ated triangular til@@ ing is top@@ ologically identical to the hex@@ ag@@ onal til@@ ing . )

example : a trun@@ c@@ ated cu@@ be 3.@@ 8.8 has an angle defect of 30 degrees . therefore , it has 720 / 30 = 24 ver@@ tices .
sem@@ i@@ regular poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a have verte@@ x configurations with positive angle defect .
note : the verte@@ x figure can represent a regular or sem@@ i@@ regular til@@ ing on the plane if its defect is zero . it can represent a til@@ ing of the hyper@@ bol@@ ic plane if its defect is negative .
for uniform poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a , the angle defect can be used to compu@@ te the number of ver@@ tices .
Des@@ car@@ tes ' theore@@ m states that all the angle defects in a top@@ ological sphere must sum to 4@@ π radi@@ ans or 720 degrees .
since uniform poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a have all identical ver@@ tices , this relation allows us to compu@@ te the number of ver@@ tices , which is 4@@ π / defect or 720 / defect .
in particular it follows that { a , b } has 4 / ( 2 - b ( 1 - 2 / a ) ) ver@@ tices .
every enumerated verte@@ x configuration potentially uniquely defines a sem@@ i@@ regular poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on . however , not all configurations are possible .
the number in paren@@ theses is the number of ver@@ tices , determined by the angle defect .

verte@@ x configuration List of regular poly@@ top@@ es
the verte@@ x figure of a triangular pr@@ ism is an is@@ os@@ cel@@ es triangle . the triangle face makes the short edge , and the two square faces make the long edges . a shor@@ th@@ and no@@ tation for this verte@@ x figure is 3.@@ 4.4
the verte@@ x figure for a great ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dr@@ on is a regular pent@@ agra@@ m or star poly@@ gon { 5 / 2 } .
in geometry , a verte@@ x figure , broadly speaking , is the figure exposed when a corner of a poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on or poly@@ t@@ ope is s@@ lic@@ ed off .
Cro@@ m@@ well ( 1999 ) makes a s@@ pher@@ ical cut or sco@@ op , centered on the verte@@ x . the cut surface or verte@@ x figure is thus a s@@ pher@@ ical poly@@ gon marked on this sphere .
many comb@@ in@@ atorial and compu@@ tational approaches ( e.g. Sk@@ illing , 1975 ) treat a verte@@ x figure as the ordered ( or partially ordered ) set of points of all the neighboring ( connected via an edge ) ver@@ tices to the given verte@@ x .
this set of elements is elsewhere known as a verte@@ x star .
a verte@@ x figure for an n @@@ -@@ @ poly@@ t@@ ope is an ( n − 1 ) -@@ poly@@ t@@ ope . for example , a verte@@ x figure for a poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on is a poly@@ gon figure , and the verte@@ x figure for a 4 @@@ -@@ @ poly@@ t@@ ope is a poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on .
by considering the connectivity of these neighboring ver@@ tices an ( n − 1 ) -@@ poly@@ t@@ ope , the verte@@ x figure , can be constructed for each verte@@ x of a poly@@ t@@ ope :
verte@@ x figures are the most useful for uniform poly@@ top@@ es because one verte@@ x figure can en@@ code the entire poly@@ t@@ ope .
for poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a , the verte@@ x figure can be represented by a verte@@ x configuration no@@ tation , by listing the faces in sequence around a verte@@ x . for example 3.4.@@ 4.4 is a verte@@ x with one triangle and three squares , and it represents the r@@ hom@@ bic@@ ub@@ oc@@ ta@@ he@@ dr@@ on .
if the poly@@ t@@ ope is verte@@ x @@@ -@@ @ transi@@ tive , the verte@@ x figure will exist in a hyper@@ plane surface of the n @@@ -@@ @ space . in general the verte@@ x figure need not be plan@@ ar .
for non@@ conve@@ x poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a , the verte@@ x figure may also be non@@ conve@@ x . uniform poly@@ top@@ es , for instance , can have star poly@@ g@@ ons for faces or for verte@@ x figures .
for a uniform poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on , the face of the dual poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on may be found from the original poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on 's verte@@ x figure using the " Dor@@ man Luke " construction .
if a poly@@ t@@ ope is regular , it can be represented by a Sch@@ l@@ ä@@ fl@@ i symbol and both the cell and the verte@@ x figure can be tri@@ vi@@ ally extracted from this no@@ tation .
for a regular poly@@ he@@ dr@@ on { p , q } , the verte@@ x figure is { q } , a q @@@ -@@ @ gon . example , the verte@@ x figure for a cu@@ be { 4,@@ 3 } , is the triangle { 3 } .
trun@@ c@@ ated cubic hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b ( partial ) .
the verte@@ x figure of a trun@@ c@@ ated cubic hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b is a non@@ uniform square pyramid . one oc@@ ta@@ he@@ dr@@ on and four trun@@ c@@ ated cu@@ bes meet at each verte@@ x form a space @@@ -@@ @ filling t@@ ess@@ ell@@ ation .
verte@@ x figure : a non@@ uniform square pyramid Sch@@ le@@ gel diagram Per@@ spective Cre@@ ated as a square base from an oc@@ ta@@ he@@ dr@@ on ( 3.3.@@ 3.3 ) And four is@@ os@@ cel@@ es triangle sides from trun@@ c@@ ated cu@@ bes ( 3.@@ 8.8 )
related to the verte@@ x figure , an edge figure is the verte@@ x figure of a verte@@ x figure . [ 3 ] E@@ dge figures are useful for expressing relations between the elements within regular and uniform poly@@ top@@ es .
regular poly@@ top@@ es ( and hon@@ ey@@ comb@@ s ) have a single edge figure which is also regular . for a regular poly@@ t@@ ope { p , q , r , s , ... , z } , the edge figure is { r , s , ... , z } .
less tri@@ vi@@ ally , the trun@@ c@@ ated cubic hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b t@@ 0,@@ 1 { 4,@@ 3,@@ 4 } , has a square pyramid verte@@ x figure , with trun@@ c@@ ated cu@@ be and oc@@ ta@@ he@@ dr@@ on cells . here there are two types of edge figures . one is a square edge figure at the ap@@ ex of the pyramid .

sp@@ ice was developed at the Electronics Research Laboratory of the University of California , Berk@@ ele@@ y by Lau@@ rence Nag@@ el with direction from his research advisor , Prof. Donald Pe@@ derson .
SP@@ IC@@ E@@ 1 was largely a deri@@ vative of the CA@@ N@@ CE@@ R program , [ 4 ] which Nag@@ el had worked on under Prof. Ron@@ ald Ro@@ h@@ rer .
it is written in C , uses the same net@@ list syntax , and added X Window System plo@@ tting .
as an early public domain software program with source code available , [ 11 ] SP@@ ICE was widely distributed and used .
the birth of SP@@ ICE was named an IE@@ EE Mil@@ e@@ stone in 2011 ; the entry mentions that SP@@ ICE " evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simul@@ ator . " [ 21 ]
SP@@ IC@@ E2 included these analyses :
since SP@@ ICE is generally used to model non@@ linear circuits , the small signal analyses are necessarily preceded by a qu@@ i@@ es@@ cent point calculation at which the circuit is linear@@ ized .
SP@@ IC@@ E@@ 3 retained the net@@ list for circuit description , but allowed analyses to be controlled from a command @@@ -@@ @ line interface similar to the C shell . SP@@ IC@@ E@@ 3 also added basic X plo@@ tting , as UNI@@ X and engineering work@@ stations became common .

in general , medical intervention is limited to symp@@ tom@@ atic therapy . before pregnancy , patients with E@@ DS should have genetic counseling and familiarize themselves with the risks to their own bodies that pregnancy poses .
in this case , emotional support and behavi@@ oral and psychological therapy can be useful . support groups can be immen@@ sely helpful for patients dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health . family members , teachers , and friends should be informed about E@@ DS so they can accept and assist the child .
studies have shown that local an@@ esthe@@ tics , ar@@ ter@@ ial ca@@ the@@ ters and central ven@@ ous ca@@ the@@ ters cause a higher risk in ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma formation in patients with E@@ h@@ lers @@@ -@@ @ Dan@@ los syndrome .
E@@ h@@ lers @@@ -@@ @ Dan@@ los syndrome patients also show a resistance to local an@@ aesthe@@ tics . [ 46 ] Resistance to X@@ y@@ loc@@ aine and bu@@ pi@@ vac@@ aine is not un@@ common , and Car@@ b@@ oc@@ aine tends to work better in E@@ DS patents .
surgery with E@@ h@@ lers @@@ -@@ @ Dan@@ los patients requires careful tissue handling and a longer im@@ mobilization after@@ ward .
signs vary widely based on which type of E@@ DS the patient has . in each case , however , the signs are ultimately due to fa@@ ulty or reduced amounts of coll@@ agen .
E@@ DS typically affects the joints , skin , and blood vessels . following is a list of major signs and symptoms .
because it is often un@@ diagnosed or mis@@ diagnosed in childhood , some instances of E@@ h@@ lers @@@ -@@ @ Dan@@ los syndrome have been mis@@ characterized as child abuse . [ 34 ]

consider the following example in set @@@ -@@ @ buil@@ der no@@ tation .
in this annotated version of the example :
a list comprehen@@ sion has the same syn@@ t@@ actic components to represent generation of a list in order from an input list or iter@@ ator :
the order of generation of members of the output list is based on the order of items in the input .
x { \ dis@@ play@@ style x } is the variable representing members of an input set .
an input list ( or iter@@ ator ) . an optional predic@@ ate expression . and an output expression producing members of the output list from members of the input I@@ ter@@ able that satisfy the predic@@ ate .
in H@@ ask@@ ell 's list comprehen@@ sion syntax , this set @@@ -@@ @ buil@@ der construct would be written similarly , as :
here , the list [ 0 .. ] represents N { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ ma@@ th@@ b@@ b { N } } , x ^ 2 > 3 represents the predic@@ ate , and 2 * x represents the output expression .
the Set@@ l programming language ( 1969 ) has a set formation construct which is similar to list comprehen@@ sions . this code prints all prime numbers from 2 to N :
Sm@@ all@@ talk block context messages which constitute list comprehen@@ sions have been in that language since at least Sm@@ all@@ talk @@@ -@@ @ 80 .
Bur@@ stall and Dar@@ l@@ ington 's work with NP@@ L influenced many functional programming languages during the 1980s , but not all included list comprehen@@ sions .
an exception was the influential pure la@@ zy functional programming language Mir@@ anda , which was released in 1985 . the subsequently developed standard pure la@@ zy functional language H@@ ask@@ ell includes many of Mir@@ anda 's features , including list comprehen@@ sions .
comprehen@@ sions were proposed as a query no@@ tation for databases [ 1 ] and were implemented in the Kle@@ isl@@ i database query language . [ 2 ]
in H@@ ask@@ ell , a mon@@ ad comprehen@@ sion is a gener@@ alization of the list comprehen@@ sion to other mon@@ ads in functional programming .
version 3.@@ x and 2.7 of the Py@@ th@@ on language introduces syntax for set comprehen@@ sions . similar in form to list comprehen@@ sions , set comprehen@@ sions generate Py@@ th@@ on sets instead of lists .
rac@@ ket set comprehen@@ sions generate Rac@@ ket sets instead of lists .
version 3.@@ x and 2.7 of the Py@@ th@@ on language introduced a new syntax for dictionary comprehen@@ sions , similar in form to list comprehen@@ sions but which generate Py@@ th@@ on dic@@ ts instead of lists .
rac@@ ket h@@ ash table comprehen@@ sions generate Rac@@ ket h@@ ash tables ( one implementation of the Rac@@ ket dictionary type ) .
in Py@@ th@@ on we could do as follows :
like the original NP@@ L use , these are fundamentally database access languages .
in X@@ Path , the expression :
is concep@@ tually evaluated as a series of " steps " where each step produces a list and the next step applies a filter function to each element in the previous step 's output . [ 3 ]
in X@@ Query , full X@@ Path is available , but FL@@ W@@ OR statements are also used , which is a more powerful comprehen@@ sion construct . [ 4 ]
so , in another functional language the above FL@@ W@@ OR statement may be implemented like this :
C # 3.0 has a group of related features called LIN@@ Q , which defines a set of query operators for manip@@ ulating object enum@@ er@@ ations .
it also offers an alternative comprehen@@ sion syntax , remin@@ is@@ cent of SQL :
this allows , amongst other things , for the I@@ Qu@@ er@@ y@@ able to
re@@ write an incompatible or inefficient comprehen@@ sion translate the AS@@ T into another query language ( e.g. SQL ) for execution
there is some effort in providing C + + with list @@@ -@@ @ comprehen@@ sion construc@@ ts / syntax similar to the set buil@@ der no@@ tation .

whenever a new node joins , three invari@@ ants should be maintained ( the first two ensure correctness and the last one keeps quer@@ ying fast ) :
each node 's successor points to its immediate successor correctly . each key is stored in s u c c e s s o r ( k ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style successor ( k ) } . each node 's finger table should be correct .
initi@@ alize node n { \ dis@@ play@@ style n } ( the predecessor and the finger table ) . notify other nodes to update their predecessors and finger tables . the new node takes over its responsible keys from its successor .

history at a glance
Hor@@ ch [ h@@ ɔ@@ ʁ@@ ç ] was a car brand manufactured in Germany by August Hor@@ ch & Ci@@ e , at the beginning of the 20th century .
it is the direct ance@@ stor of the present day Aud@@ i company , which in turn came out of Auto Union , formed in 1932 when Hor@@ ch merged with DK@@ W , W@@ an@@ de@@ rer and the historic Aud@@ i enterprise which August Hor@@ ch founded in 1910 .

Hor@@ ch 670 , 12 @@@ -@@ @ cylinder luxury cab@@ ri@@ ol@@ et ( 1932 )
August Hor@@ ch and his first business partner S@@ all@@ i Her@@ z established the company on November 14 , 18@@ 99 in the district of E@@ h@@ ren@@ fel@@ d , Cologne in Cologne . [ 1 ] August Hor@@ ch had previously worked as a production manager for Kar@@ l Ben@@ z .
three years later , in 19@@ 02 , he moved the company to Re@@ ic@@ hen@@ b@@ ach im V@@ og@@ tland .
on May 10 , 1904 he founded the Hor@@ ch & Ci@@ e . Motor@@ wag@@ en@@ wer@@ ke AG , a joint @@@ -@@ @ stock company in Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au ( Kingdom of Sax@@ ony ) .
the city of Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au was the capital of the South Western Sax@@ on County and one of Sax@@ ony 's industrial centres at that time .
in 1932 both companies from Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au ( Hor@@ ch and Aud@@ i ) merged with Z@@ sch@@ op@@ au@@ er Mo@@ to@@ ren@@ wer@@ ke J. S. Ras@@ mus@@ sen ( the DK@@ W brand ) and the W@@ an@@ de@@ rer car @@@ -@@ @ production facilities to become the Auto Union corporation of Sax@@ ony .
the company initially began producing 5 h@@ p ( 3.7 kW ; 5.1 PS ) and 10 h@@ p ( 7.5 kW ; 10 PS ) twin @@@ -@@ @ cylinder engine automo@@ bil@@ es near Cologne in 19@@ 01 .
the firm soon ran into financial troubles , not surprising considering the pioneering nature of the automobile business at that time . Hor@@ ch had to seek new partners .
in March 19@@ 02 , August Hor@@ ch produced a 20 h@@ p ( 15 kW ; 20 PS ) four @@@ -@@ @ cylinder car with a shaft drive in Re@@ ic@@ hen@@ b@@ ach in V@@ og@@ tland .
Hor@@ ch cars were considered more advanced and superior to those being then built by Mercedes or Ben@@ z ( who were then separate manufacturers ) .
by 19@@ 03 , Hor@@ ch had built a car with a four @@@ -@@ @ cylinder engine . in March of the following year , he introduced his new car at the Frankfurt Fair .

in 19@@ 06 a Hor@@ ch automobile driven by Dr. Rud@@ ol@@ f St@@ ö@@ ss from Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au won the Her@@ kom@@ er Competition ( equivalent to a ' brand @@@ -@@ @ name ' world championship at the time ) .
in 1923 , Paul D@@ aim@@ ler ( a Sta@@ uss associate ) worked for Hor@@ ch as the chief engineer for 8 @@@ -@@ @ cylinder engines . Hor@@ ch vehicles were subsequently the first to introduce 8 @@@ -@@ @ cylinder engines in series production .
in 19@@ 09 , the supervisory board ( the German equivalent of the Board of Directors ) of the corporation forced out Hor@@ ch .
in 1928 , the company was acquired by J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen Sk@@ af@@ te Ras@@ mus@@ sen , owner of DK@@ W ( from the German D@@ amp@@ f@@ kra@@ f@@ tw@@ agen , or steam engine vehicle ) who had bought the remains of the US automobile manufacturer R@@ ick@@ en@@ back@@ er in the same year .
the R@@ ick@@ en@@ back@@ er purchase included their manufacturing equipment for eight @@@ -@@ @ cylinder engines .
eventually , on 29 June 1932 , Hor@@ ch , Aud@@ i , DK@@ W and W@@ an@@ de@@ rer merged to form the Auto Union AG , Chem@@ nit@@ z affiliated group . the current Aud@@ i four @@@ -@@ @ ring logo is the Auto Union logo that represents the merger of these four brands .
in the 19@@ 30s , Hor@@ ch introduced a new line of smaller and cheaper , but still pres@@ en@@ table , V@@ 8 automo@@ bil@@ es .
in 1936 , Hor@@ ch presented the 25,@@ 000@@ th 8 @@@ -@@ @ cylinder luxury car in Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au .
the Auto Union Grand Prix racing cars types A to D , were developed and built by a specialist racing department of Hor@@ ch works in Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au between 1933 and 1939 .
between 1935 and 1937 Auto Union cars won 25 races , driven by Er@@ n@@ st von Deli@@ us , T@@ az@@ io Nu@@ vol@@ ari , Ber@@ nd Ros@@ eme@@ yer , Hans St@@ uck and A@@ chil@@ le Var@@ zi .
11 . auto Union became a major supplier of vehicles to the German We@@ hr@@ mach@@ t , such as Heavy standard passenger car ( Hor@@ ch 108 ) , Medium standard passenger car ( Hor@@ ch 9@@ 01 and W@@ an@@ de@@ rer 9@@ 01 ) and Hal@@ f @@@ -@@ @ track S@@ d.@@ K@@ f@@ z@@ . Civilian production was suspended after March 1940 .
D@@ aim@@ ler @@@ -@@ @ Ben@@ z retained the trademark rights to the Hor@@ ch brand until the mid 1980s .
from 1955 @@@ -@@ @ 1958 , old Hor@@ ch factories produced the Hor@@ ch P@@ 240 , a 6 @@@ -@@ @ cylinder car that was respected at the time .
the former Hor@@ ch and Aud@@ i operations from Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au were unified in 1958 . a new brand , S@@ ach@@ sen@@ ring , within the East German corporation IF@@ A was born .
after unification in 1958 , the P@@ 240 car was renamed as the S@@ ach@@ sen@@ ring P@@ 240 . as the Soviet Administration in@@ expl@@ icably banned the foreign ex@@ portation of the P@@ 240 , the East German economic administration decided to stop production of the vehicle .

it is then customary to define linear operators acting on wa@@ ve@@ functions in terms of linear operators acting on kets , by
since virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vec@@ tors and linear operators , it can involve , and often does involve , bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation . a few examples follow :
starting from any ket | Ψ ⟩ in this Hil@@ bert space , we can define a complex scal@@ ar function of r , known as a wa@@ ve@@ function :
on the left side , Ψ ( r ) is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number ; on the right side , | Ψ ⟩ = ∫ D@@ 3@@ R Ψ ( r ) | r ⟩ is a ket .
one occasionally encounters an expression such as
though this is something of an abuse of no@@ tation . the differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator , acting on kets , that has the effect of differenti@@ ating wa@@ ve@@ functions once the expression is projected into the position basis ,
even though , in the momentum basis , the operator amounts to a mere multi@@ plication operator ( by i@@ ħ@@ p ) .
a stationary spin @@@ -@@ @ 1 / 2 particle has a two @@@ -@@ @ dimensional Hil@@ bert space . one orth@@ on@@ or@@ mal basis is :
where | ↑ z ⟩ is the state with a definite value of the spin operator S@@ z equal to + 1 / 2 and | ↓ z ⟩ is the state with a definite value of the spin operator S@@ z equal to − 1 / 2 .
since these are a basis , any quantum state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination ( i.e. , quantum super@@ position ) of these two states :
again , any state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two :
where a@@ ψ and b@@ ψ are complex numbers .
a different basis for the same Hil@@ bert space is :
defined in terms of S@@ x rather than S@@ z .
in vector form , you might write
there are a few conventions and abuses of no@@ tation that are generally accepted by the physics community , but which might conf@@ use the non @@@ -@@ @ initiated .
( in other words , a function composition ) . this expression is commonly written as ( cf@@ . energy inner product )
if the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side ,
den@@ o@@ tes the rank @@@ -@@ @ one operator with the rule
then this expression gives the expectation value , or mean or average value , of the observ@@ able represented by operator A for the physical system in the state | ψ ⟩ .
a convenient way to define linear operators on a Hil@@ bert space H is given by the outer product : if ⟨ φ | is a bra and | ψ ⟩ is a ket , the outer product
for a finite @@@ -@@ @ dimensional vector space , the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multi@@ plication :
the outer product is an N × N matrix , as expected for a linear operator .
one of the uses of the outer product is to construct projection operators . given a ket | ψ ⟩ of norm 1 , the orth@@ og@@ onal projection onto the sub@@ space span@@ ned by | ψ ⟩ is
if A is expressed as an N × N matrix , then A † is its con@@ ju@@ gate trans@@ pose .
by the definition of addition and scal@@ ar multi@@ plication of linear func@@ tion@@ als in the dual space , [ 6 ]
since br@@ as are linear func@@ tion@@ als ,
these rules are sufficient to formally write the Her@@ mi@@ tian con@@ ju@@ gate of any such expression ; some examples are as follows :
bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation makes it particularly easy to compu@@ te the Her@@ mi@@ tian con@@ ju@@ gate ( also called d@@ agg@@ er , and den@@ oted † ) of expressions . the formal rules are :
inner products :
outer products :
for a Hil@@ bert space H , with respect to the norm from an inner product ⟨ · , · ⟩ .
see quantum ent@@ ang@@ lement and the EPR parad@@ ox for applications of this product .
consider a complete orth@@ on@@ or@@ mal system ( basis ) ,
must be the identity operator , which sends each vector to itself .
from basic functional analysis , it is known that any ket | ψ ⟩ can also be written as
with ⟨ · | · ⟩ the inner product on the Hil@@ bert space .
from the comm@@ ut@@ ativity of kets with ( complex ) scal@@ ars , it follows that
the object physi@@ ci@@ sts are considering when using bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation is a Hil@@ bert space ( a complete inner product space ) .
that is , Let H be a Hil@@ bert space and h ∈ H a vector in H. What physi@@ ci@@ sts would den@@ ote by | h ⟩ is the vector itself .
one igno@@ res the paren@@ theses and removes the double bars . some properties of this no@@ tation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a ring multi@@ plication .
the right part is called the ket / k@@ ɛ@@ t / ; it is a vector , typically represented as a column vector and written
the left part is called the bra , / br@@ ɑ@@ ː / ; it is the Her@@ mi@@ tian con@@ ju@@ gate of the ket with the same label , typically represented as a row vector and is written
a combination of br@@ as , kets , and operators is interpreted using matrix multi@@ plication . a bra and a ket with the same label are Her@@ mi@@ tian con@@ ju@@ gates of each other .
bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation was introduced in 1939 by Paul Di@@ ra@@ c [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and is also known as the Di@@ ra@@ c no@@ tation .
the standard mathematical no@@ tation for the inner product , preferred as well by some physi@@ ci@@ sts , expresses exactly the same thing as the bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation ,
which can also be represented as a matrix multi@@ plication ( i.e. , a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix ) .
if the ket is an element of a vector space , the bra is technically an element of its dual space - see Ri@@ es@@ z representation theore@@ m .
for instance , the momentum operator p has the following form ,
where ⟨ A | is called a bra , read as " bra @@@ -@@ @ A , " and | B ⟩ is a ket as above .
for a finite @@@ -@@ @ dimensional vector space , using a fixed orth@@ on@@ or@@ mal basis , the inner product can be written as a matrix multi@@ plication of a row vector with a column vector :
based on this , the br@@ as and kets can be defined as :
and then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies matrix multi@@ plication .
the con@@ ju@@ gate trans@@ pose ( also called Her@@ mi@@ tian con@@ ju@@ gate ) of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa :
because if one starts with the bra
then performs a complex con@@ ju@@ gation , and then a matrix trans@@ pose , one ends up with the ket
in mathematics terminology , the vector space of br@@ as is the dual space to the vector space of kets , and corresponding br@@ as and kets are related by the Ri@@ es@@ z representation theore@@ m .
vec@@ tors vs kets
Sp@@ in@@ less position @@@ -@@ @ space wave function
its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread . many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation .
br@@ as and kets can also be configured in other ways , such as the outer product
bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation uses a specific no@@ tation for inner products :
bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation spl@@ its this inner product ( also called a " brac@@ ket " ) into two pieces , the " bra " and the " ket " :
bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation
bra @@@ -@@ @ ket no@@ tation can be used even if the vector space is not a Hil@@ bert space .
the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is based in large part on linear alge@@ bra :

the internal energy is one of the two cardinal state functions of the state variables of a ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ic system .
though it is a macro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic quantity , internal energy can be explained in micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic terms by two theoretical virtual components . one is the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic k@@ ine@@ tic energy due to the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic motion of the system 's particles ( translations , ro@@ tations , vibrations ) . the other is the potential energy associated with the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic forces , including the chemical bonds , between the particles ; this is for ordinary physics and chemistry .

the header part is intended to provide authenticity and integrity protection for networking or storage metadata for which confidentiality is unnecessary , but authenticity is desired .
this is a variant of A@@ E where the data to be encrypted needs both authentication and integrity as opposed to just integrity .

the following is a declaration of the concept " E@@ qual@@ ity@@ Compar@@ able " from the concept @@@ -@@ @ enabled C + + standard library ( which is a separate ISO Technical Specification , ISO / IEC D@@ TS 2@@ 14@@ 25 ) .
a function template constrained on this concept may be declared as follows :
void f ( con@@ st E@@ qual@@ ity@@ Compar@@ able & ) ; / / constrained function template declaration
and may be called as usual
the main uses of concepts are :
introducing type @@@ -@@ @ checking to template programming S@@ impl@@ ified compil@@ er diagnostics for failed template instan@@ ti@@ ations S@@ electing function template over@@ loads and class template special@@ izations based on type properties Con@@ stra@@ ining automatic type deduction
typical compil@@ er diagnostic without concepts is over 50 lines of output , beginning with a failure to compile an expression that attempts to sub@@ tract two iter@@ ators :
if concepts are used , the error can be detected and reported in the context of the call :
error : CA@@ N@@ NOT call function ' void st@@ d : : sort ( _ Ra@@ iter , _ Ra@@ iter ) [ with _ Ra@@ iter = st@@ d : : _ List _ iter@@ ator < int > ] ' note : concept ' Ran@@ dom@@ Access@@ I@@ ter@@ ator ( ) ' was not satisfied
concepts may be used instead of the un@@ constrained type deduction plac@@ e@@ holder auto in variable declarations and function return types :
auto x@@ 1 = f ( y ) ; / / the type of x@@ 1 is deduc@@ ed to whatever f returns sor@@ table x@@ 2 = f ( y ) ; / / the type of x@@ 2 is deduc@@ ed , but only compil@@ es if it satisfies sor@@ table
concepts , as specified in ISO / IEC TS 19@@ 217 : 2015 , are implemented in GCC 6 . [ 2 ]
during the C + + standards committee meeting in March 2016 , the evolution working group moved to merge Con@@ cepts into the main@@ line C + + 17 standard , but the motion was defeated in full committee . [ 3 ]
concepts v1 was merged into the C + + 20 draft . [ 4 ]
in contrast to this abandoned proposal , the C + + 20 version of Con@@ cepts is sometimes referred to as " Con@@ cepts L@@ ite . " [ 6 ]

example
in generic programming , a concept is a description of supported operations on a type , including syntax and sem@@ an@@ tics . in this way , concepts are related to abstract types but concepts do not require a sub@@ type relationship .
there was a proposal to add concepts as an explicit language feature in C + + 11 , though it was rejected as " not ready . "
another language implementing something very similar to concepts is H@@ ask@@ ell , where the feature is called type classes .
for example , if a type I satisfies the Tri@@ vial I@@ ter@@ ator concept in C + + , and i is of type I , the following are valid expressions with corresponding sem@@ an@@ tics : [ 4 ]
I i default construction . * i must be convertible to some type T. i@@ - > m is valid if ( * i ) .@@ m is .

notes
in a similar fashion , nominal sub@@ typing means that one type is a sub@@ type of another if and only if it is explicitly declared to be so in its definition .
nom@@ in@@ ally @@@ -@@ @ typed languages typically enforce the requirement that declared sub@@ types be struc@@ turally compatible ( though E@@ i@@ ff@@ el allows non @@@ -@@ @ compatible sub@@ types to be declared ) . however , sub@@ types which are struc@@ turally compatible " by accident , " but not declared as sub@@ types , are not considered to be sub@@ types .
C + + , C # , Java , Objective @@@ -@@ @ C , Del@@ ph@@ i , Sw@@ ift , and R@@ ust all primarily use both nominal typing and nominal sub@@ typing .
some nom@@ in@@ ally @@@ -@@ @ sub@@ typed languages , such as Java and C # , allow classes to be declared final ( or sealed in C # terminology ) , indicating that no further sub@@ typing is permitted .

early life
major General John Hu@@ ston Church ( June 28 , 18@@ 92 - November 3 , 1953 ) was a senior officer in the United States Army . he fought in World War I , World War II and in the Korean War . during the latter conflict , he provided assistance to the South Korean Army in the opening days of the war .
at the end of the war , Church decided to continue with his service in the army . he was aide @@@ -@@ @ de @@@ -@@ @ camp to Brig@@ di@@ er General F. C. Marshall in 1920 and , having been promoted to captain , a post as an instructor with the National Guard in Maryland followed .
from 1933 to 1936 , he served in the Philippines .
in 1936 , and by now a major , he returned to the United States to attend the Command and General Staff School for two years . [ 4 ] He later served with the Ari@@ z@@ ona National Guard as an instructor .
in October 1940 , he became the assistant chief of staff for operations of the 45th Inf@@ antry Division . [ 1 ]
from 1948 until 1949 Church served as the deputy chief of Army Field Forces at Fort Monro@@ e , Virginia .
in 1950 , he was serving in General Dou@@ gl@@ as Mac@@ Arthur 's headquarters in Tokyo as a section chief . [ 5 ]
after a stub@@ born fight , the American troops ret@@ re@@ ated . Dean got separated from his troops and was captured . on July 22 , Church , without a command following the dissolution of AD@@ COM , was given command of the division . [ 10 ]

second deri@@ vative power rule
the la@@ plac@@ ian of a function is equal to the divergence of the gradient and the trace of the H@@ es@@ sian matrix .
Ch@@ ir@@ py@@ ness , second deri@@ vative of instantaneous phase
the second deri@@ vative of a quad@@ ratic function is constant .
on the graph of a function , the second deri@@ vative corresponds to the cur@@ v@@ ature or conc@@ av@@ ity of the graph . the graph of a function with a positive second deri@@ vative is up@@ war@@ dly con@@ cave , while the graph of a function with a negative second deri@@ vative curves in the opposite way .
the power rule for the first deri@@ vative , if applied twice , will produce the second deri@@ vative power rule as follows :
that is : the second deri@@ vative of a function f ( x ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style f ( x ) } is usually den@@ oted f ″ ( x ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style f " ( x ) } .
when using Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's no@@ tation for derivatives , the second deri@@ vative of a dependent variable y with respect to an independent variable x is written
this no@@ tation is derived from the following formula :
given the function
the deri@@ vative of f is the function
the second deri@@ vative of f is the deri@@ vative of f ′ , namely
it is possible to write a single limit for the second deri@@ vative :
the limit is called the second sym@@ metric deri@@ vative . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Note that the second sym@@ metric deri@@ vative may exist even when the ( usual ) second deri@@ vative does not .
the expression on the right can be written as a difference quo@@ ti@@ ent of difference quo@@ ti@@ ents :
this limit can be viewed as a continuous version of the second difference for sequences .
the sign function is not continuous at zero and therefore the second deri@@ vative for x = 0 { \ dis@@ play@@ style x = 0 } does not exist . but the above limit exists for x = 0 { \ dis@@ play@@ style x = 0 } :
this quad@@ ratic approxim@@ ation is the second @@@ -@@ @ order Taylor poly@@ nom@@ ial for the function centered at x = a .
for other well @@@ -@@ @ known cases , see the main article e@@ ig@@ en@@ values and e@@ ig@@ en@@ vec@@ tors of the second deri@@ vative .
the second deri@@ vative gener@@ alizes to higher dimensions through the notion of second partial derivatives . for a function f : R@@ 3 → R , these include the three second @@@ -@@ @ order parti@@ als
and the mixed parti@@ als
another common gener@@ alization of the second deri@@ vative is the la@@ plac@@ ian . this is the differential operator ∇ 2 { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ n@@ abl@@ a ^ { 2 } } defined by

a social choice function f ( ) is dict@@ atorial if one agent always receives his most @@@ -@@ @ fav@@ ored goods allocation ,
the theore@@ m states that under general conditions any tru@@ th@@ fully implemen@@ table social choice function must be dict@@ atorial ,
x is finite and contains at least three elements Preferences are rational f ( Θ ) = X { \ dis@@ play@@ style f ( \ The@@ ta ) = X }
the average distortion of the principal 's surplus must be 0 . to fl@@ att@@ en the schedule , find an x { \ dis@@ play@@ style x } such that its in@@ verse image maps to a θ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ the@@ ta } interval satisfying the condition above .
mechanism design studies solution concepts for a class of private @@@ -@@ @ information games .
that a game " designer " chooses the game structure rather than inher@@ iting one that the designer is interested in the game 's outcome
the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Leonid Hur@@ wic@@ z , Eric Mas@@ kin , and Rog@@ er My@@ er@@ son " for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory . " [ 2 ]
a game of mechanism design is a game of private information in which one of the agents , called the principal , chooses the pay@@ off structure . following Har@@ san@@ yi ( 1967 ) , the agents receive secret " messages " from nature containing information relevant to pay@@ offs . for example , a message may contain information about their preferences or the quality of a good for sale .
as a benchmark the designer often defines what would happen under full information . define a social choice function f ( θ ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style f ( \ the@@ ta ) } mapping the ( true ) type profile directly to the allocation of goods received or rendered ,
a proposed mechanism constitutes a Ba@@ ye@@ sian game ( a game of private information ) , and if it is well @@@ -@@ @ beha@@ ved the game has a Ba@@ ye@@ sian N@@ ash equilibrium . at equilibrium agents choose their reports strategically as a function of type
simply define a mechanism that would induce agents to choose the same equilibrium . the easiest one to define is for the mechanism to commit to playing the agents ' equilibrium strategies for them .
which is also called the incentive compatibility ( IC ) constraint .

in mathematics , in the area of harmon@@ ic analysis , the fr@@ actional F@@ ou@@ rier transform ( FR@@ FT ) is a family of linear transformations gener@@ alizing the F@@ ou@@ rier transform .
for any real α , the α @@@ -@@ @ angle fr@@ actional F@@ ou@@ rier transform of a function ƒ is den@@ oted by F α ( u ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style { \ ma@@ th@@ cal { F } } _ { \ alpha } ( u ) } and defined by

and ƒ is determined by ƒ ̂ via the in@@ verse transform F − 1 { \ dis@@ play@@ style { \ ma@@ th@@ cal { F } } ^ { -@@ 1 } }
the Fr@@ FT provides a family of linear trans@@ forms that further extends this definition to handle non @@@ -@@ @ integer powers n = 2@@ α / π of the FT .

the P@@ ax@@ os protocol was first published in 1989 and named after a fic@@ tional legislative consensus system used on the P@@ ax@@ os island in Greece . [ 4 ] It was later published as a journal article in 1998 . [ 5 ]
in order to simplify the presentation of P@@ ax@@ os , the following assumptions and definitions are made explicit . techniques to broaden the applicability are known in the literature , and are not covered in this article .
any of the accep@@ tors wa@@ its for a Prepare message from any of the Pro@@ pos@@ ers . if an Accep@@ tor receives a Prepare message , the Accep@@ tor must look at the identifier number n of the just received Prepare message . there are two cases .
this Ac@@ cept message should be interpreted as a " request , " as in " Ac@@ cept this proposal , please ! . "
if an Accep@@ tor receives an Ac@@ cept message , ( n , v ) , from a Pro@@ pos@@ er , it must accept it if and only if it has not already promised ( in Phase 1b of the P@@ ax@@ os protocol ) to only consider proposals having an identifier greater than n .

here , V is the last of ( V@@ a , V@@ b , V@@ c ) .
qu@@ or@@ ums express the safety ( or consistency ) properties of P@@ ax@@ os by ensuring at least some surviving processor retains knowledge of the results .
in order to guarantee safety ( also called " consistency " ) , P@@ ax@@ os defines three properties and ensures they are always held , regardless of the pattern of failures :
in most deployments of P@@ ax@@ os , each participating process acts in three roles ; Pro@@ pos@@ er , Accep@@ tor and Lear@@ ner . [ 14 ] This reduces the message complexity significantly , without sacrif@@ icing correctness :

for the subsequent discussion a State Machine will be defined as the following tu@@ ple of values [ 2 ] ( See also Me@@ aly machine and Mo@@ ore Machine ) :
a set of States A set of In@@ puts A set of Out@@ puts A transition function ( In@@ put × State → State ) An output function ( In@@ put × State → Output ) A distinguished State called Start .
it should be noted that failed repl@@ ic@@ as are not required to stop ; they may continue operating , including generating s@@ pu@@ rious or incorrect Out@@ puts .
faults where a repl@@ ica sends different values in different directions ( for instance , the correct Output to some of its fellow repl@@ ic@@ as and incorrect Out@@ puts to others ) are called Byz@@ an@@ tine Fail@@ ures . [ 5 ] Byz@@ an@@ tine failures may be random , s@@ pu@@ rious faults , or malicious , intelligent attacks .
the preceding intuitive discussion implies a simple technique for implementing a fault @@@ -@@ @ tolerant service in terms of a State Machine :
the remainder of this article develops the details of this technique .
step 1 and 2 are outside the scope of this article .
step 3 is the critical operation , see Or@@ dering In@@ puts .
step 4 is covered by the State Machine Definition .
step 5 , see Or@@ dering Out@@ puts .
step 6 , see Auditing and Fail@@ ure De@@ tection .
the appendix contains discussion on typical extensions used in real @@@ -@@ @ world systems such as Log@@ ging , Chec@@ k@@ points , Recon@@ fig@@ uration , and State Transfer .
a Vi@@ sible Channel is a communication path between two entities actively participating in the system ( such as clients and servers ) . example : client to server , server to server
when all communication paths are visible channels and no hidden channels exist , a partial global order ( Ca@@ usal Order ) may be inf@@ erred from the pattern of communications . [ 8 ] [ 10 ] Ca@@ usal Order may be derived independently by each server .
inputs to the State Machine may be executed in Ca@@ usal Order , guaranteeing consistent State and Output for all non @@@ -@@ @ fa@@ ulty repl@@ ic@@ as .
in open systems , hidden channels are common and a weaker form of ordering must be used . an order of In@@ puts may be defined using a voting protocol whose results depend only on the visible channels .
if there is no majority of repl@@ ic@@ as with the same Output , or if less than a majority of repl@@ ic@@ as returns an Output , a system failure has occurred . the client response must be the unique Output : fail .

T @@@ -@@ @ series ( 1940 @@@ -@@ @ 1942 )
all " T " -@@ series models were urban transit buses . the model designation consisted of two or three letters followed by four numbers . these gave a basic description of the type of bus :

history
consider y as a function of a variable x , or y = f ( x ) . if this is the case , then the deri@@ vative of y with respect to x , which later came to be viewed as the limit
was , according to Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z , the quo@@ ti@@ ent of an in@@ fin@@ ite@@ sim@@ al incre@@ ment of y by an in@@ fin@@ ite@@ sim@@ al incre@@ ment of x , or
where the right hand side is Joseph @@@ -@@ @ Louis Lag@@ range 's no@@ tation for the deri@@ vative of f at x .
English mathemati@@ cians were encumbered by New@@ ton 's do@@ t no@@ tation until 18@@ 03 when Robert Wood@@ house published a description of the continental no@@ tation . later the Analy@@ tical Society at Cambridge University promoted the adoption of Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's no@@ tation .
suppose a dependent variable y represents a function f of an independent variable x , that is ,
then the deri@@ vative of the function f , in Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's no@@ tation for differentiation , can be written as
the Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z expression , also , at times , written dy / d@@ x , is one of several no@@ tations used for derivatives and derived functions . a common alternative is Lag@@ range 's no@@ tation
another alternative is New@@ ton 's no@@ tation , often used for derivatives with respect to time ( like velocity ) , which requires placing a do@@ t over the dependent variable ( in this case , x ) :
in its modern interpretation , the expression dy / d@@ x should not be read as the division of two quantities d@@ x and dy ( as Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z had envisioned it ) ; rather , the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shor@@ th@@ and for
( note Δ vs. d , where Δ indicates a finite difference ) .

in January 1997 , the K@@ ij@@ ang received a re@@ design to have the completely rounded , aer@@ odynam@@ ic shape , and was more powerful and more refined than its predecessors .
the fourth generation K@@ ij@@ ang vehicles were generally released in two series of tri@@ ms :
in February 2000 , the K@@ ij@@ ang got a new front end .
the 2.0 @@@ -@@ @ litre engine was offered in the LG@@ X and Kri@@ sta models after September 2000 . another minor change was given in August 2002 with new gr@@ ille , rear gar@@ nish , and some small changes with its features .
it used compound se@@ al@@ ant for the rear window , while the front windscreen was still using rubber seals . the design of the front panel was slightly changed ( mostly on the driver 's side ) . for this model ( and upwards ) customers could choose which engine they wanted to use - the original ( but renewed ) 2.0 @@@ -@@ @ litre EF@@ I petrol engine , a 2.4 @@@ -@@ @ litre diesel engine or the new 1.8 @@@ -@@ @ litre EF@@ I engine .

the bi@@ osy@@ n@@ thesis of ATP is achieved throughout processes such as sub@@ strate @@@ -@@ @ level phosph@@ or@@ yl@@ ation , oxid@@ ative phosph@@ or@@ yl@@ ation , and pho@@ top@@ hos@@ ph@@ or@@ yl@@ ation , all of which facilitating the addition of a phosph@@ ate group to A@@ DP .
under normal conditions , small disk @@@ -@@ @ shape plat@@ ele@@ ts circulate in the blood freely and without interaction with one another .
A@@ DP is stored in dense bodies inside blood plat@@ ele@@ ts and is released upon plat@@ el@@ et activation .
A@@ DP inter@@ acts with a family of A@@ DP recep@@ tors found on plat@@ ele@@ ts ( P@@ 2@@ Y@@ 1 , P@@ 2@@ Y@@ 12 , and P@@ 2@@ X@@ 1 ) , which leads to plat@@ el@@ et activation . [ 14 ]
P@@ 2@@ Y@@ 1 recep@@ tors initiate plat@@ el@@ et aggregation and shape change as a result of interactions with A@@ DP .
P@@ 2@@ Y@@ 12 recep@@ tors further ampl@@ ify the response to A@@ DP and draw forth the completion of aggregation .
A@@ DP in the blood is converted to ad@@ en@@ os@@ ine by the action of ec@@ to @@@ -@@ @ AD@@ P@@ ases , in@@ hibiting further plat@@ el@@ et activation via ad@@ en@@ os@@ ine recep@@ tors .

the ten @@@ -@@ @ step cat@@ abol@@ ic path@@ way of gly@@ col@@ y@@ sis is the initial phase of free @@@ -@@ @ energy release in the breakdown of gl@@ uc@@ ose and can be split into two phases , the preparatory phase and pay@@ off phase .
gly@@ col@@ y@@ sis overview
when R@@ NA is broken down by living systems , nucle@@ o@@ side mon@@ op@@ hos@@ ph@@ ates , including ad@@ en@@ os@@ ine mon@@ op@@ hos@@ ph@@ ate , are formed .
amp can be regener@@ ated to ATP as follows :
amp can be converted into IM@@ P by the enzy@@ me my@@ o@@ ad@@ en@@ yl@@ ate de@@ am@@ in@@ ase , freeing an ammonia group .
in a cat@@ abol@@ ic path@@ way , ad@@ en@@ os@@ ine mon@@ op@@ hos@@ ph@@ ate can be converted to uri@@ c acid , which is excre@@ ted from the body in mammals . [ 2 ]
physiological Role in Regulation
amp / A@@ DP protects AM@@ P@@ K from being in@@ activated by binding to the γ @@@ -@@ @ sub@@ unit and maintaining the de@@ phosph@@ or@@ yl@@ ation state . [ 9 ]
amp plays an important role in many cellular metabol@@ ic processes , being inter@@ converted to A@@ DP and / or ATP . amp is also a component in the synthesis of R@@ NA . [ 1 ]

when the data are roughly el@@ lip@@ tically distributed and there are no prominent out@@ li@@ ers , the Spe@@ ar@@ man correlation and Pe@@ ar@@ son correlation give similar values .
the Spe@@ ar@@ man correlation is less sensitive than the Pe@@ ar@@ son correlation to strong out@@ li@@ ers that are in the tails of both samples . that is because Spe@@ ar@@ man 's r@@ ho limits the out@@ lier to the value of its rank .
the Spe@@ ar@@ man correlation coefficient is defined as the Pe@@ ar@@ son correlation coefficient between the ranked variables . [ 3 ]
N.@@ B. : the figure in the center has a slope of 0 but in that case the correlation coefficient is un@@ defined because the variance of Y is zero .
Pe@@ ar@@ son 's correlation coefficient is the co@@ variance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations . the form of the definition involves a " product moment , " that is , the mean ( the first moment about the origin ) of the product of the mean @@@ -@@ @ adjusted random variables ; hence the modi@@ fier product @@@ -@@ @ moment in the name .
for a population
Pe@@ ar@@ son 's correlation coefficient when applied to a population is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ ( r@@ ho ) and may be referred to as the population correlation coefficient or the population Pe@@ ar@@ son correlation coefficient . given a pair of random variables ( X , Y ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style ( X , Y ) } , the formula for ρ [ 7 ] is :

historical
historical pen and paper ci@@ ph@@ ers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ci@@ ph@@ ers . they include simple substitution ci@@ ph@@ ers ( such as Ro@@ t 13 ) and trans@@ position ci@@ ph@@ ers ( such as a Rail F@@ ence Ci@@ ph@@ er ) .
modern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria : by type of key used , and by type of input data .
by type of key used ci@@ ph@@ ers are divided into :
sym@@ metric key algorithms ( Private @@@ -@@ @ key cryp@@ to@@ graphy ) , where the same key is used for encryption and dec@@ ry@@ ption , and asym@@ metric key algorithms ( Public @@@ -@@ @ key cryp@@ to@@ graphy ) , where two different keys are used for encryption and dec@@ ry@@ ption .
in an asym@@ metric key algorithm ( e.g. , R@@ SA ) , there are two separate keys : a public key is published and enables any sender to perform encryption , while a private key is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct dec@@ ry@@ ption .
ci@@ ph@@ ers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data :
block ci@@ ph@@ ers , which encry@@ pt block of data of fixed size , and stream ci@@ ph@@ ers , which encry@@ pt continuous streams of data
key size and vulnerability

loss functions
different loss functions are used depending on whether the problem is one of regression or one of classification .
regression
the most common loss function for regression is the square loss function ( also known as the L@@ 2 @@@ -@@ @ norm ) . this familiar loss function is used in Ord@@ inary Least Squ@@ ares regression . the form is :
the absolute value loss ( also known as the L@@ 1 @@@ -@@ @ norm ) is also sometimes used :
where θ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ the@@ ta } is the He@@ avi@@ side step function .

when the direc@@ tivity D { \ dis@@ play@@ style D } of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum direc@@ tivity in any direction , namely
summary
where Z@@ in is the feed@@ point impe@@ dance .
published numbers for antenna gain are almost always expressed in deci@@ bel@@ s ( dB ) , a log@@ arith@@ mic scale . from the gain factor G , one finds the gain in deci@@ bel@@ s as :
partial gain
as a result of this definition , we can conclude that the total gain of an antenna is the sum of partial gains for any two orth@@ og@@ onal pol@@ ar@@ izations .
power gain ( or simply gain ) is a un@@ it@@ less measure that combines an antenna 's efficiency E@@ antenna and direc@@ tivity D :
suppose a los@@ s@@ less antenna has a radiation pattern given by :
let us find the gain of such an antenna .
solution :
first we find the peak radiation intensity of this antenna :
the total radi@@ ated power can be found by integrating over all directions :
since the antenna is specified as being los@@ s@@ less the radiation efficiency is 1 . the maximum gain is then equal to :
expressed relative to the gain of a half @@@ -@@ @ wave di@@ pole we would find :
realized gain
gain may be expressed as absolute gain if further clarification is required to differentiate it from realized gain . [ 1 ]
the notions of efficiency and direc@@ tivity depend on the following .
total radi@@ ated power is the sum of all RF power radi@@ ated by the antenna when the source power is included in the measurement .
TR@@ P is expressed in Wat@@ ts , or equivalent log@@ arith@@ mic expressions , often d@@ B@@ m or DB@@ W . [ 2 ]
TR@@ P can be measured while in the close proximity of power @@@ -@@ @ absorbing losses such as the body and hand of the Mobile Device Under Test User . [ 3 ]
the TR@@ P can be used to determine Body Loss ( BO@@ L ) . the Body Loss is considered as the ratio of TR@@ P measured in the presence of losses and TR@@ P measured while in free space .

a domestic airport is an airport that handles only domestic flights - flights within the same country . domestic airports do not have customs and immigration facilities and so CA@@ N@@ NOT handle flights to or from a foreign airport .
most municipal airports in Canada and the United States are of this classification . at international airports in Canada , there are domestic terminals that handle flights within Canada ( flying from one Canadian city to another ) .
additionally , some airports that are named " international " are essentially domestic airports that do not handle international traffic on a regular basis . many of these airports are located through the United States .
in the United Kingdom , an example of a domestic airport is W@@ ick Airport , which operates frequent flights to other Scottish airports .

D@@ MA@@ RC ( Domain @@@ -@@ @ based Message Auth@@ entic@@ ation , Reporting and Con@@ form@@ ance ) is an email authentication protocol . it is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use , commonly known as email spo@@ of@@ ing .
the purpose and primary outcome of implementing D@@ MA@@ RC is to protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks , ph@@ ishing emails , email sc@@ ams and other cyber threat activities .
D@@ MA@@ RC operates by checking that the domain in the message 's From : field ( also called " 5@@ 32@@ 2.@@ From " ) is " aligned " with other authentic@@ ated domain names .
if either SPF or DK@@ IM alignment checks pass , then the D@@ MA@@ RC alignment test passes .
like SPF and DK@@ IM , D@@ MA@@ RC uses the concept of a domain owner , the entity or entities that are authorized to make changes to a given DNS domain .
SPF checks that the IP address of the sending server is authorized by the owner of the domain that appears in the SMTP MA@@ IL FROM command .
( the email address in MA@@ IL FROM is also called envelope @@@ -@@ @ from or 5@@ 32@@ 1.@@ Mail@@ Fro@@ m. ) In addition to requiring that the SPF check pass , D@@ MA@@ RC additionally checks that 5@@ 32@@ 1.@@ Mail@@ From aligns with 5@@ 32@@ 2.@@ Fro@@ m.
DK@@ IM allows parts of an email message to be cryp@@ to@@ graph@@ ically signed , and the signature must cover the From field .
there may be several DK@@ IM signatures on an email message ; D@@ MA@@ RC requires one valid signature where the domain in the d = tag aligns with the sender 's domain stated in the From : header field .
D@@ MA@@ RC records are published in DNS with a sub@@ domain label _ d@@ mar@@ c , for example _ d@@ mar@@ c.@@ exam@@ ple@@ .com. Compar@@ e this to SPF at exam@@ ple@@ .com , and DK@@ IM at selec@@ tor . _ dom@@ ain@@ key@@ .@@ exam@@ ple@@ .com.
for example : the content of the T@@ XT resource record consists of name = value tags , separated by sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons , similar to SPF and DK@@ IM .
aggregate reports
for example : exam@@ ple@@ .com ! exam@@ ple@@ .org ! 14@@ 7@@ 57@@ 1@@ 2000 ! 14@@ 7@@ 57@@ 98@@ 40@@ 0.@@ x@@ ml@@ .@@ g@@ z@@ .
D@@ MA@@ RC records can also be directly transformed in HTML by applying an X@@ SL styl@@ es@@ he@@ et .
D@@ MA@@ RC is defined in R@@ FC 74@@ 89 , dated March 2015 , as " Inform@@ ational . " [ 1 ]
these policies are published in the public Domain Name System ( DNS ) as text T@@ XT records .
under D@@ MA@@ RC a message can fail even if it passes SPF or DK@@ IM , but fails alignment . [ 1 ]
setting up D@@ MA@@ RC may have a positive impact on deliver@@ ability for legitimate s@@ enders . [ 4 ]

Rob@@ erts decided to return to the kit market with a low cost computer . the target customer would think that " some assembly required " was a desirable feature .
MI@@ TS products typically had generic names such as the Model 14@@ 40 Calcul@@ ator or the Model 1600 Digital Vol@@ t@@ meter . the editors of Popular Electronics wanted a more all@@ uring name for the computer .
MI@@ TS technical writer David Bun@@ n@@ ell came up with three pages of possible names , but Rob@@ erts was too busy finishing the computer design to choose one .
when the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics reached readers in mid @@@ -@@ @ December 1974 , MI@@ TS was floo@@ ded with orders . [ 31 ] They had to hire extra people just to answer the phones .
in February , MI@@ TS received 1,000 orders for the Al@@ ta@@ ir 8@@ 800 . the quoted delivery time was 60 days , but it was many more months before the machines were shipped .
by August 1975 , they had shipped over 5,000 computers . [ 32 ]
the Al@@ ta@@ ir 8@@ 800 computer was a break @@@ -@@ @ even sale for MI@@ TS . they needed to sell additional memory boards , I / O boards , and other options to make a profit .
there were several design and component problems in the MI@@ TS 4@@ K Dynamic RAM board .
MI@@ TS released its own 4@@ K St@@ atic RAM board in January 1976 .

G@@ TP ' ( G@@ TP prime ) is an IP based protocol used within GSM and U@@ MTS networks .
it can be used with U@@ DP or TCP .
G@@ TP ' uses the same message structure as G@@ TP ( G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ C , G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ U ) , but it is largely a separate protocol .
G@@ TP ' uses registered U@@ DP / TCP port 33@@ 86 .
G@@ TP ' uses the G@@ TP Version Not Sup@@ ported , E@@ cho Request and E@@ cho Response messages unchanged , but adds the following messages
the Re@@ direction messages are used to :
in either case the CD@@ Fs are given more information about an impending or immediate failure than would be the case if the C@@ DF was polling using E@@ cho Request messages .
this message contains details about the cause , and optionally address ( es ) of an alternate CG@@ F .
G@@ TP ' is used on the G@@ a interface within the 3@@ G@@ PP G@@ PRS Core Network definition .
the Data Record Transfer messages are used to reliably transport CD@@ Rs from the point of generation ( S@@ GS@@ N / G@@ GS@@ N ) to non @@@ -@@ @ volatile storage in the CG@@ F .
each Data Record Transfer Request message can contain a message of one of four types :
send Data Record Pac@@ ket - This message contains zero or more CD@@ Rs .
release Data Record Pac@@ ket - This message orders the CG@@ F to write the contents of one or more Data Record Pac@@ kets from the CG@@ F " possibly dupl@@ icated " pending queue .
the Data Record Transfer Response acknowledges receipt of one or more Data Record Transfer messages ; responses can be grouped for reasons of efficiency but must be sent more frequently than the sending CD@@ Fs time@@ out .
the acknowledgement includes a cause and can be a rejection of the contained records .

in 3@@ G@@ PP architec@@ tures , G@@ TP and Pro@@ xy Mobile IP@@ v@@ 6 based interfaces are specified on various interface points .
G@@ TP can be decom@@ posed into separate protocols , G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ C , G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ U and G@@ TP ' .
G@@ TP@@ v1 head@@ ers contain the following fields : [ 1 ]
this field exists if any of the E , S , or PN bits are on . N @@@ -@@ @ PD@@ U number an ( optional ) 8 @@@ -@@ @ bit field . the field must be interpreted only if the PN bit is on .

it is also known as evolved @@@ -@@ @ G@@ TP or e@@ G@@ TP .
G@@ TP@@ v2 @@@ -@@ @ C head@@ ers contain the following fields : [ 2 ]
there is no G@@ TP@@ v2 @@@ -@@ @ U protocol , G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ U in L@@ TE also uses G@@ TP@@ v1 @@@ -@@ @ U.
version It is a 3 @@@ -@@ @ bit field .
the TE@@ ID ( if present ) and the S@@ equ@@ ence Number shall be included in the length count .
apart from the common message structure , there is also a common mechanism for verifying connectivity from one GS@@ N to another GS@@ N . this uses two messages .
apart from the two messages previously mentioned , there are no other messages common across all G@@ TP variants [ 3 ] meaning that , for the most part , they effectively form three completely separate protocols .
it also controls forwarding relocation messages ; SR@@ NS context and creating forward tunnels during inter L@@ TE hand@@ overs .
G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ U is used for carrying user data within the G@@ PRS core network and between the radio access network and the core network . the user data transported can be pac@@ kets in any of IP@@ v4 , IP@@ v@@ 6 , or PPP formats .
G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ U is , in effect a relatively simple IP based tun@@ n@@ eling protocol which permits many tunnels between each set of end points .
when used in the U@@ MTS , each subscriber will have one or more tunnel , one for each P@@ DP context that they have active , as well as possibly having separate tunnels for specific connections with different quality of service requirements .
the G@@ TP@@ v1 @@@ -@@ @ U protocol is used to exchange user data over G@@ TP tunnels across the S@@ x interfaces .
an IP pac@@ ket for a UE is enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ated in an G@@ TP@@ v1 @@@ -@@ @ U pac@@ ket and tun@@ n@@ eled between the P @@@ -@@ @ G@@ W and the e@@ No@@ de@@ B for transmission with respect to a UE over S1 @@@ -@@ @ U and S@@ 5 / S@@ 8 interfaces .
G@@ TP ' - charging transfer
the G@@ TP ' protocol is used to transfer charging data to the Char@@ ging G@@ ateway Fun@@ ction .
G@@ TP ' uses TCP / U@@ DP port 33@@ 86 .
within the G@@ PRS core network
three forms of G@@ TP are used by the G@@ PRS core network .
G@@ TP ' ( G@@ TP prime ) uses the same message structure as G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ C and G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ U , but has an independent function .
G@@ TP can be used with U@@ DP or TCP .
G@@ TP version 1 is used only on U@@ DP .
G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ U is also used to transport user data from the R@@ NC to the S@@ GS@@ N in U@@ MTS networks . however , in this case signalling is done using RA@@ NAP instead of G@@ TP @@@ -@@ @ C.
the original version of G@@ TP ( version 0 ) had considerable differences from the current versions ( versions 1,@@ 2 ) :
different G@@ TP variants are implemented by R@@ N@@ Cs , SG@@ SN@@ s , G@@ G@@ SN@@ s and CG@@ FS within 3@@ G@@ PP networks .
G@@ PRS mobile stations ( MS@@ s ) are connected to a S@@ GS@@ N without being aware of G@@ TP .
G@@ TP was originally standardized within E@@ T@@ SI ( GSM standard 09.@@ 60 ) .
with the creation of the U@@ MTS standards this was moved over to the 3@@ G@@ PP which , as of 2005 [ update ] maintains it as 3@@ G@@ PP standard 29.@@ 0@@ 60 .
G@@ TP ' uses the same message format , but its special uses are covered in standard 32.@@ 295 along with the standardized formats for the charging data it transfers .
later versions of TS 29.@@ 0@@ 60 de@@ prec@@ ate G@@ TP@@ v1 / v@@ 0 inter@@ working such that there is no fall@@ back in the event that the GS@@ N does not support the higher version .
G@@ TP@@ v2 ( for evolved pac@@ ket services ) went into draft in early 2008 and was released in December of that year .
G@@ TP@@ v2 offers fall@@ back to G@@ TP@@ v1 via the earlier " Version Not Sup@@ ported " mechanism but explicitly offers no support for fall@@ back to G@@ TP@@ v@@ 0 .
G@@ TP can be used with U@@ DP or TCP . U@@ DP is either recommended or mandatory , except for tun@@ n@@ eling X@@ .@@ 25 in version 0 .
G@@ TP version 1 is used only on U@@ DP .
GSM standard 09.@@ 60 , E@@ T@@ SI , 1996 @@@ -@@ @ 98 , this standard covers the original version 0 of G@@ TP .
General features
all variants of G@@ TP have certain features in common . the structure of the messages is the same , with a G@@ TP header following the U@@ DP / TCP header .

the He@@ in@@ z dilemma is a frequently used example in many ethics and morality classes . one well @@@ -@@ @ known version of the dilemma , used in Law@@ rence Ko@@ h@@ l@@ berg 's stages of moral development , is stated as follows [ 1 ] :
stage five ( social contract orientation ) : He@@ in@@ z should steal the medicine because everyone has a right to choose life , regardless of the law .
or : He@@ in@@ z should not steal the medicine because the scientist has a right to fair compensation . even if his wife is sick , it does not make his actions right .
stage six ( universal human ethics ) : He@@ in@@ z should steal the medicine , because saving a human life is a more fundamental value than the property rights of another person .
or : He@@ in@@ z should not steal the medicine , because others may need the medicine just as badly , and their lives are equally significant .

stage one ( obedience ) : He@@ in@@ z should not steal the medicine because he will consequently be put in prison which will mean he is a bad person .
or : He@@ in@@ z should steal the medicine because it is only worth $ 200 and not how much the dru@@ gg@@ ist wanted for it ; He@@ in@@ z had even offered to pay for it and was not ste@@ aling anything else .
stage two ( self @@@ -@@ @ interest ) : He@@ in@@ z should steal the medicine because he will be much hap@@ pier if he saves his wife , even if he will have to serve a prison sentence .
or : He@@ in@@ z should not steal the medicine because prison is an aw@@ ful place , and he would more likely langu@@ ish in a jail cell than over his wife 's death .
stage three ( conformity ) : He@@ in@@ z should steal the medicine because his wife expects it ; he wants to be a good husband .
or : He@@ in@@ z should not steal the drug because ste@@ aling is bad and he is not a criminal ; he has tried to do everything he can without breaking the law , you CA@@ N@@ NOT blame him .
stage four ( law @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ order ) : He@@ in@@ z should not steal the medicine because the law prohibits ste@@ aling , making it illegal .

the advent of M@@ BC @@@ -@@ @ TV brought significant development to the television industry in Korea and after 1969 the television industry was characterized by fu@@ rious competition among the three networks .
the 1970s were highlighted by government intervention into the media system in Korea . in 1972 , President Park Ch@@ ung He@@ e government imposed censorship upon media through the Mar@@ tial Law Decree .

gl@@ uc@@ ose trans@@ porter type 4 ( G@@ LU@@ T @@@ -@@ @ 4 ) , also known as solu@@ te carrier family 2 , facilitated gl@@ uc@@ ose trans@@ porter member 4 , is a protein en@@ coded , in humans , by the SL@@ C@@ 2@@ A4 gene .
as muscles contract , they use ATP .
the energy needed to make ATP comes from a variety of different pathways - such as gly@@ col@@ y@@ sis or oxid@@ ative phosph@@ or@@ yl@@ ation - that ultimately use gl@@ uc@@ ose as a starting material . [ 13 ]
in stri@@ ated sk@@ ele@@ tal muscle cells , G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 concentration in the plasma membrane can increase as a result of either exercise or muscle contraction .
in order to increase gl@@ uc@@ ose levels in the cell , G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 is the primary trans@@ porter used in this facilitated diffusion . [ 14 ]
although muscle contrac@@ tions function in a similar way and also induce the trans@@ location of G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 into the plasma membrane , the two sk@@ ele@@ tal muscle processes obtain different forms of in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 .
an analysis of m@@ R@@ NA levels of G@@ LU@@ T@@ 1 and G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 in cardi@@ ac muscles show that G@@ LU@@ T@@ 1 plays a larger role in cardi@@ ac muscles than it does in sk@@ ele@@ tal muscles .

much like in other tissues , G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 also responds to insul@@ in sign@@ aling , and is transported into the plasma membrane to facilitate the diffusion of gl@@ uc@@ ose into the cell . [ 20 ]
if G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 is over @@@ -@@ @ expressed , it can actually alter nutrient distribution and send excess gl@@ uc@@ ose into adi@@ pose tissue , leading to increased adi@@ pose tissue mass . [ 23 ]
Regulation
when gl@@ uc@@ ose in the blood bin@@ ds to gl@@ uc@@ ose recep@@ tors on the beta cell membrane , a signal casc@@ ade is initiated inside the cell that results in insul@@ in stored in ve@@ si@@ cles in these cells being released into the blood stream . [ 25 ] Increased insul@@ in levels cause the uptake of gl@@ uc@@ ose into the cells . G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 is stored in the cell in transport ve@@ si@@ cles , and is quickly incorporated into the plasma membrane of the cell when insul@@ in bin@@ ds to membrane recep@@ tors . [ 3 ]
PI @@@ -@@ @ 3 kin@@ ase conver@@ ts the membrane lip@@ id P@@ IP@@ 2 to P@@ IP@@ 3 .
in@@ hibition of the G@@ TP@@ ase @@@ -@@ @ activating domain leaves proteins next in the casc@@ ade in their active form , and stimulates G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 to be expressed on the plasma membrane . [ 28 ]
Rac@@ 1 is a G@@ TP@@ ase also activated by insul@@ in .
Rac@@ 1 stimulates reorganization of the cor@@ tical acti@@ n cy@@ tos@@ k@@ elet@@ on [ 29 ] which allows for the G@@ LU@@ T@@ 4 ve@@ si@@ cles to be inserted into the plasma membrane . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] A Rac@@ 1 Kno@@ ck@@ out mouse has reduced gl@@ uc@@ ose uptake in muscle tissue . [ 31 ]

the basic algorithm can be written as follows :
inputs : N : a composite number Output : a non@@ tri@@ vial factor of n or failure
the running time of this algorithm is O ( B × log B × log@@ 2 n ) ; larger values of B make it run slower , but are more likely to produce a factor .
example
if we want to factor the number n = 299 .
since 1 < 13 < 299 , thus return 13 .
299 / 13 = 23 is prime , thus it is fully fac@@ to@@ red : 299 = 13 × 23 .
let n be a composite integer with prime factor p . by Fer@@ mat 's little theore@@ m , we know that for all integers a cop@@ ri@@ me to p and for all positive integers K :
if a number x is cong@@ ru@@ ent to 1 mod@@ ul@@ o a factor of n , then the g@@ cd ( x − 1 , n ) will be divi@@ sible by that factor .

moving average regression model
in a moving average regression model , a variable of interest is assumed to be a weighted moving average of un@@ observed independent error terms ; the weights in the moving average are parameters to be estimated .

is@@ omer@@ isation
Post@@ transl@@ ational modification
finally , the protein can undergo a variety of post@@ transl@@ ational modifications , which are briefly summarized here .
the N @@@ -@@ @ terminal am@@ ino group of a poly@@ pep@@ tide can be modified co@@ val@@ ently , e.g. ,
1 N @@@ -@@ @ terminal ace@@ tyl@@ ation
the positive charge on the N @@@ -@@ @ terminal am@@ ino group may be eliminated by changing it to an ace@@ ty@@ l group ( N @@@ -@@ @ terminal blocking ) .
the N @@@ -@@ @ terminal meth@@ ion@@ ine usually found after translation has an N @@@ -@@ @ termin@@ us blocked with a form@@ yl group . this form@@ yl group ( and sometimes the meth@@ ion@@ ine resi@@ due itself , if followed by G@@ ly or S@@ er ) is removed by the enzy@@ me de@@ form@@ yl@@ ase .
2 For@@ mation of pyro@@ gl@@ ut@@ am@@ ate from an N @@@ -@@ @ terminal gl@@ ut@@ am@@ ine
an N @@@ -@@ @ terminal gl@@ ut@@ am@@ ine can attack itself , forming a cycl@@ ic pyro@@ gl@@ ut@@ am@@ ate group .
similar to ace@@ tyl@@ ation . instead of a simple methyl group , the my@@ ri@@ sto@@ yl group has a tail of 14 hydro@@ pho@@ bic carbons , which make it ideal for anch@@ oring proteins to cellular membran@@ es .
the C @@@ -@@ @ terminal car@@ box@@ yl@@ ate group of a poly@@ pep@@ tide can also be modified , e.g. ,
3 C @@@ -@@ @ terminal am@@ idation

the C @@@ -@@ @ termin@@ us can also be blocked ( thus , neutr@@ alizing its negative charge ) by am@@ ination .

finally , the pep@@ tide side chains can also be modified co@@ val@@ ently , e.g. ,
gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ation
hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation
meth@@ yl@@ ation
ace@@ tyl@@ ation
chemical
the hydro@@ pho@@ bic is@@ op@@ rene ( e.g. , far@@ nes@@ yl , ger@@ any@@ l , and ger@@ an@@ yl@@ ger@@ any@@ l groups ) and pal@@ mit@@ o@@ yl groups may be added to the S γ { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ ma@@ thr@@ m { S ^ { \ gam@@ ma } } } atom of cy@@ ste@@ ine residues to anchor proteins to cellular membran@@ es .
unlike the G@@ PI and my@@ rit@@ o@@ yl anch@@ ors , these groups are not necessarily added at the termin@@ i .
car@@ box@@ yl@@ ation
u@@ bi@@ qu@@ i@@ tin@@ ation and SU@@ MO@@ yl@@ ation
various full @@@ -@@ @ length , folded proteins can be attached at their C @@@ -@@ @ termin@@ i to the si@@ dec@@ ha@@ in ammonium groups of ly@@ sin@@ es of other proteins . u@@ bi@@ qu@@ iti@@ n is the most common of these , and usually signals that the u@@ bi@@ qu@@ iti@@ n @@@ -@@ @ tag@@ ged protein should be degraded .
most of the poly@@ pep@@ tide modifications listed above occur post @@@ -@@ @ transl@@ ation@@ ally , i.e. , after the protein has been synthe@@ sized on the ri@@ bos@@ ome , typically occurring in the endo@@ plas@@ mic re@@ ticul@@ um , a sub@@ cellular organ@@ elle of the eu@@ k@@ ary@@ otic cell .
many other chemical reactions ( e.g. , cy@@ an@@ yl@@ ation ) have been applied to proteins by chem@@ ists , although they are not found in biological systems .
pep@@ ti@@ des can be synthe@@ si@@ sed chem@@ ically via a range of laboratory methods . chemical methods typically synthe@@ si@@ se pep@@ ti@@ des in the opposite order to biological protein synthesis ( starting at the C @@@ -@@ @ termin@@ us ) .

notes and references
pep@@ ti@@ des can be directly sequ@@ enced , or inf@@ erred from DNA sequences . large sequence databases now exist that coll@@ ate known protein sequences .
secondary structure elements typically spontaneously form as an intermediate before the protein fol@@ ds into its three dimensional tertiary structure .
the Dictionary of Prote@@ in Secondary Structure , in short D@@ SS@@ P , is commonly used to describe the protein secondary structure with single letter codes .
the secondary structure is assigned based on hydrogen bon@@ ding patterns as those initially proposed by Paul@@ ing et al. in 1951 ( before any protein structure had ever been experi@@ mentally determined ) .
there are eight types of secondary structure that D@@ SS@@ P defines :
according to D@@ SS@@ P , a hydrogen @@@ -@@ @ bond exists if and only if E is less than − 0.5 k@@ cal / mol ( − 2.1 k@@ J / mol ) .
although the D@@ SS@@ P formula is a relatively crude approxim@@ ation of the physical hydrogen @@@ -@@ @ bond energy , it is generally accepted as a tool for defining secondary structure .
SS@@ T [ 1 ] classification
SS@@ T is a Ba@@ ye@@ sian method to assign secondary structure to protein coordinate data using the Shan@@ non information criterion of Minimum Message L@@ ength ( M@@ ML ) in@@ ference .
SS@@ T accurately deline@@ ates any protein chain into regions associated with the following assignment types : [ 12 ]
predic@@ ting protein tertiary structure from only its am@@ ino sequence is a very challenging problem ( see protein structure prediction ) , but using the simpler secondary structure definitions is more tractable .
the concept of secondary structure was first introduced by Ka@@ j Ul@@ rik Lin@@ der@@ str@@ ø@@ m @@@ -@@ @ Lan@@ g at Stan@@ ford in 1952 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Other types of bi@@ opol@@ ym@@ ers such as nucle@@ ic acids also possess characteristic secondary structures .
distant relationships between proteins whose primary structures are un@@ al@@ ign@@ able can sometimes be found by secondary structure . [ 1 ]

differen@@ cing in statistics is a transformation applied to time @@@ -@@ @ series data in order to make it stationary . a stationary time series ' properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed .

differen@@ cing removes the changes in the level of a time series , eliminating trend and seas@@ on@@ ality and consequently stabilizing the mean of the time series .
sometimes it may be necessary to difference the data a second time to obtain a stationary time series , which is referred to as second order differen@@ cing :

the sample auto@@ correlation plot and the sample partial auto@@ correlation plot are compared to the theoretical behavior of these plots when the order is known .

this basic setting set by Cra@@ w@@ ford and So@@ bel [ 1 ] has given rise to a variety of variants .

indifference condition . what happens at t = ti ? the sender has to be indifferent between sending either message mi @@@ -@@ @ 1 or mi .
this gives information about N and the ti .
N = 1 : this is the bab@@ bling equilibri@@ um@@ . t@@ 0 = 0 , t@@ 1 = 1 ; a@@ 1 = 1 / 2 = 0.5 .
with N = 1 , we get the co@@ ar@@ s@@ est possible message , which does not give any information . so everything is red on the top left panel . with N = 3 , the message is fin@@ er .
however , it remains quite co@@ ar@@ se compared to full revelation , which would be the 45 ° line , but which is not a N@@ ash equilibrium .
with a higher N , and a fin@@ er message , the blue area is more important . this implies higher utility . dis@@ closing more information benefits both parties .

a geome@@ tri@@ zed unit system or geometric unit system is a system of natural units in which the base physical units are chosen so that the speed of light in vacuum , c , and the gra@@ vit@@ ational constant , G , are set equal to unity .
any velocity can be interpreted as the slope of a curve ; in geometric units , slopes are evidently dimen@@ sion@@ less ratios . physical quantities which can be identified with dimen@@ sion@@ less ratios include the components of the electromagnetic potential four @@@ -@@ @ vector and the electromagnetic current four @@@ -@@ @ vector .
here is a table collecting some important physical quantities according to their dimensions in geome@@ tri@@ zed units .
they are listed together with the appropriate conversion factor for SI units .
this table can be augmented to include temperature , as indicated above , as well as further derived physical quantities such as various moments .
this system is useful in physics , especially in the special and general theories of rel@@ ativity . all physical quantities are identified with geometric quantities such as areas , lengths , dimen@@ sion@@ less numbers , path cur@@ v@@ atures , or sec@@ tional cur@@ v@@ atures .
many equations in rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ tic physics appear simpler when expressed in geometric units , because all occurrences of G and of c drop out . for example , the Sch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radius of a non@@ rotating un@@ charged black hole with mass m becomes r = 2@@ m .
the small numerical size of the few conversion factors reflects the fact that rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ tic effects are only noticeable when large masses or high speeds are considered .

decimal Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers
decimal Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers with an even number of digits are divi@@ sible by 11 .
all numbers in base 10 ( and indeed in any base ) with one digit are Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic . the number of Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers with two digits is 9 :
there are 90 Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers with three digits ( Using the Rule of product : 9 choices for the first digit - which determines the third digit as well - multiplied by 10 choices for the second digit ) :
and also 90 Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers with four digits : ( again , 9 choices for the first digit multiplied by ten choices for the second digit . the other two digits are determined by the choice of the first two )
so there are 199 Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers below 104 .
for instance : Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics . a typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property and are Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic .
G. J. Sim@@ mons con@@ jec@@ tured there are no pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mes of form n@@ k for k > 4 ( and n > 1 ) . [ 2 ]
Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers can be considered in num@@ eral systems other than decimal . for example , the binary Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers are :
with , as usual , 0 ≤ ai < b for all i and AK ≠ 0 . then n is Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic if and only if ai = AK − i for all i .
zero is written 0 in any base and is also Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic by definition .
there are many Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic perfect powers n@@ k , where n is a natural number and k is 2 , 3 or 4 .
the first nine terms of the sequence 12 , 112 , 11@@ 12 , 11@@ 112 , ... form the pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mes 1 , 121 , 12@@ 321 , 12@@ 34@@ 321 , ... ( sequence A@@ 00@@ 24@@ 77 in the OE@@ IS )
other bases
in base 7 , because 10@@ 17 is twice a perfect square ( 52 = 347 ) , several of its multi@@ ples are Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic squares :
in base 18 , some powers of seven are Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic :
and in base 24 the first eight powers of five are Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic as well :
any number n is Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic in all bases b with b ≥ n + 1 ( tri@@ vi@@ ally so , because n is then a single @@@ -@@ @ digit number ) , and also in base n − 1 ( because n is then 11@@ n − 1 ) . a number that is non @@@ -@@ @ Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic in all bases 2 ≤ b < n − 1 is called a strictly non @@@ -@@ @ Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic number .

the physical problem of changing the color of a captured piece can be handled by : [ 5 ]
Cra@@ zy@@ house ( also known as drop chess , mad chess , reinforcement chess , turn@@ about chess and sch@@ iz@@ o @@@ -@@ @ chess ) is a chess variant similar to bu@@ gh@@ ouse chess , but with only two players . it effectively incorporates a rule from the game Sho@@ gi , in which a player can introduce a captured piece back to the ch@@ ess@@ board as their own .
there is no standard FE@@ N specification for Cra@@ zy@@ house . however at L@@ ich@@ ess an extended version of FE@@ N is in use . here is L@@ ich@@ ess 's FE@@ N implemen@@ tion example . [ 6 ]
L@@ ich@@ ess simply adds a 0@@ th rank as a reserve .
there are more than 8 pieces on the reserve , so the last section may have more than 8 characters .
a different no@@ tation is used by X@@ Board / Win@@ board . the reserve is given in square brackets following the board position .
Ch@@ ess@@ .com uses another no@@ tation . the reserve is put after full @@@ -@@ @ move number .
rules
all the rules and conventions of standard chess apply , with the addition of drops , as explained below .

bo@@ wing
different degrees of bo@@ wing and pro@@ stration , here drawn from Eastern Orthodox religious lit@@ urgical use
basic bo@@ ws originate at the wa@@ ist and are performed with the back straight and the hands at the sides ( for men ) or cl@@ as@@ ped in front ( for women ) , and with the eyes down .
bo@@ ws are a required and expected part of any ap@@ ology or expression of thanks in East Asia , especially Japan and Korea .
bo@@ ws also replace speaking under certain circumstances . for example , when en@@ countering again a person to whom one has already spoken that day , a silent bow replaces such phrases as " hel@@ lo " or " hi . "
when addressing a subordinate , a manager , supervisor , or other leader generally only no@@ ds the head slightly ( some may not bow at all ) , while the subordinate ben@@ ds forward slightly from the wa@@ ist .
generally when bo@@ wing in proximity to another , as necessitated when combining bo@@ wing and sha@@ king hands , people turn slightly to one side to avoid bum@@ ping heads .

in many situations , the standing bow has replaced the k@@ ow@@ to@@ w .

however , a tri@@ e also has some draw@@ backs compared to a h@@ ash table :
this is because a DA@@ FSA can com@@ press identical branches from the tri@@ e which correspond to the same suff@@ i@@ xes ( or parts ) of different words being stored .
tries are also well suited for implementing approximate matching algorithms , [ 8 ] including those used in spell checking and hy@@ phen@@ ation [ 2 ] software .
a simple No@@ de class can be used to represent nodes in the tri@@ e :
a slight modifications of this routine can be utilized
to check if there is any word in the tri@@ e that starts with a given pre@@ fix ( see § Auto@@ complete ) , and to return the deepest node corresponding to some pre@@ fix of a given string .
insertion proceeds by walking the tri@@ e according to the string to be inserted , then ap@@ pending new nodes for the suff@@ ix of the string that is not contained in the tri@@ e :
tries can be used to return a list of keys with a given pre@@ fix . this can also be modified to allow for wild@@ cards in the pre@@ fix search . [ 1 ]
full @@@ -@@ @ text search
another alternative in order to avoid the use of an array of 256 po@@ inters ( A@@ SC@@ II ) , as suggested before , is to store the alphabet array as a bit@@ map of 256 bits representing the A@@ SC@@ II alphabet , reducing dramatically the size of the nodes . [ 17 ]
com@@ pressing tries
com@@ pressing the tri@@ e and merging the common branches can sometimes yield large performance gains . this works best under the following conditions :
the result of such compression may look similar to trying to transform the tri@@ e into a directed ac@@ ycl@@ ic graph ( DA@@ G ) , because the reverse transform from a DA@@ G to a tri@@ e is obvious and always possible .
however , the shape of the DA@@ G is determined by the form of the key chosen to index the nodes , in turn constra@@ ining the compression possible .
one more approach is to " pack " the tri@@ e . [ 4 ] Li@@ ang describes a space @@@ -@@ @ efficient implementation of a spar@@ se packed tri@@ e applied to automatic hy@@ phen@@ ation , in which the descendants of each node may be inter@@ lea@@ ved in memory .
external memory tries
several tri@@ e variants are suitable for maintaining sets of strings in external memory , including suff@@ ix trees .

as discussed below , [ where ? ] a tri@@ e has a number of advantages over binary search trees . [ 6 ] [ examples needed ]
a tri@@ e can also be used to replace a h@@ ash table , over which it has the following advantages :
L@@ SD sorts are generally stable sorts .
M@@ SD sorts are not necessarily stable if the original ordering of duplicate keys must always be maintained .
other than the tra@@ versal order , M@@ SD and L@@ SD sorts differ in their handling of variable length input .
L@@ SD sorts can group by length , radi@@ x sort each group , then conc@@ at@@ en@@ ate the groups in size order .
M@@ SD sorts must effectively ' extend ' all shorter keys to the size of the largest key and sort them accordingly , which can be more complicated than the grouping required by L@@ SD .
however , M@@ SD sorts are more amen@@ able to sub@@ division and recur@@ sion .
radi@@ x sort dates back as far as 18@@ 87 to the work of Her@@ man Hol@@ ler@@ ith on ta@@ bul@@ ating machines . [ 1 ] Radi@@ x sorting algorithms came into common use as a way to sort pun@@ ched cards as early as 1923 . [ 2 ]
complexity and performance
radi@@ x sorts operates in O ( n@@ w ) time , where n is the number of keys , and w is the key length .
L@@ SD variants can achieve a lower bound for w of ' average key length ' when splitting variable length keys into groups as discussed above .

there were two iter@@ ations of a special ink formulated exclusively for use in the Par@@ ker 51 .
this initial ink was highly al@@ kal@@ ine and while water @@@ -@@ @ based , also included a substantial amount of iso@@ prop@@ yl alcohol .

the pen was not named after the P @@@ -@@ @ 51 Mu@@ stan@@ g fighter plane ; but Par@@ ker took advantage of the coincidence by comparing the pen and the plane in its advertising .

in computer networking , a un@@ ic@@ ast flood is when a switch receives a un@@ ic@@ ast frame and treats it as a broadcast frame , flooding the frame to all other ports on the switch .
devices other than switches may create un@@ ic@@ ast floods as well . a rou@@ ter which has a bridge interface but does not have the destination frame 's address in the bridge cache will flood the frame out to all bridge members . [ 2 ]
or a more robust , cross @@@ -@@ @ switch solution than ' swit@@ ch@@ port protected ' is the use of Private V@@ LAN@@ s . [ 7 ]
when a network is experiencing un@@ ic@@ ast flooding , network performance is degraded . here is an graph of a bridge before and after adjusting the size of the bridge address cache :
when a switch receives a un@@ ic@@ ast frame with a destination address not in the switch 's forwarding table , the frame is treated like a broadcast frame and sent to all hosts on a network :
another common cause are hosts with AR@@ P tim@@ ers longer than the address cache time@@ out on switches - the switch for@@ gets which port connects to the host . [ 1 ]
Mac flooding can also be used as a ru@@ di@@ mentary V@@ LAN hop@@ ping attack . [ 2 ]

L@@ ang@@ er@@ h@@ ans cells are im@@ mature d@@ end@@ ri@@ tic cells that are found in all areas of the penile epi@@ th@@ el@@ ium , [ 11 ] but are most superficial in the inner surface of the fores@@ kin . [ 11 ]
the fores@@ kin can be seen depicted in art from different ages .
human neonatal der@@ mal fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ asts isolated from fores@@ kin stained with cal@@ ce@@ in @@@ -@@ @ AM . such cells are commonly used in bi@@ ore@@ actor and tissue engineering applications .
fores@@ kins of babies are also used for skin gra@@ ft tissue , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and for β @@@ -@@ @ inter@@ fer@@ on @@@ -@@ @ based drugs . [ 16 ]
fores@@ kin fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ asts have been used in biom@@ ed@@ ical research . [ 17 ]
development
the fores@@ kin is present in non @@@ -@@ @ human pri@@ mates , including the ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee . [ 1 ]
once the fores@@ kin has naturally separated from the gl@@ ans , the fores@@ kin 's two layers of outer skin and inner m@@ uc@@ osa can be re@@ tracted to reveal the gl@@ ans , inner fores@@ kin , and rid@@ ged band .
the fores@@ kin typically covers the gl@@ ans when the penis is not erec@@ t ( top image ) , but generally re@@ trac@@ ts upon erection ( bottom image ) . coverage of the gl@@ ans in a fl@@ ac@@ ci@@ d and erec@@ t state varies depending on fores@@ kin length
sensitivity
modifications
Pre@@ pu@@ ti@@ o@@ pl@@ ast@@ y is the most common fores@@ kin reconstruction technique , most often done when a boy is born with a fores@@ kin that is too small ; [ 1 ] : 177 a similar procedure is performed to relieve a tight fores@@ kin without resorting to circumcision . [ 41 ] : 181
other cultural or a@@ es@@ e@@ thetic practices include genital pi@@ erc@@ ings involving the fores@@ kin and s@@ lit@@ ting the fores@@ kin . [ 45 ]
conditions
the fores@@ kin can be involved in balan@@ itis , ph@@ im@@ osis , sexually transmitted infection and penile cancer . [ 46 ]
Fren@@ ul@@ um bre@@ ve is a f@@ ren@@ ul@@ um that is insufficiently long to allow the fores@@ kin to fully re@@ tract , which may lead to discomfort during intercourse .
lic@@ hen s@@ cl@@ ero@@ sus is a chronic , inflammatory skin condition that most commonly occurs in adult women , although it may also be seen in men and children . topical clo@@ bet@@ as@@ ol pro@@ pi@@ onate and m@@ om@@ et@@ as@@ one fu@@ ro@@ ate were proven effective in treating genital lic@@ hen s@@ cl@@ ero@@ sus .

in the economic study of the public sector , economic and social development is the process by which the economic well @@@ -@@ @ being and quality of life of a nation , region , local community , or an individual are improved according to targeted goals and objectives .
economic development originated in the post @@@ -@@ @ war period of reconstruction initiated by the United States .
in 1949 , during his inaugural speech , President Harry Tr@@ uman identified the development of un@@ developed areas as a priority for the west :
economic growth deals with an increase in the level of output , but economic development is related to an increase in output coupled with improvement in the social and political welfare of people within a country . therefore , Y@@ oda dies

transit time effects are reduced by reduced spac@@ ings in the tube .
tubes such as the 4@@ 16@@ B ( a L@@ igh@@ thouse design ) and the 77@@ 68 ( an all @@@ -@@ @ ceramic mini@@ at@@ ur@@ ised design ) are specified for operation to 4 GH@@ z . they feature greatly reduced grid @@@ -@@ @ ca@@ tho@@ de spac@@ ings in the order of 0.1 mm .
these greatly reduced grid spac@@ ings also give a much higher ampl@@ ification factor than conventional ax@@ ial designs .
the 77@@ 68 has an ampl@@ ification factor of 225 , compared with 100 for the 6@@ AV@@ 6 used in domestic radios and about the maximum possible for an ax@@ ial design .
ano@@ de @@@ -@@ @ grid capac@@ it@@ ance is not especially low in these designs .
operation
the tri@@ ode 's ano@@ de current is highly dependent on ano@@ de voltage as well as grid voltage , causing it to appear as a voltage source in circuit .
the J@@ FE@@ T 's drain current is virtually un@@ affected by drain voltage , thus it appears as a constant @@@ -@@ @ current device , similar in action to a te@@ tro@@ de or pen@@ to@@ de tube .
both the J@@ FE@@ T and te@@ tro@@ de / pen@@ to@@ de valves offer much higher voltage gains than the tri@@ ode .
the tri@@ ode was the first non @@@ -@@ @ mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies , and made radio practical . tri@@ o@@ des are used for ampl@@ ifi@@ ers and oscill@@ ators .
vacuum tubes are obsolete in mass @@@ -@@ @ marketed consumer electronics , having been over@@ taken by less expensive transi@@ stor @@@ -@@ @ based solid @@@ -@@ @ state devices . however , more recently , vacuum tubes have been making somewhat of a com@@ e@@ back .
characteristics
in the class @@@ -@@ @ A tri@@ ode ampl@@ ifier , an ano@@ de resi@@ stor would be connected between the ano@@ de and the positive voltage source . for example , with Ra = 10@@ 000 oh@@ ms , the voltage drop on it would be
V@@ RA = I@@ a × Ra = 2@@ 2.5 V if an ano@@ de current of I@@ a = 2.@@ 25 m@@ A is chosen .
since the grid voltage changes from − 1.5 V to − 0.5 V , and the ano@@ de resi@@ stor voltage drops from 12 to 33 V , an ampl@@ ification of the signal resulted . the ampl@@ ification factor is 21 : output voltage ampl@@ itude divided by input voltage ampl@@ itude .

a business designed specifically for dancers in their country who have outstanding talent and passion , but have trouble overcoming the hardships of the shallow path of employment and unfortunately decide to give up on their dancing career .
the founder of Dance Plan@@ ner had also had the same experience as above , and had eventually been employed to a foreign dance company . therefore even before the corporation establishment ( which was in 2016 ) had been held , he has helped dancers in his surrounding and gradually started with the service .
from recommending dance companies suitable for each dan@@ cer , to audi@@ tion examination , audi@@ tion tour@@ ing planning ( accommodations , travel paths , reservations for flights ) , arrangements for practice spaces + contract consulting ( helping with contract adjustments and being issued with a V@@ ISA ) .
dance Plan@@ ner helps dancers focus on nothing but simply audi@@ tioning and getting into foreign countries without any unnecessary hardships and is with the dan@@ cer through the whole audi@@ tion process step by step . also , Dance Plan@@ ner 's proceeds to help the dan@@ cer even when it is time to sign the contract form , and guides dancers into safely entering their desired dance companies .
we accept counseling starting from October , in order for dancers to pre@@ p for audi@@ tioning season which is held in January to March each year .
