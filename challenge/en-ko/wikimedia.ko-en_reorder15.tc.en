classification of fluids with shear stress as a function of shear rate : Pseudoplastic , Bingham and Bingham pseudoplastic all show reduction in apparent viscosity with increasing shear rate .
modern paints are examples of pseudoplastic materials . when modern paints are applied the shear created by the brush or roller will allow them to thin and wet out the surface evenly . once applied the paints regain their higher viscosity which avoids drips and runs .
it helps to reduce the calling overhead on simple kernel routines , and also can work as a way to select the best system call method on some architectures .

a statistic ( singular ) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . it is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
observability
more formally , statistical theory defines a statistic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . the term statistic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .

generalization to higher dimensions

second derivative power rule
the laplacian of a function is equal to the divergence of the gradient and the trace of the Hessian matrix .
on the graph of a function , the second derivative corresponds to the curvature or concavity of the graph . the graph of a function with a positive second derivative is upwardly concave , while the graph of a function with a negative second derivative curves in the opposite way .
when using Leibniz 's notation for derivatives , the second derivative of a dependent variable y with respect to an independent variable x is written
the derivative of f is the function
it is possible to write a single limit for the second derivative :
the second derivative generalizes to higher dimensions through the notion of second partial derivatives . for a function f : R3 → R , these include the three second @-@ order partials
another common generalization of the second derivative is the laplacian . this is the differential operator ∇ 2 { \ displaystyle \ nabla ^ { 2 } } defined by

English mathematicians were encumbered by Newton 's dot notation until 1803 when Robert Woodhouse published a description of the continental notation . later the Analytical Society at Cambridge University promoted the adoption of Leibniz 's notation .
in its modern interpretation , the expression dy / dx should not be read as the division of two quantities dx and dy ( as Leibniz had envisioned it ) ; rather , the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shorthand for
