an improvement on this situation was the ability to relocate execu@@ table programs when they were loaded into memory . only one copy of the program was required , but once loaded the program could not be moved .
IBM OS / 360 programs ( 1966 ) fit this model .

a stati@@ stic ( sing@@ ular ) or sample stati@@ stic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . it is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
observ@@ ability
more formally , statistical theory defines a stati@@ stic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . the term stati@@ stic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .

a packing density or packing fraction of a packing in some space is the fraction of the space filled by the figures making up the packing . in packing problems , the objective is usually to obtain a packing of the greatest possible density .

uniform til@@ ings can exist in both the Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an plane and hyper@@ bol@@ ic plane . uniform til@@ ings are related to the finite uniform poly@@ he@@ dr@@ a which can be considered uniform til@@ ings of the sphere .

the first is made of 2 @@@ -@@ @ edges , and next two are triangular edges , and the last has overlapping hex@@ ag@@ onal edges .

second deri@@ vative power rule
the la@@ plac@@ ian of a function is equal to the divergence of the gradient and the trace of the H@@ es@@ sian matrix .
on the graph of a function , the second deri@@ vative corresponds to the cur@@ v@@ ature or conc@@ av@@ ity of the graph . the graph of a function with a positive second deri@@ vative is up@@ war@@ dly con@@ cave , while the graph of a function with a negative second deri@@ vative curves in the opposite way .
the power rule for the first deri@@ vative , if applied twice , will produce the second deri@@ vative power rule as follows :
that is : the second deri@@ vative of a function f ( x ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style f ( x ) } is usually den@@ oted f ″ ( x ) { \ dis@@ play@@ style f " ( x ) } .
when using Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's no@@ tation for derivatives , the second deri@@ vative of a dependent variable y with respect to an independent variable x is written
the deri@@ vative of f is the function
it is possible to write a single limit for the second deri@@ vative :
the second deri@@ vative gener@@ alizes to higher dimensions through the notion of second partial derivatives . for a function f : R@@ 3 → R , these include the three second @@@ -@@ @ order parti@@ als
another common gener@@ alization of the second deri@@ vative is the la@@ plac@@ ian . this is the differential operator ∇ 2 { \ dis@@ play@@ style \ n@@ abl@@ a ^ { 2 } } defined by

decimal Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers with an even number of digits are divi@@ sible by 11 .
for instance : Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics . a typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property and are Pal@@ in@@ dro@@ mic .
