a stati@@ stic ( sing@@ ular ) or sample stati@@ stic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . it is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
observ@@ ability
more formally , statistical theory defines a stati@@ stic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . the term stati@@ stic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .
