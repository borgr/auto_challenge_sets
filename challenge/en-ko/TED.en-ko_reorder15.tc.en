here 's what my neuropsychologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it .
I 'm not a doctor . I have no medical background whatsoever .
so my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position .
this affected my entire body .
and I 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed .

I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim @-@ majority societies .
if I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders , they come to your mind immediately .

but Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person .
and he had a name for it .
imagine you had one second per product category .
you could count them in five minutes .
what is evolution ?
now Unilever did this and it didn 't work -- too complicated .
it didn 't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
that nagging dread of self @-@ hood didn 't exist when I was dancing .
what do you do when you grow up ? "
now is this a new idea ?
thank you .
and it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions .
and let your presence be a gift .
now nobody believed him .
I don 't doubt that that plays some role , but what I want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on .

but how attractive you find them , how sexually or romantically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you 're looking at .
the original is typically the product of a creative act , the forgery isn 't .

in the other condition , they 're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose -- knows they 're shocking them .
others worry about peace and security , stability in the world .
this message , this word , can come out that this is not an old @-@ fashioned way of doing business ; it 's a brilliant way of saving your child 's life .
but what is most amazing is the effect on girls .
but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response , but can 't quite control it .
is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply ? it needs to be constantly contracting , so therefore it 's almost selfish . it 's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .
( laughter ) But it 's a great intention to have in a relationship .
how many birds am I hearing ?
then there 's ultraviolet light .
so I 've mentioned to you the four challenges .
it 's just that , whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light , your language relies on pulses , discrete pulses , of sound .
in fact , the Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language .
how do we know this ?
and we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
it really opened my eyes .
I really miss you .
dw : the group . we all agreed on it .
and in the year 2008 , he partnered with me in the first @-@ of @-@ its @-@ kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer something called mindfulness training to active @-@ duty military personnel .
we call it the N170 component .
and what I mean by this is that when we direct attention to the face , it becomes clearer and more salient , it 's easier to see .
to kind of bring it back , I 'd like to make a prediction about your attention for the remainder of my talk .
so we might ask why do we do this ?
because those are the moments in which their attention is most likely to be vulnerable , because of stress and mind @-@ wandering .
but if you do engage in mindfulness practice , the more you do , the more you benefit .
by mid @-@ century , we 're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people living in cities or within a day 's travel of one .
urban retrofitting : creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there .
could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
there was no day of intercultural cooperation .

we 're going to have to live closer to each other .
the age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end .
we 're not going to be rescued by the hyper @-@ car ; we 're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels .
sometimes it 's hard to tell the two apart .
and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago .
so this presumably means that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past , since we don 't think that the ancestors of Melanesians were ever in Siberia .
Hamas Party Member : we were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine .
in fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .
but it goes a step further , and it tries to have actual computation .
it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do .
each element is completely identical , and they 're biased .
without them , humanity CANNOT survive . "
and it was really her strength , I believe , that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life .
and I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity , at least in the next few hundred years .
this seems most likely .
and this movie here shows this competition between molecules .
Lee Cronin : so many people think that life took millions of years to kick in .
so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon , maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for .
but you know , I have a problem with children 's books : I think they 're full of propaganda .
you pick them up , and once you see something that you 're interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
( laughter ) Telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
in some communities , you might not find a public health center , a post office or even a school , but you 'll find a church or mosque .
an Africa that demonstrates that God loves Africans and that we are just as capable as any other world region in solving our problems in peace ...
and then finally , Cagatay EVYAPAN , aka Cha0 -- one of the most remarkable hackers ever , from Ankara in Turkey .
they 're just relentless and obsessive about what they do .
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
this one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat .
( laughter ) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .
and so when I was first living in New York City a few years back , I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them .
or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool , like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice .
but really the most satisfying experience I 've had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit .
and once again , it 's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
these are initial musings for this project .
women have two copies of that big X chromosome ; men have the X and , of course , that small copy of the Y.
is that a big number ?
and perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it .
then we bring that into software and reassemble it , and tell you what the story is .
imagine one more thing , that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent : " would you be willing to meet your third cousin ? "
they call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
we went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
five , the consumer society .
you can play a game and try and think of one I 've missed at , or try and boil it down to just four , but you 'll lose .
( laughter ) Now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
ELA : if you were not yet convinced , sea levels are rising , so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature .
but this was just the beginning .
simply the ID that denies you health care .
people are living far longer now , and for the first time in human history , it 's common for four generations to be living side by side .
and the real tragedy was , if you look through her records , she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years .
you might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh , and his character , Sherlock Holmes , was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell .
and Conan Doyle , writing about Bell , described the following exchange between Bell and his students .
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh , except in the botanical gardens .
and Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called " the cylinder . "
I say that because these are difficult patients .
and so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and I tried not to interrupt them .
the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this , but here 's what you should do , here 's what we should do . "
I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story .
we marry , for example , with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .
I would feel the abdomen .
and then the next day , I would come , and I would do it again .
that 's what happens in academic journals , it 's what happens at academic conferences -- the Q & amp ; A session after a postdoc presents data is often a bloodbath .
if there is publication bias , if small negative trials have gone missing in action , you can see it on one of these graphs .
it 's perfect .
so , a jump rope , you can use it for all different kinds of things .
it 's one of the most enduring designs in history .
and the way you figure that out is : the diameter of the button plus the width of the button , plus a little bit of ease .
as we move across a stairway , the form dictates our pacing , our feeling , our safety and our relationship and engagement with the space around us .
when I was 10 years old , there was a girl in my class at school named Vicky .
like I was better than her , and she was garbage .
what kind of a nice person does that ?
I was in Beijing 's bidding for the Olympic Games .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they 're sick .
in urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside , but they don 't have the sense of belonging .
and also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
and this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
a father posted his son 's picture onto the Internet .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
and I said , " What is that ? "
who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane ?
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types .
and this type of activity goes on for quite a while , until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs .
so why despair when the unexpected knocks on the horizon ?
but it wasn 't until I got older and I learned more about the National Park System that I realized just how lucky I was .
but we need to take it a step further .
my parents are visiting here from Minnesota , and they don 't really even care about this talk , all they 're talking about is going to Muir Woods .
my medical exam was something completely different .
if it is , I can do that .
he didn 't know that .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
so they were concerned that the stories weren 't quite as accurate as police were claiming them to be .
there was no official investigation into his death .
he realized we had an intention to tell a different version of events ; we were skeptical .
and the first was , I 'd ask other people : " do you like it ? " " yes . "
that 's not the expression of joy .
so is that wrong ?
and he said , " I need to talk to you . "
I 'm going to show you Dominique Strauss @-@ Kahn with Obama who 's chattering with his fingertips .
barefoot technology : this was 1986 -- no engineer , no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs .
every five years we have an election .
tell a woman .
she handled the national press , and she was a star .
that 's what I say in my mind . and I just say " thank you , " and I go on to the next one .
this way , when you have an interaction with a chatbot on your phone or a voice @-@ based system in the car , it sounds a little more human and less cold and disjointed .
you still have that alligator brain . you do . it 's your emotional brain .
it 's a memory of very high @-@ dimensional patterns , like the things that come from your eyes .
I don 't know how this will turn out .
today we 're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at Copenhagen .
there 's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger .
we assume that Dr. No is trying to hack the exchange .
the internet of things is heralding a hyperconnected era with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020 .
and specifically , I 'd like to talk with you about how Bionics is evolving for people with arm amputations .
arm amputation is usually caused by trauma , with things like industrial accidents , motor vehicle collisions or , very poignantly , war .
every time you contract a muscle , it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis .
we built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago where we 've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors , or six degrees of freedom .
you touch yourself , there 's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain .
and we 're fortunate today to have Amanda Kitts come and join us .
( applause ) So Amanda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
( laughter ) And here you can see , on Jesse 's chest , when he just tried to do three different things , you can see three different patterns .
AK : so I have the elbow that goes up and down .
TK : that 's Claudia , and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .
so it 'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made .
there was a computer spook , a broken wire , a converter that sparked .
and then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here .
you all know the truth of what I 'm going to say .
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .
they 're all weighted equally .
this is mental illness .
we 've got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top .
horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer .
we have this molecule , but it 's not a pill yet .
and so I want to thank you for your participation , your collaboration and most of all , for your confidence in our ideas .
( laughter ) So I made series of images , cuttings , and I assembled them in portfolios .
and in papercutting , you have the drawing as the structure itself .
so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
and Bronx literature , it 's all about Bronx writers and their stories .
and I wanted to give them an escape .
it is a papercutting , and then after , I added color on the computer .
while building my house , I found something I didn 't know I was looking for -- what a lot of millennials and people who are moving back to cities are looking for .
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now .
I just found the molecule behind it .
and I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day .
and lots of generations , lots of tweaking and torquing , and we turn our puffer into the Mola .
and sure , it may be just one big old silly fish , but it 's helping .
there are thousands of local airstrips that don 't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could .
we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that 's what we 'd like to know .
now both these sources of information carry important information .
so it 's the optimal way of combining information .
and so they take it in turns to apply the force they 've just experienced back and forward .
( music ) Please .
( music ) You heard her , go ahead .
and write in order to be understood . write to your grandma .
I 'm going to add some resource from the left , here , that defuses into the system , and you can see , they really like that .
so I 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it 's much faster .
all of this happens in seconds .
humans have long held a fascination for the human brain .
we 've put all of that together into one thing , and I 'll show you what that synthesis looks like .
we 're just starting to look at this data ourselves .
now , you may not have focused on this , but index search accounted for 90 % of all search volume about 4 years ago .
( laughter ) The smartest one , first to come in , was the MTN company of South Africa .
when we sat people facing south , they organized time from left to right .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
I just told you that , if you make a mutation in the daf @-@ 2 gene cell , that you get a receptor that doesn 't work as well ; the animal lives longer .
so in a daf @-@ 2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor .
if you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful .
and the way that Generation G is different from X , Y , and all the different generations that we may belong to , is that video games are the primary form of entertainment that Generation G is consuming .
part of the reason gamification has become such an emergent topic right now is because of Generation G 's effect on culture and society already .
it turns out that we are already out of touch .
they 're the ones who had to deal with the summer of love and sex and drugs and all that kind of stuff .
so we already are doing solar engineering .
but it 's so little , it would be like putting a handful of chalk into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain .
and I do worry about that .
but I 'm really afraid we need much , much more .
it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country .
this is a potential threat .
the smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years .
this is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago .
( laughter ) But we 'd be rich !
this probe actually can 't use chemical rockets .
we are medicine men , we are medicine women , we are sun dancers , we are pipe carriers , we are traditional language speakers .
what used to be 50 Cent in my room then , to a 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy 's room now is Sauti Sol .
in 2015 , President Obama came to Kenya , and we had the pleasure of being the entertainment for the state dinner that happened at state house , Nairobi .
it 's not just another day .
I started snowboarding , then I went back to work , then I went back to school .
but if you ask me today , if I would ever want to change my situation , I would have to say no .
he 's about my age , and he 's in San Quentin State Prison .
and that 's felony murder -- 25 to life , parole at 50 if you 're lucky , and Tony 's not feeling very lucky .
what is that idea ?
" could be I 'm wrong . I 'm tired of being wrong .
but if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane , I think you need to learn to live , not without regret , but with it .
so let 's start off by defining some terms .
why ?
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways .
but I want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one .
we 're incredibly used to not having to face life 's hard realities , in a certain sense .
and this doesn 't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life .
I mean , even the stupid " reply all " regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .
and I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device .
but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
and then he said , " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . "
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
we have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
( laughter ) It 's like the six degrees of separation , but with research .
so for whatever reason , this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception .
( music ) ( Limited Frequency Music ) I had patients tell me that those sound the same .
because his grave was exhumed .
and at about four months old , I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss .
not long after , I was fitted with hearing aids .
but although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time , they weren 't very helpful .
you don 't actually have to hear it .
you wouldn 't want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
I believe that journalism is a public good .
so they 're collaborating with reporters , because for many researchers , it 's difficult for them to write a simple story or a clear story .
and it was a discussion with Revi that brought us to the edge of the researcher and reporter , that fuzzy boundary .
it 's a terrific story .
this also is not a research picture .
research environments and reporting trips and NGO projects are very intimate environments ; you make good friends while you 're doing good work .
a mother finishes setting the table for dinner .
I usually just got cut off .
good afternoon , I 'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow .
( laughter ) And then I started thinking , of course , we can 't just get rid of captchas , because the security of the web depends on them .
unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
you 'll be seeing one of the most high @-@ performance materials known to man .
and I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing .
all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent urination .
this is a big fibroid .
( music ) So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
so it 's unpredictable . we 'll paint this palette again .
so , my normal working field is called two @-@ photon polymerization .
and like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him : you 're not sure .
when I came out of college , I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California , and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that .
by saying all that , it means your work is good somehow .
( laughter ) RSW : frank had a sort of ...
and it 's inside and outside , self and other , and other is all very different .
and so you wouldn 't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it 's you versus the universe -- that 's all Buddha discovered .
now , a landfill is basically something which is not going to go away , and it 's increasing .
these are actually bricks that are made from old demolition waste , which includes the glass , the rubble , the concrete .
again , the perfect idea of thrift .
these are opium @-@ addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
I saw one day , the largest school in Afghanistan , a girls ' school .
but art can change the way we see the world .
the easy way is just -- I 'm papering black @-@ and @-@ white images on walls .
Luana : we 're just a tool for people that want to send a positive message .
their ability to do that is strengthened when they 're enabled with modern technology .
you of course want to record maybe how thick something is , which you can 't measure from space , whether that 's soil or snow .
she 's able to give back and really contribute in a meaningful way .
however , we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one @-@ time use .
you have a voice through the arts that doesn 't judge what you 've been through .
so never stop fighting to stand in your light because even in your darkest times , we see you .
old Man River , Big Muddy .
I strongly believe we can translate the science , bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment .
we all want a clean environment .
thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
imagine your internet access went off for a day , and when it came back , it only stayed on for three hours at a time , with random 15 @-@ hour outages ?
as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment , it doesn 't matter .
your aorta comes up behind your heart , it 's your major artery -- and it was severed , so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth .
and my lung collapsed , so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well , to stop that catastrophic event from happening .
it was like I was giving them a remote control over the information .
( laughter ) He was wrong .
it takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy in our highly industrialized food system in order to produce one calorie of food energy .
why not green food ?
( laughter ) So I 'm going to take you to task , guys .
so here 's the new history of gastronomy .
and it 's also due , sometimes , to the fact that doctors and patients are falsely influenced by advertising campaigns of pharmaceutical companies .
except that they 're not as rich as ours , because they don 't have a cerebral cortex like we do .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one .
other conditions show people the future self .
scraps of men do not exist .
people like Mahmoud are agents of change .
well now you should see me .
I thought , " Oh my gosh . I 'm going to become a Crotchety old lady . "
and you 're able to go back and forgive them .
you can work to change your relationship to your past .
these live in a global space which is largely unregulated , not subject to the rule of law , and in which people may act free of constraint .
you see , our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel , the Internet , satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison , which is about destroying our systems and our ways .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions .
in fact , what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
it is no longer the case .
and unfortunately , when I first received the answers -- and here , you 'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed .
51 % wanted to turn his or her life into a story .
you don 't have to read any books .
I 'm really not sure , and I 'm not here to tell you to burn your DVD player and throw out your Tolstoy .
well , we focus on needs and people and context .
it 's crucial to understand , I believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom @-@ up .
medical appointments would be scheduled during business hours , and I knew that I would need time off to recover from surgical procedures .
but in each one of your cells , each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .
it 's involved with the growing of the microtubules , and it 's able to transiently couple onto them .
but this is the kind of community I was thinking of -- a lunar community It had all of the same needs as a community on Earth would have , but it had some very unique constraints .
and thorium is not a rare substance , either .
there are many sites like this one in Idaho , where an area the size of a football field would produce enough thorium each year to power the entire world .
after every criminal and societal sanction that we can come up with , people still use drugs , and far too many die .
many people who were reliant on a steady supply of prescription drugs turned to heroin .
overdoses are uncommon .
this year even more people will get caught up in the illegal drug trade .
why is this ?
it 's like we need some melodic Viagra in our culture , ladies and gentlemen .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
these people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued -- they 've argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game .
in there , we 'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
I 'm an independent , individual person . "
" give us the new , " we 're always saying .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
what is a calendar ?
and the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
they 're selling us shoes and cars .
I 'm going to show you one example of what I 'm talking about .
we have a bunch of engineers , but none of them could please this client .
yes , our workforce needs specialized skill , but that skill requires a far less rigorous and formalized education than it did in the past .
the first metric is : is it sustainable ?
we actually have a solution for that .
and the answer is : yes .
here 's the plant species . Salicornia virginica .
we do things because of other things .
and so really , there are all these things , like beliefs , desires , sensations , experiences , they 're all related to each other , and that just is you .
there are lots of different processes in the brain , all of which operate , in a way , quite independently .
you might think that if it 's true , that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self , no permanent essence , does that mean that really , the self is an illusion ?
for one thing , it 's always changing .
of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance .
I 've heard some fantastic musicians this morning , and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them .

all of us ? designers ?
or I 'd dress up really , really sharply or something .
intent changes the picture completely .
he 's the random state of nature we emerged from .
but we all had to change , but not just react to the given ; we bend to this new experience with intent .
today we don 't confront the chaos of nature .
how shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create , on all the circumstances we create , on all the places we change ?

you can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters .
there 's nobody I 'll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years , so we thought that 's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight .
history as an imaging tool ?
it 'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today .
we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
and now you 're riding along with the ISS where it is right now .
it only looks like nothing 's moving because , well , Saturn here is 700,000 miles away , and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India .
so within the company , there 's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries .
you can 't be a professor without having been a student .
Allison Hunt : my three minutes hasn 't started yet , has it ?
you just have to read the article until you find something you don 't know , and preferably something your dad doesn 't even know .
now in the old days , that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically , maybe getting sidetracked , that was fun .
this is the boy in me getting lucky again .
or you get kids , like these kids , they 're from Spain .
I call them the Net Generation .
I 'm a digital immigrant .

'i think someone 's infiltrated my copies of the cases , ' I said .
I study the future of crime and terrorism , and frankly , I 'm afraid .
there 's also been a big paradigm shift in crime .
you could rob 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
if you 're multiplying the rig , so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you 're using , you can collect a lot more .
in other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
now I get to share one more little bit of science with you .
people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us , I know you 're not paying attention to me , but ...
premature infants have real problems with their microbial community .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
with more base stations , more ground stations , better receivers and better algorithms , GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on , but what part of the street .
they 're wide open , vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack .
you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spoofer .
you may never experience the entire thing yourself .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn 't make sense .
why not ?

so , he made a filtrate , he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter , and he injected it to another chicken , and he got another tumor .
we inject them into the mouse , the ones on the right , and none of them would make tumors .
( laughter ) I let that pass .
but I 'm confident , with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one , I think we can get this and other goals done .
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image .
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel .
what should we do ?

if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
a simple volume , the cube .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
what does this mean ?
have you been to southern Spain lately ? there are roads everywhere .
but there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance .
the first one needs little introduction -- " Girl with a Pearl Earring " by Johannes Vermeer , 17th @-@ century Dutch painter .
the daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting .

I live in Beijing . every day , I just watch the American Embassy 's data to decide whether I should open my window .
" Weibo " is the Chinese translation for " microblog . "
it has its own innovation .
anything not mentioned in Weibo , it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public .
but now we have Weibo , so I call it the Weibo petition .
so the crackdown is very serious .
and so it 's very simple , because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy , this independent kingdom .
Don 't let them hook [ up ] with the Chinese cats .
it changes what we see . it changes what we remember .
so this is the footage that I was showing everybody .

( music ) Tom Hanks : Hello , Houston , this is Odyssey .
( laughter ) And I 'm not going to argue with you . you 're an astronaut , a hero , and I 'm from New Jersey , so -- ( Laughter ) I 'm just going to show you some footage .
so I showed him this , and this is actual footage that he was on . this is Apollo 15 . this was his mission .
I 'll give it to Jim , because he could use the pat on the back .
and so I 'll just show it one more time .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) " And the thing without the wheels , that moves . "
so I was kind of proud of it , and I went to a friend of mine , and said , " You know , this is , you know , kind of the best @-@ reviewed shot I 've ever worked on .
so here we have this piece of music by Beethoven , and my problem with it is , it 's boring .
( music ) Okay , I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the intonation was a little questionable . ( laughter ) Let 's watch just another clip .
there was the florist , and I can understand that , once again , we 're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally , but let 's look at one last piece today I 'm going to share with you .
is it music ? here 's how I want to conclude .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
I 'm going to start really , really simply .
so all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand .
they 're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase .

they 're starting it already , and this is a task @-@ based method , where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves .
if you reach with your finger , where would it be ?
until 2017 claimed that record -- ( Laughter ) and left many people longing for earlier decades , when the world seemed safer , cleaner and more equal .
but 30 years ago , there were 23 wars , 85 autocracies , 37 percent of the world population in extreme poverty and more than 60,000 nuclear weapons .
( applause ) And I have worked hard to back up those words with actions .
and it may seem very obvious , the link , now , but at the time , I couldn 't really work out how could I use my photography to do something useful .
the people there have been forgotten , so I thought it was important to go and document their stories .
it was a realization that maybe it was worthwhile going off and doing these things .
now , I have to say , I had a " Lonely Planet " guide to Ukraine and in it , it gave some advice .

that 's him , there .
I went to those places because I wanted to make some kind of change , and photography happened to be my tool .
but in the US , it 's a thing .
one got us invited to the White House , one 's a recent incarnation .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
and so , the student tries again , and now they got it right , and they 're told that , and they can move on to the next assignment .
what 's even more surprising is that self @-@ grades , where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades .
educational researcher Benjamin Bloom , in 1984 , posed what 's called the 2 sigma problem , which he observed by studying three populations .
the first is the population that studied in a lecture @-@ based classroom .
so , if this is so great , are universities now obsolete ?
so how do we do that ?
we cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them , Cindy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .

but looking at Goldman Sachs ' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report .
it 's just a sign of things to come .
there are only 700 ATMs in the country . opportunity .
I couldn 't offer them any direct help .
it 's estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man @-@ made lake in the world .
but we have to practice .

data is inherently unsexy , but it can jump @-@ start an area 's recovery .
if I were screening Anuk at school , sound @-@ attenuating headphones and noise monitoring would take the place of a sound booth , and I would use a phone adapter instead of a microscope to examine his ears .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn 't know of each other 's existence beforehand .
or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large ?
I 'm afraid I 'm one of those speakers you hope you 're not going to meet at TED .
secondly , a political theorist who 's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
and the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s , which put the individual at the center of politics .
and of course , you have 1989 -- the end of Communism , the end of the Cold War .
it has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics .
the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality .
when the Soviet Union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them .
thank you very much .
now here 's what I 'd like to do .
I have a magnificent wife , and together , we have such crazy ambition .
and it didn 't have much more grandeur than the term " foreman " or " overseer . "
I 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world .
well , here 's an example .
our other partner is East Meets West , an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region .
and one day I looked in -- they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished .
in 1967 , in the middle of the Biafran @-@ Nigerian Civil War , Dr. Njoku @-@ Obi invented the Cholera vaccine .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon ?

for " The Sultan 's Elephant , " Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time @-@ traveling elephant .
so I was really excited , because not only do we make something cool , but we might actually have the opportunity to do something real and make it useful .
one such process I 'd like to highlight are solar cells .
cities like London , Glasgow , Amsterdam are pioneering circular city design , finding ways to turn the waste from one urban process into food for the next .
very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be .
ca : was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
it 's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called UAC foods that 's active throughout Africa and the Middle East , but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores .
( laughter ) And that 's when I knew .
we 've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky 's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years .
we require high @-@ end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing .
and for this task , supercomputer field brute force simply isn 't enough .
the better the process , the less the friction .
we have a precedent for this . good old Henry II here , in the 12th century , invented the jury .
the second phase is in getting decision @-@ making power out .
you have a conventional one @-@ bedroom arrangement when you need it .
I think we need to consider everything , everything from alpha to OMEGA .
to you and me , that 's a heart attack .
some food waste , as I said at the beginning , will inevitably arise , so the question is , what is the best thing to do with it ?
what do we do when we feel powerless ?
they raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
so there are a lot of differences . they take more risks .
here are a couple more .
risk tolerance , which is the gambling , we find that when you are in the high @-@ power pose condition , 86 percent of you will gamble .
but the next question , of course , is , can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
I am an impostor .
I don 't feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
and so I want to say to you , don 't fake it till you make it .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
you know , when people say , " I don 't get art .
but I found a sign for Russian @-@ speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
my favorite ones are " no plants . " why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? I 'm not sure .

we evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous , and abundance meant survival .
we just haven 't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously .
throughout all of history , if you wanted something written , a report or an article , you had to involve a person .
it was written by an algorithm .
so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when I look at what 's going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey .
I 'm with him ; I 'm going to echo his words : " I , for one , welcome our new computer overlords . "
( laughter ) Thanks very much .
hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
his name is Nostradamus , although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery . ( laughter ) And like most of you , I suspect , I don 't really believe that people can see into the future .
now these are stories from basic science .
and when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means , through Freedom of Information Act requests , through harassing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent .
normally it lives on the top of Big Ben , because that 's where you get the best reception , but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation .
but what amazes me is Simon 's incredible geographic imagination .
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw , you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud .
some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
and you can just imagine them .
it wasn 't just your standard installation .
over the past six months , I 've spent my time traveling . I think I 've done 60,000 miles , but without leaving my desk .
and then I struggled , because I was thinking to myself , " What should I talk ? what should I do ? it 's a TED audience .
you don 't believe me , do you ? okay . ( applause ) So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don 't understand .
people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen .
so I 'll put a little line up here which represents learning , and that 's how we used to do it . we could see things , understand them , take the time to put them into practice .

one in six men .
( cello music continues ) ( Taps rhythmically ) You found me , you found me under a pile of broken memories with your steady , your steady , steady love .
but the question is , why is it obvious ?
when we do , however , make a turn into a side street , our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 @-@ degree angle .
maybe you 've had that experience as well .
in the 1930s , Harry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever .
so when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago , I tried to make sense of that .
I 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and Westmoreland Street .
they 're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners .
third , adapting to rising seas .
there are no quick fixes .
okay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
but I got a little bad news for you folks . I got some bad news .
but it wasn 't until we tested it in people that we actually knew .
so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous .
fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States .
right ? when I got these results , I started talking to doctors , and they told me not to tell anyone , and my reaction is , " Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease ? "
and in biology , the numbers are even better .
we 've mentioned the health , but it needs consumers to buy into it .
we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive .
if we look at al Qaeda . Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of .
what I 'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @-@ up calls for us ?
I didn 't have the tools . I lacked the experience .
more precisely , the timber yard of a hardware store .

it may have jeopardized short @-@ term sales , but it builds lasting , long @-@ term loyalty based on shared values .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
if you include Internet telephony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
or think of investment . take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010 .
and then finally , the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen : the export @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
" foreign aid is the most aid to poor people , " is about the most home @-@ biased thing you can find .
so that 's why we 're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
and it 's getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that 's great . we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems .
when I got to the - For the next four , five years , I was held in four different children 's homes .
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know @-@ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .

the kind of part of the mind when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
people live for love .

this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you 've made love to them .
wounds are scary , they are nasty , they are icky , it is why most of us look away when we donate blood .
anger is important ; it is the fire that cauterizes our wounds and lets them scar over and heal .
a front @-@ row seat to their torture chamber ?
in all those years , with that guy chained to my side , I got a lot done .
pretty soon , that little posse started to crowd me out of my own body and my own experience .
so these are my illusion glasses .
wake up .
and that can be seen directly through a microscope , and I 'm going to show you some of this today .
you have bits of a volcano . there 's a little bit of a volcano there . you have tube worms .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
the first thing I 'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly .
so among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception .
and indeed , in this image , you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats .
some ? how about 30 ?
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , I want you to smile . thank you . ( applause )

any of those yes responses are what we called mind @-@ wandering .
wouldn 't that be so cool , and that wouldn 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
they 're just the right tools for the job .
and this is a little @-@ known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
it wasn 't really what people needed .
now , the Sock Puppet , on the other hand , is a totally different animal . the sock puppet isn 't about ambiguity , per se . it 's about identity .
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile .

now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
this isn 't a deception @-@ detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging .
my outbox for email is massive , and I never look at it . I write all the time , but I never look at my record , at my trace .
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms .
and it was such a blow that it woke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , I guess .
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night .
in fact , this is better than a wheel , because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach , you will notice it 's very hard to do .
( sound of running air ) Yes !
you don 't plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework .
I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney .
I had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above , as if it was happening to someone else .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward , we would never be the same .
and she said , " You 're going to get depressed . "
so someone tells us the story about supertaskers , so this two percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment .
people have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near , so stock up .

it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
who would have thought that two young guys and a start @-@ up would beat out Google Video ? why ?
so there you have it : the evolution of a headline .
I have to say , this sounds awesome . ( laughter ) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so I went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .

Pisa has transformed that debate , and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany .
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did Hungary .

( applause ) I want to challenge you today .
okay ? friends , family and financiers .
but we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it , and we have to admit that .

the point I 'm making is that it is a crime .
we 're standing today in the Central Bank , and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I 'm going to be speaking about .
it went right into my heart .
one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
and I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council , which is a not @-@ for @-@ profit .
the Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .

my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom .
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto .
it turns out there 's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal .
so move where you sit . that 's adaptability .
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around .
to me that is a certified agile miracle .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) And by the way , research backs this up too .
so agile is great for stimulating progress , but I kept hearing time and again , you need to preserve the core .
and suddenly we were worried , like , do we have a mean girl on our hands ?
in fact , they need to be able to read discerningly .
and so on . so I suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
the net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
so what 's my wish ?
it will be called the School in the Cloud .
the lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything 's done from the cloud .
that number is hard to visualize .
now , our dependence on them for energy -- that means that every one of those carbons gets converted into a molecule of CO2 .
again , another one , " That 's a monkey . " " that 's a pig , " etc .

now no sooner - this was in the 1950s - and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum @-@ beating people to protect the animals , than the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed .
they did . they agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage .
it made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions .
to prevent that , we have traditionally used fire .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
some people say , " Well , that 's just because those MBA types are greedy . "
but we don 't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity .

so Disney can make a new $ 200 million movie that flops , and nobody calls the attorney general .
moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons .
so how do we ask this question ?
now , in genetics , it 's a little counterintuitive .
but in each fly , we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others , and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity .
you get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes falcons .
that 's what the data is telling us . if the trajectory continues , we get to , wow , the zero zone .
everything around us moves really quick .
which ones of these are your best movies ? "
everyone would rate " Schindler 's List " five stars , and then they 'd rate Adam Sandler , " The Do @-@ Over " three stars .
and you know , if you have the good mix , you get to a healthy diet .
I think you 're right , which is , when people talk about Netflix , they talk about the shows that move them : " 13 Reasons Why " or " The Crown . "
instead , we 've seen great viewing across a whole range -- " Black Mirror " -- we 're filming season five now .
and that was a struggling show when it was only in the BBC .
and if we 're as great as we can be , and we have a variety of moods , then more often , people will choose us .
and you know , all new technologies -- when television was first popular in the 1960s in the US , it was called a " vast wasteland , " and that television was going to rot the minds of everybody .

em : no , we don 't patent.CA : you didn 't patent because you think it 's more dangerous to patent than not to patent .
and you have to do that .
I was in the third year of my seven @-@ year undergraduate degree .
and that is exactly what we found .
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation .
there 's a lot more arrows .
okay , so the next part of this study I 'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa .
and these are two different groups of humans from Japan and Africa . they replicate quite nicely .
the chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill , and as he reported back to me , the response was , " Hell no !
do you have that love ?
the only thing I had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stuffed for the collection .
so this is the motor .
I can 't say I enjoy the process .
what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
but then we told them , " Look , this origami really belongs to us .

ladies and gentlemen , the choice is yours .
if I come over here -- ( Laughs ) He 's smart .
thanks , little guy .
I 've always wanted a picture of a 1,500 @-@ person TED audience .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see Romo doing on the left .
it 's our trailer , because I know , obviously you guys are busy , many of you may not have had a chance to see it .
if we could roll ?

so there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite , and so on .
or at least , they shouldn 't if they 're interested in reproducing . that -- ( Laughter ) is not the way any human being speaks casually .
we see this general bagginess of the structure , the lack of concern with rules and the way that we 're used to learning on the blackboard , and so we think that something has gone wrong .
another example is " slash . "
Sally : " for this summer program at NYU . "
all spoken languages have what a linguist calls a new information marker -- or two , or three .
take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20 @-@ year @-@ old today .
the great graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo , the Westinghouse logo .
when you get older , and you 're all freaked out , whatever , the mentors calm us down .

why ?
a lot of times at a crime scene when people see a skeletonized body , they think , " Wow , this has been here for a really long time undiscovered . "
whether it 's nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
and I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world .
so it 's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here .
that 's between , say at an average use , that 's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that .
( laughter ) He didn 't mean it complimentarily , but Joe put it up in the lobby , he was so proud of it .
we know why .
is this job tough ? you betcha .
there I learned different things .
he said first , his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure , about what worked and what didn 't work .
how many places in America are going to change ? none .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
you just had to do things sometimes .
I was like , " You need to go to a hospital , the school nurse , something . "
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
and as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District , you better believe there was some opposition .
three together , that 's sparkles .
so we have gone through almost 30 characters .
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
and it 's working beautifully .
what it doesn 't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it , who don 't enjoy it , who don 't get any real benefit from it .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
but if nobody 's learning anything , she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it .
that 's it .
there 's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin .
the system we have today isn 't fair to them .
well , unfortunately there 's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems .
the U.S. isn 't number one .
for example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
we also had students fill out surveys with questions like , " Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? "
this building was wired for change .
Hubert was saying , absolutely correctly , " These are the new cathedrals . "
last but not least , Emma believed that you can 't pick your family , but you can pick your friends .

we 've learned an amazing amount .
she was rushed to hospital , but it was too late . she died .
as I thought , that 's most of you .
take , for example , providing a guide dog for a blind person .
that 's a good thing to do , right ?
you never get off , and you never really feel satisfied .
so we can begin to see the seed of a completely open @-@ source , citizen @-@ led urban development model , potentially .
probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds , the open @-@ source pioneer , which was that idea of , " Be lazy like a fox . "
in order to do that in 20 minutes , I have to bring out four ideas -- it 's like four pieces of a puzzle .
so the same Guardian rebuts , " Are video games art : the debate that shouldn 't be .
so it was not very constructive . ( laughter ) So , I 'm making fun of it , but we discussed this for so many days . you have no idea .
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
so the question is , how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using , and start wasting less of it ?
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future , it isn 't on this slide .
so I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
but my tiger mother said , " No . "

as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness . "
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , I wanted to protect my child from illness .
the scoop was quite a very simple story .
another key story that comes to mind , which relates to this spirit child phenomenon , is " The Spell of the Albinos . "
so I 'm surprised .
how did you end up in jail ? this was just a few weeks ago , I believe , yeah ?
now I 'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild .
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin .
they 're outside the dolphin 's normal repertoire , but they 're easily mimicked by the dolphins .
they 're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at , and they 're actually getting so severe that they 're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement .
we 're facing very tough challenges .
but fortunately , Henry Kramer , who put up the prize for -- that was a one @-@ mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the English Channel , 21 miles .
with on @-@ board GPS , it can navigate autonomously , and it is rugged enough to self @-@ land without damage .

now she 's got the robot doing it .
democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power , whether it was of tyrants or of high priests , their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth .
democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating , debating , taking on public responsibilities for public affairs .

now , more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels .
now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government , autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both .
it was a few weeks later , we started receiving all these " Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive . "
ninety percent said yes , she 's a traitor .
thank you , everyone .
so , as a reflection of this , we started the Financial Crisis Observatory .
the root mechanism of a dragon @-@ king is a slow maturation towards instability , which is the bubble , and the climax of the bubble is often the crash .
perhaps more surprisingly , the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine , parturition , the act of giving birth , epileptic seizures .
we have applied this theory to many systems , landslides , glacier collapse , even to the dynamics of prediction of success : blockbusters , YouTube videos , movies , and so on .
we created the Financial Bubble Experiment .
this is a big deal , so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
( applause ) In 2010 , for example , there were 831 , all over Australia , and the Torres Strait Islands , all states , working to improve the houses where they and their families live , and that 's an important thing .

they could trap the flies , send them to him in Perth .
kanji Maya , she 's a mother , and a proud one .
and then I 'll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an incurable optimist .
let 's review them both . first of all , the megatrends .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
and we 've seen a new disease , not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases .
and we had to start all over again .
a disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India , and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in India , ended .
thank you .
Greg Gage : the octopus is a rather strange @-@ looking animal that exhibits amazingly complex behaviors .
we 've learned a lot about ourselves from studying marine animals .
and that 's not enough .
because the ocean gives us more than half of the oxygen we breathe , food , it absorbs much of the carbon pollution that we throw in the atmosphere .
and fishing near the surface targets mostly species that migrate between the high seas and country 's waters , like tuna and sharks .
despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , I 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome .
you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
what if obesity isn 't the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
when we become insulin @-@ resistant , the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state .
" it sort of makes you stop and think , doesn 't it . "
and normally , when water freezes , as you know , it expands , and the same thing happens in a cell .
we took the eggs of a related species , a living frog , and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg .
that was a miracle , but it was workable .
we haven 't announced this publicly before .
have a look at this bit of film footage .
it has to be a different species . what could it be ?
and I 'm positive it wouldn 't .
they interview their superiors , their peers , their subordinates . they vet their personal conduct .
and what we 're looking at here is a truckful of data .
but the problem is , 20 or 30 programs , like , training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology , that is a tiny drop in the bucket .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
now let 's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier .
if you recall the graphs I showed you earlier , 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil , and the plants are unable to access it .
in other words , as I already said , I have invented nothing .
I 've been up to its front gates .
and there 's Dan Etete .
my first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory .
in 2011 , natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa , Asia and Latin America . nineteen to one .
now let 's go back to the oil and mining companies , and let 's go back to Dan Etete and that $ 1 billion deal .
we 've discovered that our universe is vastly grander than our ancestors imagined and that life seems to be an almost imperceptibly small perturbation on an otherwise dead universe .
now , AI can generate fake faces and simulate your face saying stuff that you never said .
so all this amazing recent progress in AI really begs the question : how far will it go ?
what was remarkable is , they explored this keyboard on their own . there was no intervention on our part .
so if we could switch to the audio from this computer , we 've been video conferencing with cognitive animals , and we 're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them .
they 're not really used to having cameras here at 8 o 'clock at night .
the production version , it uses IP version 6 .
whether or not we understand it is a different story .
( laughter ) And if " Where do you come from ? "
and when I got out of my car , the air was pulsing .
there are lots of music venues on our map .
next , and this is a very big one , we need leadership , and we need a strategy .
they 're volunteer councils , and they work directly with a designated advocate inside of city hall or even the chamber of commerce .
changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .
and that 's no mere hypothetical example .
after all , for all its grim , satanic mills , it worked out pretty well , didn 't it ?
( Beatboxing ) Party , party , yeah .
and this is unacceptable .
and today I 'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that 's what 's crucial , how and why they set meaningful and audacious goals , the right goals for the right reasons .
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher , and he said to me , " John , it almost doesn 't matter what you know .
well , it 's a personal why .
why consciousness ?
okay , the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us , and that is , all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them .
the disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot , so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing .
and if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like U.K. , Germany , and so on , they 're actually much lower .
but he did have one thing .

let 's pick a bit of data from another three @-@ month @-@ old patient .
the Arabic language doesn 't satisfy today 's needs .
if we did so , they 'd strip us of our clothes .
let 's call this the rhetorical model , where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand .
there 's no magic wand that 's going to make it disappear .
I don 't have an answer .
one thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
now , for a period of three years , I gathered data , not just me but also some of my friends , and I used to teach in university , so I forced my -- I mean , I asked my students to do this as well .
these people I still do hang out with .
they 've been looking outward for a long time , yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp , right within them .
DP : g minor .
most pianists would have a heart attack if you said , " Sorry , do you mind playing ' Flight of the Bumblebee ' in B minor instead of A minor ? " as we went on .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
that was the problem .
in 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
and in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .

here 's a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net .
RB : I don 't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works .
RB : yes , I mean , we 've got -- we 're setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word .
we throw it away .
so I 'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea .

so what plants have -- while we have consciousness , tool making , language , they have biochemistry .
the Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens .

how far away was the finish line ?
it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues , it has now expanded .
this is their perception of why you shouldn 't mess with uncontacted Indians .

they bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo , that little spiral structure you see there .
they continue without their tablecloth , looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch .
and if you want the information , so that we complete this cycle of understanding , all you have to do is read these paragraphs .
today , I want to show you a new kind of map .
seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white .
so in fact , what the scientists are telling us is , no way .
please , please , just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong .
and I saw this person across the street , and I was thinking , " Oh great , black guy . "
that 's much better than everybody just thinking that you 're the cute girl next door .
( laughter ) than everybody that you 've seen before .
( laughter ) OK , so this method doesn 't give you a 100 percent success rate , but there 's no other possible strategy that can do any better .
now , I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce , apart from , I don 't know , Piers Morgan 's wife , maybe ?
now of course , it takes a bit more than just a low negativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship .
so in the following week , I was back in the streets , but that time , I wasn 't a member of any media outlet anymore .
they were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city .
we are not using big cameras .
but that was also useful , because we were still at the web , so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country .
with our deep learning algorithm , it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images .
my art contributes to fundamental change by encouraging an audience to address big questions from that perspective .

the second target was the Lernaean Hydra , a giant serpent with many heads .
deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end of the ' 90s and the beginning of the 2000s .

what emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America .
for many , it is their first time interacting with Islam on such an intimate level .

we need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion , and we need the sensors , power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi @-@ intelligent ant robot .
and it survives , bounces on the table , it 's incredibly robust , and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it 's very tiny .
we all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run .
and you 'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off , and the robot tumbling through the air .
they made some astounding discoveries .
but I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding .
so there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
I was a young humanitarian aid worker , and I met this woman who was my age .

this is a very dangerous , debilitating , and deadly disease .
in fact , the average man can throw a ball further than about 98 percent of all women .
but let 's have a look at the size of this difference .
now , it isn 't true per se that left @-@ handed people are more creative than right @-@ handed people .
and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes .
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
and so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the THEREMIN the way it is now .
so we have to do something about the scatter so we can see the tumor .
it 's amazing .
but we treat this skull with great respect at our lab and here at TED .
Red light is all around us .
a system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost , higher resolution and smaller medical imaging .
so .
our system may be extraordinary at finding blood .
here 's a beaker of blood .
so with our system , you can imagine detecting cancers early , when intervention is easy , or tracking the size of your tumor as it grows or shrinks .
compact , portable , inexpensive medical imaging can save countless lives .
her name is AIVA , and she 's an artificial intelligence that has learned the art of music composition by reading over 30,000 scores of history 's greatest .
now we know that there 's a lot of animals out there that can do it too .
the problem with infectious diseases , as we all know , is that pathogens continue to evolve , and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy .
as part of my job , I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants , and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters .
so then we moved on to adult butterflies , and we started asking the question whether it 's the mothers that can medicate their offspring .
so we started this about 30 years ago , and we started dealing with this very issue .
so , come have your interviews .
so there 's a place for music and literature , etc . , but also for grammar .
and follow this all the time and we know how they 're doing and we say , you 're not interested in this now , let 's wait a year .

when I was four years old , my grandfather and I were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost .
it was one of the scariest moments I 've ever experienced in my life , and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grandfather had Alzheimer 's disease .
therefore , I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance .
I 've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now , and it 's had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wandering .
and so , you know , it 's one of those things that you don 't take too seriously .

what I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement .
as an Arab female photographer , I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences .

here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents .
this is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years .
we can standardize our addresses , and if we do , we can get more maps like this .
it 's not a disease or an abnormality , and it isn 't necessarily tied to depression , anxiety , or self @-@ esteem .
it 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
and that , in fact , turns out to be true .
my name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya .

and they were going up , and they finally made it to the peak .
and so there was a big movement to put all this information online , to track all the ownership of these plots of land , put them in the cloud , and give them to the communities .
there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere .
it looks super high tech .
it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut .
then , you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself .
I have a playing card in my hand .
not only that , but I will impose myself a time limit of one second , something that would look like this .

we 've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you 'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens .
what he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do .
and for this service , they were murdered , their families torn apart , and their story largely forgotten .
sometimes that 's the only difference you make -- one individual , one family , a small group of individuals -- and it matters .
every life matters , or every life should matter .
we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself .
I know I 'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for .
now , across the animal kingdom , different animals pick up on different parts of reality .
and this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a cochlear implant , which opens up this technology globally , even for the poorest countries .
so we 'll report on that later to see how well this goes .
or digital dentistry , and making these kinds of structures even while you 're in the dentist chair .

every day , people come up to me and say , " I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother , but I waited too long . "
I hope you 'll help us make this wish come true .
" what is England and why am I going there ? "
my interests were scientific , the market was commercial -- things such as payroll , which I found rather boring .
( laughter ) I 've been called Kevin all my life .
this guy is an American . his name 's Graham Allison .

this is what our head tells us we need to do , but what about our heart ?
the important thing -- ( Applause ) The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology .
it was extraordinary to see , for example , old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents , like this lady here .
Kevin Rudd : well , what we Australians do best is organize the drinks , so you get them together in one room , and we suggest this and suggest that , then we go and get the drinks .
you could say that I look for choice alien real estate .
orbiters like the Maven mission sample the Martian atmosphere , trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability .
private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars .
and that 's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
and it can change people 's perception of each other .
and ultimately , we become more human .
the next group , 14 percent of the wealth , 21 , 22 and 32 .
but the fact is , it 's because I didn 't draw them on the same scale .
we asked , what about things like health ?
what about life expectancy of infants ?
we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency -- basically , young kids and babies , because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation .
we have two gaps : we have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap And the knowledge gap is something that we think about , how do we educate people ?
how do we get people to think differently about what we really want ?
BF : you know , sometimes when people do those , they go all the way down .
DH : a type of juggling I actually invented , right after I saw another juggler do it .
( audience : once on purpose ! ) DH : how about if I try first and then decide ?
BF : yeah . and so we 've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this .
he actually assumes more of the danger in this .
DH : Jesus Christ . Richard , please stand in front of me .
BF : I think we were just outside .

beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from .
it has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution , but also its habitability potential .
all together , they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway , and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end .
in our evolution , we have developed two different ways of vocalizing .
we just played people real and posed laughs .
so you 've got the two of them in there , and he 'll say to the husband , " Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you . "
and now they 're all off .
at the same time , the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed .
we 'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context .

the WorldWide Telescope takes the best images from the world 's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space , and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe .
and the tours are all totally interactive , so that if I were to go somewhere ...
like , why did I really have to mow the lawn ?
why couldn 't I put jelly beans in my oatmeal ?
and it 's not that they didn 't want me to think critically .
now , genetic modification is not new ; virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner .
how do we know that there isn 't a big risk of some unintended consequence ?
so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we 've achieved , and everything we care about , depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind .
so at one end we have the village idiot , and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten , or Albert Einstein , or whoever your favorite guru is .
another example , suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem .
sooner or later , it will out .
making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that .
let 's take a look at it as well .
most of us think of motion as a very visual thing .
but all in all , it 's a pretty good path .

this is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years .
so , please don 't email me one of your crazy theories .
it 's about tens of meters in diameter .
now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
here is Earth as a pale blue dot .
but there 's more .
Fred Jansen : you mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet .
and something needed to be done about that .
and I was doing funerals , but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who 'd lived a long life and there 's a lot to say .
RAP music ?

it 's 13 hours ' flight from Moscow .
they said , " You CANNOT photograph us . you have to wait .
I 'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks .
it doesn 't get better than that .
all right , it 's nice that babies will generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls , and it 's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us , but we 've known those things about babies for a very long time .
this time , we 're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls , and guess what ?
you [ probably won 't ] randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls .
( video ) HG : two , three . go ! ( music ) LS : one , two , three , go !
human minds generate research and discovery , and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater , and human minds take care of other humans : our old , our young , our sick .
in the years to come , we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even envision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .
it has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you .
now we 're trying to ask , " Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
we 're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
but it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
( laughter ) They laughed more than you guys are . ( laughter ) And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there 's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .

here are the cues of motion , the kinds of cues that you get on your retina when things are moving .
think back to the most difficult job you ever did .
it all depends on the context of what you 're looking at .
Albert Einstein used non @-@ Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space @-@ time becomes warped in the presence of matter , as part of his general theory of relativity .
instead , the universe consisted of a swirling sea of subatomic matter .
further back still , and the energy was too great even for the quarks to stick together .

the next morning , I just took all the pieces , assembled them together in my hotel room , and this is actually the skirt that I 'm wearing right now .
I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials , and then bring them home to experiment on .
so you guys , you want to see what it looks like ?
it was built by Livia , the wife of the first emperor Augustus , on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio .
unfortunately though , the sandwich came in at 30 cents .

before it started to collapse , this cloud had a very gentle spin .
I didn 't have the money to go out and buy a plane , so I decided to build a computer instead .
it 's pretty disgusting .
the first thing I thought was , " This is no good . "
thanks .
and then , Newton proposed the theory of universal gravitation , demonstrating that all objects are pulling on each other .
what would happen if you set a table like this ?
it doesn 't look good , and you have to clean up the mess before you can even start .
this is more about looks than etiquette , but it 's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you 're eating at a picnic table .
next we 'll anchor our setting with the plate .
so , our hero swoops in at super speed , grabs her , and carries her to safety .

the computer programmers who wrote the code ?
the hardware engineer who created the computers , knowing that they were intended to enable an attack ?
1915 must have been an exciting year to be a physicist .
the question is , ultimately , why does all this interesting stuff exist ?
we can 't see it or touch it , but if it wasn 't there , we would not exist .
relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings , a bit like a light switch .
if so , then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature .
but I mean , seriously , it 's great news .
let 's walk through three of today 's more prevalent theories , using the same restaurant setting for each .
are you paying attention ?
for example , just now you focused on the fork and didn 't observe the tablecloth or the falling waiter .
is your brain just acting slow ?
this must be some kind of optical illusion .

( laughter ) So what have we learned ?
let 's take a look at a few of the most prevalent ones , beginning with two physiological hypotheses before moving to a psychological one .
our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning is triggered by a specific stimulus , an initial yawn .
this study was set up to show that dogs would enact a yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn .
we were calling collectively for actions , and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know .
the euphoria faded , we failed to build consensus , and the political struggle led to intense polarization .
and fourth , it became really hard to change our opinions .
fifth -- and in my point of view , this is the most critical -- today , our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements , posts over discussions , shallow comments over deep conversations .
without them , plants would lose a pollinator .

so in other words , he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here .
( audience : " alpha House . " ) Yes , " Alpha House , " but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it didn 't turn out that great .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) " House of Cards " gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be .
you have 200 years of statistics to rely on .
look at the jumper 's center of mass as his body bends backward .
and , finally , there is the lipid layer , an oily outer film that keeps the surface smooth for Iris to see through , and prevents the other layers from evaporating .
so there 's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses .
pesticides used both on commercial beehives and agricultural crops to ward off parasites could be getting into the food and water that honeybees consume .

tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads .
but have you ever wondered how tattooing really works ?
and it is this very process that makes tattoos permanent .
dermal cells , however , remain in place until they die .
but with time , tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts to the alien pigment particles , slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system 's macrophages .
technically , yes .
so a single tattoo may not truly last forever , but tattoos have been around longer than any existing culture .
you 've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth , but how does it work ?
this is where we enter the quantum realm .
every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons .
one that doesn 't appear to be emitting light at all : Earth .
the hotter an object gets , the higher frequency the light it emits .
95 % of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes .
so with that , I will leave you .
in his " Meditations on First Philosophy , " René Descartes tried to answer that very question , demolishing all his preconceived notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations .

H.M. ' s seizures virtually disappeared , with no change in personality , and his IQ even improved .
so , why does music rely so heavily on repetition ?
to investigate , psychologists asked people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition .
in this way , repetition can open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing .
it says that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism to sports commentary .
the real origin is much deeper and more amazing .
wavelength is essential for quantum physics because an object 's wavelength is related to its momentum , mass times velocity .
both position and momentum are now uncertain , and the uncertainties are connected .
if you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet , you need to add more waves , which means a bigger momentum uncertainty .
and preferably among them , some drought @-@ tolerant crops .
now , making drought @-@ tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world .

but she only sees one , so she deduces that her hat is also black .
this is confidence .
one : what you 're born with , such as your genes , which will impact things like the balance of neurochemicals in your brain .
in medieval times , alchemists tried to achieve the seemingly impossible .
but to understand how this precious metal became embedded in our planet to start with , we have to gaze upwards at the stars .
however , at that point nuclear fusion no longer releases enough energy , and the pressure from the core peters out .

but if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues , it degrades within seconds .
first , let 's start with the nanoparticle core .
the two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction , and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream .
this is truly remarkable .
there are all these written and unwritten rules of the road , and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you , usually without consequence .

now , in her 41 years on TV , perhaps Erica 's most famous scene is her alone in the woods suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear .
it 's called rejectiontherapy.com.
and she was so happy to see me .
they let their own reaction after rejection define themselves .
but also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth , and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact .
I 'm going to make it right now in case I forget .
I have a characterization .
this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water .

yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement , she found seven hours .
if you think about it , that 's really more accurate language .
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others .

but those tellers were doing somewhat different work .
if you think about it , isn 't it kind of self @-@ evident that once we get sufficiently productive at something , we 've basically worked our way out of a job ?
as automation frees our time , increases the scope of what is possible , we invent new products , new ideas , new services that command our attention , occupy our time and spur consumption .
does that mean there 's nothing to worry about ?
Norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility .
the challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs , and many citizens CANNOT qualify for the good jobs that are being created .
but it is feasible .
too often , harassment and discrimination is a lonely and isolating experience , but we need to help people out from under their desks .
how can we speak up in a society that too often discredits or diminishes our experiences ?
assume that you 're going to forget .
assume you have to write it down .
you don 't have to talk to a person , there 's no fear of judgment , and you can do it whenever and wherever you need .
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
and we just don 't have the tools that are small enough to work with them .
now that last one , that 's a really important one .
and this pace exists because of our ability to pack more and more devices onto a computer chip .

we 're not doing a very good job on our own , we could certainly use all the help we can get .

I think we 're going to see a world where we 're moving from things that are fabricated to things that are farmed .
emails that started with words like " terrorist , " " Raghead , " " rat , " " whore . "
and then he said , " I have to ask my wife . "
when I got home , I was very ambivalent about my experience .
I know what I 'm talking about .
if you want to prevent hate and violence , we have to talk to as many people as possible for as long as possible while being as open as possible .
we hang out only with people who think like us and talk about the others in a category of disdain .
we unfriend people on Facebook , and when we meet people who are discriminating or dehumanizing people or groups , we don 't insist on speaking with them to challenge their opinions .

it wasn 't until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong .
and separated biking and walking paths , so speeding bikers won 't hit young people as they stroll by the creek .
literally .
they want nature right in their backyards , not four blocks away .
for better or worse , this is logical , because five @-@ year @-@ olds today are rarely allowed to walk four blocks to access a park by themselves .
so if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaper food venues , we meet the needs of many other populations , too .
over the course of this week , we literally spoke our life stories to each other , from start to finish .
I feel that way . I try my best .
then we concentrate on what we have already mastered and we try to minimize mistakes .
I mean that every minute of every day , many students in elementary schools through colleges feel that if they make a mistake , others will think less of them .
we 're going to do some open @-@ heart surgery . I was the only Brit , on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons , cardiac nurse , intensive care nurse .
yes , that 's the medical advice the committee chairman says , " Yes , I told you , you weren 't going to be able to , you can 't do this , I just know it . "

Jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated , but instead of being compassionate , her classmates harassed her .

I became a doula , a lay person trained to provide support to people during pregnancy and childbirth .
in certain parts of the country , particularly the Deep South , the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in Sub @-@ Saharan African .

their approach is casual and friendly .
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis are actually the center of her care model , and that her role as a provider is just to support their work .
this is a big departure from the traditional medical model , because it places responsibility and information back in the woman 's hands .
a similar demographic of women in Jennie 's area who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did were three times more likely to give birth to a baby below a healthy weight .
thank you .
but there was a crack in the wall , a problem with our industry , that I felt we needed to fix .
there were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008 that went to the war in Afghanistan .
they talked about building institutions to protect human security , for their generation and also for ours .
now , HAL was a fictional character , but nonetheless he speaks to our fears , our fears of being subjugated by some unfeeling , artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity .

and to make matters worse , when we read the terms and conditions , we discovered the following , and I 'm going to need to take out my reading glasses for this one .
so I had to do something .

because this agent then told me , and I quote , " Don 't tell anybody , but I have it on really good authority this is going to be the number one script on next year 's Black List . "

what on Earth is happening ?
ca : so some , I guess many liberals out there view Trump and his government as kind of irredeemably bad , just awful in every way .
ca : and those elites might not even be human elites .
one of the things I know as a historian is that you should never underestimate human stupidity .
people often confuse intelligence and consciousness , especially in places like Silicon Valley , which is understandable , because in humans , they go together .
if it can 't suffer , it 's not real .
a nation CANNOT suffer .
my basic reaction as a historian is : if this is the era of post @-@ truth , when the hell was the era of truth ?

I grew up in a culture of self @-@ effacement .
so currently in my lab , I 'm researching questions like , what makes a human smell like a human ?
they said , " OK , you know what ?
sounds a little sketchy to me , but I 'm listening , " you at least know you 're being engaged and respected .
we can resist .
each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up .
the last lap took almost 30 .
most of what they said to her when she was outside began with , " Be careful , " " Watch out , " or " No . "
I 'm just pro @-@ bravery .
so notice next time you say , " Watch out , you 're going to get hurt , " or , " Don 't do that , it 's dangerous . "

so who codes matters .
who codes matters , how we code matters and why we code matters .
my mother left school when she was 15 .
so I traveled there last year , and part of the joy I had in going there was going to these caves .
the Laas Geel caves .
these paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old .
that 's what art is for .
and I thought , well , who painted this joyful , youthful figure ?
men made these marks . women don 't . "
young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own orgasm .
now I know that 's not enough .

that 's another groundswell kind of emotion that was going on in the middle of America and not being heard , in thinking that the mainstream media was biased .
( laughter ) No , I reject the category .
GC : I would just start by saying that I really think any change and coming together starts from the top , just like any other organization .
I decided to call my project " Thanks a Thousand . "
psychologists talk about how gratitude is about taking a moment and holding on to it as long as possible .
it reminded me that what I take for granted is not available to millions of people around the world .
being aware of the thousands of people involved in every little thing we do .
what makes this claim different is it doesn 't come from a private company , it comes from the government .
among supporters of President Trump it 's even higher ; it 's about 7 out of 10 .
on the one hand , there are those who say these statistics are crucial , that we need them to make sense of society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes and measure progress in an [ objective ] way .
this is a total disaster .
if we don 't have this data , how can we observe discrimination , let alone fix it ?
facts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells that are smaller than the size of an average parking space .
that doesn 't mean every single swimming pool in the country contains exactly 6.23 turds .
they 're civil servants .
my mom was freaking out , my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a Snapchat video .

evil is the exercise of power .
it 's the few bad apples , the few rogue soldiers . "
and it all happened in a single place , Tier 1 @-@ A , on the night shift .
that 's one of the visual illustrations of evil .
this is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
and so we 're interested in what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel ?
two thirds go all the way to 450 volts .
and secondly , we know there 's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners .
so how can this work ?
and now one can think about how important that process can be for our lives .
it evolved during evolution .

before the first iPhone even hit the shelf , the Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and the inter @-@ communication and instant communication it provided us .
take this for another example .
and above all , you must have the courage to unflinchingly pursue the truth .
I ask myself that frequently .
ca : how much ?
well , they 're right .
so yeah , it 's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally .
em : actually , if you just do two things , you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement , and I think you can go beyond that .
obviously , I do rockets , so I like things that fly .
is there a tie @-@ in here with Hyperloop ?
ca : you 've called it a hobby .
ca : you started Tesla with the goal of persuading the world that electrification was the future of cars , and a few years ago , people were laughing at you .
em : OK .
if you don 't solve vision , it 's not solved .
so that 's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision neural net that 's very effective for road conditions .
like , you can probably do it ten times better than humans would , just cameras .
ca : as one does . em : yeah .
like , why do you want to live ?
it 's like a branching stream of probabilities , and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing .
but I am not lazy . ' then the sloth yawned and said , ' That 's just how I am .
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape .
over the past 30 years , areas of the Arctic have seen decreases in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks to four months .
those of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living use instruments called hydrophones , which are underwater microphones , and we record ambient noise -- the noise all around us .
for those of you with headphones on -- I see that some of you are listening to the translation -- please take them off for a minute .
( Spanish ) A choreography of sound .
I wrote the first one having only recently learned how , and it has some errors in terms of meter , so it 's not presentable in its current state .
I had just returned from doing a concert in Israel , and I was very emotional over a problem that hits really close to home , which is the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict .
not long ago , we were in Mexico after a concert .
in reality , the Décima is its origin , but at the same time , just like in the milonga and in the Décima , are the roots of many more cultures from all over the place , like he said .
he wrote a memoir about facing mortality .
Paul didn 't want a ventilator and CPR .
and I learned that when we approach it together , we get to decide what success looks like .
either way , we never have those answers .
but doctors can 't make sure your wishes are respected until they know what they are .
but there 's some people I would like to see killed , but I 'm against the death penalty .
and there 's another complication , which is , in addition to us being this miserably violent species , we 're also this extraordinarily altruistic , compassionate one .
for example , ecosystems change .
what we have here is the opposite of it .
and we need to rethink how we produce our food to make it more regenerative .
the top solutions would take us far along the pathway , but there 's no such thing as a small solution .
and this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern , who wrote the " Theory of Games . "
this includes a large amount of human error .
so , he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running , let alone having , you know , software problems .
that was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the Institute .
and he published it . it wasn 't locked up and disappeared .
you have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype .
it just was another version of the same thing happening .
I will do anything to defend myself against interference with this objective that I have been given . "
so ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain -- and right onto our dinner plates .
you 're barely passing .
( laughter ) Who am I to contradict my baby girl ?
it may even be better .
if it stays in Paris , as many are pushing for in the administration , well then that begs a question : what 's the plan ?
our Secretary of State will be asking other countries for NATO contributions , and they 'll be saying , " No , give us our Paris commitment .
the poor borrow more , save less , smoke more , exercise less , drink more and eat less healthfully .
well , the standard explanation was once summed up by the British Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher .
so the long @-@ term perspective goes out the window .
a recent analysis of 201 studies on the effectiveness of money @-@ management training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all .
but it 's not enough .
we could help the poor with their paperwork or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills .
( applause ) Because , I mean , the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self @-@ appointed experts think they need .
but let 's talk about the elephant in the room .
this means that your income is topped up as soon as you fall below the poverty line .
if they stopped working , we 'd be in trouble .
( laughter ) Machines were weak , and my hair was strong .
and this competitive rhetoric is standard now .
nobody remembers that I won the first match -- ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) In Philadelphia , before losing the rematch the following year in New York .
I immediately sensed something new , something unsettling .
machines have calculations .
we have purpose .
our humanity is not defined by any skill , like swinging a hammer or even playing chess .
would we talk to the women we hope to inspire , a million in the next year , or would we talk to you ?
my school shut down , and when the rebel armies captured the only international airport , people started panicking and fleeing .
and every time business would get bad , he 'd remind me of that mantra : no condition is permanent .
so A.B. took Prince and his mother to the river , got in a canoe and paddled for four hours to get to the hospital .
community members across Liberia learned the symptoms of Ebola , teamed up with nurses and doctors to go door @-@ to @-@ door to find the sick and get them into care .
or when you drink a little too much at a party , just out of anxiety .
and as you get all the way up close , you realize that it 's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups .
and the day after that , another 1,100 Americans died from smoking .
( music ) Sophie Hawley @-@ Weld : OK , you don 't have to stand up , but ...
and this last US presidential election was the mother of all disruptions .
now , art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly @-@ burly of politics in my daily work at the ACLU , but not anymore .
now , these are big images and big ideas , but I really love the small stuff .
that 's what we do .
( applause ) CA : Anthony , you spoke to so many of us so powerfully .
you think of an idea .
how many parts of your lives are 99 percent reliable ?
it was like my playspace was 400 lines long and 25 columns wide -- which I presume that if anybody is going to understand that , it 's this crowd .
and there 's no known cure .
it was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil who first noticed , just a year ago , after a Zika outbreak , that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly .
the protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that kill people as well as bugs .
these are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua .
that 's because insecticides aren 't very effective .
so the bottom line is this : biological control of harmful insects can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using insecticides , which are toxic chemicals .
my parents are from Trinidad and Tobago , the southernmost island in the Caribbean .
come love come , the road lies free , I 'll wait for you in Tennessee .
look -- of course it 's difficult to be certain about anything ; we might all be living in " The Matrix . "
others invent new products like the molded panels that Snøhetta used to give the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that crinkly , sculptural quality .
in this case , not surprisingly , we saw that these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming from the back of their head , which is responsible for the processing of your visual information .
I bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers .
that took me to his letters , which took me to the exercise , " premeditatio malorum , " which means the pre @-@ meditation of evils .

the brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year .
( laughter ) Fastest @-@ growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
whereas nature tends to be small , and curved , and it bends and twists , and has legs instead , and appendages , and has many muscles and many , many sensors .
( laughter ) Same principle : it only has six moving parts , six motors , but it has springy , tuned legs . it moves in the gait of the insect .
here 's the animal that we have here , running on a vertical surface .
we realized that we would have to do work on this condition ourselves to find solutions for ourselves and others like us .
and I was surprised , but they said I could give a talk , and I said I 'd love to .
I know because I used to be in one of those control rooms .
because what we don 't talk about is how the handful of people working at a handful of technology companies through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today .
when we talk about technology , we tend to talk about it as this blue sky opportunity .
so the internet is not evolving at random .
because outrage doesn 't just schedule a reaction in emotional time , space , for you .
it doesn 't have to be this way .
they are actually -- they really want it .
but this is also , if I take a big step back from this , this is also a very personal journey for me .
she was sent to start a new life in a new country on her own at the age of 12 .
these are not people moving to another country to get a better life .
she 's working for the International Rescue Committee to help other refugees , but she has no certainty at all about her future , where it is or what it holds .
the future " you " is about your duties to strangers .
that means they cross a border into a neighboring state .
it 's called Dadaab .
we can 't say we don 't know what 's happening in Juba , South Sudan , or Aleppo , Syria .
and there 's one other thing it reveals about us : whether we have any humility for our own mistakes .
to share this information with you , I wore one of the early consumer @-@ based EEG devices like this one , which recorded the electrical activity in my brain in real time .
a US @-@ based company has developed a technology to embed these sensors into the headrest of automobilies so they can track driver concentration , distraction and cognitive load while driving .
instead , we should be focusing on securing rights and remedies against the misuse of our information .
they actually met in New York City and got married in New York City .
for people who have the great privilege of studying medicine and anthropology -- I had come from parents who were refugees .
we were reading everything and we had to come to a conclusion of how are we going to structure our work ?
a few months of medicines , and this is what he looked like .
and we argued with the World Bank .
that 's what we need , and we need that from all of you .
but this work is not about predictions .
how on earth did Arnold manage to do that ?
people usually contract bacterial meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and saliva that spray into the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs .
so fast treatment , or better yet , prevention , is critical .
I began designing a system based on the principles of livestock mortality composting that would take human beings and transform them into soil .
we want to bring back the aspect of ritual that 's been diluted over the past hundred years as cremation rates have risen and religious affiliation has declined .
but I always thought it would get better , that no one could force me to leave , no one could take my home away from me .
" why do they hate us ? "
I use the accessibility services in the airport because most of the terminal is just not designed with me in mind .
design inhibits my autonomy and my independence .
I 'm not showing you that one .
Charlie : that 's his reindeer , isn 't it ?
what do we worship ?
I 'm going to draw a little more blood .
it goes back and forth , back and forth ...
but neutrality won 't necessarily lead me to the truth .
life is much more complicated , and I believe journalism should reflect that very complexity .
to me it seemed like a brilliant idea to expose the president , but to my boss -- ( Laughter ) My boss didn 't think it was such a great idea .
Donald Trump : who 's next ? yes , please .
Jr : it 's not about you -- Man : get out of my country !
neutrality helps only the oppressor , never the victim . "
what happened is the KOSI River jumped its banks , and for reference , the scale bar here is 40 miles .
so this was a pretty warm time and it happened really abruptly .
what 's interesting about these -- dating , social networking , gaming , entertainment , news , web browsing -- people spend 27 minutes a day on each of these .
and what they 've done is rigged the desks to the ceiling .
we don 't know how they 're going to react as the planet heats up , and hidden in that uncertainty might be hope .
they turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us .
if global warming triggers cloud changes that make for a less powerful greenhouse or a more effective sunshade , then that would enhance the cooling power of clouds .
I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest is like , " I have some suggestions for you . "
( distorted voice ) OK , so what 's going on here ?
( laughter ) Now I 'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self , the specific experience of being you , is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain .
and there are experiences of being a continuous and distinctive person over time , built from a rich set of memories and social interactions .
or " Should our army advance into this territory ? "
well , you know what happened to Nokia ?
it 's very easy just to slip into silver @-@ bullet thinking , as if some simple solution existed .
as I motioned in the direction I thought she should go , saying , " There are no stores on this side of the street so your best bet is to cross -- " " Oh my goodness , " she interrupted .
we now know that these receptors are found all over the body , including in some pretty unexpected places -- in muscle , in kidneys , lungs and blood vessels .
I mean , where 's the button on the ride hailing app for the drivers to talk to one another about their working conditions or to unionize ?
he kills , I kill . "
of course you would .
we 're interested in scenarios in which this is not possible .
( laughter ) We 've seen this problem before .
so it 's time for Spot to come back out , and we 're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility , dexterity and perception .
now , Spot has a set of cameras here , stereo cameras , and we have a feed up in the center .
in fact , we look identical to the one next door , except that we 're bright yellow .
instead of pursuing the American dream , where we might have been isolated in our single @-@ family homes , we instead chose cohousing , so that we can increase our social connections .
when you eat together , you share more things .
we follow up , we check in , we speak our personal truths and , when appropriate , we apologize .
and in the library , I found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the Great Depression .
my dog is in fact a malamute .
and it 's correct , there is a malamute in the image , but just given this label , we don 't actually know that much about what 's going on in the image .
I work on a problem called object detection , where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects , put bounding boxes around them and say what those objects are .
and at night , we would leave , get in the water , and we would swim and let the current carry us .
but after having lived through that with Lucho , after having faced fear together , united , not punishment , not violence -- nothing -- could ever again divide us .
I called the man upstairs , and he sent me the patrol that rescued me from the jungle . "
the shriek that came out of all of us when we regained our freedom , continues to vibrate in me to this day .
you can survive crawling along , fearful .
thank you .
so .
he asked whether I 'd be interested in designing a program called a " conviction review unit . "
right ?
but my research showed that juvenile confessions without a parent present are prone to error .
we knew what really happened ; someone told them to say this .
I knew my baby didn 't do this . "
if there 's anything that we 've learned , anything that I 've learned , with this conviction integrity work , it 's that justice doesn 't happen .
we make justice happen .
but the truth is that the challenges of making this happen have less to do with what we do and more to do with the wealth position in which we are born .
( audio ) Dr. Gloria Mark : so we find that when people are stressed , they tend to shift their attention more rapidly .
you interacted with the company that you work for or that you own .
simple , nine @-@ item survey that 's quite predictive in these experiments .
and one day they featured a video of my band on the homepage , which was amazing -- we got a bunch of new fans .
thanks , everybody .
I decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated .
and they do the paperwork , they do the insurance , they do all of the other forms that I can 't do quickly .
if you live in a city of eight @-@ and @-@ half million people , you can do this .
it can 't work that way . "
and imagine how this could revolutionize the way we manage allergies and chronic disease .
it 's a remote , mountainous zone , a blue zone , where super longevity is common to both sexes .
now , to return to the beginning , why do women live longer than men ?
we have knowledge .
( guitar ) And then there 's you .
the New York Post filed a Freedom of Information Act request , got all the teachers ' names and all their scores and they published them as an act of teacher @-@ shaming .
( applause ) And the rest of you , the non @-@ data scientists : this is not a math test .
and I glanced upward , and I was just dumbstruck .
and so let me tell you : before you die , you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse .
( laughter ) Because you 're using ammonia , you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong ; it topped 400 psi .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
their alignment enables their autonomy , and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible .
now , today , to know how things are going , instead of looking at status reports , he needs to walk down to the team floors to attend one of their sessions .
now they have releases every few weeks , and without the handovers and the red tape , the whole organization becomes more efficient .
OK , so now you might understand what I said : modern AIs do not read , do not understand .
and Todai Robot chose the correct answer , too .
ca : a shift from knowledge , rote knowledge , to meaning .
so this facility contains 2,650 mirrors which are arrayed in concentric circles around an 140 @-@ meter @-@ tall tower at its center .
it 's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion and natural disasters , but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid .
so we 're already finding photographs to complete a digital reconstruction of this .
but cultural heritage offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people for future generations .
you 've got just a minute to jump through the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history .
these are smog @-@ free bicycles which -- I 'm Dutch , yes ? -- I have this " bicycle DNA " inside of me somewhere .
but going to this camp , I was further shocked to realize that it was actually really fun .
and what 's really tragic is that oftentimes there 's no one profile .
how do we get rid of terrorist content ?
it 's not just recruiting combatants ; it 's trying to build a state .
I spent four years trying to analyze it , using standard academic tools , to guess what would happen , and I 'm here to tell you what I found .
this is your life : you start and you end , really simple .
but I tripled my money , and I tripled my money because I got lucky .
and that was because the computer could make decisions much faster , it could process a lot more information and it can process decisions much more -- less emotionally .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , if you 'd waited for one more year , you would have heard this .
( music ) The 10 @-@ year @-@ old , on every eight notes .
he was the president of a corporation in Ohio .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
the audience gasped when they heard the difference .
you adore classical music . your FM is always on that classical dial .
now comes the third group : people who never listen to classical music .
and then there 's a very small group .
you couldn 't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome .
but I tell you what .
of course , I 'm not sure they 'll be up to it . "
when I started , you thought , " How beautiful that sounds . "
( music ) " I don 't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year . "
then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say , " Wake up ! it 's culture ! " and then you feel even worse .
we have a B. This is a B.
the next note is a C.
( laughter ) Now , it goes down to A.
( music ) That might have been a fluke .
or they say , " Hamlet has an Oedipus complex . "
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
and ...
so what the general straight public saw was this very awful thing happening to a group of people who were already on the fringes of society .
but Jonathan insisted on paying , so he went to the store and bought something he didn 't need to make change .
of course , for many of us , that happens through work .
of course , you don 't have to find purpose at work , but purpose gives you something to live for , some " why " that drives you forward .
one study had students look up at 200 @-@ feet @-@ tall eucalyptus trees for one minute .
of course , the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones .
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean .
so this is definitely physics happening here -- there 's lots of things -- this is definitely physics .
that 's allowed .
and if you go to some places like black holes in the beginning of the universe , we know that these are frontiers in physics , right ?
there 's plenty of physics research going on here .
but because it doesn 't involve pointing at stars , people for some reason think it 's not that .
I want you to tell me which one is which .
( audience responds ) The one on the left -- yes !
this is the Hubble Space Telescope .
Hubble has been floating in free space for 25 years , not touching anything .
Hubble kind of rotates around them , and so it can orient itself .
so the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use , also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time .
so this is the fun bit of physics , that you learn these patterns and then you can apply them again and again and again .
so I think we should play with these patterns .
magnets that you can play with in your kitchen get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation .
and being familiar with these concepts means we 're not helpless .
it 's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions .
all of us can have fun playing with toys , and we shouldn 't be embarrassed about it .
I 'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are teacups around .

what about you , now , listening to this ?
there are days when you feel as if you 're floating among the clouds .
these are fragile ecosystems .
Mike lost his job to a machine .
so what he 's talking about here is shared production , and efficiency is the name of the game .
it 's that simple .
Elissa 's question to me , back when she first came to my lab , indeed had been a life @-@ and @-@ death question .
can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone ?
a lot of things could be studied , but look at that : 30 years ago , we were still poor in China .
giant clams are these massive and colorful shelled marine animals , the largest of its kind .
the biggest recorded individual was four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ feet long and weighed about 550 pounds .
street evangelism is only slightly less ubiquitous than street harassment .
forced evictions are incredibly violent and , of course , unconstitutional .
similar to couscous , fonio has a delicious , nutty and earthy flavor .
last year , a business partner and I secured a commitment from Whole Foods Market , the US 's largest natural food store chain , to carry fonio .
la : and I 'd say I 'm a little to the left , like all the way to the left .
think about it .
and do you know how much it costs for a company to even have an office ?
but that is going to change by the convergence of two technologies : augmented reality and telepresence robots .
a vehicle carrying a squadron of drones .
so that 's two .
now , what was the third reason why people move to cities ?
a recent study made in the UK by the Office for National Statistics showed a higher life satisfaction rating among people living in rural areas .
( laughter ) I just think they will once they realize they can have the same benefits the city has .
I had just seen The Green Lady .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
I didn 't bring one with me , but they really work much better off @-@ board .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
I 'm willing to suspect some of you hadn 't even heard of them before .
so what I want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out .
you see them , so they must see you .
on that -- well , that year , I had just begun my master 's at the University of Cape Town .
and so I started conjuring her mentally , spiritually and through dress .
this is what I have called " Africa 's knowledge imperative . "
African universities are now all too content to have e @-@ connections with libraries elsewhere , having given up ambitions on building libraries to which the world would come for intellectual edification .
these are from YouTube .
but what Silvarret has done here is that what he wanted to make was not a real city .
this is a fantasy city , even though it looks real .
like , it 's not enough to have a hospital .
so we need the solutions and these people , playing the game , they are trying out different kinds of solutions .
they 've been more likely to do worse at school , to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money .
reading to children every day seems to be really important , too .
were the children going to bed at regular times , or did they go to bed at different times during the week ?
so wait , does that actually mean , then , that poverty doesn 't matter after all ?
now , as you can imagine , the answers aren 't quite as simple as that .
he had an idea .
I 'm talking about the creature in the box , not my cat .
but it will probably take a lot of time .
but I needed to know . like , I wanted to know .
I don 't have infinite olive branches to extend to people who , like , would not want to see me on this planet . right ?
audience : yes !
but , remember -- I came here to play smart , willful , complicated , interesting complex , confident female characters , right ?
attractive , cute , and flirty , she is the ideal girl and Brian 's prize throughout the entire film . "
just so that people will trust you with their money . "
and so you don 't get change by asking them or even yelling at them .
( laughter ) So , now before I get to my four @-@ point plan for the revolution -- yes , I have a four @-@ point plan -- I have two pieces of very good and important news for you .
but the good news is , we exist , and there is a vast amount of untapped potential over here .
fact : women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets .
if we can figure out how to make our movies and deliver them to the audiences that want them , that 's it .
if you can give a female filmmaker 25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign , great , do that .
come pick it up .
looking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact that not much has changed in the education curricula in Africa .
I was in the United States in Washington , DC studying towards my doctorate , and I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region .
he said , " Oh , when I go to Africa , it 's so easy .
my bosses are happy with me . "
you own the knowledge . you know it all .
( applause ) Thank you . thank you .
" Robam kbach Boran , " or the art of Khmer classical dance , is more than 1,000 years old .
they tore families apart and brainwashed children against their own parents .
for those few weeks , people got to be creators and innovators .
and music has psychological effects on us .
hair up in a bun that 's the most fun .
all my bad habits have got to , got to go .
we were at the border .
this time , an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm , because I lost my coat on the frozen river while battling with one of these soldiers .
and I 'm in this place where I read and hear about North Korea provoking the US .
but what we care about in food is nutritional value .
so this is where we enter the picture .
but he hears some voices up in the stairwell , so he climbs up the stairwell , comes around the corner , and finds a group of young African @-@ American men playing dice .
and so for instance , one thing the gang would do is -- the gang leaders would have big entourages , and they 'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry .
one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like -- the gang leader always got paid .
( laughter ) Maybe " weak and shit " is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis .
it is an imaginary , super @-@ magnified medical device that fits around the optic nerve .
( dog barking ) ( Dog barking and spring boinging ) Thank you .
off the rugged coast of the pacific northwest , pods of killer whales inhabit the frigid waters .
the matriarch shows the younger whales where to find the most fertile fishing grounds .
why do I want it ?
( applause ) Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos who believed their voices mattered in the state of Georgia .
that 's why God created naps .
you take an airplane , you fly over the top , you 're weightless for 25 seconds .
and my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero @-@ g .
and so her lawyers and I asked Lily , did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her .
instead , we filed a civil lawsuit , and we eventually won the case , and her case became a rallying cry for domestic workers everywhere .
we live in a time of moral choices everywhere we turn : at the border , at the ballot box , in our workplaces , right in our homes , full of moral choices .
they have a mix of chromosome types with X , with XY or with XXX .
to truly understand DNA decision @-@ making , we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic detail .
for that we 'd need a million computers to do that .
for the first time , my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA -- the largest biomolecular simulation performed to date .
sometimes it raises eyebrows , but it also raises awareness .

to Kat and Marie , not having and election website was unacceptable , but they didn 't have very many options .
it 's already transformed how we connect with one another and understand the world around us , but our democratic institutions -- they 're being left behind .
nothing really special , but a good pair of hands . "
you CANNOT have a 100 percent meritocratic environment when there is a human element involved in the evaluative equation , because by definition , that makes it subjective .
it was almost two years later when I realized what this person should be called .

we can 't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats . "
so , in some sense , what this is suggesting is that it 's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong , which is putting children at risk . it 's just that , fundamentally , the car seats aren 't doing much .
it seems to me that this can 't be a very expensive solution , and it 's got to work better than what we already have .
I 've made him run into a wall here , over and over again .
we did get it to work eventually , after tweaking a bit here and there .
and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
and what you see is , it 's going to fall over the obstacle .
it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it .
now , it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well .

we need to scale this up , ideally maybe train car scale .
and here 's something else that we can do .
and then , we want to make an adhesive bond , or joint , and so we take another piece of metal and we put it on there and just position it .
this is a tube with lead shot in it , nothing fancy .
and it 's stuck .
it 's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce , so for us , it 's pretty exciting . it 's pretty cool .
but maybe more importantly , here , it 's also degradable , and we can degrade it under very mild conditions , with water .
it 's just awful . it hurts .
so what we 're doing is we 're getting all sorts of bones and skin and soft and hard tissue , and sometimes we 'll whack it with a hammer .
and we are observing that the results are intriguing .
and we are doing it ourselves with our hands in our shop , and we are architects . we 're not professional builders but we want to make sure it 's possible .
it showed me what it meant to be an explorer , at a very early age .
so as I went on this journey through a high school , and I went to college , and I got a football scholarship to play football in college .

so in which corner should you place the diffuser to flood the vampire lair with sunlight ?
there 's two million emails per second .
the media wants to be liquid .
and so , giving an example of this thing , I live in Pacifica , rather than -- right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere .
and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity , just by it flowing through the network .
they certainly didn 't need to talk to origami artists .
and rockets are small . so you have to make it smaller .

and I think I 'll take off this one .

it 's one minute long .

the question is , what 's the good you can do with it ?
what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow , and creating the peace space that allows us to move on .

I maintain this is code inside the Army for , " We don 't want to do this . "
I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s .

certain bad things you CANNOT do .
what 's happened since is that bifurcation I described .
( laughter ) I supported the war in Iraq .
I knew we 'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force .

and as you 're looking at this stuff , here 's kind of a country view at a 400 base pair resolution level , and then you zoom in to 550 , and then you zoom in to 850 , and you can begin to identify more and more genes as you zoom in .
DNA is a really powerful information storage device .

it wasn 't going anywhere toward , you know , saying what the gene was ; it was just nuclear science . and oh , that 's the book , little book .
it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule , and then how do you go from RNA to protein ?
and , you know , I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time .
and I started working with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that .
so you see -- hey , come on . Hey , did you feel that ?
you 've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it , or else you can .
I want to know the size of the market . why is this market worth getting at ?
there 's never been a company with no competition , even if the competition is the old way of doing something .

why is there so much morphological variation in the genus Homo ?
and what force is driving that variation ?
who did it evolve from ?
( laughter ) Thank you .
he studied how our process of perception doesn 't just register sensory inputs , but transforms them .
patients suffering from the same mental illnesses also performed similarly , making the test a reliable diagnostic tool .
by the 1960s , it had been officially administered millions of times in the U.S. alone .
bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns behind our perceptions .
this is what happens in people who share half of their DNA -- fraternal twins .

so I came to realize once again , as I did when I needed help to go to university , that while I could dream or have a dream , I could not make it come true all by myself .
none of us will see that day , but we must start in the hope that future generations will be able to finish the job .
you talked about , we need to do an experiment on this .
that lime is going to get out there .
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol , for example .
what I want to suggest to you , though , in the next couple of minutes is that there 's also a hopeful response to this .

that 's why you see it in every supermarket .
now , the problem isn 't solved if he doesn 't publish it , because there are already companies that are developing this kind of technology , and a lot of the stuff is just off the shelf .
this simple tweak .
this isn 't " 1984 . "
in this context , it means that we are the product that 's being sold .

( laughter ) I couldn 't pick a career .
so I brought a picture with big hair .
I just want to get that out of the way .
the reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it .
he didn 't actually buy anything , just some data .
this is happening in your local cities too , you 're probably just not aware of it .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
without it , the problems faced in the real world -- poverty , war , disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should .
a well @-@ designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience .
I 'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization .
the woman , let 's call her " V , " was beaten for over 50 minutes before she died .
one minute and 20 seconds .
it is not .
you see , assigning a letter to my father , a letter to my son , " If I knew then what I know now ... "
versus , " You can read and write , can 't you ? "
there are dozens of different gender @-@ affirming surgeries from chest surgeries to bottom surgeries to facial feminization and man @-@ sculpting .
so I fell over and I sat there with him because for the first time in a long time he seemed kind of OK .
nobody was productive .
and I think it kind of does , because as you 've heard , as the sea levels come up , it takes weaker and weaker storms to do something like this .
so now we have too much , too little , wrong place , wrong time .
it 's a place called Svalbard .
ICLEI , UCLG , Metropolis -- these are the movements of the future .
thank you .
being surrounded by many cultures was the norm , but also a very confusing experience .
in both Chinese and Native folk , I sense this inherent sound of longing and holding onto the past , an emotion that greatly drives the music I create today .
in my father 's words , " Being Native is not about wearing long hair in braids .
the arts brings meaning to life .
and I thought , well , this is the power of a city .
if they did , it probably was right there at Ground Zero .
( laughter ) I also did -- and I don 't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection .
now our theory of case management is : anything necessary to keep them housed . "
when the protons reach their maximum speed , they shoot out onto a target that contains a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen @-@ 18 .
in early spring , these frozen pools begin to melt , supplying villagers with irrigation for their fields .
I was visiting this birth center in the north of India .
and she got back a green , thick liquid , and within a minute of being able to do that and suctioning out over and over , that baby started to breathe .
the idea that there 's sort of an equalizer happening , that sort of means that anybody can make something , is wonderful .
but part of me also gets it completely .
obviously British television is always amazing and always does interesting things .
please help me thank Shonda . SR : thank you .
and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other , is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age .
( laughter ) So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales .
when you are brought up as a Catholic , you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church , you 'll be struck dead at the threshold .
he said , " No problem . it wasn 't a religious service . "
AGF : absolutely not .
she said , " No , it 's serious .
and you 've always been passionate about science .
the new thing now is that computers can find their own rules .
and we are . we are creative .
it 's a bit scary , I know .
sometimes , the curl might completely enclose part of the wave , forming a moving tube of water known as the barrel .
after months of strategic planning and controversy , thousands of women gathered in Washington D.C.
as a disenfranchised group , women had no voice in the laws that affected their- or anyone else 's- lives .
however , in planning the parade , Paul mainly focused on appealing to white women from all backgrounds , including those who were racist .
it can sometimes seem that we are doomed to take sides , be stuck in echo chambers and never agree again .
I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours , a tool that you might not expect : abstract mathematics .
and then at the top , we have 30 , which is a product of three prime numbers -- two times three times five .
now maybe it can be clear that it doesn 't really matter what those numbers are .
and there are many things we can learn from this diagram , I think .
we can all use these abstract structures to help us pivot between situations in which we are more privileged and less privileged .
rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades .
or , more precisely , perfecting an imperfect self .
and what I discovered was that many of them exhibit the same behaviors that I saw in six @-@ year @-@ old D.
I could no longer go to school , see my friends or even eat out , because my tics would attract the attention of everyone in the room .
instead , she diagnosed me with an incurable neurological disorder , Tourette syndrome .
we could blame Hollywood for that .
that 's not it .
they all have two things in common : one , they can never get my name right , and second , they are all female .
you can probably guess where this is going , right ?
so , yes , some of the energy in the world of AI , in the world of technology is going to be about what ads you see on your stream .
first , I hope you leave thinking about bias today .
for instance , this is another student of mine , Susan Jackson from Australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world .
imagine squaring off the outside of a pizza , so that instead of a circle , it 's an octagon .
it 's not that special .
this is the last place in the universe you would expect to find a planet , but they had very methodically looked at this pulsar , and they detected the gravitational tug of this planet as it orbited the pulsar .
by the clothes that we wear and the makeup that we put on .
yeah , I guess those hoodies that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley are just so provocative .
( applause ) So how do we go about getting our power back ?
and here 's what I tell the Senators : sexual harassment is apolitical .
or imagine every time you go out , and you 're in crowded places , you feel this panic starting to arise .
( audience ) Yes .
this actually used to be a cornfield nine months ago , and with the Rwandan government , we leveled it and built this center in a couple weeks .
and from the moment it leaves the end of the launcher , it 's completely autonomous .
and the jobs that these kids may have gotten 10 years ago are largely being automated or are being changed dramatically by technology .
this is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue .
Jimmy , you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia 's success .
there 's a media storyline about Wikipedia , which I think is false .
( laughter ) But I think there 's going to be huge impacts .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi : I 'm used to coral .
humanity 's longest experiment in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well .
unfortunately , phones might not be able to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols .
I 'm showing to you different sections of the show right now , just to give you a taste of it .
in this case too , you have a mixture of scientists and designers .
so , we 'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future .
one of the most important topics of the show -- you know , as anything in our life today , we can look at it from many , many different viewpoints , and at different levels .
it takes seven days today to manufacture a chair , but you know what ? one day it will take seven hours .
Elio Caccavale : he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia .
it 's quite amazing how these things can make you smile , can make you laugh , can make you cry sometimes .
pollinator decline is a grand challenge in the modern world .
we 're finding out now that in rural areas , there are 150 plants on average in a sample of honey .
we now have a baseline measure of honey , honey DNA from before and after the storm .
( laughter ) And even now , a decade and a half later , even now that we are married , I look for her still , whenever she is not in the room .
I backed away .
it was our first show .
( music ) Thank you .
this is a salve that our democracy sorely needs .
and it 's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor .
the other is a letter to the inmate with specific suggestions for how to manage themselves .
I just have to work a lot harder at it . " ( laughs ) And here 's Thomas .
and yet , look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold .
and you get all the disease @-@ protective substances .
and it can be labor @-@ intensive , it 's sometimes costly .
but again , just like school @-@ based initiatives , this is hard work .
what makes this disease so deadly ?
this leaves the patient with a deficit in the amount of heart muscle that they have .
so if we could do eight points in the clinic , I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact on human health .
little do they know it , but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death .
but in that case , if the maturing brain is to blame , then why are teens more vulnerable than children , even though their brains are more developed than those of children ?
in short , I wanted to conduct a research study to answer one big question : why do teens keep making outrageous choices that are harmful to their health and well @-@ being ?
but , you see , I attended a high school in South Dakota with limited opportunity for scientific exploration .
can positive risk @-@ taking escalate with repeated exposures ?
I turned around to a tall , broad @-@ shouldered man , pure hate in his eyes .
and I began to think about what I could potentially offer to build safety and power for women .
and we mean those words .
and for that to happen , we need all hands on deck .
so I 've given you my secret recipe , and now it 's up to you .
HT : well , thank you very much for that fantastic question .
so don 't ever think you don 't have power if you don 't sit in a position of power .
and that 's to say nothing of his idea of a goose machine that could go to the Moon .
in 1981 , it flew 163 miles from Paris to England , solely on the power of sunbeams , and established a basis for the Pathfinder .
OK .
and with a large weight , you get a large contraction .
if you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph , television , radio , telephone were adopted in decades .
the most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions .
my main message is that progress in technology is exponential , not linear .
how can you be stressed on one side of your body and not the other ?
so I waited and he came back .
we 've had people whose hair stands on end on one arm 20 minutes before a seizure . "
he explained how this could happen in the brain , and he got interested . I showed him the data .
this is a really great thing , a really positive step .
she is , like , everything .
they were sons and daughters , brothers and sisters .
this is possible if we do the work .
ca : that 's an amazing story , thank you .
KB : thanks for letting me show these .
painted with squirrel @-@ hair brushes on vellum or parchment by monks , nuns , and urban craftspeople , these bizarre images populate the margins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages .
more parents were divorced in this generation than any generation prior .
they 're incredibly pragmatic , they 're hopeful and they 're determined .
I 've been spending some time thinking about this and researching this , and fellow researchers and I aren 't exactly sure that these generations are real .
thank you very much .
so , the guy replies , " Yeah , I know , I know .
the blood moving through your arteries .
for example , the motion of the atmosphere is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the earth 's rotation .
Keith Schacht : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
( applause ) So what 's the significance of this dry liquid ?
thank you .
and I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex @-@ combatants , as they like to be called .
no , once we 're done with that , we wait a few days , and then , we anesthetize those spiders .
teens who use tobacco products are more likely to use marijuana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety as a teen or as an adult .
the trick lies in a phenomenon known as total internal reflection .
so we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
he was a creativity researcher in the ' 60s and ' 70s , and also led the Stanford Design Program .
I need you to turn that piece of paper over ; you should find that it 's blank on the other side .
( laughter ) There we go .
( laughter ) Thank you , thank you , thank you .
helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
now , an adult encountering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can , you know .
I suspect , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categorize new things very , very quickly .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stripy thing : is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us ?
of course they will . but they 'll also ask , " What can I do with it ? "
any parents of young kids in the audience ? there must be some .
he gave each of them some mescaline , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
now , that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh .
so I put it through a G.C. , a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office , and it 's about 400 .
like , at no concentration , even pure , you know , if you smelt pure ethanol , it doesn 't smell of rotten eggs .
if you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
the bad news is they 're rocket fuels .
OK , great , we smell vibrations . how ? all right ?
and this is our new baby , called tonkene .
this is a new 33 @-@ million @-@ pound college of further education that was mostly funded by the European Union .
he was fed up with it .
and this entire referendum took place in darkness , because it took place on Facebook .
( applause ) Our parliament has been the first in the world to try to hold you to account , and it 's failed .
democracy is not guaranteed , and it is not inevitable , and we have to fight and we have to win and we CANNOT let these tech companies have this unchecked power .
so , about three years ago I was in London , and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said , I represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
we have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well .
it took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea .
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
no matter what any one nation @-@ state does , they will not be able to solve the problem alone .
Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy , and amazingly , genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy .
why no hearings , no denunciations , no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House ? what 's the deal ?
evangelicals have joined it . Jewish groups have joined it .
now because it 's student @-@ driven , there 's some amazing things that the movement has done .
and that 's all the Bush administration 's leadership , and it 's all because of this bottom @-@ up pressure and the fact that the phones haven 't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis .
he 's the viceroy . he has to decide on tax policy , on currency , on border patrol , on policing . he has to make all these judgments .
and sometimes , it 's better to be lucky than good .
ca : so you started capturing huge amounts of data .
ca : yeah , that is amazing .
so tell us more about what we 're actually looking at here .
ca : and so when we think of a black hole , you think of these huge rays jetting out of it , which are pointed directly in our direction .
now , we 're too close to really see all the jet structure , but it 's the base of those jets that are illuminating the space @-@ time .
you 're just going to drift right through that event horizon .
today , this shared universe is called the Cthulhu Mythos , named after Lovecraft 's infamous blend of dragon and octopus .
unfortunately , Lovecraft 's fear of the unknown found a less savory expression in his personal views .
I came here to give you a science lesson about animal mating systems and why defining monogamy has been a challenge for scientists .
now , " OPP " is a call @-@ and @-@ response song .
now , in the song , the MC hints that it 's a five @-@ letter word , but to keep it rated PG , he simply refers to it as " property . "
now , before that technique , we were never ever certain about , 100 percent , who the parents of baby birds were .
we now call this " serial monogamy . "
" it 's OPP , time for other people 's what you get it there 's no room for relationship , there 's just room to ... "
you down with EPC ?
and often , I 'm driving in a taxi , and I see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I 'd never seen happen before .
how can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ?
so actually , check this out .
so you 'll have to go check it out and come see me or something , because it 's mortifying .
again , I don 't know where inspiration comes from .
there I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
that 's just that .
and I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
IM : yeah , it is . exactly .
in any day , the cells in your body will collectively accumulate billions of these single @-@ letter swaps , which are also called " point mutations . "
base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe .
two companies I cofounded , Beam Therapeutics and pairwise Plants , are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases and to improve agriculture .
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
EB : looks kind of like an ice cream cone , more or less .
it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product .
but there was something bizarre about it .
( laughter ) OK , alright . but enough about me .
OK , so I think this is the science behind the whole thing .
but it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the toughest problems we 're facing .
the Canadian government allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees .
we saw that the more money people gave to Spread the Net , the happier they reported feeling afterward .
each night , a local business sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal .
let 's take a snapshot at aviation .
well , what did I do when I was a kid ?
solidifying into surface , molded by fire .
we can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
( laughter ) And this is my -- ( Laughter ) -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space .
some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a ghostly woman reaching out her window .
( laughter ) What would they know ?
this place is remote . it 's over 200 miles from any major city .
that 's a 2,000 @-@ foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
thank you very much .
and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
and it 's maturing up to the present time .
what happens is , you take pictures as the Earth rotates , you get a fan across the sky .
do you see the fan @-@ like scans made across the sky ?
and you start seeing these networks , this cosmic web of structure forming .
and at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger @-@ scale structure .
but what we 're hoping when we get to Planck , we 'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
and it was quite an experience to be there .
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away .
it was quite a compelling experience , but not really , I suppose , a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books .
now , just imagine what that $ 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education .
so given that we know and should believe -- because Moore 's Law 's been , like , a constant , I mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 .
we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that 's a property of carbon fiber also .
the inside of the nanotubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers -- that it 's basically a quantum world .
and so we begin to see , and we 've seen business plans already , where the kind of things Lisa Randall 's talking about are in there .
new materials that can make water , new materials that can make fuel cells work better , new materials that catalyze chemical reactions , that cut pollution and so on .
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .
the third area that we 're working on , and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York .
we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly .
we can 't fight at a million @-@ to @-@ one disadvantage .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
what I want to do is I want to weave computing , AI and internet as part of us .
as part of human cognition , freeing us to interact with the world around us .
one of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks that we do as human beings .
people don 't want to be read , they want to write .
perhaps a greeting , like , " Hello , how are you ? "
I feel like this is amazing , it 's innovative , it 's creepy , it 's terrifying .
radioactive yellow .
bright yellow .
he was right .
the history of foie gras .
mega @-@ farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long @-@ distance travel , food processing .
we see them on the front of the bus , on the bakery 's facade , on the keyboard we write on , on our cell phones -- everywhere .
now , dealing with an unfamiliar language was at times very frustrating and uncomfortable .
[ no trespassing ! ] I could also tell when something was made to last forever .
after a few days in the city , I was on the lookout for something tasty to take back home .
so I walked and walked and walked until I found the perfect bakery .
telling stories by drawing letters -- that 's my job .
now , my friends who don 't want kids , all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies .
and yet , despite all this chaos , I still think we should have babies .
I believe we can and should fight for the earth and humanity , side by side .
where there was once hope , now there is convenient space , and good mileage , good mileage .
according to the World Health Organization , we need to average about 2.1 children per woman today just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation .
it seems every generation is indeed connected .
even after ending its one @-@ child policy in 2015 , China 's birth rates have largely declined .
he said families where the women have four or more kids will no longer pay income tax .
( audience gasps ) It has been a challenging week .
it has been a challenging week .
but that 's not the reason you have babies .
we 're going to be stuck in the screens with our faces not seeing the world around us ?
we worked with my collaborators , who were not engineers .
how can we go from one product to many products ?
I 'm not talking about creating another gadget you get bored with and throw in the back of your drawer and forget about .
that 's what it looks like , and it 's a small device which will be connected to things we want to make smart and connected and interactive .
to tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
and they lived together happily ever after .
the experience left him with a far more pessimistic view of social reform , and his focus shifted toward spiritual concerns .
in the community of Athens , Tennessee , a feisty leader named Whitney Kimball Coe leads hers in an art and framing shop with a youth choir and lots of little flags .
binding ourselves this way actually liberates us .
the " them " is those who don 't .
I know civic religion is not enough to remedy the radical inequities of our age .
we CANNOT unpollute our politics if we clean only downstream .
they don 't really have so many of the extensor muscles that are the weight @-@ bearing muscles ; instead , they rely on retractor muscles to pull themselves along .
and we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction .
I 'm a pretty speedy character .
but the fifth world still wasn 't truly established .
that would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
and this is a connection that most people aren 't pursuing right now , but which we 're fascinated by .
you can see the range of the Coast Redwoods . it 's here , in red .
this buttress is less than halfway up the tree .
these are millennial structures -- portions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
there are four humans in this shot -- one , two , three , four .
well , I think they can tell us something about human time .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
and we 're doing it without a sales @-@ and @-@ marketing team .
now , what we 're doing is , we 're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit .
so we 're targeting 50 dollars in 2010 .
are we dreaming ? is this real ?
one is that if you went into space you 'd be able to begin again .
so that 's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible .
we 're very sensitive to that as humans .
generically , what we use the Web for is to organize , exchange , create and consume information .
you are always there with other people .
one of my favorites . I had this feature that I built into Second Life -- I was really passionate about it .
there is a new sky every night .
but the fact remains : the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same .
I think this should be concerning , considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now .
typically , pain helps the body avoid further injury or damage .
we 're only beginning to uncover the mechanisms behind the experience of pain , but there are some promising areas of research .
it 's got an unfortunate level of detail , unfortunately .
( laughter ) You can see every pore , every wrinkle .
it 's business that must take a side .
you see , we 'd just been to the grocery store , and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it .
good news : chariot 's coming .
that sheen , perfect !
and you don 't have to be on one side of the spectrum or the other side of the spectrum , or fit into someone 's mold , your mom 's mold , whoever 's mold that you are trying to fit into .
these roles were stereotypes and couldn 't have been further from my own reality or from the roles I dreamt of playing .
and our goal was to prove that this sensor would work really well to detect that hydrogen gas .
the thing is , I 've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades .
look , tens of thousands of people died from antibiotic @-@ resistant superbugs in North America just last year .
I 'm scared .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) I got lucky .
I 'd see an ad for a product I had just whispered to a friend about yesterday .
and it wouldn 't be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible .
you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in 1455 .
the room is a theatre . it changes colors .
( applause ) TED is all about patterns in the clouds .
achieving this goal and improving healthcare in general is in everyone 's best interest , from individual people to society as a whole .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
( laughter ) We feel it throughout our teenage years , as my mom can certainly attest to with me .
and we compare simulated universes like that -- I 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky .
but they will have a dark side .
metallic objects -- albeit very small ones , a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the Earth .
now , the idea is simple when we 're applying it to coin tosses , but in fact , it 's not very simple in everyday life .
until about a dozen years ago , when I was really captured by caves , and I really re @-@ focused most of my research in that direction .
now , to wrap this up , I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves .
beneath a surface layer of ice thicker than Mount Everest , there exists a liquid ocean as much as 100 kilometers deep .
they hope to send a probe to test whether the geysers " plumes of vapor contain life @-@ enabling material from that hidden sea .
this guy is now five generations removed from the General ; this guy is about seven .
they looked at " The Young and The Restless . " it wasn 't that , either .
but at some point , all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant .
birthday party ? cake and candles .
an expectant mother I know was dreading her baby shower .
what about a hypothetical tense Thanksgiving dinner ?
rules are powerful , because they allow us to temporarily change and harmonize our behavior .
the way we gather matters because how we gather is how we live .
and then , out of the blue , some physician 's assistant called me at work to tell me that I had stage IV cancer , and that I was going to need to come to the hospital right away .
( laughter ) I believed that hardships were only detours on what I was certain would be my long , long life .
I had to face the fact that my life is built with paper walls , and so is everyone else 's .
but the Danish word for design is " formgivning , " which literally means to give form to that which has not yet been given form .
they didn 't have TV screens , and they didn 't have any football games to watch .
( laughter ) So I started developing -- you know , George 's dad had a lot of help . I just had my brother .
but I wasn 't worried , by the way , about , you know , the explosion causing the destruction of the planet .
but if you go to authority , and you always don 't -- you don 't always get the right answer , see .
OK . all scientists aren 't like that .
and they weren 't the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air .
so the temperature has been , sort of , inching up .
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
so if you just average that and the daytime temperature , it looks like it went up about .7 degrees in this century .
it 's a paper that came out in February , and most of you probably hadn 't heard about it .
so you still get heated , but you don 't dissipate any .
so the planet should get warmer .
these papers should have been called , " The End to the Global Warming Fiasco , " you know .
it may seem like we 're all standing on solid earth right now , but we 're not .

and so you have this question : what does this lead to issues like war crimes ? robots are emotionless , so they don 't get upset if their buddy is killed .
and now , we 're using our creativity in a certain direction , to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities , maybe even one day an entirely new species .
they cried .
and cried .
I remember as the youngest of these five kids feeling heard for the first time .
( laughter ) Always listen to your parents .
( laughter ) I wanted to be Zemeckis , Lucas and Spielberg .
the last thing I wanted to talk about was my own cultural identity , my ethnicity .
I heard from voices from the sky ...
OK , fine , it was Twitter .
and then I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I am Hollywood .
also , some tech founders out here started to post stuff on social media , write stuff about us in articles in the " LA Times , " in " The Hollywood Reporter " and " Entertainment Weekly . "
what an amazing thing to witness .
it became more physical when I went to the movie theater .
so I have a challenge for myself and for anyone here .
there are certain very important but sensitive drugs that are easily degraded by enzymes in the blood .
and here we see the illustration of blocking the liver .
and that ends with a little clip of my father , of Lou , talking about something that is very dear to him , which is the accidents of life .
we were the first film crew in there .
NK : thank you .
he is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
despite that , 15 years ago , I left medical school , as I missed mathematics .
since then , I 've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data .
it would be really nice if there was just one chemical that they detected , but it 's not that simple .
now three of the socks have been worn by children who were uninfected , and just one of the socks was worn by a child who was infected with malaria .
and if you couldn 't predict , you died .
it 's becoming asymmetrical in its activity , biased towards the right , which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world , as opposed to step back .
to enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty .
so where can we find awe , given how important it is ?
( applause ) Please , come up .
part of the problem from creating us versus them is it 's hard to do .
these kids , these parents , they don 't get lawyers .
this isn 't about kids and borders .
with five decision @-@ makers there are a lot of linkages -- 120 , as a matter of fact , if you remember your factorials .
five factorial is 120 .

I could tell you story after story , but I haven 't forgotten Fernando .
can we stop them ?
but it also means that those jumps between species , which are so important to understand , but so rare for most viruses , for rabies , they 're actually happening by the thousands .
so , can we vaccinate bats ?
it might sound like a crazy question , but the good news is that we actually already have edible rabies vaccines that are specially designed for bats .
now we have a whole laundry list of questions .
an imam was present who made it clear that their religion was wrong , and the only good path was to accept Islam and marry a Muslim man .
these women and girls are healing .
and what I 've noticed is that most people 's stories tend to circle around two key themes .
she asked me what she should do .
they 're the people who , when you try to offer them a suggestion , they reject it with , " Yeah , no , that will never work , because ... "
and so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do .
it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies .
and finally , we worked with elected representatives to launch these revived PHCs , who shared the citizen promises with the community with a lot of fanfare .
the public health system was getting back into business .
and a great way to trigger the motivation is to increase transparency to the citizen .
understanding this ancient type of biological computation is the critical first step .
but mortal guards and ordinary weapons wouldn 't suffice , so the visionary god devised an indomitable new defender .
Medea 's promise resonated deep within his core .
none of these creations were as famous as TALOS , who appeared on Greek coins , vase paintings , public frescoes , and in theatrical performances .
the web , mobile devices , virtual and augmented reality were rescripting our nervous systems .
but I am grappling with an ethical dilemma .
that seems to make more sense .
and we 'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
and these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
ours is on the demand side .
but what we 're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature , so we can extend the nature from the park into the city .
that looks very fit into this painting .
it 's a museum created by George Lucas , the creator of the " Star Wars " movies .
it 's nature .
they are monitored by private security firms in order to ensure that they don 't talk to journalists .
delete .
( music ) We need to watch for it .
that is actually the device .
because without chemistry , what is an information superhighway that we love , would just be a really expensive , shiny paperweight .
well it turns out it can do a lot more than just that .
but once true 5G is here , it 's going to be a lot more than how many movies we can put on our device .
on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon , I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
and we said , " What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? "
( laughter ) He actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
and what would it do to our economy ?
and time to land .
to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that .
the way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes , so we go from 46 to 47 or 48 .
and they depend too much upon history , upon philosophy , upon religion , upon culture , upon politics .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
it 's here , right now , under our feet .
there 's also evidence that the fungi are good at inflating the price of nutrients .
so rather than photosynthesizing , tap into the network , steal the carbon and give nothing in return .
so our group helped pioneer a method , a technology , whereby we could tag nutrients with nanoparticles , fluorescing nanoparticles called quantum dots .
this is important , because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources .
and we have been trying to scream to the world that we need to protect our territory , our nature .
you know , back in the late ' 80s , this Big Mac clamshell was the symbol of a garbage crisis .
the last 10 years , I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers .
me and my team thought , reusables ?
the kitchen area is dirty and grimy .
their behavior .

we measured it during the decade of the ' 90s , and over 10 years we reduced 300 million pounds of waste .
now , animal rights , obviously they don 't want animals used for meat .
( laughter ) And I 'm just going to stick to the pastries .
and that is , they said , " You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin . "
so I end up meeting her , and she 's the very best type of critic , in a sense that she just loves the animals , wants to protect them , but she also understands the reality of the meat business .
but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left , maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible .
and so his entire body really is underwater .
and then I took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
so don 't hang on till the bitter end .
thank you very much .
and if the bleaching doesn 't go away -- if the temperatures don 't go down -- reefs start to die .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
we started out , Chrissy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathematically perfect models .
and the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
so it would seem sensible to guess the lowest number possible .
and so I have given over 25 years of my life to this sport , during which I have swum in all five oceans of the world , crossed the English Channel -- which is also known as the Mount Everest of swimming -- and set a world record in the freezing Antarctic ocean .
you had to learn about aeronautics .
even the most common type , osteoarthritis , is trickier to prevent than one might think .
it 's a general misconception that arthritis is confined to old age .
this leads to the flood of enzymes and degradation seen in osteoarthritis , but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cytokines .
to a technique called microfracture , where surgeons create small holes in the bone , allowing bone marrow stem cells to leak out and form new cartilage .
but even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition , not the cause .
a typical day in space starts with the perfect commute .
so we take our urine , we store it , we filter it and then we drink it .
and it 's actually delicious .
but it 's the gathering around the table that 's important , I think both in space and on Earth , because that 's what cements a crew together .
so we prepared her for the process of turning herself over to CBP to ask for asylum .
seeing these horrors day in and day out has changed me .
these refugees , many of whom are families , are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world , where they 're being raped , kidnapped and extorted by criminal groups .
they 've created parallel , fascist @-@ style legal systems in which migrants have none of the rights that form the basis of a democracy , the alleged foundation of the countries in which they 're seeking refuge .
we need to call our elected representatives and demand these changes .
gender is easy . it 's easy to design advertising based on gender , it 's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender .
this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
this was eight years ago , some people were more Republican back then .
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .

it mechanically creates condensation , which produces 2,000 gallons of water per day .
and , " What has it been like living without access to clean water ? "
no matter how dark a situation may be , a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive .

I think back to my undergraduate training at the University of Georgia , where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed .
I had a student who I 'll call " David . "
and it was on the last day of school , I told David to have a great summer .
and after a while , our souls become weighed down by the heaviness of it all .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
the chain that hangs in my classroom is more than just a decoration .
and they have hope .
somebody to reach out and make sure that we 're OK .
every now and then , we all just need a little help holding the stapler .
thank you .
embarrassingly enough , I finished up with " If not this , what ?
if not us , who ?
and if not now , when ? "
the problem was that no one knew what they were expected to do .
and most importantly , they didn 't know that I needed them .
the second big difference for collaborators is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan .
I remember the day really clearly .
people lean back in their chairs , maybe impressed but not engaged .
they know that meetings are not just mindless calendar fillers .
it requires us to be open and transparent and vulnerable , and that 's not what traditional leaders have been trained to do .
and if we 're going to solve the challenges that the world is facing today , we have no alternative , so we had better start getting good at it .
my own journey in biofabrication started with a project called " Biocouture . "
using a certain species of bacteria in a nutrient @-@ rich liquid , we fermented threads of cellulose that self @-@ organized into a sheet of fabric .
I dried the fabric I had grown and cut and sewed it into a range of garments , shoes and bags .
in fact , there 's a growing global community of innovators rethinking materials with biology .
the bacteria produce crystals that form around each grain of sand , locking together all the loose particles to form a solid brick .
if , in any market , you dramatically increase supply , you should expect prices , profitability and growth to go down for existing players .
this is the same car becoming 40 percent more productive .
you can give it to the drivers -- more passengers , more income .
and one of the reasons for that is because they have decided to actively invest in African entrepreneurs , to grow them into the digital age .
some common ideas include Captain Hook , Harry Potter and many well @-@ known characters in Chinese literature .
we are realizing that this is true .
how do you decide what is important ?
so tell me , are you making a lot of money ?
so this leads me to my third question : " what do your elected officials know about nuclear weapons , and what types of decisions are they likely to take on your behalf ? "
ask them , " How would you choose to spend US national treasure ?
after all , this is " national security . "
and the answer can 't be " Because they 're super rich and they live in your zip code . "
Oh , that 's a great school , are you guys very involved there ?
Oh , at Santa Clara , that 's awesome .
right ?
you don 't get extra points for knowing how to use Google .
I 'm looking for , like , a thumbs up , thumbs down .
once you 've made the ask -- " Would you consider supporting us at the 10,000 @-@ dollar level ?
let 's explore what these new medicines are made of , how they 're different and what 's causing this incoming tidal wave of new and exciting medicines .
in the spring , I 'd smell the heady fragrance of lilacs .
for example , Januvia , which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes , is made partially with enzymes .
and by that I mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
well let 's take a look . let 's take a look at the Great Depression .
and so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited , as a consequence , in their language abilities at an older age .
it 's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that 's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon .
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries .
and 700 or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails .
we can look down in the brain of the monkey .
we can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time .
in other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body .
now actually we 've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task .
this is constructed by physical change .
think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general .
you are constructed , your self is constructed from these billions of events .
the point is is that you can train the brain out of this .
a way to think about this is you can actually re @-@ refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it .
it means that most people who are at risk for senility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position .
I 'm specifically interested in things like autism , and cerebral palsy , these great childhood catastrophes .
and of course , a well @-@ ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key .
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here , I thought to myself that well , it 's TED .
and these TEDsters are -- you know , as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .
and then I thought no , no . I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because , after all , this is the great unveiling .
Oh my ! there 's so many of you .
frankly , I 'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this , you know .
really , it 's amazing .
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities .
I am Dominican @-@ American .
so , basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican @-@ American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is , basically , we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me .
I mean , I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different , whatever .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because I 'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that 's my new title .
so , I 'm very happy that you 're , you know , doing this kind of thing , making the talks available online .
for example , a friend of mine .
so , I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend .
she said , " No Mom . I mean , I don 't like boys . I like girls .
I am originally from Jordan .
so you will get the extra credit I promised you .
Bouvard knew that his predictions were perfect .
but we 're now up to 55 countries in the world , have had this virus emerge , in either birds , or people or both .
alright , so I 've got you nervous .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than I 'd anticipated .
[ green is the new black ... ] ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I like that , too .
so I started asking a very simple question : what does it mean to you to be a good woman or a good man today ?
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
sometimes , we 'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster .
and when these concepts underlie our teaching and what we think about the world , then we have a problem , because we stymie support for everything .
the arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity .
infrastructure , museums , theaters , movie houses across the country are disappearing .
so we have to really stop and think : what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts ?
I just want to tell you quickly what I 'm doing -- ( Applause ) I want to tell you what I 've been doing a little bit since ...
and as a dancer , I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body , just as I knew how to sense colors .
it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture , and then putting it into a communication system .
so if we could roll the next film here .

and these atoms are extremely durable .
this implies that somewhere in the universe , there 's a supernova explosion every second or so .
and as they started tweeting , they immediately sent the stock market crashing , wiping out 140 billion dollars in equity value in a single day .
think about it this way : when you go to the grocery store to buy food to consume , it 's extensively labeled .
and that 's potentially incredibly dangerous .
this distributed approach also avoids the problem of the single point of failure .
we 've stopped actually asking really tough questions about what is the difference between value creation and value extraction , productive and unproductive activities .
the farmers , creating value , were called the " productive class . "
well , mechanization has for centuries , actually , taken jobs , but as long as profits were being reinvested back into production , then it didn 't matter : new jobs appeared .
and I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form .
as I will show to you , it is actually the mainstay of modern life .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre @-@ packaged , which I 'm told is called a Wonderbread .
now you may prefer this loaf of bread .
and this is where I have to query all of you .
let 's go back to small @-@ scale , to farmers ' markets , small bakeries and all that . " wonderful .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
and let me just do one simple conceptual thing : if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale .
we 've moved towards large @-@ scale and very high control .
we need more science and not less . and we need good science .
and above all , to me , food is about respect .
never before , as I said , has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few .
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
eat it , and feel privileged .
that people on the fringes can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
that heretics look at the status quo and say , " This will not stand . I can 't abide this status quo .
and I didn 't know what I was doing -- like I said , mid @-@ 20s -- and I 'm the Internet generation , so we started a website .
and we met , literally , a couple of months ago .
it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa .
of course , some people will still need to seek asylum at the border .
picking fruit , cleaning crabs , landscaping in a 100 @-@ degree heat .
how much would a low @-@ wage job help a Honduran , like Juan or Cintia ?
the members of the resistance have positioned a crane over the train tracks that can pluck the artifact once it 's exposed .
fortunately , we now live in a time when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem .
in addition , academic research has shown that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention .
eventually we began asking what they wished they could do .
my grandkids just got arrested last weekend .
but today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
the final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you didn 't think of India as a market , you didn 't really bother about a single market , because it didn 't really matter .
the other thing that you can do is you can do this -- electroencephalography -- you can put these electrodes on your head , OK ?
it 's actually connected to a suite of automated hardware and software that read in real time and feed back to a design team the growth conditions of the microbe .
we have to start to think about how do we connect to water .
you know the expression , " Begging only gets you so far . "
now , weekend in Paris , weekend in Rome -- these are different things .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don 't know our preferences that well .
in her Auntie An @-@ Mei 's home , Jing @-@ Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner of the mahjong table .
they stimulated her gums with a toothpick , to see if that was doing it .
anyway , these women sat in front of an X @-@ ray device .
and Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up .
why don 't you have the farmers do that ?
( laughter ) Shy but ambitious pig farmers , however , can purchase a -- this is true -- a sow vibrator , that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate .
this did not stop Masters and Johnson .
so I was 18 ; I was very excited .
maybe I will never be able to do it , but I have plans for my children .

why was menstruation so different ?
why can 't we talk about periods ?
and it 's not about the blood , as Freud would have you say , because if it were , there would be an ear , nose and throat surgeon up here right now , talking about the taboos of nose bleeds , right ?
( audience gasps ) Right .
you could have a condition called endometriosis , where the lining of the uterus is growing in the pelvic cavity , causing inflammation and scar tissue and adhesions .
and I 'm not going to stand for it .
that means it 's moving during the entire respiratory process , so that thin membrane , the blood @-@ gas barrier , CANNOT be too thin or it will break .
and then we overlaid that with a map of places where journalists were being murdered .

130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense , and the working conditions were horrible .
it wasn 't too bad , but they 're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .
here 's something that 's far more labor @-@ intensive , which is the making of shoes .
that 's cubed metal . this is armatures , electrical armatures , where they 're getting the copper and the high @-@ end steel from electrical motors out , and recycling them .
and to teach them , to me , would be a fantastic wish , and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into .

so here 's the thing , all of this work exists , we have the tools to create these conditions that can allow us to show up as our brilliant selves .
what matters here isn 't technical capital , it 's social capital .
these tools don 't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to .
and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
if you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by amateurs .
through the capillaries , they reach larger blood vessels and exit the bone .
