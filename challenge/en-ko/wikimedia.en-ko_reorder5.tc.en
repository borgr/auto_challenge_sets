a mollifier ( top ) in dimension one . at the bottom , in red is a function with a corner ( left ) and sharp jump ( right ) , and in blue is its mollified version .
in mathematics , mollifiers ( also known as approximations to the identity ) are smooth functions with special properties , used for example in distribution theory to create sequences of smooth functions approximating nonsmooth ( generalized ) functions , via convolution .
it must be pointed out that there is a little misunderstanding in the concept of mollifier : Friedrichs defined as " mollifier " the integral operator whose kernel is one of the functions nowadays called mollifiers .
as briefly pointed out in the " Historical notes " section of this entry , originally , the term " mollifier " identified the following convolution operator : [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
where φ ϵ ( x ) = ϵ − n φ ( x / ϵ ) { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ varphi _ { \ epsilon } ( x ) = \ epsilon ^ { -n } \ varphi ( x / \ epsilon ) } and φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi } is a smooth function satisfying the first three conditions stated above and one or more supplementary conditions as positivity and symmetry .
for any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } , the following family of convolutions indexed by the real number ϵ { \ displaystyle \ epsilon }
where ∗ { \ displaystyle \ ast } denotes convolution , is a family of smooth functions .
for any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } , the following family of convolutions indexed by the real number ϵ { \ displaystyle \ epsilon } converges to T { \ displaystyle T }
for any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } ,

when the data are roughly elliptically distributed and there are no prominent outliers , the Spearman correlation and Pearson correlation give similar values .
the Spearman correlation is less sensitive than the Pearson correlation to strong outliers that are in the tails of both samples . that is because Spearman 's rho limits the outlier to the value of its rank .
Pearson 's correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations . the form of the definition involves a " product moment , " that is , the mean ( the first moment about the origin ) of the product of the mean @-@ adjusted random variables ; hence the modifier product @-@ moment in the name .
