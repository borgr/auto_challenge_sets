the server has encountered bad data from the client .
the server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates .
the server presented a certificate that contains an invalid en@@ coding of an integer . common causes include negative serial numbers , negative R@@ SA mod@@ uli , and en@@ co@@ dings that are longer than necessary .
the server presented a certificate that is not yet valid .
the server presented a certificate that is valid for too long .
the server presented a certificate with a key size that is too small to establish a secure connection .
the server presented a certificate with an empty issuer distinguished name .
the server rejected the hand@@ shake because the client down@@ graded to a lower T@@ LS version than the server supports .
your new collection is shown below . you can < a h@@ ref = " % ( url ) s " > edit additional settings < / a > if you 'd like .
the server supports no protocols that the client adverti@@ ses in the AL@@ PN extension .
the server uses a certificate with a basic constraints extension identifying it as a certificate authority . for a properly @@@ -@@ @ issued certificate , this should not be the case .
the server uses key p@@ inning ( HP@@ KP ) but no trusted certificate chain could be constructed that matches the pin@@ set . key p@@ inning violations CA@@ N@@ NOT be over@@ rid@@ den .
