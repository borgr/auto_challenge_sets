Fission (Site Isolation)
Fission (site isolation) is an experimental feature in { -brand-short-name } to provide an additional layer of defense against security bugs. By isolating each site into a separate process, Fission makes it harder for malicious websites to get access to information from other pages you are visiting. This is a major architectural change in { -brand-short-name } and we appreciate you testing and reporting any issues you might encounter. For more details, see <a data-l10n-name="wiki">the wiki</a>.

<h2>Tracking external sources</h2> <p> If you link to your add-on's details page or directly to its file from an external site, such as your blog or website, you can append a parameter to be tracked as an additional download source on this page. For example, the following links would appear as sourced by your blog: <dl> <dt>Add-on Details Page</dt> <dd>https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/%(slug)s?src=<b>external-blog</b></dd> <dt>Direct File Link</dt> <dd>https://addons.mozilla.org/downloads/latest/%(id)s/addon-%(id)s-latest.xpi?src=<b>external-blog</b></dd> </dl> <p> Only src parameters that begin with "external-" will be tracked, up to 61 additional characters. Any text after "external-" can be used to describe the source, such as "external-blog", "external-sidebar", "external-campaign225", etc. The following URL-safe characters are allowed: <code>a-z A-Z - . _ ~ %% +</code>

If an add-on contains binary or obfuscated source code, the author will receive a message when the add-on is reviewed indicating whom to contact at Mozilla to coordinate review of the source code. This code will be reviewed by an administrator and will not be shared or redistributed in any way. The code will only be used for the purpose of reviewing the add-on.

If an add-on isn't compatible with your version of %(app_name)s, it is usually either because your version of %(app_name)s is outdated or the add-on author has not yet updated the add-on to be compatible with a newer version you are using. Mozilla does not recommend trying to circumvent these compatibility checks, as they can lead to browser instability or in some cases loss of data. For users who are testing out alpha or beta versions of Firefox, we offer the <a href="%(acr_url)s">Add-on Compatibility Reporter</a> to help add-on developers update their compatibility.

In terms of reuse of source code from other add-ons, if the author has not clearly stated that you are permitted to use his or her code in your own work &mdash; such as by placing it under an open source license &mdash; then you should assume that you do not have the right to do so. You can contact the author to seek such permission, but we can't provide you with any special rights to it just because it's listed on the site, or because the author isn't responding to your request.

Most add-ons do not cause a perceivable performance decrease in %(app_name)s, though installing an excessive number may have adverse effects. If you suspect an add-on is causing %(app_name)s to be slow, try disabling it. Add-ons that cause large start-up performance issues will have warning messages on their details page.

Most add-ons load code and resources at the same time Firefox is starting up. In most cases the impact in start-up time is minimal, but some add-ons can cause a noticeable slowdown. We warn you about these add-ons to help you decide about installing them, and also to help you diagnose performance issues you may run into in the future.
Send { $tabCount } Tabs to Device

<span class='hostname'></span> has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that &brandShortName; can only connect to it securely. You can’t add an exception to visit this site.
<span class='hostname'></span> is most likely a safe site, but a secure connection could not be established. This issue is caused by <span class='mitm-name'/>, which is either software on your computer or your network.
An attacker could easily reveal information which you thought to be safe. <span class='hostname'></span> uses security technology that is outdated and vulnerable to attack.

Sync another device
Sync bookmarks, history, and passwords to Firefox on your mobile devices. It only takes a few minutes.
Synced history, bookmarks, logins, and other personal data will not be lost.
Sync Firefox between devices
Syncing another device with Firefox privately keeps your bookmarks, passwords and other Firefox data the same everywhere you use Firefox.
Sync isn't designed as a permanent backup – it's just sharing what is saved locally. If you reset your password and your data isn't stored on at least one other device, you could lose all the information associated with the old password. That's why you'll want to install Firefox and use Sync on more than one device.

Add-ons
Add-ons are applications that let you personalize &brandShortName; with extra functionality or style. Try a time-saving sidebar, a weather notifier, or a themed look to make &brandShortName; your own.
Add-ons are small apps you can add to %S that do lots of things — from managing to-do lists, to downloading videos, to changing the look of your browser.
Compare prices, check the weather or express your personality with a custom theme. Add-ons let you add features to %S, so your browser works harder for you.

A form was submitted in the %S encoding which cannot encode all Unicode characters, so user input may get corrupted. To avoid this problem, the page should be changed so that the form is submitted in the UTF-8 encoding either by changing the encoding of the page itself to UTF-8 or by specifying accept-charset=utf-8 on the form element.

<strong>Are all privacy and security concerns clearly spelled out?</strong> This is an aspect of a clear and accurate description, but such an important one that we feel it deserves specific mention. Many very useful and well-written add-ons manipulate some form of user data, or can present security hazards if misused; they are welcome on the site, but they must make it very clear to users what risks they might encounter, and what they can do to protect themselves.

<strong>Are you responsive?</strong> We expect that an author who is promoting their add-on to our applications' many users is responsive to problem reports, maintains their contact information, and updates their add-on promptly to keep current with Firefox releases and changes in our policies. This doesn't mean that you have to reply to every question that someone posts in the discussions, or that you even need to fix every bug, but we do expect that you will respond to issues in a manner that's appropriate to the severity of the issue in question.

<strong>Do the add-on and add-on author both treat the user respectfully?</strong> Your software should not intrude on the user unnecessarily, try to trick the user, or conceal any of its activities from the user. Users (or even non-users) are sometimes rude in their comments, and while we will do our best to filter out inaccurate reviews as they're reported to us, we do expect that authors will avoid retaliating with rudeness of their own.

<strong>Has the add-on been well-tested, and is it free of obvious or serious defects?</strong> One important thing that we look for when considering an add-on is whether its user reviews indicate that it has received thorough testing, and that it doesn't have serious problems or negative impacts on the browser. If reviewers report problems such as major performance issues, crashes, frequent problems using the functions of the add-on, or spamming of messages to the error console, you should take those reports to heart, and re-submit your add-on after you've addressed them as best you can. We don't expect you to perfectly optimize or have zero bugs &mdash; Firefox itself undergoes constant improvement in these areas &mdash; but we do want you to take reasonable efforts to minimize downsides, and to clearly call out cases where users may be surprised by those that remain.

<strong>Is the add-on clearly and accurately described?</strong> It's of the utmost importance to us that users get what they expect when they try a new add-on. Your add-on name should be clear and concise, and you should refrain from using special characters or numbers to get higher search rankings or for decorative purposes. Your description should provide details about what the add-on does, how a user should take advantage of it, and what the user should expect when they install it. Links to external documents for detailed instructions are fine, but the description itself should cover the basics and leave users confident that they know what they'll get. Also, it is important that you maintain version notes appropriately as you improve and change your add-on. Users should be able to see what's new in an add-on they may have tried previously, and should be made aware of changes that might affect their current use of the add-on when they update.

<strong>Is the add-on useful to an appropriately wide portion of Firefox's users?</strong> Your add-on doesn't need to be the next Greasemonkey or Firebug, but if it is only useful to people at your company or who are part of a small web community, we may feel that it's not yet appropriate to put it in front of all of our users.

Surprises can be appropriate in many situations, but they are not welcome when user security, privacy, and control are at stake. It is extremely important to be as transparent as possible when submitting an add-on for hosting on this site. A Mozilla user should be able to easily discern what the functionality of an add-on is and not be presented with unexpected experiences post-install.

That depends. If you are simply changing a description of your add-on or updating a "maxVersion" to ensure compatibility with a new Mozilla software update, then your add-on does not need to be reviewed again. If, however, you submit a new updated file, then your add-on update will need to be reviewed by an editor.

If there are still several in the running, read through the add-on's ratings, user reviews, and statistics to see which is most liked by other users. Remember that you can also just try out both and see which you like better.

The Recommended lists are an important part of exposing AMO visitors to useful and compelling add-ons within a small &amp; focused list. It allows us to feature add-ons that have done a good job of creating a unique and/or exciting enhancement to Mozilla software and increasing awareness of the thousands of add-ons hosted on AMO. The lists are broken down into two categories; Recommended and Category Recommended. The former is shown on the home page of AMO and is typically limited to 40 featured add-ons. The latter are lists of add-ons that are recommended at the category level. The only distinction between the two lists is that Category Recommended add-ons are not featured on the home page. Apart from that, both lists are meant to recognize the achievements of individual add-on authors and the work they’ve produced.

While we call these "Beta versions", you can use this channel for nightlies, or alphas, or prerelease versions as you wish. Please note that there is only one channel for this purpose and all of your users on this channel will receive the latest add-ons submitted. For instance, if you upload <code>1.0beta1</code> to the release channel and then upload <code>1.1alpha1</code>, all users of <code>1.0beta1</code> will be offered an upgrade to <code>1.1alpha1</code>. Updates are pushed by submission date and not version number, so users will always get the most recent channel update regardless of any kind of alphabetical sorting.

Firefox Health Report (FHR) analyses your browser's performance information, in order to provide you with useful tips that help you get the best from Firefox. For more information on Firefox Health Report, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-health-report-understand-your-android-brow" target="_blank" class="external"><span aria-hidden="true" class="external_icon"></span>visit the Mozilla Support section.</a>
Firefox Health Report (FHR) records anonymous data about your computer, configuration, usage, performance, and error conditions. This data helps us improve Firefox for you and for other Firefox users.
Firefox Health Report lets you know how your Firefox is performing and what you can do to improve it.
Firefox Health Report lets you optimize your Firefox and helps us build a more excellent browser. Reports will be pretty basic at first, but will continue to evolve and grow.
Firefox Health Report records information about your browser and device. You can <a href="#raw" class="navigate">see the information we record.</a> You can also see what you share with Mozilla.
Firefox is distributed through channels: Nightly builds, the Aurora pre-release channel, a stable Beta, and the public release. This field identifies the channel.
For each browsing session, Firefox Health Report records approximately how long you browsed (in seconds), and whether the session ended normally or because of a crash. Also includes startup times (in milliseconds) if available.
For more information about how we handle your data, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/legal/privacy/firefox.html#health-report" target="_blank" class="external"><span aria-hidden="true" class="external_icon"></span>see our privacy policy.</a>

Now you can access %(name)s from the toolbar.
Data aggregators, or data brokers, collect information from public records and buy it from other companies. They compile this data to sell it to companies for marketing purposes. Victims of these breaches are less likely to experience financial fraud, but hackers could use this data to impersonate or profile them.
Data breaches are on the rise. If your personal info appears in a new data breach, { -product-name } sends you an alert — so you can take action and protect your accounts.

However, not all add-ons work with each of those applications or every version of those applications. For Firefox add-ons, the install buttons will indicate whether the add-on is compatible or not. Add-ons listed in this gallery only work with Mozilla-based applications, such as <a href="%(getfirefox_url)s">Firefox</a>, <a href="%(getmobile_url)s">Firefox Mobile</a>, <a href="%(getseamonkey_url)s">SeaMonkey</a>, and <a href="%(getthunderbird_url)s">Thunderbird</a>. Each add-on specifies which applications and versions it works with, such as Firefox 2.0 - 3.6.*.

Add-ons provide many useful features and functions, but they can also cause %(app)s to become slower. Some add-ons can even slow %(app)s to a crawl and make it difficult to use for regular web browsing. If you think add-ons might be the reason %(app)s is lethargic, check the list below for some of the biggest bottlenecks. And remember, for best performance you should disable add-ons that you no longer use regularly.

CSS3 Animations
CSS3 Animations are a new feature of modern browsers like Firefox, which add even more flexibility and control to the style and experience of the Web. CSS3 Animations let you change property values over time with no or minimal JavaScript, and with greater control than CSS Transitions. Go beyond static properties to animate the appearance and positions of HTML elements. You can achieve these effects without Flash or Silverlight, to make creative dynamic interfaces and engaging animations with CSS3.
CSS3 Animations let you change property values over time, to animate the appearance or position of elements, with no or minimal JavaScript, and with greater control than transitions.
CSS 3D Transforms
CSS 3D Transforms extends CSS Transforms to allow elements rendered by CSS to be transformed in three-dimensional space.

CSS Media Queries
CSS Media Queries allow Web developers to create responsive Web designs, tailoring the user experience for a range of screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
<p>When you browse in a Private Window, %1$s <strong>does not save</strong>:</p> <ul class="two-column"> <li>visited pages</li> <li>searches</li> <li>cookies</li> <li>temporary files</li> </ul> <p>Private Browsing <strong>doesn’t make you anonymous</strong> on the Internet. Your employer or Internet service provider can still know what page you visit.</p> <p class="about-info">Learn more about <a id="learnMore">Private Browsing</a>.</p>
CSS Media Queries are now a common tool for responsive, mobile-first web design. They are now even a W3C Recommendation! They can tell you a lot more about a display than just its width. What can you do with Media Queries?

MDN is currently in maintenance mode. Content is being served from a backup database, which means some articles may show out-of-date information. Have no fear! All will be restored when maintenance has concluded.

Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
Advocating for Web standards
After several years of development, <a href="%(mozilla1)s">Mozilla 1.0</a>, the first major version, was released in 2002. This version featured many improvements to the browser, email client and other applications included in the suite, but not many people were using it.
A growing percentage of our revenue also comes from support from the public, including grants and individual donors like you. These donations are directly applied to important projects such as Webmaker, Open Badges and Mozilla-Knight Open News that extend Mozilla's influence in new areas.

Made possible with the support of the Ford Foundation, Collusion allows users to see who is tracking them across the Web. It shows, in real time, how that data creates a spider-web of interaction between companies and other trackers.

An ad blocker is a piece of software that can be used to block ads, and they work in two ways. The first way is when an ad blocker blocks the signal from an advertiser’s server, so the ad never shows up on your page. Another way ad blockers work is by blocking out sections of a website that could be ads.

As an open source project, transparency and openness are an essential part of Mozilla’s founding principles. Our codebases are open and auditable. Our development work is open. Our bi-annual <a href="%(report)s">Transparency Report</a> also demonstrates our commitment to these principles.
As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.
As of mid-November 2013, there are three different Firefox OS phones on sale: the ZTE Open, the ALCATEL ONE TOUCH Fire, and the LG Fireweb. Huawei has also committed to manufacturing Firefox OS smartphones, and Foxconn announced in June 2013 that it plans to build a range of Firefox OS devices. We expect to announce additional OEM support soon.
As the Web expands to reach billions of new people and touch our lives in new ways, it has become an essential part of our individual growth and collective future. And that Web is what the Mozilla community has pledged to protect and promote: a platform providing opportunity, connectivity and inspiration for all.
A sustainable organization has been created that uses market mechanisms to support a public benefit mission and this model has been reused by others to create open, transparent and collaborative organizations in a <a href="%(range)s">broad range</a> <a href="%(areas)s">of areas</a>.
At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we are doing to improve the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers. We succeed when we build products that people love, and when other organizations build build the traits and features we care about into competing products. For example, we view Google Chrome's recent implementation of the Do Not Track feature we pioneered to be a success for Mozilla and our mission.

Firefox OS
Firefox OS devices will launch in early 2013 through <a href="%(telefonica_url)s" rel="external">Telefónica</a>, establishing HTML5 as a viable platform for the mobile industry. The Web as the platform will free developers to create groundbreaking new apps that work seamlessly across all devices, spurring a new era of innovation and creativity for the ubiquitous Web.
Firefox OS is Mozilla’s mobile operating system, based entirely on HTML5. Today, 50 percent of 2.3 Billion people who go online do so primarily through a mobile device, and that number is expected to grow. With Firefox OS, Mozilla has set out to develop and a completely open and standards-based Web as a platform for innovation. We've built the technologies and <abbr title="Application Program Interfaces">APIs</abbr> to make the Web a rich and viable option and we are committed to driving forward the adoption of HTML5 as a platform for the mobile industry.
Firefox OS is the first truly open mobile platform. Developers are already embracing HTML5, but so far HTML5 applications on mobile have been held back because they can’t access the device’s underlying capabilities the way that native apps can. Firefox OS overcomes these limitations and provides the necessary <abbr title="Application Program Interfaces">APIs</abbr> to show how it is possible to run an entire device using open standards.
Firefox OS is the first truly open operating system for mobile devices, delivering the same security, privacy, customization and user control that people have come to expect from the Firefox browser. Mozilla has built the technologies and APIs to make the Web a rich and viable platform for the mobile industry. With the support of valued partners from across the mobile ecosystem, Firefox OS phones are now on sale in 10 markets globally (as of mid-November 2013), and Mozilla will continue to advance its development and adoption.

If ads don’t bother you and you don’t mind being followed by trackers and third-party cookies, then the Standard setting should work for you. To get trackers off your tail in Standard mode, use a <a href="%(url)s">Private Browsing</a> window.
If seeing too many ads ruins your day, then the Strict mode is a better fit. This mode will block known third-party trackers and cookies in all Firefox windows.

In 2003, the Mozilla project created the Mozilla Foundation, an <a href="%(foundation)s">independent non-profit organization</a> supported by individual donors and a variety of companies.
In 2013, we launched <a href="%(firefoxos)s">Firefox OS</a> to unleash the full power of the Web on smartphones and once again offer control and choice to a new generation of people coming online.
So when you choose Firefox, we’re choosing you, too. In addition to fighting for your online rights, we also keep corporate powers in check, while working with allies all around the globe to nurture healthy Internet practices.
In addition to organizing community events in Switzerland, I also coordinate events in Germany and Austria, making me one of only a few Mozillians to help pull off events in three different countries — all within a couple of months of each other.
In an effort to give users more control over their Web experiences, we developed the <a href="%(dnt_url)s" rel="external">Do Not Track</a> feature in Firefox. We also became the first browser manufacturer to offer it on multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux and Android. <a href="%(dntfxos_url)s" rel="external">Do Not Track is even available for Firefox OS</a> so that user privacy settings can be controlled on a system-wide level to ensure that every third-party application on a user's device respects their choice.

(in English)
In June 2012 we released an update to <a href="%(mobile_url)s" rel="external">Firefox for Android</a> that we believe is the best browser for Android available. We completely rebuilt and redesigned the product in native UI, resulting in a snappy and dynamic upgrade to mobile browsing that is significantly faster than the Android stock browser. This made Firefox significantly faster on Android and delivered a much better browsing experience to users than the one offered by the device’s stock browser. We also added Do Not Track to Firefox for Android to let users express their intent for privacy, even on mobile and are the first mobile browser to offer Do Not Track. Firefox for Android is a critical part of supporting the open Web. This is a great start, but it is only a start. We want these opportunities to exist at all layers of our Web experience.

is about more than lending a hand. It’s about learning, collaborating and sharing your skills with a global community of Mozillians — coders, organizers, activists and more — who help shape the Web every day.
I started contributing Firefox patches as a teenager in 2008. Four years later, I decided to officially become a Mozilla Rep and have been helping to build the Mozilla Switzerland community ever since.
I support Mozilla because… #mozmanifesto
I support the vision of a better, healthier internet from @mozilla, will you join me?
Is your computer slow? Your browser might be using too much memory. Switch to Firefox today for more speed.
It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
It did this by continuing to release software, such as Firefox and Thunderbird, and expanding to new areas, such as providing <a href="%(grants)s">grants</a> to support accessibility improvements on the Web.
It looks like you’re running an older version of Firefox.

It’s your Web anywhere you go.
It was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market.
I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
I’ve been collaborating with the Mozilla community since 2004, helping with website localization, QA, user support and community marketing. I’ve also helped organize events in Spain and performed IT tasks within the Mozilla Hispano community.
I went to my first local Mozilla event in 2011 and was inspired to do more by all the amazing people I met and got to know. And now, I am the Mozilla Philippines Community Manager.

Moving browsers? We got you.
Moving forward we will continue to focus on building products, technology solutions and educational offerings that incorporate Mozilla values into the Web. Today, Mozilla’s mission remains as important as ever. From Firefox through Firefox OS to our new Mozilla Webmaker educational offering, the goal is empowerment. It’s about unlocking the full creative power of mobile; standing up for user sovereignty, privacy and freedom; and helping millions of people move from using the Web to actively building its future.
MozCafes
MozCamps
MozCamps are regional events that bring together core paid and volunteer Mozilla staff members from all areas of the project for two full days of presentations, discussions, brainstorms, work sprints, hackathons and, of course, a little bit of fun.
Mozilla also celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2013.
Mozilla and Yandex will continue to explore partnerships on a number of fronts, including the customized Yandex edition of the popular Firefox browser and the integration of Yandex search services in other regional builds.
Mozilla believes that the Web is the best platform for innovation, connecting, sharing and for building the world that we want. With Firefox OS, Mozilla is creating an operating system based entirely on open Web standards. HTML5 is an increasingly important technology, which more and more developers are embracing. There is also an HTML5 ecosystem of developers who are already creating applications for desktop web browsers, while many AppStore and Android applications have already been developed in HTML5.

Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.

Mozilla Information Trust Initiative
Mozilla invests in both people and products to further our mission to keep the Web open and to retain our impact on the Internet landscape. We continue to spend a significant majority of our expenses on staffing our technology and development, and recently have increased our spending in marketing new product lines. Over the last few years, Mozilla’s investment focus has been significant in new areas such as our mobile and cloud services products. In particular, the market launch of Firefox OS and significant upgrades to our Firefox for Android browser have advanced our goal of opening the mobile ecosystem for users and developers worldwide.
Mozilla is an open source project with a mission to improve your Internet experience. This is a driving force behind our data privacy practices. <a href="%(link)s">Read More</a>
Mozilla is an open source project with a mission to improve your Internet experience. This is a driving force behind our privacy practices.
Mozilla is an organization that is fundamentally about people and making the Web better for everyone. The Mozilla community is essential to the success of the project. We can’t fight for an open, hackable and transparent Web without people who believe in and support that cause. We have Mozilla communities spanning the world and these remarkable people are responsible for coding, testing, localizing, hosting hackfests and summer code parties, teaching Webmakers, marketing, evangelizing Mozilla products and much more.
Mozilla is mobilized to ensure the protection of the Web and to empower tomorrow’s webmakers and Web users. Today, Mozilla is growing — with more employees, contributors, products and locations — to ensure that the Web remains an open, vibrant ecosystem. Because, the Web is the platform for building the world we want.
Mozilla is mobilizing millions of people to build the world they want. Mobilizing to set the mobile Web free from proprietary platforms and gatekeepers. Mobilizing to empower the world's next two billion Web users. And mobilizing to build a new generation of digital innovators, creators and webmakers.
Mozilla is not a lobbying operation. Notwithstanding, we take firm stands when the welfare of the Web and its users are at stake.
Mozilla is not your average organization. Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla is a mission-driven organization working towards a more healthy internet. The majority of Mozilla Corporation’s revenue is from royalties earned through Firefox web browser search partnerships and distribution deals around the world. You can learn more about how we make money in our <a href="%(link)s">annual financial report</a>.
Mozilla is proudly non-profit and answers to no one but you. That means we're uniquely able to fight for users at a critical moment in the Web's history. Looking forward, we will mobilize millions of people to stand up for privacy, security and online freedom. We will take on new threats to the Web's future — from locked down proprietary platforms, to would-be censors and gatekeepers, to short-sighted government legislation. Together we will set the mobile Web free, reassert the vital importance of privacy and user sovereignty, and join others in building a more Web-literate world.
Sorry! I could not understand.

Mozilla story
Mozilla‘s vision of the Internet is a place where anyone can access information, a place where everyone can hack and tinker; one that has openness, freedom and transparency; where users have control over their personal data and where all minds have the freedom to create and to consume without walls or tight restrictions.
Mozilla was instrumental in the movement to motivate the Web community to act against the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP act. These laws, had they gone into effect, would have given the US government and private businesses incredible censorship powers that would have global ramifications, weaken the Internet's security and discourage innovation and investment worldwide.
Mozilla was one of many organizations that blacked out its websites in opposition to the SOPA/PIPA bills in congress. For the first time, the Web community of more than 15 million people came together to speak against a policy that affected the Web as a whole. This historic protest represented a significant turning point for the Web as a way to engage the electorate and mobilize citizens for change.
Mozilla Websites, Communications &amp; Cookies
Mozilla will continue to contribute to Web standards.
Mozilla will continue to provide an opportunity for people to make their voices heard and to shape their own online lives.
Mozillians
Mozillians are a diverse group of thinkers, builders, educators and hackers with a shared purpose to bring openness, freedom and participation to the Internet. Our collective global effort advanced Firefox OS from concept to phones in stores within two years, hosted 1,600 events in three months to teach the Web, and many more accomplishments. We’re celebrating our journey and the promising path ahead.

Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.
My favorite part of being a Mozillian is the global community. I like to think of us as a “family” where we accept each other openly and are free to speak our minds while we work together.
My goal now is to keep growing our global community through localization (translation), hacking and Webmaker projects. If you’re interested, please get in touch.
My passion is for organizing local Webmaker and WoMoz (Women in Mozilla) community events where I can train others and help them develop their skills. I also help out with the Firefox Student Ambassadors program and Community Building.

On issues such as SOPA/PIPA, CISPA, and more recently, government surveillance revelations, Mozilla has voiced its views, sought to educate users and taken steps to catalyze grassroots action. As with most issues of importance, we believe education, listening and dialogue amongst stakeholders are critical to finding solutions. Mozilla has testified before government bodies and provided input to numerous agencies and NGOs on strengthening the Internet. Our acclaimed Firefox Add-on, Lightbeam, seeks to educate users on matters of privacy in their online lives.

Firefox will support a new Social API that lets developers integrate social services directly into the browser. The Social API will support multiple providers and has endless potential for integrating social networks, e-mail, finance, news and other applications into your Firefox experience. Our first experimental provider is Facebook.

The first Firefox OS devices went on sale in July 2013, so are in the very early stages of market development and user acquisition. Mozilla’s focus is on delivering a superior user experience and getting developers excited, and not on generating revenue from Firefox OS at this time.
The first Firefox OS-powered devices are expected to launch commercially in Latin American markets in early 2013 through Telefónica. We've also announced support for the Firefox OS from global network operators including Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, Smart, Sprint, Telecom Italia and Telenor, so you can expect more device and OS news throughout 2013.
The first is what we call "technical data." This is data about the browser itself, such as the operating system it is running on and information about errors or crashes.

The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.

This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.
These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
The speed you need. The privacy you trust.

This isn’t just an update. This is Firefox Quantum: A brand new Firefox that has been rebuilt from the ground-up to be faster, sleeker, and more powerful than ever.
This is what you’ve been waiting for<br> — the fastest Firefox ever.
This year‘s MozCamps were held in Buenos Aires, Warsaw and Singapore, bringing together more than 300 employees and 600 volunteers.
This year we brought back <a href="%(flicks_url)s" rel="external">Firefox Flicks</a> — a video challenge for aspiring filmmakers, animators and creatives from around the world to produce and submit short films. These films made by Firefox fans, promoted and educated users about the issues that affect their online lives such as privacy and security. Most importantly, these filmmakers shared what makes Firefox different using their own voices. Celebrities and film-industry experts helped select the regional winners from more than 400 submissions from thousands of filmmakers worldwide.

We made Enhanced Tracking Protection because no one should be able to follow you online without your permission. And now you can see just how many data-collecting trackers Firefox has blocked for you — along with other ways our products protect your privacy.
We make our documentation public so that anyone can verify what we say is true, tell us if we need to improve, and have confidence that we aren’t hiding anything.
We make the internet safer, healthier and faster for good.
We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.
We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
We put people in control of their data and online experiences.

This version featured many improvements to the browser, email client and other applications included in the suite, but not many people were using it. After several years of development, <a href="{ $mozilla1 }">{ -brand-name-mozilla } 1.0</a>, the first major version, was released in 2002.
A great internet browser should have the functionality you need, portability across devices, and the privacy you deserve.

<a href="{ $firefox1 }">{ -brand-name-firefox } 1.0</a> was released in 2004 and became a big success — in less than a year, it was downloaded <a href="{ $millions }">over 100 million times</a>.

An ad blocker is a piece of software that can be used to block ads, and they work in two ways. The first way is when an ad blocker blocks the signal from an advertiser’s server, so the ad never shows up on your page. Another way ad blockers work is by blocking out sections of a website that could be ads.

Our codebases are open and auditable. Our development work is open. As an open source project, transparency and openness are an essential part of { -brand-name-mozilla }’s founding principles. Our bi-annual <a href="{ $report }">Transparency Report</a> also demonstrates our commitment to these principles.
We set out these principles below. As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life.
Which means unless you’re running a Windows-based laptop or desktop, you won’t have access to your bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, and other information that modern browsers sync across devices. As { -brand-name-microsoft } has made the move to sunset the { -brand-name-ie } browser, it no longer supports any version for { -brand-name-ios }, and has never been available for { -brand-name-android }.
A security guide to safer logins and passwords
Also in normal browsing mode, you can also turn off some data collection features by digging into the settings to enable the ad blocker and adjust other security features. As far as actual privacy protections in the { -brand-name-opera } browser, it does offer a robust Private mode that allows you to surf the web without the browser tracking your activity.
As far as security goes, { -brand-name-firefox } is solid there as well. Any time you’re in { -brand-name-firefox }, you can right-click in the password field to securely generate a strong password using the Fill Password option. When you save your new password, we will prompt you to save to its built-in password manager, <a { $lockwise }>{ -brand-name-lockwise }</a>. We also serve up users and account holders with another free and useful product called <a { $monitor }>{ -brand-name-monitor }</a> that automatically alerts you if your data is included in a known data breach.
As for customization, our fans will tell you one of the things they love most about our browser is its ability to allow you to move and arrange a majority of the UI elements to best suit your needs. { -brand-name-chrome } allows you to hide certain UI elements but there’s not much allowance, if any, for moving things around based on your preferences. However, it should be noted that both { -brand-name-chrome } and { -brand-name-firefox } make it pretty easy to change your browser’s appearance and theme.
But there’s still a lot to account for in terms of the browser’s privacy protections. Aside from sucking up a lot of computing power, { -brand-name-edge } running on { -brand-name-chromium } has answered a lot of users’ needs for functionality and features. It’s our assessment that { -brand-name-firefox } is still a better choice for most people to use in their daily lives, based not only on functionality but more importantly on our transparency in how we collect user data, what exactly we collect, and what we do with it. Because our parent company is <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-mozilla }</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to internet privacy and freedom, we simply have a different set of priorities when it comes to users’ data.
Keep it safe. No secrets. As the internet grows and changes, { -brand-name-firefox } continues to focus on your right to privacy — we call it the <a { $attrs }>Personal Data Promise</a>: Take less. Your data, your web activity, your life online is protected with { -brand-name-firefox }.

At { -brand-name-firefox }, we have a huge number of dedicated users who appreciate our steadfast dedication to online privacy.

It also has an integrated feature called <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-firefox-monitor }</a> that automatically notifies you if your password has been breached or needs to be updated. In addition to these protections, { -brand-name-firefox }'s Private Browsing mode automatically deletes your browsing information such as history and cookies, leaving no trace after you finish your session.

Not having to manually send the tab from one device to the other is convenient when you want to do something like continue reading an article you didn’t finish earlier. If you have a { -brand-name-firefox } account, you can manually send an open tab on your desktop to your mobile device or vice versa. With { -brand-name-chrome }, it’s done automatically if you’ve chosen that setting in your preferences. But there could be times where automatic syncing might not be ideal if there’s a chance multiple users are browsing while signed in to your { -brand-name-google } account. Both { -brand-name-chrome } and { -brand-name-firefox } also allow you to sync things like passwords, bookmarks, and open tabs across all your devices.
Both { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-opera } are compatible across every platform including { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac }, { -brand-name-linux }, { -brand-name-android } and { -brand-name-ios }. { -brand-name-firefox } account holders can easily sync their bookmarks, passwords, open tabs, and browsing history across all their signed into devices. The same is true for { -brand-name-opera } users with an account. However, many sites, especially old sites that haven’t been updated in years, block the latest version of { -brand-name-opera } entirely. So if visiting places like your Ex’s old blog is important, take heed, you may not be able to access some of the dustier corners of the internet if you use { -brand-name-opera }.

Both browsers are relatively equal in terms of data encryption. However, if online privacy and transparency are important to you, then { -brand-name-firefox } is clearly a better choice here.
Both browsers have a lot of crossover features, as well as some unique functions. Eventually, you’ll discover which one is more suited to your needs. It’s worth mentioning, if you take a lot of screenshots, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without this handy feature that’s built right into { -brand-name-firefox }. But if you’re just looking for a fast, private browser for surfing and shopping, then you may want to give { -brand-name-firefox } a try — especially if you’ve been exclusively using { -brand-name-safari } because it came preloaded as the default browser on your computer.

{ -brand-name-brave } also supports the huge library of extensions available in the { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome } web store and offers a variety of in-browser features like the aforementioned { -brand-name-brave } Rewards program, and support for downloading torrents in the browser.
{ -brand-name-brave } differentiates itself from the other { -brand-name-chromium } browsers by focusing on user privacy — specifically by blocking trackers, scripts, and ads by default. So when you use the { -brand-name-brave } browser, the areas of a website that would normally display ads appear as blank spaces. In some instances, pages don’t load properly, which will require you to either choose a different browser or flip the ‘Shields Up’ setting to ‘Shields Down’ which turns off the privacy and security protection.
{ -brand-name-brave }’s advertising replacement idea is a twist on the current model of paid ad placement and paid search. But again, some busy Internet users will probably not want to get too involved with the management of micro payments to sites in exchange for their time and attention.

Data Privacy Principles
Data Privacy Principles
Data security is complicated — or at least it should be. Which is why we take the extra steps to classify the data we have, maintain rules for how we store and protect each type, and never stop iterating on our processes. We prioritize your privacy. We invest in it. We’re committed to it. We even teach other companies how to do it.

Faster Performance
Fast for good.
Fast-forward to today, the competitive landscape for browsers has changed with many people beginning to question just what is happening to their online data such as browsing history, passwords, and other sensitive information. A lot has changed since 2008 when { -brand-name-chrome } came onto the scene. At { -brand-name-firefox }, we’ve been heads down, working to redesign our interface and provide users with an ever growing number of privacy and performance enhancements as well as plenty of handy browser tools.

For practical purposes, there’s obviously really nothing preventing you from using both browsers—{ -brand-name-firefox } for those moments in life when privacy really matters, and { -brand-name-chrome } if you’re still invested in the { -brand-name-google } ecosystem. Yet with the growing number of incursions into our personal data, { -brand-name-firefox } may prove to be the right choice in the long run for those of us who value protecting our personal privacy online.

If ads don’t bother you and you don’t mind being followed by trackers and third-party cookies, then the Standard setting should work for you. To get trackers off your tail in Standard mode, use a <a href="{ $url }">Private Browsing</a> window.
The only problem with this is when you have multiple tabs open from the same website, so you see the same favicon across your tabs. If having tons of open tabs is your thing, then it really comes down to your UI preference. { -brand-name-firefox } features a horizontal scroll on all your open tabs rather than shrinking them smaller and smaller with each new one. { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome } prefers to shrink them down so just the favicon is visible.
If seeing too many ads ruins your day, then the Strict mode is a better fit. This mode will block known third-party trackers and cookies in all { -brand-name-firefox } windows.
If we don’t know how the browser is performing or which features people use, we can’t make it better and deliver the great product you want. We’ve invested in building data collection and analysis tools that allow us to make smart decisions about our product while respecting people’s privacy.
If you choose to use { -brand-name-safari }, you’re in safe hands as long as you’re using an { -brand-name-apple } device. But { -brand-name-safari } only works on { -brand-name-apple } devices, whereas { -brand-name-firefox } works on { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac }, { -brand-name-ios }, { -brand-name-android } and { -brand-name-linux }. So no matter what operating system you choose, { -brand-name-firefox } has you covered with our security and privacy protections.
If you have a { -brand-name-firefox-account }, you can also see how we’re helping you protect your personal info and passwords.
If you haven’t moved on from using { -brand-name-ie }, the security risk factor alone should be enough to convince you. <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-microsoft }’s own security chief has warned</a> millions of people who continue to use { -brand-name-ie } as their main web browser that they are placing themselves in “peril.”
Please check your inbox or your spam filter for an email from us. If you haven’t previously confirmed a subscription to a { -brand-name-mozilla }-related newsletter, you may have to do so.
If your web browser uses too much memory, switch to { -brand-name-firefox }.
If you still kinda like { -brand-name-facebook } but don’t trust them, then try the { -brand-name-facebook-container } extension by { -brand-name-firefox } and make it harder for them to track you around the web.

If you use a Mac or have an { -brand-name-iphone }, chances are you’re familiar with the { -brand-name-safari } web browser. The fact that it’s pre-installed as the default browser for { -brand-name-apple } product users definitely gives it an early advantage, but { -brand-name-firefox } has its own set of useful features that make it an attractive alternative. Here we’ll explore the main differences between our browser and { -brand-name-safari } in terms of privacy, utility, and portability between devices.
If you want to join us in our mission, please <a href="{ $contribute }">get involved</a>.
If you want to know what’s happening around { -brand-name-nightly } and its community, reading our <a href="{ $blog }">blog</a> and following us on <a href="{ $twitter }">{ -brand-name-twitter }</a> are good starting points!
If you want to make a correction to your information, or you have any questions about our privacy policies, please get in touch with:

I’m okay with { -brand-name-mozilla } handling my info as explained in <a href="{ $url }">this Privacy Notice</a>
In 2003, the { -brand-name-mozilla } project created the { -brand-name-mozilla-foundation }, an <a href="{ $foundation }">independent non-profit organization</a> supported by individual donors and a variety of companies.
It was faster for loading sites, took up minimal screen space and offered an undeniably simple user interface. In 2008, { -brand-name-google } introduced { -brand-name-chrome }, and its impact as an innovation in browser technology was immediate.
In 2013, we launched <a href="{ $firefoxos }">{ -brand-name-firefox-os }</a> to unleash the full power of the web on smartphones and once again offer control and choice to a new generation of people coming online.

In addition to fighting for your online rights, we also keep corporate powers in check, while working with allies all around the globe to nurture healthy Internet practices. So when you choose { -brand-name-firefox }, we’re choosing you, too.
In addition to privacy protection, which largely takes place in the background of the browser, another key ingredient to a well-made browser is the actual user interface and functionality. Almost all seven browsers are equal when it comes to tab browsing, bookmark management, auto-completion, proofreading and extensions. { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-edge } and { -brand-name-opera } also offer a quick screenshot function that proves to be quite handy and is definitely something you notice is missing when you switch over to a browser without it.

Touch is light on features but it’s designed to use on the go with only one hand. The Mini version aims at lowering data usage and increased speeds on slow connections by downgrading images and stripping away content. In addition to the regular mobile app, { -brand-name-opera } has two other mobile versions of its browser: Touch and Mini.
In addition to the regular set of features you’d expect in a browser, such as tabbed browsing and private browsing, { -brand-name-safari } has some unexpected features as well. For instance, if a user were to right-click a word anywhere on a page inside { -brand-name-safari }, then click Look Up, they’d get a dictionary definition plus entries from the thesaurus, { -brand-name-app-store }, movies and more. { -brand-name-safari }’s Parental Controls are easy to customize, allowing the adults to breathe a little easier when the kids begin to get curious about the internet.
In { -brand-name-firefox }, Private Browsing mode automatically erases your browsing information like passwords, cookies, and history, leaving no trace after you close out the session. { -brand-name-edge } on the other hand, actually records browsing history in their private mode (called “InPrivate”) and it’s a relatively easy task for someone to reconstruct your full browsing history, regardless of whether your browsing was done in regular or InPrivate mode.

Install { -brand-name-firefox } as a { -brand-name-linux } app: going this route takes a few more steps, but it’s worth it. When you install the { -brand-name-firefox } browser as a { -brand-name-linux } app, you get the { -brand-name-firefox } desktop browser and all the benefits that come with, including Enhanced Tracking Protection, a built-in password manager, access to thousands of add-ons (including UBlock Origin ad blocker), and themes to customize the look of your browser. <a { $url }>Learn more about installing { -brand-name-firefox } desktop browser for { -brand-name-chromebook }.</a>

Installing the <a href="{ $fbcontainer }">extension</a> is easy and, once activated, will open { -brand-name-facebook } in a blue tab each time you use it. Use and enjoy { -brand-name-facebook } normally. { -brand-name-facebook } will still be able to send you advertising and recommendations on their site, but it will be much harder for { -brand-name-facebook } to use your activity collected <strong>off { -brand-name-facebook }</strong> to send you ads and other targeted messages.
In terms of actual precious RAM usage, the { -brand-name-brave } browser is much heavier than { -brand-name-firefox }. { -brand-name-brave } comes pre-loaded with various features and “add-ons” which can be attributed to its usage of more RAM. { -brand-name-firefox }, on the other hand, lets you decide which add-ons and extensions you want to bolt on.
In terms of features, both { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-chrome } offer a large library of extensions and plug-ins, with { -brand-name-chrome }’s catalog vastly outnumbering any other browser while nicely integrating with other { -brand-name-google } services, like Gmail and { -brand-name-google } Docs.
In terms of head to head utility, { -brand-name-opera } and { -brand-name-firefox } are close competitors. { -brand-name-opera } may have an advantage in one aspect with its compatibility with and access to { -brand-name-chrome }’s huge extension library. But one significant factor to consider is the fact that { -brand-name-opera }, because it’s built on { -brand-name-chromium }, is a processor-hungry browser with its RAM consumption comparable to { -brand-name-chrome }, which is known for its high CPU usage.

In the end, it just boils down to what you value in your browser. If you’re integrated with the { -brand-name-apple } ecosystem, { -brand-name-safari } is still a great choice. But if you value having the latest and greatest privacy protections and being able to work across multiple operating systems, we think { -brand-name-firefox } is your best bet. { -brand-name-firefox } is also a solid option as a secondary browser for those { -brand-name-apple }-exclusive users who may want to switch into a different browser for those online moments that call for extra layers of privacy protection.

It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details.

It did this by continuing to release software, such as { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-thunderbird }, and expanding to new areas, such as providing <a href="{ $grants }">grants</a> to support accessibility improvements on the web.

Like { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-opera } delivers a scrolling tab experience, which means that when you open more tabs than will fit on screen, it scrolls them off screen instead of just continuously shrinking them down. Also both { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-opera } have a screenshot tool that lets you capture a snapshot of your screen or part of the page. However, the { -brand-name-opera } tool doesn’t give you the ability to create one huge capture of the whole webpage, only the visible portion.
And since our platform is open-source, there’s a vast selection adding a wealth of functionality. Like { -brand-name-safari }, { -brand-name-firefox } encourages its enthusiastic developer community to create <a { $attrs }>add-ons and extensions</a> to the browser.
Like { -brand-name-safari }, we at { -brand-name-firefox } have made a point of focusing on privacy and security. But unlike { -brand-name-safari }, we’ve been standing on the privacy soap box for a long time. In fact, { -brand-name-mozilla } (our parent company) was one of the first voices in the tech community to sound the alarm for online privacy.

And with a free { -brand-name-firefox } account you also get access to all your settings and <a { $products }>our other { -brand-name-firefox } products</a> on any device simply by signing in.

In a head-to-head comparison, it’s really no contest at all. { -brand-name-firefox } is hands down the winner across all assessment categories.

Our personal data is collected every time we access the web, and it's not easy to find out what happens with it. Misinformation is making it harder for us to find the truth. Web-connected devices are pushed to market without meeting minimum security standards. The non-profit { -brand-name-mozilla-foundation } fights to make the internet safe, open and accessible to all. <strong>Will you donate today?</strong>
Our Private Browsing mode blocks trackers and erases your passwords, cookies and history every time you close it. But you can also experience our advanced privacy features even in regular browsing mode. This prevents things like cross-site trackers from following you as you jump around the web. Why do they need to know what you look up on WebMD anyway? With the latest edition of { -brand-name-firefox }, enhanced tracking prevention is turned on by default. Also, with { -brand-name-facebook } being caught out almost daily for privacy problems, our <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-facebook-container }</a> extension makes a lot of sense. It makes it harder for { -brand-name-facebook } to track you around the web — similar to what { -brand-name-safari } does to prevent cross-site tracking — but { -brand-name-firefox } actually isolates your { -brand-name-facebook } session into a separate container blocking { -brand-name-facebook } from tracking what you do on other websites.

Out of the gate, { -brand-name-firefox } has more features and integrations built into the browser and readily available on download. And while both browsers have a tremendous number of add-ons and extensions available, { -brand-name-edge }’s compatibility with { -brand-name-google }’s { -brand-name-chromium } platform gives it the advantage in terms of sheer numbers.
Overall Assessment
Overall, { -brand-name-brave } is a fast and secure browser that will have particular appeal to cryptocurrency users. But for the vast majority of internet citizens, { -brand-name-firefox } remains a better and simpler solution.
There are, however, some serious privacy concerns as well as an issue with it using a lot of processing power. Overall, { -brand-name-opera } is a solid browser, with a clean interface and a lot of useful features available. Although { -brand-name-opera } has some really terrific ease of use features, we still believe { -brand-name-firefox } remains a superior browser based on performance and with a transparent user-privacy stance and strict privacy protections.
Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality. We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. We do so now.

Privacy comes first
Privacy first
Privacy has become a white hot topic for tech companies as they realize more and more people are feeling vulnerable to things like data breaches, ad trackers and hackers. But when it comes down to the real tools people use to navigate the actual interwebs, is it all talk or are they actually taking action to keep your data secure?

Really the only reasons to use { -brand-name-ie } are for developers to test what their sites look like on an older browser or if a company has business-critical apps that only work with the { -brand-name-ie } browser.

Since { -brand-name-edge } has moved to the processor intensive { -brand-name-chromium } platform, you can expect it to run a little slower, especially if you have multiple programs running at once. However, with { -brand-name-chromium } platform comes a massive library of extensions as well as a decent level of UI customization that { -brand-name-edge } did not have before its move to { -brand-name-chromium }.
Since { -brand-name-safari } is { -brand-name-apple }’s proprietary web browser, its iCloud syncing works exclusively with { -brand-name-apple } products. This can be somewhat limiting if, for example, you’re both an { -brand-name-android } user and an { -brand-name-iphone } user or if you have a { -brand-name-windows } based PC for work but use an { -brand-name-iphone } as your personal device.
Since your browser is your gateway to the internet, speed, security, privacy and utility are paramount. But at a time when online ads seem to follow us everywhere and data breaches are a fixture of news headlines, a lot of people are starting to demand more privacy and respect from their browser. In recent years, { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome } has been the browser of choice for many.

So is your browser the best one for what you do online? The right browser can make a big difference in how you experience the web. So, without further ado, let’s compare { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome }, { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-safari }, { -brand-name-opera }, { -brand-name-brave }, { -brand-name-microsoft } { -brand-name-ie } and { -brand-name-edge } — and see which best suits your needs.
So is your browser the best one for what you do online? The right browser can make a big difference in how you experience the web. So, without further ado, let’s compare { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome }, { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-safari }, { -brand-name-opera }, { -brand-name-microsoft } { -brand-name-ie } and { -brand-name-edge } — and see which best suits your needs.
So many ads, so little patience… It’s time to stop the madness.
So many browser options, but there’s only one that works best for your needs. The best browser for you should offer both speed and privacy protection.
Some Foundation activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products—are conducted primarily through the { -brand-name-mozilla-foundation }’s wholly owned subsidiary, the { -brand-name-mozilla-corporation }.
Something went wrong
Some websites and ads attach hidden trackers that collect your browsing info long after you’ve left. Only { -brand-name-firefox } Private Browsing has tracking protection to block them automatically.

So what’s the solution if your company is running legacy apps that only work on { -brand-name-ie }? Our best advice is, don’t mix business with pleasure. We actually recommend use of the <a { $attrs }>Legacy Browser Support extension</a> for { -brand-name-windows }. This extension lets users automatically open a predefined set of URLs in { -brand-name-ie } and switch back to { -brand-name-firefox } when navigating to a different domain.
Our best advice for you personally is, don’t mix business with pleasure. Then, if you need to do things like check your personal email or shop online, you can just switch over to the more secure browser. Your online privacy and security are not worth risking because you (or your company) have a hard time breaking an old habit. So what’s the solution if your company is running outdated apps that only work on { -brand-name-ie }? The simple thing to do is download and use a more secure browser like { -brand-name-firefox }. The bottom line is, if { -brand-name-microsoft } is warning people not to use { -brand-name-ie }, don’t use it. We make { -brand-name-firefox } with security and privacy features like <a { $lockwise }>{ -brand-name-lockwise }</a>, our password manager, private browsing and lots of other add-ons that help us make the web safer for you. Also, our <a { $privacy }>Privacy Policy</a> is straightforward: we tell you what we know about you, and why we collect that information. All of these things obviously go beyond what { -brand-name-ie } offers, and even what other modern browsers like { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome } and { -brand-name-microsoft } { -brand-name-edge } offer.
So you’ve got a { -brand-name-chromebook } — now it’s time to get the independent, automatically private { -brand-name-firefox-browser } to protect your personal data.

That sneaky little button
That’s why everything we make and do honors our Personal Data Promise
The ability to sync your passwords, extensions, form data, add-ons and other preferences across all your devices and operating systems is a feature that’s been available for years with { -brand-name-firefox }. The synced data is also encrypted, which means no one can access it from the outside.
The ad blocker – a secret weapon against annoying ads.
The ad blocker – a secret weapon against annoying ads.
The average person has 130 online accounts. { -brand-name-firefox } for mobile remembers and stores your passwords safely across synced devices, so you can log in with just one click.
The average person sees an average of 4,000 ads a day. If you think that’s too many, an ad blocker is your new best friend.
The best { -brand-name-firefox } ever
The bottom line is that even though { -brand-name-brave }’s revenue model with the Basic Attention Tokens may be too complex for a lot of users, overall both { -brand-name-brave } and { -brand-name-firefox } browsers offer a variety of ways to enjoy a safe and private browsing experience.
The bottom line is that while we suggest using { -brand-name-firefox }, the best browser for you ultimately will be the one that fits your individual needs with extension support, browsing tools customization, speed, privacy and security.
Web Extension
Allowed HTML: {0}
The { -brand-name-brave } browser, like so many others, is built on the open-source { -brand-name-chromium } code by { -brand-name-google }. Open-source means anyone can use the source code and piggy-back on top of it to build whatever they want — like the <a { $opera }>{ -brand-name-opera }</a> and <a { $edge }>{ -brand-name-edge }</a> browsers. But it doesn’t mean that all { -brand-name-chromium }-based browsers are equal or are themselves open source.
The { -brand-name-facebook-container } Extension is currently only available for { -brand-name-firefox } for Desktop.
The { -brand-name-facebook-container } Extension is not available on mobile devices.
The { -brand-name-firefox } app for <a { $ios }>{ -brand-name-ios }</a> and <a { $android }>{ -brand-name-android }</a> is one of the fastest browsers available and also has solid security and anti-tracking features — a huge plus if you’re constantly bouncing between a laptop and mobile devices.
The { -brand-name-firefox } browser also gives users the ability to sign up for a free <a { $accounts }>{ -brand-name-firefox-account }</a>. Having a { -brand-name-firefox } account is the key to unlocking syncing across devices, plus you get the added benefit of products like <a { $monitor }>{ -brand-name-firefox-monitor }</a> which monitors your email addresses and alerts you if any of your information has been involved in any known <a { $breaches }>data breaches</a>.
The { -brand-name-firefox-browser } and { -brand-name-opera } are two of the earliest browsers on the scene still releasing frequent updates. While { -brand-name-opera } has not reached the same level of user adoption as { -brand-name-firefox } or { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome }, it’s maintained a relatively stable and loyal base over a sustained period of time. In this review, we’ll compare the { -brand-name-opera } browser with our { -brand-name-firefox } browser in terms of security and privacy, utility, and portability to help you choose which browser might be the best fit for you.
The { -brand-name-firefox } browser collects so little data about you, we don’t even require your email address. But when you use it to create a { -brand-name-firefox } account, we can protect your privacy across more of your online life.

The { -brand-name-mozilla } Manifesto
The { -brand-name-mozilla } Manifesto Addendum
The { -brand-name-mozilla } project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the { -brand-name-mozilla } { -brand-name-firefox } web browser.
The { -brand-name-mozilla } project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the internet experience better for all of us.
The { -brand-name-mozilla } project was <a href="{ $coderush }">created in 1998</a> with the <a href="{ $sourcerelease }">release of the { -brand-name-netscape } browser suite source code</a>.
The browser is just the beginning
The community has shown that commercial companies can benefit by collaborating in open source projects and that great end user products can be produced as open source software.

The effectiveness of the internet as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.
This is data about the browser itself, such as the operating system it is running on and information about errors or crashes. The first is what we call “technical data.”
The first thing to point out about portability is that not all browsers run on all operating systems. While { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-chrome } and { -brand-name-opera } work on all major systems and are easy to install, { -brand-name-ie }, { -brand-name-edge } and { -brand-name-safari } only work on { -brand-name-microsoft } and Apple’s own systems. The mobile version of { -brand-name-safari } is pre-installed on Apple’s mobile devices, and most { -brand-name-android } devices come with a pre-installed browser modified by the manufacturer for the device. { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-chrome }, { -brand-name-edge } and { -brand-name-opera } can easily be installed and even used side by side.

The following five principles stem from the <a href="{ $link }">{ -brand-name-mozilla } Manifesto</a> and inform how we:
The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from { -brand-name-mozilla } and { -brand-name-firefox }:
WebXR Allowed
The future is being decided online. Help { -brand-name-mozilla } fight for a web for all of us.
The future is full of challenges and opportunities equal to those of our past.
The goals for the Manifesto are to:

The History of Web Browsers
The intended recipient of the email must have consented.
The intended recipient of the email or SMS must have consented.
The Internet as a whole is largely paid for by display advertisements, which keeps the actual content you want to view free. { -brand-name-brave } has attempted to upend this model by encouraging its users to opt into { -brand-name-brave }’s own reward system, which in reality, is its own ad platform. Once a user has opted-in, { -brand-name-brave } will display what they call “privacy-respecting ads” for which you can view and earn what they call a Basic Attention Token a.k.a. a BAT. From this point { -brand-name-brave } users can choose to spend their BATs on supporting the sites or individual contributors they love, who in turn can convert the BATs into actual currency.
The internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.

The internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.
The internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.
The internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
The internet keeps finding new ways to poach your personal data. { -brand-name-firefox } is the only browser with a mission of finding new ways to protect you.
The internet must enrich the lives of individual human beings.

It also includes valuable information such as the font source, weight, style and more. The new fonts panel in { -brand-name-firefox-devtools } gives developers quick access to all of the information they need about the fonts being used in an element.

The non-profit behind { -brand-name-firefox } is fighting for a healthy internet for all.
The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and collaboration resource we have ever seen. It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress. It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing people everywhere.
The passwords and credentials you save in { -brand-name-firefox-lockwise } are encrypted on all your devices, so not even we can see them.

There are a few security features in { -brand-name-brave } worth highlighting, such as its automatic HTTPS connection upgrades (which { -brand-name-firefox } also offers by <a { $extension }>extension</a>). { -brand-name-brave } and { -brand-name-firefox } both offer users a native <a { $lockwise }>password manager</a> and the ability to check their security statistics anytime. { -brand-name-brave } displays stats like the number of trackers it has blocked whenever you open a new tab. { -brand-name-firefox } displays similar information when you view <a { $privacy }>your privacy report</a> which can be accessed anytime by clicking the shield in the address bar.
There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the { -brand-name-mozilla } Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that { -brand-name-mozilla } participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the { -brand-name-mozilla } project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use { -brand-name-mozilla } { -brand-name-firefox } and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
There are two categories of data that we collect by default in our release version of { -brand-name-firefox }.

There’s no debate that { -brand-name-opera } is a feature-packed browser with a clean user interface and strong customization options. Because { -brand-name-opera } is built on { -brand-name-chromium }, it can take advantage of most of { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome }’s vast extension library. { -brand-name-firefox } also features a large <a { $attrs }>extension library to browse</a>, but not quite as large as { -brand-name-chrome }’s.
There’s no guarantee that the internet will remain open or enjoyable or safe.
Welcome to an all-new %s
Our business doesn’t depend on secretly abusing your trust. There’s no hidden agenda here. Our <a href="{ $privacy }">Privacy Notice</a> is actually readable. Anyone in the world can attend our <a href="{ $meetings }">weekly company meetings</a>. If you want to dig into every datapoint we collect, our code is open. And so are we.
There’s no need to settle. Change up the new tab page, search bar, bookmarks and more to explore the internet the way you want.
There was a time not so long ago where { -brand-name-ie } was the most popular and widely used browser in the world. Times have changed and so has technology, but unfortunately { -brand-name-ie } has pretty much stayed the same. { -brand-name-microsoft } itself openly implores users to stop using { -brand-name-ie } and instead switch to their newer { -brand-name-chromium }-based { -brand-name-edge } browser.
These ads might be loud video ads, ads that follow you around the web, trackers, third-party cookies, and more. Click on this list (or ad blockers that are approved for your browser) and see which fits your needs. To use an ad blocker, you can search for ad blocker add-ons that are available in your browser. <a href="{ $firefox }">{ -brand-name-firefox }</a>, for example, has <a href="{ $addons }">this list of approved ad blocker add-ons</a>.
These are the principles that guide our mission to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the web.
For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed. The second is what we call “interaction data.” This is data about an individual’s engagement with { -brand-name-firefox }, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers.
These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The { -brand-name-mozilla-foundation } is committed to advancing the principles set out in the { -brand-name-mozilla } Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the internet an ever better place for everyone.
The standard { -brand-name-firefox } browser — fast and private. If you’re not sure which { -brand-name-firefox } to choose, choose this.

What’s blocked by standard tracking protection
Using a browser that blocks third-party trackers isn’t just important for privacy — it usually means it runs much faster, too. Most trackers are just scripts that run in the background on a number of websites. You can’t see them, but you can feel them slowing down your browser. If you’re not familiar with cryptominers, here’s an example of how they can affect you: maybe you’ve experienced your computer suddenly running hotter or the battery depleting faster than normal. That’s often the byproduct of cryptominers creeping around on your device. As of version 67 of { -brand-name-firefox }, fingerprinting and cryptominers are also blocked.
Using the web as the platform, we build open, innovative technologies that allow developers to work free of closed, corporate ecosystems and create faster, safer web experiences for us all.

Welcome to your new favorite browser. Get the latest features, fast performance, and the development tools you need to build for the open web.
Our powerful browser reduces lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster, leaner browsing. We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now { -brand-name-firefox } is bringing better performance to online gaming.
Well, it seems like you really have my back on this privacy stuff.
We make a point of knowing less about you
That's why we collect so little info about users and are transparent about how we use that info. We make { -brand-name-firefox } for people like you, who care deeply about personal privacy and security. It's hard to know how { -brand-name-opera } is operating from a privacy perspective. While there are robust privacy features, how they themselves collect and share your data is murky. { -brand-name-firefox } remains consistent in what we say and what we do in protecting your privacy.
We make our documentation public so that anyone can verify what we say is true, tell us if we need to improve, and have confidence that we aren’t hiding anything.
We make the internet safer, healthier and faster for good.
For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="{ $link }">studies</a>. This helps us answer specific questions to improve { -brand-name-firefox }, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.
We only collect the data we need to make the best products.

We created this extension because we believe that you should have easy-to-use tools that help you manage your privacy and security. We’re backed by <a href="{ $mozilla }">{ -brand-name-mozilla }</a>, the not-for-profit organization that puts people over profit to give everyone more power online.

We’re obsessed with protecting your privacy. That’s why we’ve made { -brand-name-firefox } Private Browsing more powerful than the others.

We think it’s fair to say { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-chrome } are really neck and neck in terms of portability and utility, with { -brand-name-chrome } having a slight edge in utility because of its huge library of extensions and add-on features. But in terms of Privacy, { -brand-name-firefox } wins the day with our commitment to preserving our users’ online data and providing free baked-in services like password managers that also alert you if there happens to be a data breach involving your credentials.
We’ve also recently restated our commitment to privacy and transparency regarding user data in our most recent <a { $attrs }>Privacy Notice</a> that states, “At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.”

Which browser is best at keeping things confidential?
Which browser would you like to download?
Which version would you like?
While a { -brand-name-chromebook } already has { -brand-name-chrome } installed, downloading and using { -brand-name-firefox } as your go-to browser provides you with a few benefits:
While { -brand-name-chrome } gets the nod with add-ons and extensions, { -brand-name-firefox } has a nicely curated set of built-in features, such as the incredibly handy screen capture tool, and reading mode feature which strips away everything from the page except the text from the article you’re reading.
When you open a website with pop-up windows, you will see a dialog that lets you choose to block pop-up windows.
While { -brand-name-chrome } proves to be a safe web browser, its privacy record is questionable. { -brand-name-google } actually collects a disturbingly large amount of data from its users including location, search history and site visits. { -brand-name-google } makes its case for data collection saying it’s doing it to improve its services – like helping you find a sweater or a coffee shop like the one you previously bought or visited. However, others might disagree, making the point that { -brand-name-google } is actually gathering an unprecedented amount of data for its own marketing purposes. They tout that they’re keeping your information private from hackers, but that’s beside the point. { -brand-name-google } itself runs the world’s largest advertising network, thanks in large part to data they harvest from their users.
While { -brand-name-microsoft }’s { -brand-name-ie } still comes pre-installed on most Windows-based PCs, clearly { -brand-name-microsoft } would prefer you to use their { -brand-name-edge } browser, which is set as the default when you purchase.

With { -brand-name-windows } 10, { -brand-name-microsoft } introduced its { -brand-name-edge } browser to compete with { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-chrome } making it the default browser pre-installed on millions of PCs sold. Even so, users were slow to adopt it and { -brand-name-microsoft } eventually announced plans to relaunch { -brand-name-edge } as a { -brand-name-chromium }-based browser ({ -brand-name-chromium } of course being { -brand-name-google }’s Open Source browser project).
With install packages and a wide expansion of group policies and features, deployment is faster and more flexible than ever — and a breeze in { -brand-name-windows } and { -brand-name-mac } environments.

Both of these projects are part of our efforts to bridge the digital speech divide. Voice recognition technologies bring a human dimension to our devices, but developers need an enormous amount of voice data to build them. Currently, most of that data is expensive and proprietary. We want to make voice data freely and publicly available, and make sure the data represents the diversity of real people. Together we can make voice recognition better for everyone.

Firefox Affiliates allows you to build banners and place them on your Facebook profile to encourage visitors to download Firefox. When a visitor to your page or status update clicks on a banner and visits the Firefox download page, you get credit for that click. Affiliates who get a lot of clicks through their profile will be featured on our leaderboard and be elegible for fun stuff like Firefox T-shirts. While we do send out prizes and gifts to our Affiliates from time to time, Firefox Affiliates does not offer monetary rewards for hosting Firefox banners.

Firefox Affiliates allows you to build banners and place them on your Facebook profile to encourage visitors to download Firefox. When a visitor to your page or status update clicks on a banner and visits the Firefox download page, you get credit for that click. While we do send out prizes and gifts to our Affiliates from time to time, Firefox Affiliates does not offer monetary rewards for hosting Firefox banners. Affiliates who get a lot of clicks through their profile will be featured on our leaderboard and be eligible for fun stuff like Firefox T-shirts and, if you opt in, we may feature your banner in a paid-ad on the Facebook ad network.

Launched
“When first starting on Thimble I had little to no experience/knowledge of JavaScript. It took me a while to get my bearings. As I started working on this project I had many hurdles to cross. But with the help of the core team I was able to slowly cross those hurdles. I still have lots to learn, but I'm happy with the progress so far!”

Most speech databases are trained with an overrepresentation of certain demographics which results in a bias towards <articleLink>male and middle class</articleLink>. Accents and dialects that tend to be under-represented in training data sets are typically associated with groups of people who are already marginalised. Many machines also struggle to understand female voices. This is why in our voice database we want variety!

Mozilla doesn’t pick or favor any one language over another. Instead, Common Voice is a purely community-driven initiative, but it takes <multilangLink>several steps to add a new language</multilangLink> and begin collecting voice donations. First, the Common Voice website needs to be translated so community members can access the contributor experience in their own language. Next, we need a large collection of copyright-free sentences for people to read outloud. Once both of those requirements are satisfied a language is “launched” on Common Voice for people to start recording their voice and validating others donations. If you want to help launch a new language, head over to our <sentenceCollectorLink>sentence collection tool</sentenceCollectorLink> to get started.

Mozilla is dedicated to keeping the web open and accessible for everyone. To do it we need to empower web creators through projects like Common Voice. As voice technologies proliferate beyond niche applications, we believe they must serve all users equally well. We see a need to include more languages, accents and demographics when building and testing voice technologies. Mozilla wants to see a healthy, vibrant internet. That means giving new creators access to voice data so they can build new, extraordinary projects. Common Voice will be a public resource that will help Mozilla teams and developers around the world.

Speech is often the most natural way we communicate with each other and voice technologies are bringing that convenience to our computers and mobile devices. We want to empower developers to build amazing voice recognition applications like real-time translators and voice-enabled digital assistants. But right now most of the voice data required to build these kinds of apps is expensive and proprietary. We hope the Common Voice dataset will give developers what they need to innovate and make speech technology available in their own language. To make voice recognition even more universal, we're collecting voice samples in widely spoken languages as well as those with a smaller population of speakers often underserved by commercial speech recognition services. Publishing a diverse dataset of voices will empower developers, entrepreneurs, and entire speech communities to address this gap themselves.

The Common Voice dataset complements Mozilla’s open source voice recognition engine Deep Speech. The first version of Deep Speech was released in November 2017 and has continued to evolve ever since. Together with the Common Voice dataset, we believe this open source voice recognition technology should be available to everybody. It’s our hope these technologies will enable developers to build a wave of innovative products and services.
(for example, &quot;John Smith&quot;).

The Common Voice Dataset contains hundreds of thousands of voice samples that help developers build voice recognition tools.
For this key, you have both the public and the secret part. You may use it as a personal key. If this key was given to you by someone else, then don't use it as a personal key.

All voice clips in the dataset are scrubbed of personally identifying information. The Common Voice dataset is an open and publicly available resource that can be used to train a wide variety of speech-enabled applications. To protect the security of our contributors, we ask everyone who downloads the Common Voice dataset to respect contributors’ privacy. When you download the dataset, you agree to not attempt to determine the identity of any contributor. That means you cannot try to link information in the dataset to a contributor’s personal information. You may, however, use the dataset to train speech recognition, speaker recognition, or other applications, by, for instance, linking information in the dataset to other information already in the dataset.

The multi-language version of the Common Voice dataset is currently undergoing community supported bundling and cleaning. If you would like to help us bring Common Voice to new languages, go check out the <sentenceCollectorLink>Sentence Collection Tool</sentenceCollectorLink> for adding new sentences to the dataset, and Mozilla <pontoonLink>Pontoon</pontoonLink> for translating the website itself. New languages are added to Common Voice for voice contribution when 5000 approved sentences have been collected.

To make the Common Voice dataset as useful as possible we have decided to only allow source text that is available under a Creative Commons (CC0) license. Using the CC0 standard means its more difficult to find and collect source text, but allows anyone to use the resulting voice data without usage restrictions or authorization from Mozilla. Ultimately, we want to make the multi-language dataset as useful as possible to everyone, including researchers, universities, startups, governments, social purpose organizations, and hobbyists.

If enabled, &brandShortName; will automatically consider messages marked by this external classifier as junk.
If enabled, you must first train &brandShortName; to identify junk mail by using the Junk toolbar button to mark messages as junk or not. You need to identify both junk and non junk messages. After that &brandShortName; will be able to mark junk automatically.
If false, turn off hardware acceleration.

If your e-mail provider supports it, Customize From Address allows you to make a one-off minor alteration to your From address without having to create a new identity in Account Settings. For example, if your From address is John Doe <john@example.com> you may want to change it to John Doe <john+doe@example.com> or John <john@example.com>.
If you require encryption, to send a message you must have the public key or certificate of every recipient.
If you store this account's new mail in a different account's Inbox, you will no longer be able to access already downloaded e-mail for this account. If you have mail in this account, please copy it to another account first.\n\nIf you have filters that filter mail into this account, you should disable them or change the destination folder. If any accounts have special folders in this account (Sent, Drafts, Templates, Archives, Junk), you should change them to be in another account.\n\nDo you still want to store this account's e-mail in a different account?

Voice is natural, voice is human. It’s the easiest and most natural way to communicate. We want developers to be able to build amazing things from real-time translators to voice-enabled administrative assistants. But right now there isn’t enough publicly available data to build these kinds of apps. We hope that Common Voice will give developers what they need to innovate.

Voice recognition technology could revolutionize the way we interact with machines, but the currently available systems are expensive and proprietary. Common Voice is a project to make voice recognition technology easily accessible to everyone. People donate their voices to a massive database that will let anyone quickly and easily train voice-enabled apps. All voice data will be available to developers.

In addition to the Common Voice dataset, we’re also building an open source speech recognition engine called Deep Speech. Voice recognition technology is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines, but the currently available systems are expensive and proprietary. Common Voice is part of Mozilla’s initiative to make voice recognition technologies better and more accessible for everyone. Common Voice is a massive global database of donated voices that lets anyone quickly and easily train voice-enabled apps in potentially every language. We're not only collecting voice samples in widely spoken languages but also in those with a smaller population of speakers. Publishing a diverse dataset of voices will empower developers, entrepreneurs, and communities to address this gap themselves.

We want the Common Voice dataset to reflect the audio quality a speech-to-text engine will hear in the wild, so we’re looking for variety. In addition to a diverse community of speakers, a dataset with varying audio quality will teach the speech-to-text engine to handle various real-world situations, from background talking to car noise. As long as your voice clip is intelligible, it should be good enough for the dataset.

WARNING:
Warning Decryption was successful, but the signature could not be verified correctly
Warning: depending on the number of keys and the connection speed, refreshing all keys could be quite a lengthy process!
Warning - the filter action "Decrypt permanently" may lead to destroyed messages. We strongly recommend that you first try the "Create decrypted Copy" filter, test the result carefully, and only start using this filter once you are satisfied with the result.
Warning - the filter action "Encrypt to key" replaces the recipients. If you do not have the secret key for '{ $desc }' you will no longer be able to read the emails.
Warning: The new OpenPGP public key in this message differs from the public keys that you previously accepted for { $email }.
Warning! This is an insecure server.
WARNING: You are about to delete a secret key! If you delete your secret key, you will no longer be able to decrypt any messages encrypted for that key, nor will you be able to revoke it. Do you really want to delete BOTH, the secret key and the public key '{ $userId }'?
WARNING: You are about to delete secret keys! If you delete your secret key, you will no longer be able to decrypt any messages encrypted for that key. Do you really want to delete BOTH, the selected secret and public keys?
Warning! You are about to send a message of size %S. Are you sure you want to do this?
%1$S will be installed after you restart %2$S.
Continue? Warning: you are about to send an encrypted email to a newsgroup. This is discouraged because it only makes sense if all members of the group can decrypt the message, i.e. the message needs to be encrypted with the keys of all group participants. Please send this message only if you know exactly what you are doing.

End-to-End Encrypted Email Support
End-to-end encryption for email can be used to ensure that only the sender and the recipients of a message can read the contents. Without this protection it is easy for email providers and mass surveillance to read your messages. If you would like to learn more about how end-to-end encryption in Thunderbird works, check out our article: <a href="%(encryption)s">Introduction to End-to-end encryption in Thunderbird</a>.
Enjoy real-time conversation with your contacts, right from your favorite messaging application, with multiple supported networks. Thunderbird makes it easy to search through both past conversations and received emails.

If you like Firefox’s tabbed browsing, you’re going to love tabbed email. Tabbed email lets you load emails in separate tabs so you can quickly jump between them. Perhaps you’re responding to an email and need to refer back to an earlier email. Tabbed email lets you keep multiple emails open for easy reference.

Tailored for all your needs
The Account Setup window and the Account Central tab have both been updated. The Account Central tab appears when you do not have an account setup, or when you select an existing account in the folder tree.
The Activity Manager records all the interactions between Thunderbird and your email provider in one place. There’s no more guess work. You only have to look in one place to see everything that’s happening with your email.
The attachment reminder looks for the word attachment (and other words like file types) in the body of your message and reminds you to add an attachment before hitting send.
The compose window has been reworked to make composing a message faster, easier and more straightforward. The compose window now also takes up less space with recipients listed in “pills” instead of an entire line for each address.
The dark theme available in Thunderbird has been enhanced with a dark message thread pane as well as many other small improvements.
The Future of Thunderbird

The layout and dialogues have been improved to make it easier to understand the information displayed and to find relevant settings. The Account Central tab also has new information about the Thunderbird project and displays the version you are using.

Themes allow you to change the look of Thunderbird in an instant. Working on getting to inbox zero at night? Turn on the dark theme to make managing your email easier on the eyes. Thunderbird ships with both light and dark themes, and more are available as add-ons.
The new Preferences tab also makes it easier to multi-task without the problem of losing track of where your preferences are when switching between windows.

The Quick Filter Toolbar lets you filter your email faster. Start typing in words in the Quick Filter search box and the results are displayed instantly. Or you can filter your email by New Messages, Tags, and people in your Address Book. You can also "Pin" or save a Filter and use it across multiple folders.
There are many other big changes that make Thunderbird 78 a very large release including: calendar and tasks are now integrated into Thunderbird, folder icons are now updated and their colors are customizable, the preferences are now searchable, and minimize to tray is now supported on Windows.
There are many other smaller changes that make Thunderbird 68 feel polished and powerful including: a new App Menu UI, an updated To/CC/BCC selector in compose, improved attachment management, full color support across the app, filters can now be set to run periodically, and feed articles now show external attachments as links.
There are many other updates in this release, you can see a list of all of them in the <a href="%(release)s">Thunderbird 68 release notes</a>.

The redesigned compose window makes it easier to manage many email recipients, and the new intuitive layout helps users to discover its features.
There is a passionate team of volunteers involved in developing Thunderbird and assisting its users who would welcome your involvement. Check out our <a href="%(volunteer)s">Get Involved page</a> to learn how you can participate on the Thunderbird team.

If you’re curious about who is working on Thunderbird, check out the <a href="%(core_team)s">list of our core contributors</a>.
There is now a dark mode in Thunderbird, making late-night email easier on the eyes. To enable, Thunderbird will use your operating system settings to see if you have enabled dark mode OS-wide.
There’s nothing here!
The search interface in Thunderbird contains filtering and timeline tools to pinpoint the exact email you’re looking for. Thunderbird also indexes all of your emails and chat conversations to help you search even faster. Your search results are displayed in a tab so you can easily switch back and forth to your search results and other email.

Thunderbird Features
Thunderbird for Organizations
Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client, that’s easy to set up and customize. One of the core principles of Thunderbird is the use and promotion of open standards - this focus is a rejection of our world of closed platforms and services that can’t communicate with each other. We want our users to have freedom and choice in how they communicate.
Thunderbird is a free email application that’s easy to set up and customize - and it’s loaded with great features!
Thunderbird is an independent project with its legal and financial home at <a href="%(foundation)s">the Mozilla Foundation</a>. The Mozilla Foundation believes the Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible to all. It is focused on advocacy issues and keeping the Internet healthy, but is also the sole shareholder in the maker of Firefox, the Mozilla Corporation. Mozilla exerts no governance over the project, which instead falls to the Thunderbird Council, elected by the Thunderbird project’s community. The Mozilla Foundation became Thunderbird’s home after an <a href="%(home_blog_post)s">exploration of legal homes in 2017</a>.
Thunderbird is an open source project, which means anyone can contribute ideas, designs, code, and time helping fellow users.

Thunderbird is both free and freedom respecting, but we’re also completely funded by donations! Help us sustain the project and continue to improve.
Thunderbird is currently transitioning to an independent organization. Being independent, we can shape our own fate, but there is significant infrastructure that must be maintained to deliver the application to our tens of millions of users. For Thunderbird to survive and continue to evolve, we need your support and ask for your donation today. All the money donated will go directly to funding Thunderbird development and infrastructure.
Thunderbird is funded by users like you
Thunderbird is no longer funded by Mozilla. Fortunately there is an active community keeping it running and developing it further. But to survive long term, the project needs funding.

Thunderbird Look & Feel
a
Thunderbird makes email better for you, bringing together speed, privacy and the latest technologies. Focus on what matters and forget about complexity.
Thunderbird Nightly
Thunderbird offers support for user privacy and remote image protection. To ensure a user’s privacy, Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in email messages.
Thunderbird protects you from email scams which try to trick users into handing over personal and confidential information by indicating when a message is a potential phishing attempt. As a second line of defense, Thunderbird warns you when you click on a link which appears to be taking you to a different Web site than the one indicated by the URL in the message.
Thunderbird Release Notes
Thunderbird release notes are specific to each version of the application. Select your version from the list below to see the release notes for it.

Thunderbirdʼs Options/Preferences have been converted from a dialog window to its own dedicated tab. The new Preferences tab provides more space which allows for better organized content and is more consistent with the look and feel of the rest of Thunderbird.
Thunderbird’s popular junk mail tools have been updated to stay ahead of spam. Each email you receive passes through Thunderbird’s leading-edge junk mail filters. Each time you mark messages as spam, Thunderbird "learns" and improves its filtering so you can spend more time reading the mail that matters. Thunderbird can also use your mail provider’s spam filters to keep junk mail out of your inbox.
Thunderbird’s update system checks to see if you’re running the latest version, and notifies you when a security update is available. These security updates are small (usually 200KB - 700KB), giving you only what you need and making the security update quick to download and install. The automated update system provides updates for Thunderbird on Windows, macOS, and Linux in over 40 different languages.

We’ve got some holiday calendar files available for download.

What is Thunderbird?
What’s New
When quitting Thunderbird, visible tabs will be saved and will be restored when you open Thunderbird the next time. There is also a Tab menu on the Tab toolbar to help you switch between Tabs.
Who We Are
a
Why we need donations
With Add-ons (Extensions & Themes) and many more features you can change the look and feel of Thunderbird in an instant.
With Personas, lightweight "skins" allow you to change the look and feel of Thunderbird in an instant. Hundreds of skins are available from the latest movies, famous landmarks, and Japanese tattoos. You can also choose from several Themes that dress up all the different icons in Thunderbird.
You can also find calendars to subscribe to at <a href="%s">iCalShare.com</a>.
You can now speed up the transfer of large documents by uploading them to an online storage provider and sharing the link instead of sending the file directly as a message attachment. Improve the speed of sending email and avoid message rejection if the recipient’s server disallows large files. As an added bonus, you’ll also save space in your sent folder and the recipient’s inbox.
You can see details of all our changes in the release notes for <a href="%(release)s">Thunderbird 78.0 and up</a>.
Fortunately there is an active community keeping it running and developing it further. But to survive long term, the project needs funding. You might already know that Thunderbird improvements are no longer paid for by Mozilla.

Certain situations may arise in which Mozilla requests that an add-on developer update their add-on within a given time period to address a major security issue or policy violation. We work with developers to reasonably accommodate their own schedules, but if the issue is of a serious enough nature, add-ons that cannot issue an update with the requested fix may be demoted from fully-reviewed status, disabled, or permanently removed from the site.
Autoplay is only allowed when approved by the user, the site is activated by the user, or media is muted.
