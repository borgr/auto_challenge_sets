an improvement on this situation was the ability to relocate execu@@ table programs when they were loaded into memory . only one copy of the program was required , but once loaded the program could not be moved .

a stati@@ stic ( sing@@ ular ) or sample stati@@ stic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . it is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
observ@@ ability
more formally , statistical theory defines a stati@@ stic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . the term stati@@ stic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .

the la@@ plac@@ ian of a function is equal to the divergence of the gradient and the trace of the H@@ es@@ sian matrix .
on the graph of a function , the second deri@@ vative corresponds to the cur@@ v@@ ature or conc@@ av@@ ity of the graph . the graph of a function with a positive second deri@@ vative is up@@ war@@ dly con@@ cave , while the graph of a function with a negative second deri@@ vative curves in the opposite way .
when using Le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z 's no@@ tation for derivatives , the second deri@@ vative of a dependent variable y with respect to an independent variable x is written
the deri@@ vative of f is the function
it is possible to write a single limit for the second deri@@ vative :
