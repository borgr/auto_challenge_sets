for these survivors , life can be compared to another health emergency .
however , many continue to bear intermittent pain .
people are living far longer now , and for the first time in human history , it 's common for four generations to be living side by side .

and Conan Doyle , writing about Bell , described the following exchange between Bell and his students .
she says , " I did . "
and so when Auenbrugger became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
and that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .
I 've often wondered , what would Fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era , in the year 2011 ?
when are they going to come by and explain things to me ?
it had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there .
but to her , it mattered deeply .
I say that because these are difficult patients .
and so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and I tried not to interrupt them .
I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story .
we marry , for example , with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .
and out of that sense of failure , I remember , I would always examine the patient .
and employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren 't actually ready for real work , didn 't have the right attitudes and experience .
it 's not perfect yet , but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands , possibly millions , of teenagers who are really bored by schooling .
a democracy could be upheld peacefully .
the kids got the pills , and their performance improved .
something happened in the 70s that is sometimes referred to as " the software crisis , " where suddenly , computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for , from a design perspective .
what mattered was that it was there at all .
they would look and say , " Oh , the progress bar is half done .
the rope became a big thing when women 's clothes became more fitted and the pantaloon came into being .
those ropes created a space where we were able to contribute to something that was far greater than the neighborhood .
the button and the buttonhole is such a great invention .
she would hit herself and give herself bloody noses and she had hygiene problems -- she had big hygiene problems .
when I was 10 years old , I treated another human being like some worthless other ...
the first step is starting to recognize the hate inside ourselves .
and then second : if we want to challenge the hate in our societies , we need to promote policies and institutions and practices that connect us as communities .
but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
in urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
they find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside , but they don 't have the sense of belonging .
so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane ?
so you 'd think , with all this extra space , we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff .
so I 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
my office folds away , easily hidden .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) But -- ( Applause ) Here we are , a few years later .
and , actually , I think we can dust off Stephen Mather 's playbook .

my medical exam was something completely different .
so what 's it like to be a baby ?
there was no official investigation into his death .
what I saw was the three men trying to pull him down below the seats .

it isn 't just about nice .
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language .
ask a deceptive person to tell their story , they 're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places .
barefoot technology : this was 1986 -- no engineer , no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs .
there 's a little wimpy box on top there .
I 've got this experience , I 'm in the world .
that 's because you 're making a prediction .
so you 're not going to see C @-@ 3PO .
I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor .
and these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace .
the cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes .
about 15 years ago , when I learned of our new @-@ found ability to create quantum effects that don 't exist in nature , I was excited .
( laughter ) And here you can see , on Jesse 's chest , when he just tried to do three different things , you can see three different patterns .
so Amanda , when you first started using this arm , how long did it take to use it ?
so if it stopped working , I just had to take it off .
but it 's also used to assign a temperature range .
you all know the truth of what I 'm going to say .
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .
on that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies .
we collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder .
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
and he makes this complicated thing .
so what happens during the Second World War ?
well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?
this got us very excited .
we 've completed , now , clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
I made an artist book that 's in stainless steel instead of paper .
it is a papercutting , and then after , I added color on the computer .
and after university , I wanted to do something -- probably na√Øvely -- to help .
it 's realizing we have the power to create the world anew together and to do it ourselves when our governments refuse .
or clergy and teachers engaging in civil disobedience to block water shutoff trucks .
it means trusting those who know the problems best -- the people who live them -- with solutions .
or any date for that fact , it 's like , " I don 't exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . "
I would tell them , " Hey guys , this is where I 'm going . this is my flight .
so if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , I might help alleviate poverty .
that 's not what we found .
and we have testosterone .
and it 's so easy to cause people 's brains to release oxytocin .
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day .
if it 's helping to unite the world , I think it 's definitely the fish of the future .
we have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car .
when we do have to do something truly out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ box , we use an incremental design , build , test , redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you .
and in neuroscience , we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain .
but apart from that , everything else goes through contractions of muscles .
so it 's really important to remember that sensory , memory and cognitive processes are all important , but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements .
now of course there are other moves , but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution .
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be .
so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is , for example , sensory feedback is extremely noisy .
forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in darts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
now both these sources of information carry important information .
ca : well that was quite fascinating . thank you very much indeed .
and above all , it is a right , it is everyone 's right .
we call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
on the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who 's actually in the space .
well , I 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while I 've been speaking , you have been scanned .
I want you to understand , each one of these is a hypothesis ; it is subject to revision .
already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time : the Africa of HIV / AIDS , the Africa of malaria , the Africa of poverty , the Africa of conflict , and the Africa of disasters .
I 'm working on an initiative now , along with the World Bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries ' moneys -- to get that sent back .
( laughter ) But that would actually get you oriented pretty fast , right ?
this is a little trick that you 're taught to use as kids .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
so maybe it 's working in people the same way .
but we 've figured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this .
education shapes our children . it shapes the way we teach .
somehow , we live in this world where , in 2017 , the US Constitution is held up as the supreme law of the land , right ?
we are medicine men , we are medicine women , we are sun dancers , we are pipe carriers , we are traditional language speakers .
Afrobeats has played the strongest role so far , if you ask me , as far as emancipating the youth is concerned .
so I started shooting time @-@ lapse photography .
so , I have a gift I want to share with you today , a project I 'm working on called " Happiness Revealed . "
so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software .
at the age of 19 , the day after I graduated high school , I moved to a place where it snowed and I became a massage therapist .
he 's about my age , and he 's in San Quentin State Prison .
what is that idea ?
I mean , even the stupid " reply all " regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .
but Cambodia is not alone .
in Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn 't a 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy , it was an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .

the brains remain hardwired for music .
now I want to show you one last video .
and here 's a video of Joseph .
there are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere .
you don 't actually have to hear it .
and I don 't think that we should give up on beauty .
I believe that journalism is a public good .
they 're under pressure to communicate their science outside of the academy .
Revi and I analyzed some of the mandates that researchers are under .
do we have women as victims , and are men only the perpetrators ?
should they share in the profit ?
the astronaut is asleep .
here 's how it works .
( laughter ) they contain Snoop Dogg .
and the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
right now , the web is partitioned into multiple languages .
the problem with that is it 's not yet good enough and it probably won 't be for the next 15 to 20 years .
if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is even at the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
if this is what you want to do , you quickly realize you 're going to run into two big hurdles , two big obstacles .
for example , this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
you can see that the repeat units differ in length . they also differ in sequence .
here are stress @-@ strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider .
that 's what the spider has to interact with their environment .
but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain , noninvasively , with focused ultrasound in the ' 50s .
so this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
pain is something that can make your life miserable .
and doing that in the U.S.
everyone 's listening . we 're responding .
it got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
what was my motivation ?
when I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water .
( laughter ) But my point is that ... and I call it the " then what ? "
and I think that 's the issue , you know ; it 's the " then what " that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren 't hiring architects for that .
( laughter ) I 'm going to make it for you !
basically , she would collect string .
these are opium @-@ addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
( voices overlapping ) So , my wish ... My wish ... I wish ...
( music ) ( Camera clicking ) Touch the screen , take your picture , type in information .
you CANNOT know when and how , but it 's worth trying .
so how do we stop this ?
thank you .
it was late fall , and we were getting ready for next spring .
ultimately , this technology is helping us to rewrite our history .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
so we go back and we do that again , and again .
however , we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one @-@ time use .
" you know , I 'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey .
that 's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally .
I 'd just take a sharpie , draw one panel after the other , figuring out what I wanted to say as I went .
as of 2007 , we went from being a primarily rural planet to being a primarily urban one , and that has implications for how we 're going to feed these people , how we 're going to get the food to the people in the cities .
they have a choice .
now help me not to be a beggar anymore . "
people like Mahmoud are agents of change .
that 's Najmuddin , the one with the white coat .
I thought , " Oh my gosh . I 'm going to become a Crotchety old lady . "
and here 's the third factor , which is totally different .
we are now interlocked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before .
for us , I think , part of the equation for our survival .
some of you might actually right now be thinking , it 's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words .
but the thing about this filter is that it always leaves the same things in .
when asked to describe their lives , what is interesting is how few people said " mess . "
you view your life like this instead of the mess that it is or it ought to be .
just imagine yourself pressing a button every time you tell the good versus evil story , and by pressing that button , you 're lowering your IQ by ten points or more .
you 'll hear this in so many contexts .
most of the others either never responded back , said they didn 't have the time or didn 't have the equipment and couldn 't help me .
I 've also entered in her age , her gender and her height .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
and what is dialogue really about ?
I was lucky that while he may not have even known about this concept of reasonable adjustments , to him , it was just common sense .
so what should be a manager 's first response when somebody says that they 're sick and they don 't know how it 's going to impact their work ?
it 's involved with the growing of the microtubules , and it 's able to transiently couple onto them .
people in the community need to be able to get from one place to another as quickly as possible .
some water @-@ cooled reactors run at over 70 atmospheres of pressure , and others have to run at as much as 150 atmospheres of pressure .
the reactors we have today use uranium oxide as a fuel .
it 's a ceramic material similar in performance to the ceramics we use to make coffee cups or cookware or the bricks we use to line fireplaces .
do we have enough thorium ?
this year even more people will get caught up in the illegal drug trade .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
and the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul @-@ like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
and they don 't really change much .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
and that 's what religions do .
that 's something we can learn from .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
there 's so much we can absorb .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
so he designed a different kind of sonar ping , one that looks random .
so what do these patterns look like again ?
they teach us how to think critically .
the first metric is : is it sustainable ?
one is a closed photobioreactor that you see here , and what you see on the other side is our species - we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus .
now the problems with closed photobioreactors are : they are quite expensive , they are automated , and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale .
there is a drawback to algae , however : it 's very expensive .
and the answer is : yes .
what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world , where there 's barren desert .
if you are a farmer , you need five things to be successful : you need seeds , you need soil , you need water and you need sun , and the last thing that you need is fertilizer .
most people use chemical fertilizers . but guess what ?
freshwater Mollies : cheap , they love to make babies , and they love to go to the bathroom .
here 's the plant species . Salicornia virginica .
how about this : in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , next to the sea , saltwater , barren desert , how about we take that plant , plant it , half use for food , half use for fuel .
we understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch , you put them together , and you create a watch .
but interestingly , it 's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience .
but it 's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together . "
but I don 't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it .
of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance .
if you watch the X @-@ Factor too much , you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be .
I 've heard some fantastic musicians this morning , and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them .
the true self , as it were then , is not something that is just there for you to discover , you don 't sort of look into your soul and find your true self , What you are partly doing , at least , is actually creating your true self .
I knew there were Portuguese men o ' war , all kinds of moon jellies , all kinds of things , but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters .
and he is crying and he 's yelling to my trainer who 's trying to help me .
and at 41 hours , this body couldn 't make it .
you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this . "
so now what do I do ?
I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems , or more exactly , the confusions , of consciousness .
this fascination led me to submerge myself in art , study neuroscience , and later , to become a psychotherapist .
imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight .
because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women .
in South Korea and Indonesia , women own nearly half a million firms .
and that 's just to start .
and two days later , this package shows up on your doorstep .
so let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem .
I was out in the Bay area in ' 99 , 2000 , the dot com boom .
I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame @-@ out called Webvan .
and it really came down to the fact that we couldn 't do it cost effectively .
and that 's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home .
so long story short , during my one year at Webvan , what I realized by talking to all the material @-@ handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking .
so we said , there 's just got to be a better way to do this .
so how did I arrive at this notion ?
take a blank sheet , of course , but then test your ideas at the limits - infinity , zero .
diet Coke walks up to the front - pick it , put it in the tote , away it goes . "
so these are patients who had received surgery , high dose radiation to the head and first @-@ line chemotherapy , and that had failed and their tumors had grown back .
we divided the patients into two groups .
he won the gold medal in Moscow in the 4,000 meter pursuit .
he received the standard treatments .
and on one side of the bunk bed , I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry .
so I did the only thing my frantic seven year @-@ old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
but normal is merely average .
my colleague , Dr. Paul Fenton , was living this reality .
it 's also designed for the environment that it will be used in .
it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts .
so we 're thrilled .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
what 's that new state that the world is heading toward ?
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
so now we 've speeded up the time scales once again .
and I think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
and let 's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . "
so I 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
but they do the job .
and in fact , I know , I 'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
no other major assembly in our lives is constructed like this .
your car doesn 't come to you in pieces with an extra 10 percent just in case , to be assembled at the mercy of the elements .
in fact , truly sustainable housing should be available to everyone and affordable for all .
but something was still bugging me , something was still keeping me up at night .
wrap your head around that number .
like the time at a bar in college when a bouncer physically removed me by the back of the neck and threw me out of a woman 's restroom .
but for me , the possibility is what this child , who will grow to be a teenager and then a real @-@ life adult , will call me for the rest of our lives , was both extremely scary and exciting .
it felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in .
( laughter ) So , option one is to ignore the assumption and allow folks to continue to refer to me as " mom , " which is not awkward for the other party , but is typically really awkward for us .
and move on .
only men can be dads . "
and I 'll say that over time , my ability to navigate this complicated map has gotten easier .
the technician saw a vulva and slapped the words " It 's a girl " on the screen and gave us a copy and sent us on our way .
I had to choose option two .
I 'm working against limiting myself .
and as the conversation shifted to our pediatrician , I saw Sarah and Becky 's interaction continue , and it went something like this .
it would have been easier for Sarah .
if you can think of a better system , keep your hands down .
they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding , for example .
we are changing our culture from within , but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions .
it 's important for us to grow organically .
and for us young people , they 're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves .
which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global .
in a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the burger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others ?
we 're here , we 're part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them .
our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
and I think with time , in the years to come we 'll be learning a lot about our Picassos , our Legers and our Cezannes .
we do have artists , but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet .
it 's important for two things .
and I would argue that it 's especially needed for work that 's complex and unpredictable and for solving big problems .
so we 're reaching out to team across big teaming , grand @-@ scale teaming .
you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities .
it 's inflating very fast .
and everybody says , " A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can 't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one . "
and the last one is T. Rex .
and each time he accessed a document , he 'd take it out , consult it and put it back in on the left @-@ hand side .
also , I have various family members , such as my grandfather and great uncle , who fought in World War II .
he 's a veteran , having served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
and not only do these genetic males mate with other males , they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they 're genetic males .
it 's also the most primitive - all other mouthparts are thought to have started out looking like this one before evolving into something different .
it short @-@ circuits the brain , and we 're starting to find it has actual cognitive consequences , one of them being this sort of pervasive background hum of anxiety .
and sometimes I had to be brave , and it wasn 't always easy .
and that 's OK .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
they 've been around a long time , very important to coastal communities .
one , it 's to try and work out the gender of the shark .
nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened .
so Les did a finer study , and he found out it came out about 9,000 .
the problem with this is they were constrained with samples .
and some are caught in nets , in trawls .
so when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat , I thought , " If you take what you 're given in this world ... "
and he was like , " Yeah , yeah . later . "
so as a field biologist , you just want to get encounters with these animals , and learn as much as you can .
Government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA -- the Trilogy Emergency Response Application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
so these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines .
the incredibly high price of flying food into these remote Northern aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival .
this is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
you turn it on , light goes everywhere .
the experience of looking up and knowing that the sky you 're looking at surrounds every known living thing in the universe is very profound .
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand , calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon .
Cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the Shah .
and just like that , you 've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .
and what I 'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow .
what does it have to do with time and savings , this issue of immediate gratification ?
one percent check the box . the rest do nothing .
if you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates , we think we 're going to eat bananas next week .
mid @-@ sized company in the Midwest , blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they CANNOT save more right away .
it 's been part of the Pension Protection Act .
if you 're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
he died broken by history .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
this picture was taken when Steve , on the left , was eight years old .
one that I 'll highlight here is changing the patient 's name .
think about it . when a car receives a radio signal , it 's processed by software .
they actually carried out their attack in real life .
the accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone .
so how does it happen ?
in addition to that , it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth , and much of it we don 't know about .
and so 10 years ago , an international program began called the Census of Marine Life , which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans .
now one of the other things that you may think about is that , when you go to the supermarket and you buy things , they 're scanned .
the Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data .
one of the things that we 're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
so whether you 're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile , whether you 're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you 're a TEDster living in Edinburgh , the oceans matter .
in this twilight zone , much of the data seems to point to one conclusion .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
the eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths to sustain this economy .
the Earth can support that if we choose the right path .
announcer Two : famine in Somalia . announcer Three : police pepper spray .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
let me give you an example .
now we talk about water wars .
because we live on a water planet .
simple : by calling and paying and getting .
and we began going to the deeper areas , places that all of a sudden , the bridges were broken , but we had to go , because it was easy to stay in San Juan .
I love to help the Salvation Army , but in my world , they are the ones who are supposed to be helping us to answer those calls of help .
we dropped the sandwiches .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , " I want you to know I 've been watching you . "
and I go to the jail and I see my client who 's 13 and 14 , and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult .
for example , here in California we 're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don 't result in arrest .
56 percent of all rape cases don 't result .
it 's already halfway over , but something 's caught you and you 're drawn in and you care .
it can 't be artificially evoked .
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus .
they haven 't given up on government .
this is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston .
to be fair , race did pop up a few times in school , growing up .
as a result , we didn 't really care .
PV : that might seem like a weird reaction , but only if we don 't recognize how it 's emblematic of something larger , something deeper .
that according to a Columbia study on cis straight relationships black is often equated with masculinity and Asian with femininity , leading more men to not value black women and to fetishize Asian women .
my goal in this was to get people to notice this going @-@ through @-@ the @-@ motions holiday thing that I 'm sure we 've all felt before .
and I did that through a holiday card , of course .
( laughter ) This card is literally a four @-@ frame documentary about receiving the card .
( laughter ) So it 's a recursive experience .
far more awesome , in fact , than the format of wedding invitations .
so I began spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about needles : like , would we find needles with the right fidelity ?
( laughter ) So we did it , we really did it !
( music and singing ) ( Music ends ) We were so excited when we finally got that to work .
we have assumptions about material experience , like that paper should be silent or that websites should be flat .
imagine your normal , everyday commuter @-@ newspaper @-@ reading ritual .
this is something we actually did do in the fall of 2008 , in a project that was conceptualized by artist Steve Lambert , organized by The Yes Men and executed by many , many people , some of whom are me .
( laughter ) While the real " New York Times " has this slogan of , " All the News that 's Fit to Print , " we offered a more forward @-@ thinking message of , " All the News We Hope to Print . "
if you haven 't taken a ride on the New York City subway , you may not know Dr. Z.
and you can see more of my work at : I 'll snore naked dot com .
they can heal and they can kill ...
when I lost my front tooth , my brother looked at me and said , " Oh , it has happened to you , too ?
I had a childhood that I would wish for anyone .
this still happens to me standing right here .
you see , the chaos of the violence continues inside in the words we use and the stories we create every single day .
I want to be a great friend .
you have a battery in your phone , or iPod , right ?
on Earth , we 've seen how dramatically technology can accelerate in just 100 years .
you go into the water and once you hit the water , it 's amazing .
he said , " What 's inertia ? " and his dad said , " Ah .
but for most of human history , we had to discover these things using our eyes and our ears and our minds .
it 's actually hitting a tooth .
what happens when you look at what the discoverers were thinking about when they made their discoveries , is you understand that they are not so different from us .
and when that happens , the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings .
and they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction .
we 're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are .
nonetheless , when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement , they can move mountains .
those things came along too recently .
we broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
we hope that we can make computing a user model you 're familiar with , and really derive insights from you , from all different directions .
because what little hoodlum wouldn 't want a million and a half bucks @-@ worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
( applause ) Or about 75,000 jobs .
vulnerability is not weakness .
and so many of the calls went like this , " Dr. Brown , we loved your TED talk .
" what do you do ? " " I study shame . " " Oh . "
( applause ) You know why this place is amazing ?
I know your dad really wasn 't in Luxembourg , he was in Sing Sing .
for women , the best example I can give you is Enjoli , the commercial .
and he said , " That 's convenient . "
you don 't look at him and say , " He 's an amputee with a prosthetic . "
and that 's what I 'm going to talk to you today about .
but as we all know , that process grew also on a kind of macro scale as well .
now , there 's nothing wrong with shopping malls , there 's nothing wrong with highways , and there 's nothing wrong with high @-@ rise buildings or suburban development .
it 's like the economic system in the world today -- it 's really not a sustainable system , and we have to find ways of addressing it .
so where are we headed from here ?
this stuff is everywhere .
but no , I 'm not . I own stocks .
you can 't -- okay .
that is , it 's going to be a small part , because you can 't rely on it .
how in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ?
and anything American will work for me .
and she wanted to study the Talmud .
Hollywood heart attack . Ughhhh .
these are female and male stem cells .
women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns .
and this is me with President Obama , showing him my Homeland Security research .
but other days I am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table .
thank you .
and these two young farmers , they are girls now -- because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS -- they discuss with a trained agronomist .
that 's one context .
health is also important , but not that much as a mean .
it may seem weird , but this comes back from HyperCard .
it 's a conversation amongst rabbis about this article in the New York Times , about the fact that religious workers don 't get a lot of time off .
and my own story with September 11 has really become a more intricate one , because I spent a great deal of time working on a piece of the 9 / 11 Memorial in Manhattan .
when you read stock prices , think about them in a human context .
( applause ) Now let 's get started .
( laughter ) Until Volta , nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use .
this is the starting point for designing a battery -- two electrodes , in this case metals of different composition , and an electrolyte , in this case salt dissolved in water .
admittedly , I 've left out a few details .
RD : sure .
in Liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
and keep your eyes on the big screen .
( laughter ) So ...
and so in 2006 , I founded a new political party .
and the European elections , the last European elections , we became the largest party and the most coveted youth demographic , sub @-@ 30 .
but applying these -- and we 've done this dozens of times , we know that this works .
shoot for the moon !
we work for autonomy , mastery and purpose .
those three factors are : speed , trust and scalability .
it was not abused once .
single @-@ celled life that transforms sunlight and carbon dioxide into edible gold .
how do we feed the world without destroying it ?
we transformed our apartments into our laboratories , and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way .
Oh , you thought I was playing .
it 's already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn 't be able to do that .
so that 's what you see on the upper @-@ left , an animated head that yawns .
and that 's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy , and that is universal in the mammals , basically .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them -- then the choices go down .
so what we did is we put two Capuchin monkeys side @-@ by @-@ side .
this year , if you think about it , over a billion couples will have sex with one another .
people who spoke the same language made that change as a group .
in Germany , this transition started in the 1880s , and it took just 50 years for family size to stabilize in this country .
I think , as we go through this history , it 's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue .
she was incredibly optimistic about her family 's future .
and I thought it was just an amazing day .
the thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
it then comes back into a round form , and then tapers and curves off .
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
the horse just has another nostril that 's developed because of a riding accident .
thank you .
because of this , all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home .
to do that I 'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic .
but I just started again an hour ago . "
and so , we made this game , and she got it .
I don 't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships .
so this is a game called " S√≠och√°n leat . " it 's " peace be with you . "
it 's an expression of beauty , it 's how they say they love you .
we conventionally divide space into private and public realms , and we know these legal distinctions very well because we 've become experts at protecting our private property and private space .
but one thing I can say is that it 's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration .
four @-@ fifths of the world 's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo .
but they also have rising costs to our security , economy , health and environment that are starting to erode , if not outweigh their benefits .
so let 's start by making autos oil free .
last year , Volkswagen announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon .
I look at this picture and it freaks me out .
so I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
so what I you to take away from my talk , the lesson of all of this , is to just be Stevie Nicks .
we see that the world is feeling " used " at 3.3 times the normal level right now .
we see " better " is the most frequent feeling , followed by " bad . "
( laughter ) " I love how I feel today . "
and in classical music we can follow these changes very , very accurately because of the music 's powerful silent partner , the way it 's been passed on : notation .
in 200 B.C. , a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks .
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pinpoint the pitch 's location .
Mozart was the same way .
and by the 1400s , music was being written that tried to mirror God 's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
it 's just these two notes in the middle .
now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
this is when those big forms arose -- the symphonies , the sonatas , the concertos .
what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance ?
it 's the passing on part . it 's the ' why ' part of it .
the culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that 's been sliced , diced , layered and , God knows , distributed and sold .
what 's the long @-@ term effect of this on us or on music ?
( music ) And he said , " Yes , yes . I was a little boy .
you don 't need to worry about knowing anything .
follow traces . get lost . be surprised , amused inspired .
I love my food .
and as a result of that , I grew up with books everywhere around the house .
( laughter ) And then life was fine , dandy .
Oh , some of you have seen it .
and as it ran , this thing was saying , " Give me input . give me input . "
and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue .
when I moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
and by this time I was hooked .
and this is about 23 years into this process .
are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it ?
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
back in the 1980s , actually , I gave my first talk at TED , and I brought some of the very , very first public demonstrations of virtual reality ever to the TED stage .
everything you know about Beethoven -- basically wrong .
the very first thing that happens is : it redefines the product .
so the product becomes sheet music , becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home .
every time this happens , we take away some social interaction .
with each of these disruptions , it changes the amount of social interaction .
but there 's also less choice , because in a global pyramid , you can 't always tell what you want .
now , this little boy here , Pamelo , from Zambia , he has trachoma .
they CANNOT eliminate trachoma unless they get more .
well , we believe that we can eliminate trachoma in 12 African countries and across the Americas and all across the Pacific .
I was drawn to oceanography by just this kind of challenge .
the wild thing that happened on that trip is that we discovered what everyone who looked before had completely missed : photosynthetic cells smaller than anyone thought possible .
we now know those tiny cells are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on earth .
it 's exceedingly large , spanning from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean and around the globe .
these animals and their movements help connect the surface and deep ocean in important ways .
this could have irreversible global @-@ scale impacts on marine life and food webs .
we need to get out ahead of fishing impacts and work to understand this critical part of the ocean .
methane pollution causes one quarter of the global warming that we 're experiencing right now .
and not only is no one talking about it , but we refuse to acknowledge that the source of this crisis is rooted in the same injustice that first propelled the civil rights movement .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
believe it or not , the picture on your right remains a very popular tourist snorkeling spot on the island of Maui , even though it 's lost most of its coral cover over the past decade or so .
if we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime , then that is the change we need to spread .
we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .
so here 's our little solar system , as we pull away from our melted planet here .
I want to be able to play " The Day the Earth Stood Still , " " 2001 : a Space Odyssey , " " Star Trek , " " War Of the Worlds . "
one of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented so two @-@ dimensionally and so static .
so here 's a little black hole that we probably don 't want to get too close to .
because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now are the result of short @-@ term thinking , and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 , 100 , or 1,000 years out .
the population density of the UK is 250 people per square kilometer .
half of the world 's population lives in countries that are already above that line .
so in an attempt to prepare their men for any future conflicts , they founded the National Rifle Association to promote rifle practice .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
so Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon .
but this is just a further evolution of a journey of uncomfortable learning throughout my life .
for many , it was difficult to see how bringing controversial speakers to campus could be valuable , when they caused harm .
it 's my belief that to achieve progress in the face of adversity , we need a genuine commitment to gaining a deeper understanding of humanity .
it was really crowded , as it is around the holidays , and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused .
no .
I was excited .
we 're bringing the first stages back , and we 're landing them on federal property on an Air Force base .
GS : yeah . so we 've got a video , this is a cropped video from others we 've shown , and then there 's a couple of new bits to it .
but basically , you 're going to lift off from a pad , you 've got a booster as well as the BFS , the Big Falcon Spaceship .
fundamentally , it 's another place to explore , and that 's what makes humans different from animals , it 's our sense of exploration and sense of wonderment and learning something new .
evaluating Egypt on this basis alone , however , ignores the real revolution .
now , let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime , and that is , SETI , I think , is important , because it 's exploration , and it 's not only exploration , it 's comprehensible exploration .
you GOTTA get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something .
now , look , a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country .
but if I have to prove who I am , I 'll never send that message .
you 're not nerds if you say yes .
so it turns out that we have upgraded .
so the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Homo sapiens ; the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around .
and as they pick that , these become bone , and then they pick another road and these become platelets , and these become macrophages , and these become T cells .
that turns out to be a big deal because now you can take , not just mouse cells , but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells .
and I 'm about to show you some stop @-@ motion footage that I made recently where you 'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour .
does anyone know ? Chi ?
and so in the past many years , we 've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking .
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers .
she had been a bright , easygoing girl .
he balked at first , but said he eventually followed the directive happily , because his stories got better and his job got easier .
in fact , the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord @-@ injured males was invented by a veterinarian .
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time .
it was the red one or the blue one .
is that it ? what 's next ?
where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this ?
now do you need towels , laundry , maids ?
and I noticed , he 's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions .
let me show you .
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
everyone is both a learner and a teacher .
it actually flies underneath Saturn .
so within the company , there 's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries .
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations , because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms .
without that , you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today .
in 2009 , they had 400,000 employees , by which time the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000 , whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000 .
Ah : Oh my God , it 's harsh up here .
and this is a good way to learn , by looking at other people 's work .
so let 's look at some projects .
or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make .
I said , " Great . what do you do ? "
I 've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like , but I 've been studying nature recently .
I was gaunt . I walked as though my legs were wooden .
Steve , both a lawyer and a psychologist , has treated many patients with severe mental illness , and to this day he 'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen .
imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand , three @-@ inch diameter , with a single difference .
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed .
and the man replied , " I 'm just an innocent schoolteacher . "
of course , criminals and terrorists weren 't the first to give guns to robots . we know where that started .
if you control the code , you control the world .
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
I mean , how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious , and in some cases life @-@ and @-@ death , circumstances ?
" I 'm not afraid to do what makes me happy . "
it 's extraordinary to watch .
there is , though , one redeeming feature of the GPS spoofer .
why not ?
so , when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish , we got a mass of blue cells .
on the right , you see it looks very ugly , the cells continue to grow , the normal ones stop .
this is what we got .
I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body .
we let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver 's seat .
and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does .
child : TV . ( children react ) Child : Oh my God .
now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side .
and some even said , this would be Stasi 2.0 .
but then after a while I realized , this is my life .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
and this is a photo now , it 's not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
after decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it 's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even .
people are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
what does this mean ?
until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor , who was looking at people and giving them meds .
DM : that 's awful .
there 's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let 's look at the first metric here , overwintering survival .
so the problems of bees today isn 't necessarily something new . it has been happening since over a thousand years ago , but what we don 't really notice are these problems in cities .
why are bees doing better in the city ?
1971 , we saw it spread to Europe and South America , and then , when we get to the 1980s , and specifically to 1987 , the varroa mite finally came to North America and to the United States , and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States .
well , really , just change your perspective .
maybe in Germany , in German language , it may be just " Aha ! "
Chinese is always cheating , right ?
it became the media .
so that 's why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government , they want the emperor to settle the problem .
so , what 's the future ?
Don 't let them hook [ up ] with the Chinese cats .
and in this particular case , this is the climax of the movie , and , you know , the weight of achieving it was simply take a model , throw it out of a helicopter , and shoot it .
and he said , " Huh , that 's pretty good . can we use it ? "
that doesn 't move . "
( laughter ) ( Applause ) " And the thing without the wheels , that moves . "
he was the master of his universe , and we wanted Hugo to feel the same way , so we created this shot .
( music ) Okay , I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the intonation was a little questionable . ( laughter ) Let 's watch just another clip .
this is going to be a piece called " aphasia , " and it 's for hand gestures synchronized to sound , and this invites yet another role , and final one I 'll share with you , which is that of the choreographer .
so for me , choreography is very much a process of physical thinking . it 's very much in mind , as well as in body , and it 's a collaborative process .
so all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand .
they 're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase .
so they 're solving this problem for me , having a little -- They 're constructing that phrase .
they 're starting it already , and this is a task @-@ based method , where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves .
I 'm going to think about it in 3D space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that 's in front of me , it 's a space that my body can go inside of .
thank you very much . ( applause ) Thank you . thank you . ( applause ) Here we go . ( applause ) ( Applause )
( laughter ) You can always fool yourself into seeing a decline if you compare bleeding headlines of the present with rose @-@ tinted images of the past .
in the 19th century , Westerners worked more than 60 hours per week .
but my science story doesn 't have that spectacular Hollywood ending .
he had taken a lot of pills and a lot of vodka .
then in February of last year , when I was on patrol in Afghanistan , I stepped on an IED .
( laughter ) But he would say , " But you 're African .
I 'm not sharing this to sensationalize Kensington .
and so I 'm here to explain what that is .
what you see here is two male chimpanzees who are the same size , but one is walking upright , has his hair up , has a big rock in his hand , and he 's the alpha male .
you don 't need to be the biggest and strongest male .
people who don 't like each other need to embrace each other and stand together , and that 's absolutely essential for the unity of the party , and if you don 't do that , the party may fall apart .
or Jenny , who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master 's degree .
they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job , and we know many students who did .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
this is from Stanford 's Computer Science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color @-@ correct that blurry red image .
so we had to come up with a different solution .
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale , and is also a useful learning strategy for the students , because they actually learn from the experience .
this is the San Francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world .
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis @-@ driven mode to the data @-@ driven mode , a transformation that , for example , has revolutionized biology .
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer .
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it 's kind of hard to miss .
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone .
so the goal here is to try and push , and see how far we can get towards the green curve .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
I was helping clean the onsen , the communal onsen , the huge giant bathtubs .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
it means that organizations mostly can 't do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
so , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
they 're ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late .
last one , this is " Who 's Going To Buy You Ribbons , " another traditional folk tune .
" the worlds are the important thing .
( music ) We know this tune , right ? we know it ?
that is " When the World 's on Fire , " a very old melody , in this case performed by the Carter Family .
you should have seen my parents ' reaction !
Bing Capital 's acquisition of Edcon , a large retailer , is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .
bellwether signs again .
but with Africa , let 's start being careful about this .
for Africa to truly be sustainable , we have to move beyond to other industries .
as the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [ we will need ] poles for rolling out electricity .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard & amp ; Poors , Moody 's and Fitch 's .
they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can 't see much else .
recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
when I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
and my heroine here -- like Satish 's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma .
if we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power .
because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
we should inventory the donations piling up here .
emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient .
but if you give locals the tools , if you show them what they can do to recover , they become experts .
over 80 percent are in low- and middle @-@ income countries , and many have no access to hearing care .
and yet , when we look back on the printing press in the early years , we like what happened .
this , graphically , was the answer . ( laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And that is indeed part of the problem , but only part .
it has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics .
the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
these days it 's very popular to believe that this push for transparency , this kind of a combination between active citizens , new technologies and much more transparency @-@ friendly legislation can restore trust in politics .
( laughter ) Now , trust , if we 're going to rebuild it , we have to understand its component parts .
would you give me some sense of whether or not you 're here voluntarily ?
( laughter ) But fortunately , it 's often the case that our logic is sound , but it 's our ability to communicate the logic that is in jeopardy .
you don 't want to have an authenticity wobble ? be you .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
and he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end , he had such popular support in London that he won .
now , you can learn three interesting things from this .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human @-@ centered design -- " Let 's figure out what people want . "
so it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution .
I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa .
it comes from popular culture .
you 've been seasoned by wind , dusk and sunlight .
you can have a camera ; you can get photos of your entire head .
Sydney . I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney .
the description read : " the suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto . "
to understand this , I think it kind of makes sense to look where we 've come from .
artists can take us to a far @-@ flung part of the city that we haven 't explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour .
we , the audience , were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal .
festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well @-@ being .
we want to get everybody out of the hole , over the social foundation and into that green doughnut itself .
cities like London , Glasgow , Amsterdam are pioneering circular city design , finding ways to turn the waste from one urban process into food for the next .
but how meaningful is this calculation , really ?
her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , speechless .
over the next two years , I watched as she switched jobs five times , eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory .
she recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes , temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village .
by opening up their lives to me , they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world .
when you talk to workers , that 's what they want .
I mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that 's not why they 're in the city , and that 's not what they care about .
all of this is happening openly , and aboveboard .
it 's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called UAC foods that 's active throughout Africa and the Middle East , but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores .
( laughter ) And when I looked up in the catalog to see how much this three @-@ foot @-@ high mouse cost , here 's how it was described ...
( laughter ) And that 's when I knew .
I see some nodding heads there .
we have a precedent for this . good old Henry II here , in the 12th century , invented the jury .
in fact , if you fly over Germany , for example , and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages , they 're all about a mile apart .
now there 's some trends that will impact cities .
it 's also involved in social interaction , understanding other people , and self @-@ awareness .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
the World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe 's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities . we can do better than that .
Hey , let 's all be interior sound designers , take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that 's effective and appropriate .
I went to my school kitchen , and I said , " Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at . "
so I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
I ran down the street and collapsed , and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming .
they kind of have this vault where they 're stored in high @-@ def , and George Lucas did all the sound effects . ( laughter ) So sometimes , remembering them , it 's like , it 's not like any other kind of memories .
but first of all , I want you to do me a favor .
where does it come from ?
and for what ?
we are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
so I 'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that 's hormones . I look at hormones .
this one is very low @-@ power .
so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it 's not just others , but it 's also ourselves .
we then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
you 're going to stay , and this is what you 're going to do .
and from day one , Noam and I decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the Web .
to anyone considering NAND2Tetris , it 's a tough journey , but you 'll be profoundly changed . "
I have to say that I 'm very glad to be here .
so that was 20 years ago , and I was always on the periphery of art .
you know , when people say , " I don 't get art .
so they 'd go to an antique shop , and they 'd look at this cup , and they 'd say , " Tell us about this cup . "
and as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , I 've spent my whole career making new media art .
now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard @-@ wired in all of us .
the interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we 've been limited , in a way .
now we have multi @-@ language , instantaneous , automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices , all the way down to smartphones .
and if any of us have used these , we know that they 're not perfect , but they 're decent .
not anymore .
it was written by an algorithm .
I want to ask : what have been the most important developments in human history ?
so when you do this and when you plot the data , you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions .
they don 't run on capital , they don 't run on labor .
we CANNOT know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information .
they connect in a manhole like this . literally , this is where the 5,000 @-@ mile cable plugs in .
well , I became a tapestry historian .
( applause ) Thank you , thank you . ( applause )
all you do , go into the timeline , double @-@ click the item , and I 've set it to Toronto , because that 's where I 'm from .
feelings are tunnels .
there 's an area of your brain you 've probably heard referred to as the " reward center . "
it 's actually three intertwined but separable systems .
how bad ? "
number 13 : on occasion , the victim , female or male , may experience a physical response , but this is not a sexual response in the sense of desire or mutuality . "
this brings me one step closer into the darkness , and then I promise we will find our way into the light .
that kind of story can give a person all kind of feelings , from rage to shame to confused arousal because it is sex @-@ related , even though it is appalling .
I can see it helping people , even as I say the words .
but do have one brave conversation .
one in six men .
say it to a judge you know or a lawyer you know , or a cop or anyone who might sit on a jury in a sexual assault case .
so for every brave conversation you have , thank you .
thanks .
en : the question I get asked most often is actually the question underneath pretty much all the other questions , so , can you get addicted to your vibrator , please help me with my erectile dysfunction ?
like , do you just want normal sex or do you want awesome sex in your life ?
every street is generally perceived as a straight line , and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make .
the cognitive map in your mind may tell you , " Aris , go back to the main cathedral square , take a 90 @-@ degree turn and walk down that other side street . "
the second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines .
she 'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work , and ... " go past that church where I got married , " that kind of thing .
so we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning .
you might add little symbols along the way .
if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you 've just drawn , you 'd realize your streets and the distances -- they 'd be way off .
no , what you 've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic .
of course , what you don 't know is that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart .
I researched how each and every bus route moved through the city , nice and logical , every bus route a separate line .
okay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive .
but it 's not an easy road . after the bomb , the victims are not into this .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @-@ up calls for us ?
what else do we need ?
here 's some sobering statistics just to give you an idea .
they certainly do .
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being .
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonderland .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
I 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
it 's actually about three percent .
a second reason has to do with peer pressure .
he 's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants , the answer is about 24 percent . that 's their guess .
and they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
that was not my intention . I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book .
slightly embarrassing admission : even when I was a kid , I used to have these little spy books , and I would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down .
our printing press is the Internet . our coffee houses are social networks .
so there 's a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there 's a few more coming on board .
in America , you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act .
this is from an anti @-@ gay website , where they said gays are " worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices . "
and what they 've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you .
that 's the first line of defense for the body .
what it is , it 's a lamination of two different metals together .
my initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know @-@ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
what I and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional MRI brain scanner .
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
it 's very slow .
and I say back into the job market , because this is not new .
in short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
and it 's going to have an impact .
these three brain systems -- lust , romantic love and attachment -- don 't always go together .
with orgasm , then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment .
in fact , you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else .
and these drugs are going generic .
you fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your " love map , " an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .
and I CANNOT remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I CANNOT recall a day without it .
wounds are scary , they are nasty , they are icky , it is why most of us look away when we donate blood .
in all those years , with that guy chained to my side , I got a lot done .

nobody ? one ? how about 10 years ?
this bat is myotis brandtii . it 's the longest @-@ living bat .
we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it , and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks .
they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries .
but you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin , Missouri , they get that sense of community back .
music : DJ Shadow .
( music ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Pretty cool , huh ? we think so .
you just didn 't want to respond to that person that time .
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it 's not going to be accurate all the time .
first , lying online can be very dangerous , right ?
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do I want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon .
you need first funds .
( shooting noises ) The name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
well , I 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
it 's better than those that don 't play .
so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
[ " yellow " ] DB : Red . audience : yellow .
right ? so these kinds of results really makes two main points .
the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .

I soaked it up and I thought , " How could I ever have taken this for granted ? "
how beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island .
but that 's still not reason for us to disengage , because we 've seen that movie before , in Afghanistan .
what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can 't see . it 's the way our eyes are built .
in fact , I think my kids will be the first Vikings who will have a hard time growing a beard when they become older .
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source , and in this case , these guys were New York food bloggers .
and that , I guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
so for me , it 's a collaboration .
but it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate .
so there you have it : the evolution of a headline .
so when this came up in my local shop , naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims .
so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @-@ year @-@ old standing in that exact spot .
you have Palestine @-@ Loves @-@ Israel .
and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe [ with ] effort , we can avoid it .
the American people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issues , to fiscal issues , are moderate , pragmatic centrists .
you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a Keynesian liberal economist , and these people didn 't go to each other 's weddings , they snubbed each other at conferences .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , Jake .
the verb is the chassis of the sentence .
you can also say , " Biff went from sick to well . "
the mind that we rely upon to be happy , content , emotionally stable as individuals , and at the same time , to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others .
let 's say this is an anxious thought .
if you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth .
and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it 's actually ready .
the males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go .
once again , the same process repeats .
think of it like this .
so my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books .
Mrs. Alisch was there . Mr. Shilale was there . Mrs. Casey was there .
and for him , it 's only his second .
and I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights .
and she responded with , " I 'm here . " ( laughter ) That 's true . you are alive , and that 's pretty good right now .
all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving Celine with no alternatives .
now , I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally @-@ funded research .
I 'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , so attractive for these HIV clinical trials ?
public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate .
the final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me , in six seconds .
and I hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .

I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .

and vitamin D has had a great deal of press , and a lot of people get concerned about it .
my grandmother grew up in Glasgow , back in the 1920s and ' 30s when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in .
and the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great .
anyway , I came back from Australia , and despite the obvious risks to my health , I moved to Aberdeen .
but I also became interested in research , and in particular I became interested in this substance , nitric oxide .
it arises in the skin .
and I was interested in these really complex systems .
" you didn 't shave . " " but sir - " " No , don 't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning .
and you know what , they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant .

and so they said , " Look , let 's take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens . "
it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low @-@ income areas , because they 're not getting the gift of a good start .

last April , I went back to a very strange -- what I called a deranged high school reunion .
what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo , and I don 't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .

it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible .
it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent .
but this is different .
to explain what this means and what this thing is , please let me quickly take a couple of steps back .
I ended up in physics by accident .
and it gets even better , because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence .
the nodes in the network are the system 's components , and the links are given by the interactions .
and it has implications for systemic risk .
so we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007 .

I was in a land of plenty .
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya .
I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman .
I wanted to do something .
and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she 's walking to school , the mother is blamed for that .
if she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she 's punished .
we gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .

the patient says , " Well , if it 's metallic and shiny , it doesn 't mean it 's gold .
I think in nonfiction real @-@ time storytelling , there are a lot of really excellent examples as well .
so sustainability , which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability .
doing so isn 't easy , but it can be done , it has been done , and it 's being done now in more than a few cities , around the globe and in our country .
so it creates , in essence , an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
this is a histology slide of what we see when we do that , and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone .
about eight years ago , people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower .
today , they live in this area , approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people , who live in this community of self @-@ built multi @-@ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
I think there 's way , way more of these .
this is the very first one I could find .
and so there 's autoplay , where it just keeps playing these videos over and over and over in a loop , endlessly for hours and hours at a time .
and this stuff really , really does affect small children .
it 's like , how much do we really understand -- by agency , I mean : how we know how to act in our own best interests .
so all of these things we 're working to address within this are not going to be addressed just by building the technology better , but actually by changing the society that 's producing these technologies .
HW : James , it 's such an important discussion , and I know many people here are really open and prepared to have it , so thanks for starting off our morning .

second : Regulation .
those have such a wide turning radius , that we have to deploy an enormous amount of pavement , of asphalt , to accommodate them .
now , don 't get me wrong , please -- I am all for pedestrian safety , firefighting and certainly , wheelchair access .
it 's a fear of difference , and architects hear this all the time from their clients : " if I try that new idea , will I be sued ?

we didn 't stop with the lung on a chip .
ships have automation now .

today , not so much has changed .
fundraising was not an easy task .
I started to build a prototype like that .
and see now , we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings , but we often don 't have so much material .
if you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball , it gets really small , hard and dense .
but the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving , because it 's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that 's slowly sliding down the mountain .
we had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole .
to make a cave map , you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave , and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations .
then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings .
there was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier .
it was so cold outside , we actually had to sleep inside the cave .
well not too much lives in them because they 're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year .
someone who is , as the Italians say , " gagootz . "
and let me tell you this story .
that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus .
and they tried everything they had .

things change .
something from childhood comes back to haunt you .
through this act of immense open @-@ heartedness , he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call " ubuntu . "
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet .
now these studies are ingenious , but they 're simple .
and it stays with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical organism .
by 2010 , Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis .
there are very important people , business and land assets in Detroit , and there are real opportunities there .
well , I could think of a million things , but there 's what you want and what you can have , and ' Oumuamua was moving away and fading very rapidly .
so this is about all the time we were going to have to study it easily .
we 're part of a much larger environment , and in fact , we may even be surrounded by interstellar visitors and not even know it .
will future technologies like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope help us detect these things sooner ?
JI : awesome , thanks so much . let 's thank Karen again .
industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see , hear , feel a lot more than ever before , generating prodigious amounts of data .
they are self @-@ aware , they are predictive , reactive and social .
it 's self @-@ learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss .
or take healthcare .
second , there is a concern that in the future , there will only be room for engineers , data scientists , and other highly @-@ specialized workers .
they 've made our lives healthier and more rewarding .
we also saw that our users had modified it in other ways .
it 's an expedition of some 30 people .
he approaches as the red truck successfully stops .

I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology .
and the trick that Richard Dawkins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
this is not on another planet . these are things that are hidden away on our planet .
and if we take the long @-@ term trends of life , if we begin to say , what does evolution want ? there 's several things that we see .
in fact , you can buy , for 50 bucks , a stone @-@ age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago .
that 's the definition of " infinite game . " a finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing .
that 's what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms .
imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints .
all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology . this is the infinite game .
and if you play that well , you 'll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone .
five years after a diet , most people have regained the weight .
what if we told all those dieting girls that it 's okay to eat when they 're hungry ?
and Andrew had been doing his own bits of research , and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from studying the literature was that there 's actually a big bottleneck .
so we took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open @-@ source license to anybody that wanted it .

to see what European sculpture and decorative arts looked like , beyond those Renaissance collections with which I was so already familiar .
there was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and , in fact , if there was any emotion going on , it was a kind of repulsion .
( laughter ) So , I started thinking about why it was , in fact , that I disliked this object so much .
where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy .
it was a Dumbo nightmare . ( laughter ) But something more profound was happening as well .
the label had told me that these pieces were made by the S√®vres Manufactory , made of porcelain in the late 1750s , and designed by a designer called Jean @-@ Claude duPlessis , actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned .
but , that tutu for example -- actually , this is a piece that does dance in its own way .
we 've eliminated , in a sense , that constant of the imagination that these vases represented in people 's lives .
I think it 's beginning to happen .
and it 's based , actually , on a more elevated piece of porcelain .
I used to play it on the guitar , you know .
usually , when we feel annoyed , hatred or upset with someone , or obsessed with something , the mind goes again and again to that object .
and now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time .
but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates , in fact , to the basic pillars of management .

you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the buffers that make us self @-@ sufficient .
just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
now , when you experience fear , your sympathetic nervous system kicks in .
( music ) Thank you .
it 's also been a real issue in terms of access .
we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
so why are we fighting it in the classroom ?
so rather than driving our kids into a classroom , herding them out there at 8 o 'clock in the morning -- I hated going to class at 8 o 'clock in the morning , so why are we forcing our kids to do that ?
they can rewind the professor .
some are never graded .
and these kinds of technologies really help , the blended model can really help revolutionize education .
so basically , they couldn 't be scaled or transferred to other places .
and every single judge in the United States of America can use it , because it 's been created on a universal data set .
well , I 'm a science journalist and multimedia producer , who has always been fascinated by gross stuff .
people online , and sometimes even in real life , were disrespectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
how about from Whiteboy77AGS : " people always need something to ( female dog ) about . "
in a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
for most people , these experiences disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize .
that then stirs up the same feelings of panic and helplessness as if they 're experiencing the trauma all over again .
so how would you divide a 4x4 , 10x10 , or 32x32 canvas ?
" about 115 milligrams oxycodone , " I responded .
what happened next really came to define my entire experience of medical trauma .
the result , put another way , was hell .
I would sweat profusely almost constantly , and yet if I managed to get myself out into the hot August sun , I might look down and find myself covered in goosebumps .
you can 't make that one up .
and one day , I was thinking about how all data has a location , and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face .
here 's Mount Pinatubo in the early ' 90s . that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb @-@ like cloud .
that 's what the world looks like , under one particular climate model 's view , with twice the amount of CO2 in the air .
the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their labs .
there 's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
it 's using this as risk control , not instead of action .
I 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
and I 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on steroids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
it could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
so to us , I think we 're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that 's also got a sort of musical @-@ like quality to it , an instrument .
so here 's a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
and here is a prototype .
it comes out of the idea of a window .
this is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it 's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
( laughter ) Thank you .
and so , given this one equation , it 's natural to ask , so what can you do with this ?
but it 's not true ! we only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds .
it is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness .
forty percent food waste is a major problem .
but that 's really big in the U.K.
they 'd say , " Leyla , how do I make it technically efficient ? "
or , " How do I make it green materials ?
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
building on this strength , they attracted investment and started to process , being able to export higher @-@ value products like starch from cassava .
hence , Saminu left to the city , where he soon realized that life was not easy .
but if we can tap into commercial debt , it is a small number -- only 0.1 percent of all the debt in the world today , 10 cents out of every 100 dollars .
I think it 's reckless to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long @-@ term returns .
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
the aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments , which have fallen for two consecutive years .
but it took an innocent question from my then @-@ four @-@ year @-@ old daughter to make me appreciate that .
so I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon .
now interestingly , the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network .
there were no strangers . right ?
it 's about 40 kilowatt @-@ hours .
so you can really wrap a business around that .
ca : cool . thank you for that .
so it 's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that underly the Internet .
and it 's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn 't going to be possible in the few months that they had .
in one Saturday afternoon , they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions , but more importantly than that , they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government .
and I 'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation .
they actually love it .
here , I discovered something obvious : wilderness is our natural habitat , too .
now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions .
and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English @-@ specific .
and that 's evident here with the slower conduction .
John I saw just last week in the clinic .
but I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka .
and I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration , repair and hope .
[ " I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist ; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous . " ] So they didn 't think much of him then .
drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this .
that 's straightforward , because that 's what pluripotent cells can do .
but crucially , you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts , ideally from an unaffected relative .
that way , you 're matching for genetic variation .
so here I 've asked John what his hopes are for the future .
and as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
and , in fact , if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around this cluster .
so that was very big .
this is in false color .
and the question is , if it 's not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
so , it 's very funny .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul , not just a trimming at the margins .
after my neurosurgery , part of my brain was missing , and I had to deal with that .
but even if we don 't run across it in our lifetimes , we can still think there is one out there , and we 're just trying to get closer and closer to it .
I collect branding irons that were used to mark slaves as property .
I collect shackles for adults and restraints for adults as well as children .
it 's a caviar @-@ vending machine .
( laughter ) These are people who don 't necessarily regularly engage with science .
this is what that looked like .
and it started to make me think about a couple of things .
I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal .
now , when we go , fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta , reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24 @-@ hour competition .
but in fact , the change is actually already happening .
so , people like to call Africa a mobile @-@ first continent , but actually it 's mobile @-@ only , so while everybody else is doing all of those things , we 're solving the world 's problems .
males have a spiked , barbed penis that they literally stab into the female , and they don 't stab it anywhere near her vagina .
was there a neurological cause for their condition ?
the heavy metal door slammed shut behind me .
when you think about it , it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth .
but the travel options are very limited ; plane tickets cost nearly half of their monthly salary .
now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only 14 , that male puberty is early in this family , because he looks more like a 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
time and again , a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible , irrational , inconsistent with values already held .
and yes , this is ambitious , but there is momentum on this issue , and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum , and it 's just starting on this issue .
you really can make this change happen .
now , a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word .
global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .
but it didn 't even slow down the animal .
and in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot .
when you touched the cockroach leg , what did it feel like ?
we discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone .
and here is RiSE .
as a sysadmin , you had access to their systems , and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June 's revelations .
they were only tried by a secret court .
the NSA was previously asked by Congress , was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted .
the prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe .
ca : but it 's alleged that you 've stolen 1.7 million documents .
ca : come here , because I want to ask you about this particular revelation .
it 's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here , but I see them .
( applause ) I mean , The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you .
and even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 , 74 shuttle flight , the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so -- one in 35 , one in 40 .
you get lighter and lighter , the force gets on us heavier and heavier .
until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we 're weightless .
so I think absolutely , folks do have a right to privacy , and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected .
now what you 'll see people say publicly is there is no " but for " case , and so there is no case where , but for that , the threat would have happened .
this is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government , and President Madison would have been proud .
when people have the knowledge , they can find solutions without having to helped out .
and I went and searched , and this is what I found .
you 're working because you want to change the world .
until the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life .
but when she enters her teens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort .
is it maybe protecting its siblings ?
now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
this is Toxoplasma gondii , or Toxo , for short , because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname .
estimates vary a lot , but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains .
now typically , this doesn 't lead to any overt illness .
it didn 't look all that special from the outside , as I said , but when we walked inside , I was immediately struck by three things : first of all , it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside .
but I wondered , what about when it rained ?
Bionics has defined my physicality .
technology is inadequate .
how do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone ?
indeed , Bionics is making a profound difference in people 's lives .
we the people need not accept our limitations , but can transcend disability through technological innovation .
it is her expression . it is her art form .
he wasn 't sharing in my celebration .
I 'm not going to fail that .
and as we have marched , people around the country have begun to say , " Can we do the same thing in our state ? "
thank you very much .
so when I was eight years old , I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries .
but the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger , roiling pot of universal stuff .
there was a lot we didn 't know .
Ma : yeah , in ' 97 , we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world , and we kept saying to ourselves , " Well that can 't be .
and I kept hearing from women , over and over and over , the more I traveled , " I want to be able to use this shot . "
we go from 20 million not long after I was born to now we 're down to about six million .
measles was killing a couple million a year .
that 's down to a few hundred thousand .
we can actually accelerate the progress .
but we don 't every minute together , that 's for sure .
BG : because we built this thing together from the beginning , it 's this great partnership .
she 's got a lot of insight .
thank you .
so here you see a familiar sight .
they not only look desolate , they feel downright dangerous .
but architects love them .
our city couldn 't possibly handle any more cars .

so this is Anna Hazare , and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting @-@ edge digital activist in the world today .

the game is really one of coevolution , and coevolution is , in this particular picture , between cheetahs and gazelles .

now if you do this , it can be mathematically proven , in fact , that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances of finding the perfect partner .
a Valentine 's Day card like this .
now , you can be forgiven , perhaps for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation .
so those are my top three tips of how maths can help you with love and relationships .
but then something happened , something that wasn 't predicted , that no one could have anticipated .
if you could read it , you would understand me .
it shows that computers can listen and understand .
here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday .
so what do they do next ?
and we got more effort , more strategies , more engagement over longer periods of time , and more perseverance when they hit really , really hard problems .
and we can actually change students ' mindsets .
some of the people said , " I 'm a German girl .
there were demonstrations of veterans in front of the Art Institute of Chicago .
that action and the subsequent legal and political battle led to a landmark First Amendment decision that prevented the government from demanding patriotism be mandatory .

so I came home once again and said to my mom , " Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure , that I should be having orgasms , and that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris . "
apparently , white men have a problem finding the clitoris .
culture should not be a defense for child abuse .
weeks later , we met at the local Starbucks , and I started right in with the tough @-@ love budget conversation .
I know that we can break free from the grips of money shame , because I did .

MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment center , as many of you know , in the area .
we know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus and probably sickened by it .

the idea is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter and improves your performance on IQ tests .
now , what 's also really interesting , that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it .

these caterpillars didn 't do anything for their own welfare .
so I said , I 'm going to do something else .
and you say , ah , I need some leisure time , and so forth .
why are we building these headquarters ?
and so the courses are World Cup Soccer , or building a bicycle .
but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon .
I was awkward , insecure , and I hated it .
that 's huge .

a hostile artificial intelligence called NIM has taken over the world 's computers .
a toroid , for those who don 't know , is the surface of a doughnut or , for some of us , a bagel .
the toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building : every beam in this building is the same radius , all laminated wood .
and so I made a counter @-@ proposal : I said , " No building . " there was a cave on the site ; we tunnel into the hill , descend through the rock into an underground chamber .
let 's get back to the town and walk to the site . "
and this is where it is ; it 's sort of evolving .

but what do we know about maintaining our psychological health ?
we decided to splurge , and that week , we would talk for 10 minutes .

one such example finds three monks debating a temple flag rippling in the wind .
two things : number one , ACEs are incredibly common .

I said , " You mean he rented all five of them in one hour ? "
she 'll be with us as we drive , she 'll help us manage the children .
five of the grandchildren are boys .
and my response to that is this : " I don 't have the luxury of being angry , and I also know the consequences of being enraged . "

Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met .
we wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die .
aid is not doing too well .
perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition .
if you examine newspaper or magazine articles , you 'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS .
I 'm not saying women don 't get some of these symptoms .
but it gets strange , because even at that slice of reality that we call home , we 're not seeing most of the action that 's going on .
okay , just like the movies .
so light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view , and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen , we could control this process .

America today is a sprightly young body , hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side , while leaving the other worryingly perfect .
what I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life .

this guy is an American . his name 's Graham Allison .
there 's another country too , and that 's called the U.S.
and worldwide , act further , like you 've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart .
but the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America @-@ China relationship , and the possibilities of China 's future engagement in the world .
I think it 's time , across the world , that we 're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind .
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them , blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us .
together , this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky , like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System , and also how much light they receive from their parent sun .
2014 was the hottest year on record .
these planetary @-@ scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course .
each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Solar System .
Mars is small and rocky , and though it 's a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler .
our rovers , like Curiosity , crawl across its surface , scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it .

I asked my father if I cried when I was a baby and he says I did not .
and that 's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
but the fact is , it 's because I didn 't draw them on the same scale .
we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency -- basically , young kids and babies , because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation .
and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life , and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us .
BF : good idea . ( laughter ) Let 's leave that . we 'll leave that door open .
RW : in all past years I 've rehearsed with them , the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what 's going to happen and that 's the truth .

well , actually , it is .
it 's not something specific to humans -- it 's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better .
some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet , shown here in white .
in this image , I 'm interested in where this white blob forms and if , as a result , there 's any relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material .
then again , when do we ever know where love 's first flutter will truly take us .
and now , a few years later , I 've led several expeditions to the ultimate far @-@ flung corner on this planet , the Sahara .

Isadora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue curtain , and she would stand with her hands over her solar plexus and she would wait , and she would wait , and then , she would move .

( music ) Where are we ?
so rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features , we create algorithms that learn , often from raw perceptual data .
but in computers , signals can travel at the speed of light .
suppose we give an A.I. the goal to make humans smile .
a few years ago , we started a company called Backyard Brains and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight , and I want to do some demonstrations .
so here 's an object , and in this case , it 's a wire figure in the shape of a human , and we 're going to film that object with just a regular camera .
2 @-@ stage rockets with video cameras on them , onboard computers logging their flights , rocket gliders that fly back to Earth .

a restaurant with an open @-@ air kitchen .
today , monogamy is one person at a time .
I 've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference .
( laughter ) It applies to you .
and alchemy is the key word here , because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving , can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking .
as Marcel Proust said , it 's our imagination that is responsible for love , not the other person .
" can I ever trust anyone again ? "
and Heather realizes these are not for her .
she also tells me that her father had affairs , but her mother , she found one little receipt in the pocket , and a little bit of lipstick on the collar .
so for the partner who had the affair , for Nick , one thing is to end the affair , but the other is the essential , important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife .
what were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me ?
in other words , the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage .
the main question that I 've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about infidelity is , for or against ?
narrator : number one , keep it simple .
Tommy was a chimpanzee . we found him in that cage .
they 're two young male chimpanzees who are being used for biomedical , anatomical research at Stony Brook .
I mean , to me , this was it . life could not get any better .
there was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot , where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site .
but to me , that trip was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches .
we were in this tiny , remote fjord , just inside the Arctic Circle .
you traveled all this way , and this is exactly what you 've been waiting for : freezing cold conditions with perfect waves .
but that was the point that I felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me , and what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full @-@ on blizzard , and I started to lose perception of where I was .
and I don 't know if it was delirium setting in or what , but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time .
lesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff , every class was recorded and reported on , every room was bugged , and every conversation , overheard .
they had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs .
these students , however , were simply told what to think , and they obeyed .
and while people may have the genitals of a male or a female , the genitals don 't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity .
but finally , for 25,000 dollars and agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get , they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug .
they said , " Oh , Martine , there 's no medicine for Jenesis .
we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape .
it was a four @-@ minute and 27 @-@ second descent .
because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system , we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that , and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon .
( laughter ) So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video , but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release .
actually , what we expect is what we call our next @-@ generation Hubble telescope .
but I didn 't start out wanting to be a part of somebody 's crime reduction strategy .
you would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night , and to the untrained ear , it sounded like fireworks , but it was gunfire .
I was doing funerals of 18 @-@ year @-@ olds , 17 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact .
you all have heard of rap music , right ?
and he said , " Don 't do that again , Rev. "
( laughter ) But I preached and I built these programs , and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference .
they met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester , and they were killed .
and as a result of that , we said to them , " How do you see this church , how do you see this institution helping this situation ? "
after 9 / 11 , the FBI was given an edict : never again .
to do this , agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 informants nationwide , all looking for anyone who might be dangerous .
but here 's what 's interesting : the lead undercover agent -- you can see him in this picture with his face blurred -- would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on .
he 's one of more than 175 so @-@ called terrorists , for whom the FBI has created Hollywood endings .
how can you back this up ?
I 've got the family , spent the better part of a day talking with them .
I 'm setting it up and I 'm setting up , and the light 's just about to go , and I want it to be golden , I want it to be beautiful .
and they start screaming , and then one of the men turns around and starts screaming , shouting , and the whole tree collapses , not the tree , but the people in the tree .
what 's your story ? who are you ? "
it was about a boyfriend . the girl on the top , she 'd kissed the wrong boy , and they 'd started having a fight .
I had to get to know every single one of them , right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who .
I wanted to put these people on a pedestal .
until , it was quite amusing , about a year ago somebody said , " You 've been invited to do a TED Talk . "
he said , " No , a TED Talk . " I said , " But who 's Ted ?
and I thought , okay , chief dying , right , you know , look up at the stars again , look at the campfire .
let 's find out .
it doesn 't get better than that .
of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can 't make them work .
human minds generate research and discovery , and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater , and human minds take care of other humans : our old , our young , our sick .
in the years to come , we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even envision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
when we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we knew there 's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here 's an example of it : there 's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
here 's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically .
these are pictures over about a six @-@ second period .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple ; it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
with bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
Uber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too .
you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
why ?
because she had saved me .
you probably think about a young girl or woman , who 's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp .
we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl .
forced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking .
and it 's found in cotton fields , and coltan mines , and even car washes in Norway and England .
they then located winners of the green card lottery , and they told them , " We 'll help you out .
so what have we done about it ?
having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty , leave abuse , or leave prostitution , if that person so desires .
I 'd like to add one more element to that .
they worked so hard they fainted in the fields .
and don 't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you ? "
I found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor , and God knows who else .
a confession : I am an archaeologist and a museum curator , but a paradoxical one .
yet these claims pale in comparison to those made by Native Americans .
in the 1880s , anthropologists began to collect them as evidence of American Indian religion .
they came to be seen as beautiful , the precursor to the stark sculptures of Picasso and Paul Klee , helping to usher in the modern art movement .
after things were quickly under control , I immediately called a meeting in the school 's auditorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal .
we took the chains off the front doors of the school .
that brings me to my second slogan : so what ? now what ?
they are clear about my expectations for them , and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system .
then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe , again because it looks that way .
then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way .
thank you very much .
so I think that we 'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it .
so class , hopefully you 'll recognize what you just heard me say as the -- ?
right ? this was also known as a mobile phone .
and the valence is actually quite negative , so you must have been a big fan .
women in their 20s smile a lot more than men the same age , perhaps a necessity for dating .
we are expressive when we 're emailing , texting , shopping online , or even doing our taxes .
in education , imagine if your learning apps sense that you 're confused and slow down , or that you 're bored , so it 's sped up , just like a great teacher would in a classroom .
so what if I click this down to zero ?
we have a wonderful 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter , who did all my illustrations .
you don 't need to worry , though : that I am not fully human is one of the things that my family loves the most about me .
we get there at 10 o 'clock , the scheduled start time , and we are handed number 59 .
there is no middle , there is no gray , just polarity .
polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other ; a diametrical opposition .
but if we are pulled in these two directions , but it 's not really where we exist -- polarity is not our actual reality -- where do we go from there ?
can we have the courage to hold both things ?
her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico .
( laughter ) That line actually went the other way .
but we were united by our similarities , not separated by our differences .
she left , did the same thing -- it was a 10 @-@ second conversation , such a short interaction .
it wasn 't Jesus or Ash .
or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective ?
now , when you put all of this together , what you get is something called social capital .
I have passionate opinions about gender equality , but I worry that to freely accept the label of " feminist , " would not be fair to good feminists .
( laughter ) So , what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation , has become a thing .
( laughter ) Think about it .
so over the next eight years , Bonica would talk about it .
Kanner knew about this competing paper , but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work .
bacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes .
and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality .
now , conventional wisdom would say that we 'll just take these driver assistance systems and we 'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them , and over time , they 'll turn into self @-@ driving cars .
similarly , the orange box on the side here , it 's a school bus , and we have to treat that differently as well .
and when a police officer stood in the road , our vehicle should understand that this means stop , and when they signal to go , we should continue .
Capt A : listen ... saving that kid is all that matters .
maybe there 's something we can learn here .
g : you 're my bestie , we 'll always be together !
as a four @-@ year @-@ old child , it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine .
age 10 , it was saving my school dinner money change .
every single day for eight years , I had mashed potato and baked beans , which cost 4p each , and gravy was free .
I felt like my life depended on that moment , and incredibly , he said yes .
after three months at sea , age just 24 , I finished in second position .
materials would be defined as either technical or biological , waste would be designed out entirely , and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term .
all of this sounds amazing , but these aren 't just ideas , they 're real today , and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy .
so how would you shift from linear to circular ?
I believe yes .
the pick @-@ and @-@ roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players , two on offense and two on defense .
it turns out in modern basketball , this pick @-@ and @-@ roll is perhaps the most important play .
and knowing how to run it , and knowing how to defend it , is basically a key to winning and losing most games .
it would make our lives a lot easier , but it turns out movement is very messy .
coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations .
can it know more than person could know ?
we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances ?
( laughter ) Those are NBA players .
people who are good are at the top , bad at the bottom .
Miami was down by three , there was 20 seconds left .
a gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie .
and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second , and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before .
down three .
[ calculating shot probability ] [ Shot quality ] [ Rebound probability ] Won 't go !
tie game with five seconds left .
( laughter ) That 's roughly how it happened .
( applause ) So when the bill passed , we texted them back , " Thank you for supporting the bill . "
now , in Malawi , 18 is the legal marriage age , from 15 to 18 .
we can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain .
we can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people .
and these are actually 15 different typologies I 've been collecting over time , and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor .
you probably couldn 't find more disparate topics , yet they are using the same metaphor , the same visual model , to map the never @-@ ending complexities of its own subject .
but networks are not just a scientific metaphor .
this is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement .
how would I know what the right decision was ?
coming of age on the beaches of Southern California , I grew up in the middle of our nation 's abortion wars .
I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade .
everyone was pro @-@ life .
and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life .
the first thing we did was create a talk @-@ line , where women and men could call to get emotional support .
Jeanie , Will and Adina are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship .
we often think that as we age , we lose the desires held in our youth .
I didn 't do it as well , but we managed to get Youssou N 'Dour , Sting , Tracy Chapman , and Bruce Springsteen to go ' round the world for Amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
at first , we were safe in the camp .
but later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot .
so it 's not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it 's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn 't be presented before .
the two @-@ headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds , in forward or reverse .
he says , " Well , reading is this junk they give me in little books to read .
the child read beautifully , it turned out , and was really very competent . so it actually meant something .
he 's from England , and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn .
this is Carl .
but that 's just not the case .
people have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia .
and the idea is that what 's true for a person will also be true for the white rat .
well , the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them .
people would admit shameful secrets about themselves , and other people would say , " Oh my God , I 'm exactly the same . "
I think they were clueless : I think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasingly horrific reality .
Justine was fired , of course , because social media demanded it .
and of course , that 's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for , like having children out of wedlock .
what 's true is that we are clever and stupid ; what 's true is that we 're grey areas .
( laughter ) The key phrase is " was , " phew .
imagine what it would be like if the English alphabet had four letters .
I don 't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras , which are recording what I 'm saying .
human rights , just like God and heaven , are just a story that we 've invented .
( laughter ) To conclude , then : we humans control the world because we live in a dual reality .
when I rented a gun , the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind , until I showed him my New York City driver 's license .
the reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind .
shortly after , Charles Minard charted Napoleon 's march on Moscow , illustrating how an army of 422,000 dwindled to just 10,000 as battles , geography and freezing temperatures took their toll .
( laughter ) Sometimes I produce code to quickly generate graphics from thousands of data points .
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings I liked or not .
and after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sketches on napkins .
three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings saying we 'd won the competition .
couldn 't find it .
and when I got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
you go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there 's another bridge here .
I say , " I 'm not going to do it anymore -- I don 't want to do it anymore -- I 'm not going to do it . "
my personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm .
my family finally rescued me , but by that time , I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks , as well as developing severe anemia , and was on the verge of suicide .
in addition , we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world , in real time .
we were hungry .
we all feel the same things .
thank you for giving me a voice . "
in the US , the average American spends three percent of their income on energy .
look -- given our rockets to Mars and our pocket @-@ sized AI , we have the tools to address these systemic inequities .
cost of renewables , insulation , microgrids and smart home technology are all decreasing .
our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities , utilities and government agencies alike to provide equitable access to clean energy , energy efficiency and energy technology .
in fact , there is a 47 @-@ billion @-@ dollar home @-@ energy affordability gap , so assistance alone is not sustainable .
but for this pill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stomach , intestines and various other organs first .
one day , I sat and thought , " Can we deliver anti @-@ HIV directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? "
before you even know it , the induced hole becomes immediately repaired .
so , after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call -- anytime , anywhere -- you might imagine that government officials are not very happy .
and so , my message to you is this : we need to use these tools .
and what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood .
and by and large , factors that we know are required for the development of tissues , for the maintenance of tissues -- they start to decrease as we get older , while factors involved in repair , in injury and in inflammation -- they increase as we get older .
and what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group , about half the factors changed significantly .
and the way this looks is shown in this graph .
so in our lab , we 're trying to understand these factors better , and many other groups are trying to understand , what are the true aging factors , and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age @-@ related diseases ?
so to summarize , we find the old mouse , and its brain in particular , are malleable .
young blood factors can reverse aging , and what I didn 't show you -- in this model , the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old .
zoom in a bit more .
watch the two white balls .
we still don 't know yet how important it is ; this is still an open question .
it 's an object that behaves like a wave , so that it doesn 't just move in one direction or the other , but can follow multiple pathways at the same time .
two quantum @-@ entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth 's magnetic field .
we don 't know if it 's the correct explanation , but wow , wouldn 't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate ?
it 's an extreme form of dengue fever , a mosquito @-@ born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine , and kills 22,000 people each year .
and that we know , in order to have great relationships and relationships built on trust , that we 're going to have to have communication .
and of course now they have relatively quieter bar nights .
that 's why the NYPD , along with other departments throughout the United States , are training all of their officers in implicit bias .
that 's another key component .
and number three : we must also make sure that truth and telling facts is painful .
TK : so we do know there is a better way .
but it 's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this .
you 've got things like this fixed @-@ wing , this hawk .
what are the odds that the experts , your chemical engineer , your railroad transportation engineers , have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have ?
we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS .
and I 'll just show you one .
and after AIMS , Shehu wanted to do high @-@ energy physics , and he came to Cambridge .
well , it 's not my TED wish ; it 's our wish , as you 've already gathered .
it 's very remote , it 's very dry and it 's very beautiful .
we have an array of existing telescopes already , in the Andes mountains in Chile , and that 's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability .
and if you can imagine this tiny area , it 's only one @-@ fiftieth of the size of the full moon .
( applause ) It also includes a number of institutions across the United States , including Harvard University , the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions , and the Universities of Arizona , Chicago , Texas @-@ Austin and Texas A & amp ; M University .
this happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona .
it 's tucked away under 52,000 seats .
it 's what allows us to have the precision that we will have .
what gets measured gets done .
so you have to keep on top of the business .
and in fact , bringing science into the investing world has improved that world .
( applause ) CA : Jim , here 's another project that you 've supported philanthropically : research into origins of life , I guess .
JS : well , I 'll save that for a second .
and what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live .
there are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness , and into ever older age .
( applause ) So you can have a law , but it 's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it .
so both men and women got a lot out of it , but different things .
if you need some inspiration to jog your memory , read Octavia Butler 's " Parable of the Sower . "
so the black woman says to the white woman , " When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror , what do you see ? "
privilege is invisible to those who have it . "
now remember , I was the only man in this group , so when I witnessed this , I went , " Oh no . "
( laughter ) So let me be very clear : white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world .
their children have lower rates of absenteeism , higher rates of achievement .
so the store actually did really well .
but it brought in so many people -- teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody -- because it was street level . it was open to the public .
so they opened this place . inside , it 's like a Costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form .
there are a million ways .
so , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
if you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who 's our director of national programs . he 'll be on the phone .
and he 'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
by yourself ?
so the article was published online on a Friday evening , and by Saturday , this had happened to the traffic on my blog .
I understand that this is part of the deal .
( laughter ) It 's an issue for all of us , and it 's an issue where we need more and more momentum .
and that 's what we have to do .
and then what happened ?
and I got total popsicle head , if anyone 's ever swam in the Bay , and I 'm trying to just thaw my face out , and I 'm watching people finish .
this was not fatigue .
how can a human being come from a concept ?
" I 'm not a national , " I proclaimed onstage .
even that most glorious expression of countryhood , the World Cup , gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players .
and here 's the day that it finally worked : [ video : ( Mac Stone narrating ) After setting up the platform , I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails .
each man 's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd .
let 's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things .
but I digress .
more and more these days , digression seems the most direct route through from where I 've lost or found myself out of place , mind , turn , time .
the rain slows to a stop , dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden 's dark .
finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his compound , the word spread all over .
and one day , with four trainers and one bodyguard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
my bodyguard got out , said , " I can answer you .
and if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
while in hospital , I desperately wanted to go home .
my parents were told I was as good as not there .
a vegetable , having the intelligence of a three @-@ month @-@ old baby .
my parents , in fact my entire family 's lives , became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how .
my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis .
no one would ever love me .
the first time it happened , I was shocked and filled with disbelief .
how could they do this to me ?
there was no one to comfort me .
as I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed , I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home .
I began to reshape my destiny .
it can cause upset , it could cause cost .
all they hear is that they 're going to have to choose .
it 's a mouthful to say .
Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography , data visualization , travel , mathematics and design , when they founded Meshu .
( laughter ) In fact , some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together .
you might think this is not much , compared to the billions of neurons we have .
so why are these new neurons important and what are their functions ?
and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus , then we block certain memory abilities .
and this is especially new and true for spatial recognition -- so like , how you navigate your way in the city .
but moreover , if you just block neurogenesis , then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant .
ST : no , you don 't !
whether he ruled anyone , or even lived at all is , unfortunately , less clear .
your early investors are going to be really excited .
I was a first @-@ time founder .
and I think it inspires a tough question : what 's our goal with entrepreneurship ?
for the first time , ICOs had raised more money for young startups than venture capital had .
and I believe that 's way more exciting than just trying to invest in the next billion @-@ dollar startup .
could we implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing ?
so let me end with some thoughts about model building .
why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago ?
what if we could create personal microbiomes that would scan our skins , repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies ?
and this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision @-@ free manner .
and in a minute you 'll see it enter our lab , which is recognizable by the clutter that you see .
( laughter ) And I want to show you an example .
( laughter ) Just 62.4 . just a tiny increase .
so what 's going on ?
but as you saw already , there is actually lots of noise around this trend line .
if we rely on economic growth alone , we 're going to get to 62.4 .
and now let 's be even bolder still .
it grades our performance on the Global Goals on a scale from F to A , where F is humanity at its worst , and A is humanity at its best .
but the parish clerk is also lusting after the wife , and comes by every night to sing outside her house .
good morning .
and this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played for four minutes and 33 seconds .
he raped her with his mouth , his fingers and his penis .
about half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year , and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais .
but at some point , he must have given up all hope .
the last night we know he was alive , he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk .
out of a population of 150,000 , only 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk .
a few years ago , with my colleague , Emmanuelle Charpentier , I invented a new technology for editing genomes .
the technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell 's DNA affect either a tissue or , in this case , an entire organism .
yes , your happy place , I know you 've got one even if it 's fake .
most of all , we wanted to create an intimate , beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved .
yet .
and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
she wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice .
and so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs , the Auy√°n @-@ tepui , which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls , which is the highest waterfall in the world -- about 979 meters of vertical drop .
it 's always dark . they have to do science . they have a lot of tasks .
FS : yeah . they are working in a darkroom , basically , so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment .
we 've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner .
( laughter ) And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
for your passport , a particular drawer .
cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
now , I 'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
you don 't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
so we launched Crisis Text Line , very quietly , in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market .
we get things like , " I want to die .
so how do we use the data to make us better ?
( laughter ) We have the data to know what makes a great counselor .
we know that if you text in the words " mg " and " rubber band , " there 's a 99 percent match for substance abuse .
( applause ) Data , evidence makes policy , research , journalism , policing , school boards -- everything better .
I don 't think of myself as a mental health activist .
I get really excited about this data , I 'm a little nerdy .
and growing up , I found out that adults make a mess , and they 're not very good at cleaning up after themselves .
so we 've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop .
so we 're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots , kids get very excited .
and the next thing we do -- we do what we call " rapid prototyping . "
what was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem , and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it .
so they were very shocked , because this is the water they drink , this is the water they bathe in , this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live .
I wanted to know what we could do differently .
and this is interesting from an artistic point of view .
" NSA Agents , Do the Right Thing ! blow the whistle ! "
on the floor , a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center , accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility .
this is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world , an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America .
it says kids over here , that 's what I 'd like to talk about .
I 've decided that , for me at least , I don 't have a big enough head .
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
he became Kenya 's first openly gay political candidate .
when Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination , India pushed harder .
one year after returning home from our trip , marriage equality came to California .
it 's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down .
that means that Nike 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor .
they sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars .
Nike lines happen 104 times more often .
it doesn 't . it 's actually the opposite .
I mean , first of all , the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total .
in up to 11 dimensions , featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination .
some of the rules we had were strict , but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed .
this was where I felt safe . this is certainty and clarity about life .
I had help raising my little daughter .
the first thing we did was raise consciousness .
but I 'll tell you what my people have done .
but 10 , just like one , just like a dozen eggs , just like an egg , 10 is a unit .
we round up empathic creatures , we kill them and we eat them .
but in the park , park rangers did that in the 1920s , and then 60 years later they had to bring them back , because the elk numbers had gotten out of control .
why can we trust them around our toddlers ?
the fractions dealing with life and intelligence and technological civilizations are ones that many , many experts ponder , but nobody knows for sure .
so far , we only know of one place in the universe where life exists , and that 's right here on Earth .
a human being should not have to face the void of death .
it can be the voice of a friend calling , and they 're being slaughtered and there 's nothing you can do .
we 're just not ready to listen .
in 1939 , there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals .
in 1987 , the US government identified 102,000 -- twice as many -- 102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide .
the only way to heal from this trauma , from this encounter with death that overwhelms , petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it .
the horror needs to be put into words -- human words , so we can organize it and talk about it again .
and if we can do that , if we can talk about these things , then step by step , by working it out verbally , we can reclaim our place in humanity .
for the first decimal place of my number , I 'll look at the first decimal place of your first number .
our buildings are real ; they 're being built .
take Shakespeare 's famous metaphor , " All the world 's a stage . "
there 's too many people ! "
let me give you an example .
those are a collection of deep brain regions that regulate movement , through a neurochemical called dopamine .
makes it more and more difficult to initiate actions .
patients who suffer degeneration from this region , something called Spino @-@ cerebellar ataxia , show a lack of coordination that results in stiff legs , wide stance , and a lumbering walk .
D2 : touch√© . OK . so we 've nailed its motor problems .
he has learned to speak well , make public speeches , and how to read and write both Latin and Greek .
but in other ways , Lucius is still a child .
( applause ) Thank you very much , thanks for the warm welcome .
and that 's why I 'm here today , to share my journey with you and to take you along with me .
when I leave the surface , I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs .
and what 's extraordinary is that we share this instinct with marine mammals -- all marine mammals : dolphins , whales , sea lions , etc .
and , of course , it works much better for them .
thanks to this phenomenon , which we also share with marine mammals , I 'm able to continue with my dive .
we resist , we go against it .
( laughter ) CA : now , a core part of your nation 's identity is fishing .
we don 't have a lot of livestock , so it 's fish that we depend on .
and so we 've started doing that , and we have to restructure the industry .
if you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries , within your borders , we 'd have no question .
but , enough mutations can bypass the fail @-@ safes , driving the cell to divide recklessly .
at the very least , the Scrapper deserves an interview .
so you have to be there .
but it 's six hours , the experience .
so what you do here , first you start slow walking , you start slowing down .
how to count rice for six hours ?
you do things in life -- it 's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way .
parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead .
then , it was Multiplication , Division , Addition , and Subtraction , each in turn , always the same order .
Don 't forget , there can be parentheses inside parentheses .
but , that doesn 't happen .
they can be seen when two objects disturb the surface of a still pond , and also when two point @-@ like sources of light are placed near each other .
in the 20th century , scientists did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle .
this result , that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes behaves like a wave , led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics .
what do my bookshelves say about me ?
well , when I asked myself this question a few years ago , I made an alarming discovery .
and pretty soon , it was strangers .
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way .
the books I read that year opened my eyes to many things .
and it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world .
so we have all this , so why don 't we have the personal robot ?
so we have to lay the boundaries , the rules of engagement , before we actually start designing .
so I believe that the way to make robots smarter is to mimic people .
I never thought I 'd have to understand things like child psychology , infant development .
and then , lastly , is creativity .
and these are the things that allow us to figure out new things .
so , I 'm all for robots and smart robots .
if both people in a relationship are saying yes to this , they 're going to have massive problems .
that worked really well .
some questions tell you more about a person than others .
let 's call that set of common questions " s . "
basically , you 're a neat freak .
and let 's say B is a little bit different .
the second question the algorithm looks at is : how much did you satisfy B ?
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident .
( Chieko and Nick laugh ) Man : hi .
of course , your matrices have to be the same size , but that 's pretty intuitive anyway .
it 's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it .
now do the next ones : 3 times 3 is 9 .
look at these two matrices .
we ran out of room .
so we choose to look at , and believe , this image .
choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies , so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices .
a teacher told me , " I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born .
if we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first , we might stick with one kid . "
it should not matter .
to understand the rest of the story , you have to understand that our brains are slow .
but let me finish by saying , how exactly does this explain this particular example ?
imagine it 's a cathedral doorway , to make it more concrete -- it 'll be helpful in a second .
here are the cues of motion , the kinds of cues that you get on your retina when things are moving .
and we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic .
over the past century , particle physicists have been studying matter and forces at higher and higher energies .
the human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet .
since then , photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science .
mathematicians have used photos to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip the crack sound comes when the whip is breaking the sound barrier .
great things happen at intersections .
I am also an astrophysicist .
( laughter ) It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space .
we as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity .
the reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories , the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race , gender and innovation .
they are gorgeous in their complexity , delicate in their construction , and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air .
an ostrich stretches its wings over its nest to shade its young .
it represents an amount of digital information , which is uncomfortable to store , transport , or analyze .
big data is so voluminous that it overwhelms the technologies of the day and challenges us to create the next generation of data storage tools and techniques .
I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials , and then bring them home to experiment on .
carried high on the shoulders of these slaves , the girls look out through the curtains to see the crowded streets below them .
all the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master .
unfortunately though , the sandwich came in at 30 cents .
other possibility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bivalves , particularly mussels .
the first is like this , where both hydrogens are on same side and both carbons are on the same side .
the point is this : it 's not how much fat you eat , it 's what kind of fat .
and what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape .
the radiation that does get through creates things like the Aurora Borealis .
gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites and electrical equipment , but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim .
this is called the conservation of angular momentum .
then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board to dry .
you can see an array of big lights on the top .
four thousand years is a long time .
take Sean , who prefers blue tasting food , such as milk , oranges , and spinach .
the gene heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back .
but why do the rest of us non @-@ synesthetes understand metaphors like " sharp cheese " or " sweet person " ?
the worst part is , when we take a look at some of the numbers , it 's pretty scary .
and then also , that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets .
take a look at that from the side as well , you see a very efficient system .
first , Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren 't perfect circles or spheres .
maybe we 're farther from the center than we ever realized .
what would happen if you set a table like this ?
start with utensils for the main course , putting your dinner fork on the left and your dinner knife on the right @-@ hand side since these are the hands we use them with .
the men in Apollo 10 reached a record @-@ breaking speed of around 25,000 miles per hour when the shuttle re @-@ entered the Earth 's atmosphere in 1969 .
( Beatboxing ) NP : all right , pops , pops , pops , chill out , chill out .
( Beatboxing ) ( Applause ) ( Beatboxing ) ( Beatboxing ends ) ( Applause ) NP : I 'm getting ready to go !
Nah , I don 't think so !
okay , well , let 's say you want to fly just a few meters above the ground where you can still see the road signs and breath oxygen with ease .
dust consists of dead skin cells from humans , soil particles , and fibers from clothes made from cotton and other materials .
gross !
if it is , how can you receive medical treatment from a doctor if you 're injured ?
you might have an optical mouse that makes these measurements with lights and sensors , but older ones did this with a hard rubber ball and some plastic wheels .
when you click the button on your mouse , it sends a message to the computer with information about its position .
" but oh my gosh there 's a very important mouse click coming through now !
so , how does orbiting work ?
let 's take a page from Isaac Newton .
commas are tricky things , especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved .
you can easily remember the conjunctions by remembering the acronym fanboys .
because they 're so small , more often than not , they require the help of a comma but not always .
so , the comma continues on .
so about half a million people die in the UK each year , and of those , around a quarter will want to be buried .
they first thought about making a caravan park , but the council said no .
it occurs on a continuum .
this means , when they read a word , it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe .
the higher up on the staff a note is placed , the higher the pitch .
the beat of a piece of music is , by itself , kind of boring .
it 's the most basic unit of rhythm , and it 's worth one beat .
( music ) Eh , sounds okay , but maybe a bit thin , right ?
sometimes it was like sheep is today - where , to make a plural , you don 't do anything .
in a word , Vikings .
after a while nobody remembered the real kind any more .
( laughter ) JF : you ain 't seen nothing yet .
I exist because I have my women friends . they -- You 're one of them .
( laughter ) LT : well , you are and you have .
PM : well , as we grow older , and as we go through different kinds of life 's journeys , what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive ?
and a long string of other descriptive phrases , and I want to get to you as soon as possible , I want you to know that I 'm there for you .
JF : you spell it right out -- LT : I spell it , every letter .
during a normal REM cycle , you 're experiencing a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream , and your brain is unconscious and fully asleep .
days later , you 're walking in the park when suddenly it starts to pour rain .
let 's go back to that football game .
one way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed .
who would they fight ?
and would their retaliation be considered an act of war ?
the hardware engineer who created the computers , knowing that they were intended to enable an attack ?
over the last century , these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe .
at the heart of this problem are two numbers , two extremely dangerous numbers .
it 's all around us right now .
and this value is crucial .
you find that dark energy should be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy .
well , even that one won 't do here .
Einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics , and physicists have kept at it ever since .
now , the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while , but in the last few years , we 've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out .
if so , then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature .
so you have to rely on people 's ingenuity , that they will solve the problems , but it may be a decade or more down the line .
the next time you get d√©j√† vu , take a moment to think about it .
but this explanation doesn 't cut it .
and the first question is very simple : why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months ?
Turkey has now two million three @-@ hundred thousand or something of the sort , if you count all refugees .
BG : but there are villages in Germany with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees .
so , what 's your position ?
so I would say that even today , the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open .
now , today this doesn 't make any sense , because they are providing a global public good .
we have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying , for instance , that Muslims refugees should not be received .
seriously , though , what is it ?
a universal truth ?
it 's all you need .
that 's my point .
but if love is a thing that we can define , then how can it mean opposite things for so many people ?
in 1977 , the physicist Edward Purcell calculated that if you push a bacteria and then let go , it will stop in about a millionth of a second .
and this turned into a weapon .
a week later , they beheaded a young girl .
and so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue .
indeed , Kabuki was even considered a popular form of entertainment amongst American troops stationed in Japan despite initial U.S. censorship of Japanese traditions .
we can 't see protons , neutrons , or electrons .
and another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous .
they became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors , one President of the United States .
you aren 't especially tired , yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out .
scientists believe that this chameleon effect is possible because of a special set of neurons known as mirror neurons .
the euphoria faded , we failed to build consensus , and the political struggle led to intense polarization .
fifth -- and in my point of view , this is the most critical -- today , our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements , posts over discussions , shallow comments over deep conversations .
this is so important .
if your ideal cookie is barely browned , like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation , you could have set your oven to 310 degrees .
so , now let 's talk about what the other 95 % is .
eventually , the universe will run out of gas to form stars , and the stars themselves will run out of fuel and burn out , leaving the universe with only black holes in it .
one out of every fifty of your genes is dedicated to it .
as they dissolve , they bind to the olfactory receptor cells , which fire and send signals through the olfactory tract up to your brain .
this is different from how sight and sound are processed .
if the olfactory epithelium gets swollen or infected , it can hamper your sense of smell , something you might have experienced when you were sick .
and in Mexico , chopped jumiles are toasted with garlic , lemon , and salt .
bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour , powder , and paste to add to food .
whether that 's a fantasy world or a futuristic setting in the real world , it 's important to know where you are and whether you 're working in the past , present , or future .
what do people believe in here ?
some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars .
so I 'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life .
ice on a planet 's surface is also important for climate .
but why does this conflicting information make us feel so terrible ?
a man walks into the hotel and asks for a room .
so , the person in seat number 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3 ^ 7 or room number 2,187 .
this continues for all of the first bus .
the passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime , 5 .
the following bus , powers of 7 .
" how fast are you moving ? "
at the start of the voyage , speeds are given relative to the launchpad .
Ah , of course !
speed is a relative quantity .
this means that speeds only have meaning when they are referred to a reference frame .
we imagine Spaceship Earth plowing through the ocean of space as it orbits the Sun .
cooking frees up time and provides more energy than if we ate food stuffs raw and so we can sustain brains with 86 billion densely packed neurons .
so hop to it !
they record when somebody presses play , when somebody presses pause , what parts they skip , what parts they watch again .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) " House of Cards " gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be .
the least you could expect is good TV , right ?
and that 's not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems doesn 't know what to do with data .
it moves all the time as you move through the day , based on how your body is positioned .
a similar drama is playing out today in S√£o Paulo , Brazil , where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in 2010 , to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics .
we like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns .
if we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years , we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we 'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought .
now , if you told me 20 years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water , I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer .
this figure here shows the stormwater park that they 're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems , or storm sewers , and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry .
after the water 's been through this two @-@ stage process , it 's safe to drink .
" it 's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil , not a lot of water and you don 't care about climate change . "
the race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle , but two peppers generally come out on top : the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper .
nobody really knows when or why humans started eating hot peppers .
and some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates where microbes also happen to be more prevalent .
if someone called you scum , you 'd probably be offended , but scientifically , they might not be far off .
living plants shed dead body parts : fallen leaves , broken branches , and even underground roots .
scientists are learning that this detritus is an unexpectedly huge energy source , fueling most natural ecosystems .
the answer lies in how many different arrangements of 52 cards , or any objects , are possible .
as a general rule , the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one .
fresh fruits actually contain fructose , but it 's naturally occurring and doesn 't cause an overload because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) He said , " What do you do for a living ? "
I was like , oh ! -- that Winnie Mandela .
and because we are a proud profession , it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes .
it was those guardians , it was that village mentality .
so we came up with some incredible initiatives , engagements for our community and police to build that trust back .
all the shapes I knew had perimeters .
but that space @-@ time diagram represents Andrew 's perspective .
this makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached .
pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience , associated with actual or potential tissue damage .
traditionally , medical science has been about testing treatments on large groups to determine what would help a majority of patients .
these are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun 's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower , kind of like an eager beachgoer .
now , a lot of people will tell you that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors .
now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication .
but in a larger area , with less ants , where such meetings happen less often , they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground .
but you can observe these fascinatingly simple , yet effective , processes directly through some simple experiments , by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior .
so , how come the tattoo doesn 't gradually flake off along with them ?
and it is this very process that makes tattoos permanent .
as these cells travel through the lymphatic system , some of them are carried back with a belly full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis .
but with time , tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts to the alien pigment particles , slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system 's macrophages .
but since the dermal cells are relatively stable , much of the ink will remain deep in the skin for a person 's whole life .
and their continuing popularity means that the art of tattooing is here to stay .
you 've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth , but how does it work ?
well , not entirely .
every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons .
to shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level , a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy .
it gets that energy from light , which comes in more energy levels than you could count .
one that doesn 't appear to be emitting light at all : Earth .
it 's the same energy , but at a higher or lower level .
the second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically , according to methods that I 'll describe a little bit later on .
so my final insight is that the computer , more or less , works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it .
this is an essentially philosophical idea , and it 's one that can 't be answered with software alone , but I think requires a moment of species @-@ wide , existential reflection .
partial lobotomies had been used for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas .
H.M. ' s seizures virtually disappeared , with no change in personality , and his IQ even improved .
after immediate sensory data is temporarily transcribed by neurons in the cortex , it travels to the hippocampus , where special proteins work to strengthen the cortical synaptic connections .
one part of the answer come from what psychologists call the mere @-@ exposure effect .
this mode of listening ties in with our susceptibility to musical ear worms , where segments of music burrow into our head , and play again and again , as if stuck on repeat .
critics are often embarrassed by music 's repetitiveness , finding it childish or regressive , but repetition , far from an embarrassment , is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience we think about as musical .
small things , like atoms or electrons though , can have wavelengths big enough to measure in physics experiments .
we can know a particles position very well , but it doesn 't have a wavelength , so we don 't know its momentum .
by combining waves with different wavelengths , which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different momenta .
the result has regions where we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all .
that 's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , first stated by German physicist Werner Heisenberg back in 1927 .
much of Africa , in fact , much of the world , is going to be in trouble .
we 're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food .
and probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals .
up the west coast of my country , for much of the year you don 't see much vegetation growth .
the Romantic poets of the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more deeply understand other profound emotions , like beauty and joy .
Singapore 's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism , spectacular growth , while politics remains democracy @-@ free .
( laughter ) BG : indeed , and possibly we are too , now .
it 's because we have confined , as I was saying in my talk , democracy to the political sphere , while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy @-@ free zone .
they were simply interested in crushing our government , just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone .
" come on , Your Honor , we all learned it in school .
" Hmm . why is celebrating this Columbus so important to you , anyway ? "
and his discovery gave our grandparents and great @-@ grandparents the chance to come here and build better lives for their children .
Don 't we deserve a hero to remind everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants ? "
" and what about the struggles of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from poverty and discrimination ?
how can you make a hero out of a man who caused so much suffering ? "
" in some Latin American countries , they celebrate the same date under different names , such as D√≠a de la Raza .
" so , why not just change the name if it 's such a problem ? "
until then , the cat is a blur of probability , half one thing and half the other .
we don 't see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases as the momentum increases .
if we took a single atom and blew it up to the size of the Solar System , the wavelength of a cat running from a physicist would be as small as an atom within that Solar System .
block one of the slits and the stripes go away .
as you add more atoms , the electrons spread out more , shared between vast numbers of atoms at the same time .
understanding how electrons are shared among atoms allows us to precisely control the properties of semiconductor materials , like silicon .
in standard notation , rhythm is indicated on a musical bar line , but there are other ways .
remember that ticking clock ?
we can mark the beats at different positions around the circle using blue dots for main beats , orange ones for off beats , and white dots for secondary beats .
or a three beat rhythm with a main beat , an off beat , and a secondary beat .
now let 's remove everything except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top .
so it turns out that the wheel method is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms .
are numbers , polygons and equations truly real , or merely ethereal representations of some theoretical ideal ?
they called the number one , " the monad , " the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation .
first , liars reference themselves less , when making deceptive statements .
for example , a liar might say something like , " Sorry , my stupid phone battery died . I hate that thing . "
who am I in this picture ?
( laughter ) BG : no , no , no , not necessarily , it is a statement .
BG : thank you .
and the increased competition and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability that continues to this day .
but then they went bankrupt and they never offered it .
Kathleen 's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad .
sort of .
first of all , why is it so important to know what time it is on a satellite when location is what we 're concerned about ?
it alerts them to our various emotional states , and it can even tell them when someone is pregnant or sick .
but the chances of being right or left @-@ handed are determined by the handedness of your parents in surprisingly consistent ratios .
handedness seems to be determined by a roll of the dice , but the odds are set by your genes .
for example , about 50 % of top hitters in baseball have been left @-@ handed .
think of it as a surprise advantage .
just as young potential golfers can more easily find a set of right @-@ handed clubs , many of the important instruments that have shaped society were designed for the right @-@ handed majority .
" it 's too complicated , " the others say .
her name is Ruby , she is six years old .
Ruby taught me that you 're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed .

I loved make @-@ believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley .
programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices .
the history of human progress is one of ever @-@ increasing velocity , and one of the most important achievements in this historical race was the breaking of the sound barrier .
some tried to circumvent the problem through risky dives , often with tragic results .
imagine throwing a small stone in a still pond .
similarly , even though we CANNOT see it , a stationary sound source , like a home stereo , creates sound waves traveling outward .
IW : in Bali , we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day .
MW : we are sisters , and we go to the best school on earth : green School , Bali .
green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo , but also in the way that it teaches .
MW : but how do we get into the airport ?
ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary @-@ Generals of the United Nations don 't sign petitions -- ( Laughter ) even if kids ask nicely .
inside us are over 360 joints , and about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy , fluid motion .
the jury may still be out as to whether it 's fair to call these acts of creation creative .
in 2012 , the landing ellipse for the Curiosity Lander was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long , an area more than 200 times smaller than Viking 's .
it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years , let alone the next thousand or million .
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap .
we will take it as a salutary warning , I think , for the rest of our conference this week .
it turns out that we 're fighting one of the most evolutionarily @-@ conserved learning processes currently known in science , one that 's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man .
what ? yeah , we said , " Go ahead and smoke , just be really curious about what it 's like when you do . "
thank you .
but his vast wealth was only one piece of his rich legacy .
but are serotonin and activity in these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown underlying cause of the disorder .
the ball 's spin creates a pressure differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it in the direction of the spin .
but when they see each other still there in the morning , they gain new information .
the new information was not contained in your statement itself , but in telling it to everyone simultaneously .
without growth , countries contract and atrophy , not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived .
economic growth matters powerfully for the individual .
there are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what 's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth .
and to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term , we 're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance .
when in practical experience , capitalism is much more of a spectrum .
and only after they 've maximized their utility do they then decide it 's important to provide support to other social contracts .
but nevertheless , this framework -- this two @-@ stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model .
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge .
it may be hard to see the roots of modern English underneath all the words borrowed from French , Latin , Old Norse and other languages .
this keeps your center of gravity directly over your base of support , which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue and muscle strain .
and the Inca , out of vengeance , told them , " Go to the Amazon .
in fact , there is a city called Paititi -- El Dorado in Spanish -- made entirely of gold . "
you see , boiling rivers do exist in the world , but they 're generally associated with volcanoes .
they take in its vapor .
here you have your extra @-@ hot coffee , and you can see that there 's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra @-@ hot coffee .
taking that internship in a remote mountain lab might not have been the best idea .
and we made an app that could release that , to make that available to health @-@ care workers in the field .
( applause ) I would like to leave you with one final thought .
if what they count doesn 't match , that means their own hat is that color .
face it , you 're going to fail sometimes .
in medieval times , alchemists tried to achieve the seemingly impossible .
indeed , today we can manufacture gold on Earth thanks to modern inventions that those medieval alchemists missed by a few centuries .
gold is extraterrestrial .
stars are mostly made up of hydrogen , the simplest and lightest element .
the outer layers collapse into the center , and bouncing back from this sudden injection of energy , the star explodes forming a supernova .
finally , it needs to understand the semantics , what the different parts of the sentence actually mean .
protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids .
if you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence , would you ?
thank you .
you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he 's increasing his intracranial pressure .
but when you eat foods high in fiber , like vegetables , fruits , and whole grains , those indigestible beta bonds slow the release of glucose into the blood .
those foods have a lower glycemic index , and foods like eggs , cheese , and meats have the lowest glycemic index .
this often occurs when aggregated data hides a conditional variable , sometimes known as a lurking variable , which is a hidden additional factor that significantly influences results .
but incomplete reversals can be fatal , especially if the heart is involved .
but where does this asymmetry come from , since a brand @-@ new embryo looks identical on the right and left .
meanwhile , the other major organs emerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions .
this last fall , I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colorado , and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory .
it 's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
if it 's more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . here is the lower atmosphere .
this is peak fishing in a few seconds . the ' 60s .

this Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign -- grassroots mobilization , television ads , Internet ads , radio , newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen .
we , most of us here , are Americans . we have a democracy .
what was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy , this time by climate .
this was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located .
but as you study the inscriptions in the near total darkness , two of the eight graduate students accompanying you bump into the alter .
at any time , one or both of them might lie , though they also might tell the truth .
" your Honor , this is Napol√©on Bonaparte , the tyrant who invaded nearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal stature @-@ based insecurities . "

we 're bombarded with so many decisions that it 's impossible to make a perfect choice every time .
and she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party , and I mean , who can resist that red juice , right ? it 's so good .
in hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators .
decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse .
I can bolster my own identity .
he was the mayor of Sacramento .
on the surface , it all looks seamless , but behind the scenes , human interpreters work incessantly to ensure every idea gets across as intended .
finally , interpreters work in pairs .
ultimately , does longer life as we know it come down to diet , exercise , medicine , or something else ?
but getting to your brain cells is tricky , and amino acids have to compete for limited access .
but the FDA has made available an amazing database .
it is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today , but it 's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs .
now it 's time to free the rest of the world .
inside me was silence .
I was the perfect titan .
now , I know somebody 's out there thinking , " Cry me a river , stupid writer titan lady . "
nothing out of the ordinary .
a hum creeps back .
I itch for my cell phone always .
you 're right , but you can still do this .
uninterrupted is the key .
the very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return , as if the hum 's engine could only refuel while I was away .
I said yes to less work and more play .
to start with , how familiar are you with the person you 're talking to ?
even in English , some dialects use words like " y 'all " or " youse " the same way .
sound is different .
otherwise , look at whatever 's in there , and then open the box with that picture on it .
it begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation that 's impossible to ignore .
two kidneys , two ureters , two urethral sphincters , and a urethra .
recognition algorithms aren 't just limited to facial expressions .
whether they can empathize with our fear of unwanted intrusion , however , that 's another story .
here 's his solution .
he 'll be alone for a while .
but that 's just half of what they need to make it to the airport .
and studies show that Americans say that most don 't know a Muslim .
that 's how it feels .
who would do this ?
( applause ) And assigning collective guilt isn 't just about having to explain yourself all the time .
so we decided to go to the mosque .
what will you choose ?
or will you join those who say we are better than that ?
these neurons encode various characteristics of the object : spiky , fruit , brown , green , and yellow .
but this principle doesn 't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations without ever seeing them .
the neuronal ensemble for a dolphin balancing a pineapple doesn 't exist .
this conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis .
the problem is that some neurons are much farther away from the prefrontal cortex than others .
and so these are the trolley guys , the existing transportation monopoly at the time .
in other cities , they required two jitney drivers for one jitney .
( laughter ) All right . so what happened ?
well , within a year this thing had taken off .
that 's unfortunate ...
now , cities have been dealing with this problem for decades .
we saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place .
and when I talk to my team , we don 't talk about , " Hey , well , 100,000 people carpooling every week and we 're done . "
thank you .
Travis Kalanick : thank you .
ca : OK , that 's cool .
I mean -- who are you ?
and we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down .
but even though she has never seen color , Mary is an expert in color vision and knows everything ever discovered about its physics and biology .
but while living in Zimbabwe , I didn 't see my role as an advocacy or a political one .
in mythological ancient Greece , soaring above Crete on wings made from wax and feathers , Icarus , the son of Daedalus , defied the laws of both man and nature .
as he strapped the wings to his son Icarus , he gave a warning : flying too near the ocean would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use .
that 's a route that visits every point within it exactly once .
compare that with the tortoise , which can age to more than 100 years .
the drivers behind this process are varied and complicated , but aging is ultimately caused by cell death and dysfunction .
what if he 's psychotic ? "
now , we know design won 't solve all the world 's problems .
ca : and you 're working with some of the companies in this room even , who are welcoming graduates from your program ?
RS : yeah , we have about 80 partners , from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney , I mean , every single company out there .
ca : and you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams , good things happen .
medicine that slides down your throat can help treat a headache , a sore back , or a throbbing sprained ankle .
this process starts in your digestive system .
within minutes , the tablet starts disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach .
these blood vessels feed into a vein , which carries the blood , and anything in it , to the liver .
the damaged ibuprofen molecules , called metabolites , may no longer be effective as painkillers .
half an hour after you swallow the pill , some of the dose has already made it into the circulatory blood stream .
and in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty , the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea .
this gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world .
all were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits .
this triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug .
the war weakened China 's global standing for over a century .
so they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation .
not much .
but the Western Empire would never be united again .
yet the practice of using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures .
some speculate the author was a medieval con man .
and second , what can we do to fix it ?
but today , that system is failing .
and so Amira can 't go back there .
refugees in such urban areas don 't usually have the right to work .
Curie soon found that the element thorium emitted similar radiation .
some play on our natural inclination to mimic social behaviors or follow orders .
in fact , researchers know that an overload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy , or CTE .
yes , these men and women were the stars of the show for me .
I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come , who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment , who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now .
now what ?
and from that graveyard , I began the search once more , not because I was brave , but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die .
we speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems .
we rarely , if ever , talk about the prosecutor .
Christopher 's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such , but I didn 't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer .
the more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system , the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again -- all at tremendous social cost to his children , to his family and to his peers .
that may be why people with a moderate amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence in their abilities .
so , this is a story about how we know what we know .
you wouldn 't even know it was there , if not for the red lump that appears , accompanied by a telltale itch .
our bodies are teeming with leukocytes : there are between 4,000 and 11,000 in every microliter of blood .
as soon as the leukocytes detect them , it takes only minutes for the body 's protective immune response to kick in .
that allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders they just ingested and transmit this information to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense , the lymphocytes .
that 's how you can develop immunity to certain diseases , like chickenpox .
it wasn 't their dream .
it stems from a lifelong interest of mine in , believe it or not , poverty .
and it was like a lot of you , kind of a prosaic example , kind of trite .
or to people just like him all over the world ?
if you 're a conservative , be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor .
so I 'd start off light , and I 'd bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
I know that if you 're not a trained brain expert , it 's not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
these people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
and when there 's deadlines , the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved .
I 'd like to talk to you today about this problem , and how we can fix it with neuroscience .
so , you want to say a little bit about how you guys work ?
here 's our moonshot blueprint .
with 1.2 million people dying on the roads globally every year , building a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take .
and now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines .
and the longer it survives that pressure , the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world .
so we 're going to keep going .
we have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects , from teams as small as two to teams of more than 30 .
six hundred million humans watched them on grainy , black @-@ and @-@ white televisions .
and it made it so much more .
then the community grew gradually .
like , before I stepped into the room she would say , " OK . that 's so @-@ and @-@ so ... "
it 's this idea called taste .
and I 've just got a couple of images here .
Lt : so this is -- How many people here actually have coded ?
so , what do we do about it ?
it 's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it 's a radical departure from the status quo .
and so I decided to study computer programming in college .
as you can see , we can create any world that we want inside the computer .
this guy , WALL @-@ E , is a great example of that .
we tried turning them down , we tried blocking them , nothing was working .
maybe because unlike normal , we were basing it on something in real life , or maybe just because we had lost our way .
imagine -- the cell effectively spits out the drug .
first , let 's start with the nanoparticle core .
and so what was happening had to be astrophysical , meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight .
I want you to imagine that you get a text from a friend , and it reads , " You will not believe what just happened .
the reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry , so there 's got to be something else going on .
like Wikipedia , like the Open Directory Project , you 're beginning to build platforms , and you see that as a model .
small children , they explore all day .
for example , " How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company ? "
we discover something , but we don 't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work .
and any company that 's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future .
but then again , what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious ?
and that 's exactly what 's happened here .
so you can freeze sperm , you can freeze eggs , you can freeze fertilized eggs .
and in the gulf , a necklace of city @-@ states is forming , from Bahrain and Qatar , through the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman .
but first , a few fascinating facts about where we 're going .
the atmosphere on Mars is really thin -- 100 times thinner than on Earth -- and it 's not breathable , it 's 96 percent carbon dioxide .
maybe they can .
and if you look at Mars , it looks really dry , it looks like the entire planet is a desert .
I love this thing .
but the secret to this -- and that 's just for testing -- the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get @-@ go to be scalable by a factor of 100 .
we were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila .
so , why don 't we hear more about the world ?
if I could find them , I could assemble them into a narrative .
the continents drifted . the mammals rose .
thus , multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of fossils , each one a small miracle , but collectively , inevitable .
before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . "
if the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I 'm sorry to say , it 's probably not worth sharing .
most of us are like my mom .
they are not trusted .
so for one , we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda .
but there is an art form that 's been around for a very long time that 's really about using information , abstract information , to make emotionally resonant pieces .
there 's a wire going through to the trigger , and the computer in the box is online .
it 's listening to the 911 feed of the New Orleans Police Department , so that anytime there 's a shooting reported in New Orleans , ( gunshot sound ) the gun fires .
now , there 's a blank , so there 's no bullet .
that 's 17,000 a day , and I have them all .
simply , I live in Gaza , there is no airport .
on some days , we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours .
we have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes .
I do have terrible nightmares because of all that I witnessed during war times , especially these lifeless bodies of young children .
and the funny thing is they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza .
and there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing -- uncontrolled money printing -- leading to hyperinflation .
and , as we 've learned with the money @-@ printing schemes , whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules .
it 's very well known . I 'm not going to spend a lot of time on those .
we currently have three locations in the Caribbean , and we 're planning a fourth one .
Africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to Africa .
an undergraduate can do it .
OK , so where does this leave us ?
that would be a game @-@ changing technology , right ?
I 'd say , " I don 't know ! "
and today , I 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made .
and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age .
are you ready ?
can they detect children 's lies ?
the lights were too bright .
everyone understands the situation they 're all in .
if prohibition is this harmful , you might ask , why it so popular ?
well , lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking .
but we need more allies .
see , now most people , especially TED people , would have run to the mailbox , right ?
that 's 162 faces , which is precisely how many the cubes have in total .
and we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia .
but for just a second , my eyes glow white , and I hold this thing for I could speak to the good @-@ for @-@ nothing in a language he maybe understands .
( beat ) And the good @-@ for @-@ nothings become good @-@ for @-@ disappearing into whatever toxic waste , chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of .
and he ain 't looking my way , but I hear him mumble two words to me : " I 'm sorry . "
and astonishingly enough , occasionally even people born without a limb can feel a phantom .
and on his left , my sisters : Mary Catherine , Judith Ann , Theresa Marie .
how can that be ?
they were so weak from the treatment I had given them .
but here 's the thing : we 're already doing this in a limited way , and it 's already starting to make a big difference .
and my mother was selling the furniture , because we were leaving -- she didn 't want to stay in that state of shame , in Chelsea , Massachusetts .
NL : benefit in that it gave me that springboard .
the truth was my grandfather took me to parades , we had lots of those .
NL : here 's where my mind goes when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished .
which we 're trying to save and it requires saving .
anything I may have accomplished is -- my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in Newington , Connecticut .
each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes .
and I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape .
they would walk up , take a picture , and then walk away .
( Board shaking ) This is a bit of a sport , because we need to resolve some traffic jams in there .
as a Pig , I need to be careful with a Snake .
she has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet .

even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013 .
your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry .
with all that money to be made , are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising , in bait and switch ...
just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone , so also people can be sold more and more education .
people can be upsold on certifications and recertifications , master 's degrees , doctoral degrees .
what if we could reimagine ways to help make your medicine @-@ taking easier ?
so instead of taking six medications , for example , I could integrate them into one .
I can now -- The automated process would rotate and cycle through , to make sure the micromeds are loaded .
and this could evolve , I think , into an incredible way to improve adherence in medications across the globe .
these aren 't going to evolve and start with printers on your bathroom counter .
how is this possible ?
you 're either on , and you 're connected and distracted all the time , or you 're off , but then you 're wondering , am I missing something important ?
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation .
now to do this you also need a new system , because you 're probably thinking , today 's Internet economy -- today 's economy in general -- is measured in time spent .
we solved it with organic , when we said we need to value things a different way .
we solved it with LEED Certification , where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustainability .
and what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that 's driven and run entirely on time spent , to world that 's driven by time well spent .
and addressing these non @-@ obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
small things being done by NGOs , being done by foundations .
in the context of education , it 's very difficult to see results quickly .
and when I was perfectly above -- you know , with the wind , we had to redo it a few times -- then I kept shooting .
Chris Milk : how was it ?
let 's see where this leads them .
and for those on the outside , just as Father Damien did , the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying .
this is an OXO potato peeler .
so without even realizing it , my solution was to take the muffled sound I heard , that was the beat , and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read .
one of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we 've discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
I 'll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
well , we had a long time to come up with good analogies .
there 's another issue , which is that the forces in nature -- it 's quite beautiful , actually -- seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
and I 'd say that it deserves , in the spirit of Wade Davis ' talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north .
gravity separated away from the other forces .
( laughter ) Those are the extroverts .
second , our sociogenic or second nature , which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives .
extroverts , when they interact , want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness .
if hospitals are making people sicker , where are the architects and designers to help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal ?
designing it is one thing ; getting it built , we learned , is quite another .
what if w = 1 ? the error is 4 .

to illustrate these mindsets in action , I 'm going to take you back to 19th @-@ century France , where this innocuous @-@ looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history .
so scientists all over the world believe that nanocellulose is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry .
so for everybody , it 's an environmental problem , and for us , it 's a gold mine .
we can do a lot of things with the material .
( laughter ) Why ? because they are jumpy .
they develop into organs , and together bring life .
why collagen ?
also , the quality .
yeah , of course , I can take those bricks and build a new wall .
Venus and Mars don 't have that .
but we 're working on it . how are we working on it ?
some of them are orbiting now , including the Maven spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars , which I 'm involved with and which is led here , out of the University of Colorado .
I have a forest in the backyard of my own house .
it attracts a lot of biodiversity .
( bird call ) I wake up to this every morning , like a Disney princess .
then we built up our cities on those forests , like S√£o Paulo , forgetting that we belong to nature as well , as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet .
nature , on the other hand , works in a totally opposite way .
can you imagine how long it took ?
it 's beginning to grow tremendously .
they have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa .
we 're concentrating our attention on four locations .
we now know more than a dozen of them .
in its past it had perhaps two @-@ thirds of its northern hemisphere -- there was an ocean .
now , the only thing that we can think of that does that here on Earth as an analogy ...
but this doesn 't go very well , and so he ends up going on kind of a rampage until Chihiro saves him , rescues him .
all of these computers are collectively confirming who owns what Bitcoin .
one misconception is that fire is a plasma , the fourth state of matter in which atoms are stripped of their electrons .
and say no to panels without underrepresented speakers .

we now have sources of power like the sun that don 't vary with our earthly dramas .
we encourage our best and brightest to work on this issue -- better solar panels , better batteries , everything .
it includes a lot of different behaviors , from mocking or belittling someone to teasing people in ways that sting to telling offensive jokes to texting in meetings .
take texting while someone 's speaking to you .
what put him there was work @-@ related stress .
but we were very sneaky .
sooner or later , though , most uncivil people sabotage their success .
youth unemployment on the continent is about 15 percent , and underemployment is a serious problem .
and I think we will need to get a handle on it , particularly how we educate girls .
we also need to be wary of new conflicts , new types of conflicts , such as we have with Boko Haram in my country , Nigeria , and with Al @-@ Shabaab in Kenya .
now , I 'd spent from age 26 to 52 being a boutique hotel entrepreneur , and so I guess I 'd learned a few things along the way and accumulated some hospitality knowledge .
no , we made a very brave choice , and that choice made the whole difference .

these women were unbelievably inspiring , and what 's great is that SPI will help us transform communities near some of the sites that you help to discover .
what if I was wasting my time and I would never feel comfortable in such an exposed position ?
but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab .
his serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor .
street artists believe that art belongs to the public .
they exclude billions of people from the global economy , for example , people who don 't have enough money to have a bank account .
thank you .
when you think about it , using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done .
if you can do that , it 'll help other people see you that way , too .
now , of our three stories , this one probably surprised me the most , since as you all know , the country is still struggling with so many problems .
so what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability , and it 's not circumstances .
there 's no way that could go wrong !
RW : once I thought I saw Bigfoot but it was just a German shepherd .
it makes them realize that if you got 20 percent wrong on something , it doesn 't mean that you have a C branded in your DNA somehow .
students see an explanation at their own time and pace ?
one , the students can actually master the concepts , but they 're also building their growth mindset , they 're building grit , perseverance , they 're taking agency over their learning .
I think that vote is occurring right now .
I 'm going to show you six , if I can , solutions for helping to save the world .
these are a species that we need to join with .
so I hope to come back in a few years with the final story , but for now I will tell you , please don 't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion .
thank you .
but the data says something different .
in a 2011 report from the Institute for Women 's Policy Research , the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent .
when I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy in 2010 , my goal was simple : open a school to close a prison .
and if they 're not learning , where would they end up ?
I can stand up and do something . "
voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had .
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined , and can be reimagined .
and the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it 's so harmful .
but there 's another really interesting aspect of this , and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence , evolution of harmfulness , then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance .
but as I said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
in fact , the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology .
we are right now in a marriage revolution .
and then comes ghosting .
and that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times and changing beliefs .
I think we need something like a Manhattan Project on the topic of artificial intelligence .
what kind of specific challenges do you have , and how do you overcome them ?
last I heard , there are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English .
other than that you had books that didn 't work , that 's just the way it was .
I highly recommend the lesser known Glossika as well .
thank you very much .
I was born in India , the world 's largest democracy , and when I was four , my family moved to Belize , the world 's smallest democracy perhaps .
we live in an incredibly interconnected world with the proliferation of social media , which is of course a fantastic resource for igniting social change .
everywhere , " People wish to be settled , " Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us , " but only insofar as we are unsettled is there any hope for us . "
but at some point , knowledge gives out .
we 're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer .
and so this tumor is now growing in this mouse 's brain , and then we 've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient , and take out piece by piece out of the tumor .
but Tod couldn 't come and the project is sort of somewhere , I 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought , or not .
well , a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff .
enough of a clue ? so , you get the pattern , right ? OK .
well , early days , Microsoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture -- clear evidence of Microsoft putting people first .
and this blew our minds .
this isn 't the present .
wow . that 's a lot of you .
so that could be a property title .
so as we began to build these types of systems , we began to test them on ourselves in our research group .
we have no such anchors and benchmarks for decisions in messy human affairs .
I got in touch with my soul .
when we behave violently towards robots , specifically robots that are designed to mimic life , is that a healthy outlet for violent behavior or is that training our cruelty muscles ?
" yes , we understand the definition .
so instead of rigid traffic rules , flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic and constantly self @-@ improving algorithms .
Acousmatic sounds -- well , the term " acousmatic " comes from Pythagoras in ancient Greece , who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years , not revealing himself to his disciples .
and these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our body @-@ shaming culture .
I mean one of the boys has a bottle of liquor in his hand , he 's 14 years old and it 's a school day .
" Hey , I 'm here for you whenever you 're ready . "
so what happens going forward ?
let 's turn to Europe .
OK , so why am I doing all this ?
this is a square pyramid .
( applause ) Pat Mitchell : I 'm not letting you go yet .
( laughter ) And what 's more interesting are people 's comments .
why is that ?
indeed , Thomas Edison famously said , " I have not failed , I have found 10,000 ways that won 't work . "
but the simplest thing CANNOT be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already . "
every seven minutes , an adolescent boy or girl somewhere in the world is killed by an act of violence .
and maybe you 've never faced violence , or prejudice , or discrimination .
young people themselves have named it .
so with Gen @-@ U , they 're going to be in the driver 's seat , steering us all along the way .
but these are a chance to see their own livelihoods .
it doesn 't matter what you once were ; you can 't do it anymore .
in the 1950s , a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater studied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria .
( laughter ) So then I had my new idea : why not engage people like me in sport ?
nevertheless , there are still many , many women who , from early November until the end of the year , by comparison to their male colleagues , are effectively working for free .
( laughter ) Here 's quick history sidebar for you : no woman ever burnt her bra in the ' 60s .
but , no , even if we were all steroid @-@ filled football players , the answer is no .
and we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths , but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space did share one remarkable fate .
or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal .
now , the first thing we need to know is : what is my range ?
so when a scene calls for it , be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker .
and four of the smartest people that I 've ever met -- Ed Boyden , Hugh Herr , Joe Jacobson , Bob Lander -- are working on a Center for Extreme Bionics .
all bacteria , all plants , all animals , all humans , all cows , everything else .
thank you very much .
and that 's going to happen unless they have a better alternative .
it had to be first of all viable , meaning that technically , they could implement it in their country , and that it would be accepted by the people in the country .
if you look at the Chindia test , we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test .
outdated regulations and yesterday 's mindsets .
right now , we 're basically waiting for a miracle .
we love it .
who is on it ?
that bear is not passing through !
that bear made a detour for you .
some activists also like Doritos , but they definitely want money .
but I must say , there 's a small handful of activists , very small , that go to great lengths to be constructive and collaborative .
and overall , we have to give credit where credit is due .
Adidas teamed up with an organization called Parley for the Oceans .
parley goes out and collects plastic waste from the ocean .
like , in an Uber Pool .
I get why you 'd be looking .
doing my part . I got eco @-@ shoes . I got eco @-@ shoes .
we 've all been -- Folks , I have jumped out of moving Uber Pools .
but we 've got to forgive the hipsters , we need to love the hipsters .
we need hipsters , and we need companies like Adidas , and what we need most is for investors to convince other companies to behave like Adidas .
conscious investors care about ESG issues .
and they talk a lot about engaging management on ESG issues .
Argentina owed Paul 600 million dollars and would not pay .
you can 't take money from an OG and not pay it back .
then you have Barry Rosenstein .
( laughter ) He wanted to make some money .
now , the CEO of Whole Foods , John Mackey , and the board did not want to sell themselves to Amazon , because that would be the prime example of selling out .
doesn 't mean that people who are in between don 't experience racism , but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum , the better off you are .
and so my journey as a trans person is about reimagining masculinity .
I was doing two and three meetings a week for two and a half years , and so was Cathy and her staff and a handful of volunteers .
this is hard , and it won 't happen on its own .
these places aren 't inevitable .
she and her baby were presumed dead .
he maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt and it still wasn 't enough .
so sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time .
and she said , " Why don 't we just stand here and compliment each other ?
and I felt I was stuck ; I was stagnant .
( laughter ) I said , " You know what ? I 'm going to do this .
he looked like a security guard .
he was a chubby , loveable guy , and he even asked me , " Why ? "
( laughter ) It was really boring .
and then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...
but also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth , and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact .
and what I 'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points .
and as I will point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea .
running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes .
a discovery is made , that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later .
two : when things get difficult or painful , try to stay open .
it 's what they do at that age .
of course there is a bright spot to this story .
they were cynics and seekers , atheists and rabbis .
what are the unknowns ?
we already have AI , and often it works in the background , in the back offices of hospitals , where it 's used to diagnose X @-@ rays better than a human doctor .
it 's in legal offices , where it 's used to go through legal evidence better than a human paralawyer .
but it 's more than that .
so let me talk about those three different aspects .
we tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension , that it 's kind of like a note that gets louder and louder .
and this single IQ intelligence is getting greater and greater .
innovation by definition is inefficient , because you make prototypes , because you try stuff that fails , that doesn 't work .
first , you can read some other family histories , get a sense for the style .
twenty @-@ four times seven is 168 hours .
and some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred creative genius .
they were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug that they actually just listed it as a side effect , an adverse side effect .
and in depression and PTSD -- here we have your stress exposure -- we only have palliative care .
antidepressants only suppress symptoms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the length of your own life .
we tried Prozac as well , and that had no effect .
if we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first , it 'd be pretty easy for us to develop it , but as is , we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere .
and we may find ourselves in that reality , and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today .
now , before I go on , some of you may hold up your hands and say , " Stop , Paul , wait a minute .
I also think it 's not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification .
the engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors than they got back .
sometimes you might put a Band @-@ Aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain .
what if the stuff that 's bothered me since I was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime ?
( laughter ) Here 's the broader point .
right ? is this time different ?
the atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that 's seen here from the International Space Station , a photograph that some astronauts took .
Cheryl talked about how , by the time Monday came , her kids ' hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn 't even begin to think about learning .
well , because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school .
and then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller .
we don 't have any disease @-@ fighting nanobots , there 's no elevators to space , and the thing that I 'm most interested in , no new types of computing .
it 's exponential .
you can go to the beach , you 'll find these simple organisms that use proteins -- basically molecules -- to template what is essentially sand , just plucking it from the sea and building these extraordinary architectures with extreme diversity .
I had no guidebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
I can 't spend the rest of my life being scared and hiding and that I 'm actually going to have to do something .
she tried to do everything right .
we Homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry .
pretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values you 'd never remember on the screen where things were .
Bob worked in the attic of the apartment he rented in Arlington , Massachusetts .
" if you can 't handle the Internet , fuck off , whore . "
shall we talk about our friends in tech ?
( in a lowered voice ) It has another quite surprising quality .
the images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs .
organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack to themselves .
so , I had this wishbone , and I thought , it 's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long .
the result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony .
and that 's the key word .
he wrote the first @-@ ever history book .
finally , last year , it was finished -- three times over budget .
it 's called the Sanyuan Bridge .
and just to remind you if you do , this won 't be the first time .
now , there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work .
would you cross this bridge ?
what 's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design , make and use .
where we 're moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown .
even our prejudices were alike .
the people who sent hate mails are workers , husbands , wives , parents like you and me .
but when I asked , " What about you ?
and finally , remember to finish the conversation in a positive way because you are going to meet again .
we hang out only with people who think like us and talk about the others in a category of disdain .
when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they 're finding , I believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find .
we looked at open @-@ source data and mapped the entirety of looting across Egypt from 2002 to 2013 .
of course I agreed , but I didn 't think we 'd find anything .
a hundred years ago , archaeology was for the rich .
and the greatest story ever told is the story of our shared human journey .
I wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people , not just the 49 percent who can get the numbers .
( laughter ) Actually , in Exeter , it 's incredibly young , and I had underestimated the impact of the university in this area .
we 've had online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years .
I never expected to be described by my own government in these terms : " lurking , " " nefarious , " " terrorist . "
I know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated I was because of my race -- and yes , I don 't think I would 've been detained if I were white .
rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four @-@ year @-@ olds , barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers .
I come from a family of civil rights advocates , and I had spent my career until that point working with low @-@ income children and families .
after all , shouldn 't we include end users in the design process ?
adult planners marveled at the students ' ideas as they shared a park constructed out of a jelly bracelet .
and then , public art constructed from animal @-@ shaped plastic beads .
so if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaper food venues , we meet the needs of many other populations , too .
but most importantly , the blame transferred from Thordis to me .
we 're going to do some open @-@ heart surgery . I was the only Brit , on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons , cardiac nurse , intensive care nurse .
open @-@ heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble .
you look at your X @-@ rays on a screen and you do stuff with them , you email them . but we were still using X @-@ rays , but we didn 't even have a viewing box !
but my favorite has got to be , " Thank you for not forgetting about us and our children . "
what I do think is a serious problem is when people share private images of others without their permission .
in the 1950s , seat belts .
and we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas .
and in a lot of states , you 're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim .
Jennifer started missing school and her grades dropped .
ultimately , Jennifer decided to end her own life .
people are still saying all the time to victims of privacy violations , " What were you thinking ?
there 's a growing body of research examining the relationship between chronic stress and illness .
but it turns out that the kind of stress we experience and whether we 're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough to keep our bodies working properly depends a lot on who we are .
in certain parts of the country , particularly the Deep South , the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in Sub @-@ Saharan African .
even nationally , black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women .
but here 's the thing : this problem , that racism is making people of color , but especially black women and babies , sick , is vast .
I could spend all of my time with you talking about it , but I won 't , because I want to make sure to tell you about one solution .
lastly , when you finally are called back to see the provider , you 've already taken your own weight in the waiting room , and done your own pee test in the bathroom .
this is a big departure from the traditional medical model , because it places responsibility and information back in the woman 's hands .
and that support provides a crucial buffer to the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day .
well , The JJ Way has almost entirely eliminated those problems , starting with what Jennie calls " skinny babies . "
the beauty of Jennie 's model is that she actually believes it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting .
they involve elaborate physiological mechanisms meant to protect us , that , when overstimulated , actually make us sick .
we want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions is an integral part of their mission .
actually , it is .
it doesn 't care about the consequences because it can 't , because it 's just information being copied .
I have no idea .
it looks like the kind of thing we do .
current Row @-@ bots contain things like toxic batteries .
how will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race ?
those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world @-@ makers who own and master time .
I fear that the future of our internet is out of our control .
what if I told you that our definition of " good person " is so narrow , it 's scientifically impossible to meet ?
Governments must create a safer internet by ensuring enforcement and up @-@ to @-@ date rules .
everyone was sharing this list of scripts that everyone had said that they loved , reading them and then loving them themselves .
production costs alone or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country .
so no wonder more and more authority is shifting from us to the algorithms .
and that should not be impossible , because people can have several layers of loyalty .
we look at these other groups which have formed which go outside of national bounds but still represent significant authorities .
and that that 's actually sparked a lot of the anger .
ca : well , depending on how things go , we may all be back in the forest soon .
YNH : I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair , and that we should realize that .
if we don 't have a global governance , and if we suffer from climate change , from technological disruptions , the worst suffering will not be in the US .
you can use the same technology to create very different kinds of societies .
the trains did not tell you what to do with them .
if you pour water on that , it dissolves .
I was going to break into a dance then .
because this is not about the steep hill in front of her .
on the technical side , how we code matters .
( laughter ) And he said , " Women don 't do these things .
men made these marks . women don 't . "
and I turn to Caroline , and she 's crying her eyes out .
men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication , but of course , how could they be ?
now I know that 's not enough .
and then I met Yoyo , who is the native Rapa Nui @-@ an guide , and if you look at Yoyo 's face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
another thing I do is I invent stuff .
it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way .
now , just five years ago , I really had no clue about phages .
so living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together and have a totally different perspective , just like the couple of people I mentioned earlier in my stories .
there is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs .
140 million Americans voted for the next president of the United States , and yet , as all of us knows , in a few weeks time , somebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes to Donald J. Trump .
in fact , I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates .
some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine .
it has some background .
people need to take their medication so that they 're cured , and so that they don 't get other people sick .
so I believe he was listening to her before that speech .
was it here or here or here ?
it 's nostalgic ; it 's for the past .
so I don 't know if that 's the right way to fight .
and I teach at Yale .
GC : see , I understand how that happened .
ca : do you think enough of his supporters have a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ...
according to a lot of research , one of the best weapons is gratitude .
so knowing this , I started a new tradition in our house a couple of years ago .
then one day , my 10 @-@ year @-@ old son said , " You know , Dad , those people aren 't in our apartment .
I 'm not talking about claims like , " 9 out of 10 women recommend this anti @-@ aging cream . "
this is a total disaster .
if we don 't have this data , how can we observe discrimination , let alone fix it ?
one poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support jihad , which is obviously pretty scary , and it was reported everywhere in 2015 .
( laughter ) This was just the beginning of my team 's science project .
and when they came back and told us about it , we really started thinking about the ways in which we see Styrofoam every day .
and now France has become the first country to completely ban all plastic utensils , cups and plates .
so we kept trying and failing and trying and failing .
and we were also honored with the Scientific American Innovator Award from Google Science Fair .
paradoxically , it was God who created hell as a place to store evil .
he didn 't do a good job of keeping it there though .
your personality and morality are disengaged .
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .
we abandoned the milk of human kindness and turned our priorities elsewhere .
( laughter ) Sex .
and he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups after they were born .
but what 's interesting about it is when he follows these pups when they become adults -- like , years in human life , long after their mother died .
is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light ?
but that 's just the electrons in your body pushing back against the electrons in the seat , opposing the force of gravity .
our once country , all north and south and east and west , so restless the Nile couldn 't hold us together , and you ask me to summarize .
in other words , as the disco ball spins , those mirrors change locations and we get to observe different parts of the image .
( laughter ) Different types of images have very distinct features .
it 's part of the case file .
knowing how to do something is one thing , knowing how to take care of yourself is another .
how do we teach our kids to be safe online when we don 't have either ?
today , I use it .
the key was to overcome the initial shock and do something new .
what kind of information do you share ?
those kids need to know what the risks of being online are , how to take care of themselves , but also that , fundamentally , as with almost everything else , kids can learn this from any adult .
grooming shows us this in the most painful way : by involving our kids .
all of these researchers were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting blacks , but they provided no evidence .
this scale captures ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not value is chipped away on a daily basis .
this was true for all kinds of medical treatment , from the most simple to the most technologically sophisticated .
it is a subtle process , but it 's normal and it occurs even among the most well @-@ intentioned individuals .
there is institutional discrimination , which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions .
one of America 's best @-@ kept secrets is how residential segregation is the secret source that creates racial inequality in the United States .
we must dissent because America can do better , because America has no choice but to do better . "
I know young women who are under so much pressure from family , from friends , even from work to get married , and they 're pushed to make terrible choices .
both men and women in Nigeria will say -- this is an expression I 'm very amused by -- " I did it for peace in my marriage . "
they grow up to be women who silence themselves .
gender and class are different forms of oppression .
but also , culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people .
I have to think in a totally new way to do it , but I love it .
our video game was our attempt to share that world with people who hadn 't experienced it before , because we never could imagine that world until it became ours .
and I drew this sketch , something with two layers , translucent with structure in between capturing light .
you all know this crazy search , letting the process take you , and you live for the surprises .
it let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them .
and what I experienced -- what they experience every day , hundreds of thousands of people like Robin -- was really amazing .
I have a loving , supportive family and incredibly loyal friends , yet I could not entertain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain .
globally , 75 percent of all mental illness cases can be found in low @-@ income countries .
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .
it can be for profit or not profit . it can be large or small .
right ? how do you capture that ?
( laughter ) I needed a better plan .
and in the springtime , those animals have babies .
how in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters ?
we 're going to need all the help we can get .
so I live in fear of unintended consequences .
and so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended .
I 'd say , " Here 's your logo . put it on the door . "
and the kids were great , hand @-@ selected by the principals and the librarian .
he did these amazing collages .
tenderness is the language of the young children , of those who need the other .
3 : 00 : departure The hero crosses the threshold from his normal , safe home , and enters the special world and adventure .
how do we fight it ?
why ?
that 's your reward system saying , " Mmm , yes ! "
that 's because when it comes to food , the brain evolved to pay special attention to new or different tastes .
but what is it about making music that sets the brain alight ?
money creates the ability to buy results and to buy almost any other kind of power .
so if you aren 't taking action , you 're being acted upon .
do you want power to benefit everyone or only you ?
elephants know every member in their herd , able to recognize as many as 30 companions by sight or smell .
unfortunately , it 's also what makes elephants one of the few non @-@ human animals to suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder .
they also tackle problems cooperatively , sometimes even outwitting the researchers and manipulating their partners .
it 's 4 a.m. , and the big test is in eight hours , followed by a piano recital .
the discrepancy , and his inability to resolve it , left Einstein in what he described as a state of psychic tension .
what makes these trait a true personality disorder is that they take over people 's lives and cause significant problems .
light , bright , and cheerful .
this is one of the fastest examples of cultural transmission , where learned behaviors are passed between unrelated individuals of the same species .
it 's popular because it forces us to think about how to choose when there are no good choices .
for the many millions experiencing bipolar disorder around the world , life is split between two different realities - elation and depression .
type 1 has extreme highs alongside the lows , while Type 2 involves briefer , less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods of depression .
but Sisyphus may still have avoided punishment if it hadn 't been for his reckless confidence .
with Thanatos trapped , no one could die , and the world was thrown into chaos .
ipso facto , I , David Irving , am not a Holocaust denier . "
and finally , here 's the view where we 've overlaid the software and the hardware that 's used by the Bovingdons staff .
SW : no , I 've been so fortunate and so I haven 't .
GK : you have a lot of support . you have a lot of love .
on the way over here , somebody was telling me about Ilie Nastase , who said some very unkind , inappropriate , dare I say racial things .
but I would never put you with a nerdy geek , and you said , you neither .
GK : was it a wonderful proposal ?
" if you like it then you ought to put a ring on it " ?
in my life , it still and forever is always going to be Venus and Serena .
GK : I don 't know , Serena . there 's never been anybody like you .
a lot has been made about your body .
it 's a 50 @-@ 50 chance , but I have a feeling .
and maybe you 're thinking , " Well , it won 't be me . "
part of the fear around Alzheimer 's stems from the sense that there 's nothing we can do about it .
here 's a picture of two neurons connecting .
and remember .
so what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point ?
we 're going to have to take this pill before we reach that tipping point , before the cascade is triggered , before we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator .
some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it .
what else ?

the average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses , which is fantastic ; we 've got a lot to work with .
let 's imagine a simplified example .
you won 't lose your emotional memory .
this panorama of information that 's so interesting to you gives a state , or anyone for that matter , a perfect back door into your mind .
Chris Anderson : Elon , hey , welcome back to TED .
it 's particularly horrible in LA .
so a couple of key things that are important in having a 3D tunnel network .
and then the car gets on a skate .
but you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels , any number of levels .
ca : and how could you achieve that ?
so if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing , that will give you a factor of two improvement .
em : we want to beat Gary .
you save all that tunneling cost .
em : right . I 'm in favor of flying things .
em : I think there 's no real length limit .
very nice . very funny .
like , it will cost less than a bus ticket .
this is just using passive optical , which is essentially what a person uses .
ca : so the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them .
they can 't yet do what that showed .
so you have an even color from the ground level .
you can 't tell from street level .
( applause ) CA : people want to position this as an either or , that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to , you know , you pick your issue .
it 's tautological .
we know that our friend James , who comes in after school and is staying at a local shelter , isn 't reading at grade level and has probably never read at grade level .
it starts with ensuring free and equitable access to everything libraries offer them .
she said , " It would be like another credit card that I can 't pay . "
but like all of our friends at the library , I am busy , I lose track of things , my house is sometimes messy , and I have lost a DVD or two under the sofa .
basically , we fine because we 've always fined .
this film was called , " Le Monde Du Silence , " or , " The Silent World . "
and sound transmits very well underwater , much better than it does in air , so signals can be heard over great distances .
I learned that a D√©cima is a type of verse that only exists in Spanish , and that it has 10 lines .
it also has a very concrete date of origin , which is very rare for a style of stanza .
it died out about 200 years ago , and yet in Latin America , from Mexico to Chile , all our countries maintain some form of the D√©cima in our popular traditions .
for those of you with headphones on -- I see that some of you are listening to the translation -- please take them off for a minute .
and I wanted my song to be very , very Uruguayan , the most Uruguayan type of song there is -- the milonga .
in reality , the D√©cima is its origin , but at the same time , just like in the milonga and in the D√©cima , are the roots of many more cultures from all over the place , like he said .
I am dust in your wind and although I bleed through your wound , and every beloved stone has my deepest affection , there is not a stone in the world worth more than a human life .
he wrote a memoir about facing mortality .
either way , we never have those answers .
he said , " wouldn 't it be great if it did ? "
you keep saying things out loud .
and a gorilla suit never hurts , either .
and it turns out that thing in this person 's hand was a cell phone .
but we 've got to push even further back , back millions of years , because if we 're talking about genes , implicitly we 're now talking about the evolution of genes .
cultures change .
an atom is the smallest unit of any element in the periodic table .
electrons are bound to an atom 's nucleus by electromagnetism .
measurements of weak interactions found that there are different kinds of neutrinos associated with the electron , muon , and tau .
and we need to rethink how we produce our food to make it more regenerative .
moreover , approximately a third of all food produced is not eaten , and wasted food emits an astounding eight percent of global greenhouse gases .
when we implement these solutions , we shift the way we do business from a system that is inherently exploitative and extractive to a new normal that is by nature restorative and regenerative .
what 's code , what 's hardware ?
so , already , they 're complaining about the manuals : " before closing down in disgust ... " " The General Arithmetic : operating Logs . "
" I have now duplicated both results .
yeah , I do that .
( laughter ) Because I truly believe that humanity is a lot like me .
so this single @-@ minded pursuit in a very defensive mode of an objective that is , in fact , not aligned with the true objectives of the human race -- that 's the problem that we face .
I 'm trying to redefine AI to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently pursue objectives .
so what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective ?
what are you talking about ? "
that one incident would be the end of the domestic robot industry .
people used to think that the oceans were so vast that they wouldn 't be affected by human activities .
you see , I 'm a sleep researcher .
together , we co @-@ authored " The Conservative Case For Carbon Dividends . "
the answer is to return all the money raised directly to citizens , in the form of equal monthly dividends .
and , hopefully , we 've provided one .
look again .
it is one piece of bleached Honduras mahogany .
their arms are crossed , their legs are crossed , their body language is saying , " What am I going to learn from this lady who talks fast about painting and sculpture ? "
and most importantly , to forge human connections where they may not be apparent , empowering us all to see our work and the world writ large with a new set of eyes .
now , I 'm sure not many of you would be so blunt .
but the underlying assumption is the same : there 's something wrong with them .
what they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind .
and what that thing is doesn 't much matter -- whether it 's not enough time , money or food .
this narrows your focus to your immediate lack -- to the sandwich you 've got to have now , the meeting that 's starting in five minutes or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow .
just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers , like George Orwell , are now withering away in scarcity .
( laughter ) Now , don 't get me wrong -- I 'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen and the care workers here .
I believe in a future where an existence without poverty is not a privilege but a right we all deserve .
jobs are being killed off .
but you are not going to send your kids to school in a self @-@ driving car with 90 percent accuracy , even with 99 percent .
if we fail , it 's because we grew complacent and limited our ambitions .
VG : and in the tradition of our families , the great oral tradition of almost every Black church we know honoring the culture from which we draw so much power , we 're gonna start the way our Mommas and grandmas would want us to start .
it is an opportunity that we don 't take for granted , and so we thought long and hard about how we would use it .
would we talk to the women we hope to inspire , a million in the next year , or would we talk to you ?
but we 're going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary , and because we need you .
her mom walked down the steps of an abandoned school bus where she raised 11 kids as a sharecropper .
and I think it 's time for technology to help us train , to help us train people faster and better than ever before .
and today , 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking .
let 's play with optical illusions .
so I spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this .
and there 's no known cure .
it was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil who first noticed , just a year ago , after a Zika outbreak , that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly .
and then , in early 2015 , there was an upsurge of cases of a dengue @-@ like syndrome in the city of Natal in northeastern Brazil .
these are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua .
but it looks the same in Miami , Florida .
a little British company called Oxitec genetically modified that mosquito so that when it mates with a wild female , its eggs don 't develop to adulthood .
from there it 's pretty simple .
there ain 't no hammer that 's on this mountain that ring like mine , boy , that ring like mine .
and in the African @-@ American community , it 's been the work of many hundreds of years to find a way to lift ourselves up .
the good news is that architects and developers have begun to rediscover the joys of texture without backing away from modernity .
and that is the point .
so , this happy pic of me was taken in 1999 .
but for our purposes , chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you CANNOT control , and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former .
she 'd had enough , and she didn 't give me a Dear John letter , but she did give me this , a Dear John plaque .
so I created a written exercise that I called " fear @-@ setting , " like goal @-@ setting , for myself .

whereas nature tends to be small , and curved , and it bends and twists , and has legs instead , and appendages , and has many muscles and many , many sensors .
the first one : Pat and I have no science background .
we quickly learned that this shared resource was not going to be enough .
I truly believe this , that the biggest question in the 21st century concerns our duty to strangers .
and then when I asked the camp management how many of the 330,000 people in that camp were born there , they gave me the answer : 100,000 .
I think people do want to make a difference , but they just don 't know whether there are any solutions to this crisis .
but I still wish I could have known what they were thinking or what they were feeling .
a US @-@ based company has developed a technology to embed these sensors into the headrest of automobilies so they can track driver concentration , distraction and cognitive load while driving .
I worry that we will voluntarily or involuntarily give up our last bastion of freedom , our mental privacy .
and if so , does that mean that we 're free to alter our thoughts however we want ?
instead , we should be focusing on securing rights and remedies against the misuse of our information .
the time has come for us to call for a cognitive liberty revolution .
are aspirations converging all around the world ?
given our ridiculously elaborate educations , what is the nature of our responsibility to the world ?
they wanted schools .
this is me with a classroom of 11 @-@ year @-@ olds .
now -- thank you .
you folks in this room , work with us .
then we trace those threads of potential out into the future , asking : what might it feel like to live in this future ?
but this work is not about predictions .
its glaring presence is so overpowering , I can 't help but stare at it .
and we see this all around us .
we treat our future selves as a stranger , and the future as a foreign land .
we stripped it down to the bare minimum .
that planet , after all , supports our living bodies our whole lives .
I began designing a system based on the principles of livestock mortality composting that would take human beings and transform them into soil .
in the past , I was able to reassure my students that the majority of the world does not hate refugees .
is it difficult for prisoners ?
we 're going to take the sample , mount it on Paperfuge .
so now the sample is completely enclosed .
and now I 'm charging it up , and you see it builds momentum .
that 's a male chasing a female .
that is not true journalism .
eight weeks after they published my cell number , I obtained a press pass for a press conference for the candidate gaining momentum in the polls .
August is monsoon season in this region of the world , and anyone that lives near a river is no stranger to flooding and the hazards and inconveniences at minimum that are associated with that .
so if we zoom in here , you guys can see these nice , curvy river pathways .
again , they 're really beautiful , but again , they 're not static .
so just for reference , again , in this location , that river changed its course over four miles over the course of a season or two .
the yellow blob here is a fossil river .
but climate models struggle with clouds , and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways .
so in an extraordinary range of contexts all over the world , this technology is still the dominant , most used , most effective technology to manage governance .
we 're interested in scenarios in which this is not possible .
now , Spot has a set of cameras here , stereo cameras , and we have a feed up in the center .
it turns out , when you eat together , you start planning more activities together .
and in the library , I found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the Great Depression .
they made us dismantle the camp , and we started marching .
but faith is , too .
the shriek that came out of all of us when we regained our freedom , continues to vibrate in me to this day .
you have a wonderful , wonderful , wonderful trip .

so about three years ago , I got a call from the Brooklyn District Attorney .
the last one is a case about two boys , Willie Stuckey , David McCallum .

( applause ) And the rest of you , the non @-@ data scientists : this is not a math test .
and the answer is going to have to be cooperative economics .
and on a quiet day , I can hear her breathing . "
but instead , they used strange drawings with funny names like " squads " and " chapters " and " tribes " to explain how they were organized .
that is radical change for someone who used to be a master of milestone @-@ tracking .
and finally , if you walk the halls of these companies today , you just feel a new energy .
OK , so now you might understand what I said : modern AIs do not read , do not understand .
I decided to investigate what was going on in the human world .
I took hundreds of sentences from high school textbooks and made easy multiple @-@ choice quizzes , and asked thousands of high school students to answer .
but -- do I read you right , that you think we really need quite an urgent revolution in education to help kids do the things that humans can do better than AIs ?
[ the Way We Work ] My name is Dan , I 'm a partner at a global creative consultancy .

you may be thinking , you didn 't create these 3D models with only tourist photographs , and that 's true .
we need your help to reclaim the history that is being lost .
as soon as a red or blue triangle is created with a nodule at each point , it opens a doorway through time that will take you back to the present .

so in 2011 , I altered my name so that I could participate in Far Right youth camp in Hungary .
one is " Extreme Dialogue , " and it 's an educational program that we helped develop .

there 's quantum mechanics down in that corner , it 's very small , it 's very weird , it happens very quickly , and it 's a long way down in the general ...
on the scale of anything that matters for everyday life .
this is the Hubble Space Telescope .
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field , which is a very tiny part of the sky .
Hubble has been floating in free space for 25 years , not touching anything .
so the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use , also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time .
so this is the fun bit of physics , that you learn these patterns and then you can apply them again and again and again .
magnets that you can play with in your kitchen get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation .
if you 're at a boring party , fish some raisins out of the bar snacks , put them in some lemonade .
you win on all fronts .
there 's these little patterns , and they 're right around us everywhere .
and by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life , we gain the confidence to ask the right questions .
and the fundamental physical laws that we can learn that are the way the world around us works , are the tools at the basis of everything ; they 're the foundation .
the most obvious one is to get a teacup , get a spoon , tap the teacup around the rim and listen , and you will hear something strange .
( laughter ) But of course , I know what they 're really asking , so I say something like , " Well , my grandparents and my mum were born in India , my dad and I were born in Kenya , and I was brought up in London .

all those thousands of years of wisdom worked for me .
informal settlements are incorrectly named as the problem .
but the most significant reason we marched as a family is that it was a way for us to honor my parents ' legacy .
but what 's most important about this example is to think about the alternative .
but that is going to change by the convergence of two technologies : augmented reality and telepresence robots .
well , the robot doesn 't give you any of that .
a recent study made in the UK by the Office for National Statistics showed a higher life satisfaction rating among people living in rural areas .
and more importantly , do you want to ?
( laughter ) Yeah .
that was very important , and in some sense , we 've lost that .
I didn 't bring one with me , but they really work much better off @-@ board .
and we changed strategy completely . I decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it 's not what we 're doing now -- is to go to six countries .
they went to Uruguay , Peru , Mexico .
we are content to run our cities and rural dwellings alike on boreholes .
how does one run metropolises on boreholes and wells ?
it is yet another knowledge crisis regarding Africa 's agricultural resources , what and where they are , and how they can be best managed to make Africans live more lives that are worth living .
so far , over three and a half million people have played it .
these are from YouTube .
so what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands .
so the places are really densely populated .
these city designs are what I love the most .
like , it 's not enough to have a hospital .
so we need the solutions and these people , playing the game , they are trying out different kinds of solutions .
I 've got three boys ; they 're three , nine and 12 .
so there we have it .
for one thing , this study looks at what happens to thousands and thousands of children on average , but that doesn 't necessarily say what will help my child or your child or any individual child .
of course , I make sure they always have a book to read .
and so you don 't get change by asking them or even yelling at them .
come pick it up .
and I definitely want to give a little girl who may not have a real @-@ life role model the chance to watch movies and see women doing everything she dreams of achieving .

workplace romance can be a tricky topic .
how do we deal with gender imbalances and power dynamics in the workplace ?

off the rugged coast of the pacific northwest , pods of killer whales inhabit the frigid waters .
if it 's not just about our chromosomes , then what is being a woman about ?

and for that , we use the neural network , which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans .
( laughter ) Now , after five generations of applying evolutionary process , the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better .
now , this might look kind of trivial , but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further , because obviously this was just a very simple , blocky biped .

I hadn 't heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , " God , who 's saying what I 'm thinking ? "
so , let 's go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we 've shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
I need you to turn that piece of paper over ; you should find that it 's blank on the other side .
he got exactly the same response : lots and lots of sorry 's .
but as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed .
and I 'm going to run a little experiment . another little experiment .
( laughter ) Well , they 're still coming in from the back there ; they 're still coming in .
I 'd better clear these up out of the way ; otherwise , I 'm going to trip over them .
so , ah , that was fun .
but why is it important ?
we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions .
helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
life 's complicated ; we want to figure out what 's going on around us very quickly .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stripy thing : is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us ?
anybody know what this is ? it 's the peyote cactus .
he gave each of them some mescaline , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
the prototyping carts , filled with colored paper and Play @-@ Doh and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean , they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .
so we do quite a lot of work at IDEO trying to convince our clients of this .
it 's not really true .
and this is the main objection to the theory .
and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules , related or unrelated , that have the same vibrations .
and the prediction is it should smell of coumarin .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) And people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
and this is the new 77 @-@ million @-@ pound road @-@ improvement scheme , and there 's a new train line , a new railway station , and they 're all being funded by the European Union .
I was like , " What stuff ? "
and what happens on Facebook stays on Facebook , because only you see your news feed , and then it vanishes , so it 's impossible to research anything .
and he was extraordinarily brave , because the company is owned by Robert Mercer , the billionaire who bankrolled Trump , and he threatened to sue us multiple times , to stop us from publishing .
we have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well .
so this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
ca : all right .
it grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur .
let 's not hype the threat ; let 's actually see it clearly .
and you didn 't really know what you were going to see coming out of this .
this moment .
but it 's actually more complicated than that .
there 's something called the -- if I can get wonky for one moment -- the innermost stable circular orbit , that 's the innermost orbit at which matter can move around a black hole before it spirals in .
you 're just going to drift right through that event horizon .
he died unknown and penniless at the age of 46- a victim of the universe 's cosmic indifference .
now , before that technique , we were never ever certain about , 100 percent , who the parents of baby birds were .
" it 's OPP , time for other people 's what you get it there 's no room for relationship , there 's just room to ... "
how can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ?
and I kind of try not to look back , you know ?
there I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
and frankly , I don 't really know what to call myself .
and I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them ?
so , next time you are really depressed , look in the mirror and you can look and say , hi , I 'm looking at a star here .
it 's a planet somewhat similar to Earth . it 's a little bit smaller , but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth , you know , if you don 't take the oceans into account .
this is one very large crater . geologists love craters , because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it , and you can see what 's below the surface .
CE : that 's about what happened in the Houston operation room . it 's exactly like this .
but that last one percent , as it always seems to be , is the tricky part .
so by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it 'll already be over .
this is a natural product that is in all plant roots .
those are the three traits we want to change : more suberin , more roots , and the last one , deep roots .
and so when we do the experiments , we can 't actually take a loss in yield , because while we are doing these experiments , say , beginning about 10 years from now , the earth 's population will be even more than it is right now .
and the genius of doing that and a solution that can scale where there 's already scale .
but it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the toughest problems we 're facing .
we know that pleasure reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species , and it looked to me like giving might be one of those behaviors .
we saw that the more money people gave to Spread the Net , the happier they reported feeling afterward .
let 's take a snapshot at aviation .
new forms became bats . Civets .
the tip of his sword meets a woman 's foot as she attempts to flee the devastation .
( laughter ) What would they know ?
( laughter ) ( Applause ) That was not my point .
you need to come up the Lincoln Canyon .
Wat , wait . just hold this for me .
how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped , and so forth ?
if you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago , there 'd be no evidence of humans at all , because we don 't think there were humans yet .
I always think of space @-@ time as being the real substance of space , and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .
it 's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on .
so here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies .
what happens is , you take pictures as the Earth rotates , you get a fan across the sky .
remember , every spot on here is a galaxy , and you see the galaxies , you know , sort of in our neighborhood , and you sort of see the structure .
and you see this thing we call the Great Wall , and you see the complicated structure , and you see these voids .
there 's another survey which is very similar to this , called the Two @-@ degree Field of View Galaxy redshift Survey .
now we 're going to fly through it at warp a million .
it 's called dark matter .
so the stuff that 's in this picture that 's white , that is the dark matter .
there 's a very simple fluid to begin with .
and so from inside , it doesn 't look very complicated , right ?
and so here we are .
you see how the filament -- you see how several filaments are coming together , therefore making this Supercluster of galaxies .
it started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations , but expanding at a tremendous rate .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
so there it is .
but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form .
since then we 've had WMAP , which just gives us higher angular resolution .
and on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth , what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth .
and what I found was quite surprising .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
so given that we know and should believe -- because Moore 's Law 's been , like , a constant , I mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
in fact , if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that 's a property of carbon fiber also .
and so we begin to see , and we 've seen business plans already , where the kind of things Lisa Randall 's talking about are in there .
and we 've dedicated -- we 've just raised a new fund , we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments .
today scientists , technologists , businessmen , engineers don 't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
integrate human and machine intelligence right inside our own bodies to augment us , instead of diminishing us or replacing us .
simply by internally asking that question .
what you see on the screen are the words that Eric is speaking to himself right now .
Arnav Kapur : what happened is that the AI sent the answer through audio , through the device , back to Eric .
what Doug said that he wanted to use our system for is to reboot the old system he had , because that old system kept on crashing .
bright yellow .
it 's brilliant , right ?
we see them on the front of the bus , on the bakery 's facade , on the keyboard we write on , on our cell phones -- everywhere .
[ no trespassing ! ] I could also tell when something was made to last forever .
I mark some guidelines , delimiting the framework where the words will be .
I always make several sketches , where I 'll try different ideas or change elements .
lots of points and lines playing in the background help me convey that in this story , lots of things happen .
if I couldn 't say it by speaking , this was my way of talking and telling things to the world .
and that 's why I always want them to have shapes that are truly beautiful and exquisite .
and with that I look for a reaction in the reader , to wake them up somehow , to make them dream , make them feel moved .
let 's stop in China .
( laughter ) Let 's take the Delorean to Europe , the continent of delicious cheeses I love to eat but CANNOT pronounce .
that 's like buying a brand new Honda Odyssey minivan , OK ?
the United States is the only industrialized country in the world that does not require employers to offer paid parental leave .
( low notes changing in pitch ) So in this particular example , the orchid can communicate to you through images and sounds .
now to make this ecosystem possible , we have to avoid fragmentation .
thank you .
( video ) Man : you know , rather than drive today , I 'm going to walk .
and they lived together happily ever after .
over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky took these questions up in what would become one of the best @-@ known works of Russian literature : " crime and Punishment . "
its legitimacy comes not from the outer frame of constitutional rules , but from the inner workings of civic spirit .
and that brings me to my second topic : how we can practice civic religion productively .
we are never asked to reflect on the content of our citizenship .
you 've got your Bradypus three @-@ toed sloths , they 're the ones with the Beatles haircuts and the Mona Lisa smiles .
so they are their own slow @-@ moving , miniature ecosystem .
now , this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery , and there are lots of theories as to why they do it .
a jaguar jumped over the fire pit , but couldn 't carry Tecciztecatl into the sky .
but the fifth world still wasn 't truly established .
so one approach we 're taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
I became very interested , and I wrote about a couple .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
you 've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that 's happening , and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .
that 's what it is .
the two pieces that are probably notable : it 'll be a mesh network , so when the kids open up their laptops , they all become a network , and then just need one or two points of backhaul .
now , what we 're doing is , we 're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit .
that 's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now .
the games buttons are missing , but it 'll also be a games machine , book machine .
set it up this way , and it 's a television set .
one is that if you went into space you 'd be able to begin again .
one of my favorites . I had this feature that I built into Second Life -- I was really passionate about it .
it 's not easy to describe as a demographic .
( laughter ) I have 1,000 of these , 500 in the focal plane of each telescope in each hemisphere .
in addition to higher resolution versions of this display , my father and I are working on a new patent @-@ pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon .
so I 'd love to talk to you all , and invite you to come down and take a closer look .
and this is the difference between return on investment and return on kindness .
you see , we 'd just been to the grocery store , and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it .
she pulled the car over ; she said , " Get out of the car . "
you feel so lucky , like you 've hit the jackpot .
but by most measures , we have more knowledge and more resources now than at any other point in history , and still injustice abounds and challenges persist .
so basically , PET plastic goes from being a big , tough , long @-@ lasting pollutant to a tasty meal for my bacteria .
as somebody who 's spent the last two decades advocating a shift away from industrial meat production , I wanted to believe that this clarion call was going to make a difference .
that 's just common courtesy .
I would see a video of a police officer gunning down someone who looked just like me .
this is not a copy .
so the printing press , ladies and gentlemen , was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading .
but we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine .
thanks , Chris .
Ch√¢teau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar .
they are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand @-@ dipped in natural indigo 24 times .
Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany .
and it 's not because they need a therapist , though that does sometimes happen , it 's really because anger is universal .
in the German town of N√∂rdlingen in 1593 , an innkeeper named Maria H√∂ll found herself accused of witchcraft .
they each do their own thing , flashing on and off , paying no attention to their neighbors .
but I hope that you 'll go outside and see the world in a new way , to see all the amazing synchrony around us . thank you .
they 've leapfrogged .
( laughter ) And it 's not completely gratuitous , because " wok " and " roll " -- Chinese food and Japanese foods , so it kind of works out .
and as a matter of fact , then , this is one of the reasons we must exclude them from this country .
someone 's like , " It 's sweet , it 's fried , it 's chicken -- Americans will love this . "
I was surprised to discover that not only in Philadelphia , but also in Atlanta .
for example , Lem Sen , who introduced chop Suey , Chef Peng , who introduced General Tso 's Chicken , and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies .
it doesn 't take a shrink to explain how I ended up in the field of conflict resolution .
it 's specific to them , just as your gathering should be specific to you .
it 's a good rule in that it preserves harmony , or that 's its intention .
I was once working with an architecture firm , and they were at a crossroads .
and there was real disagreement in the room , but you wouldn 't know , because no one was actually speaking up publicly .
what about a hypothetical tense Thanksgiving dinner ?
and then suddenly we had a Zach , a perfect one @-@ year @-@ old boy / dinosaur , depending on his mood .
( laughter ) I had not yet fully grasped the way that the prosperity gospel had become the great civil religion , offering another transcendent account of the core of the American Dream .
I had to face the fact that my life is built with paper walls , and so is everyone else 's .
and when surfers are out waiting for waves , you probably wonder , if you 've never been out there , what are they doing ?
but the general idea that you could only -- you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis .
but -- all of us own stuff .
not a whole lot of people doing this stuff .
it 's like anything else that 's prohibited : you do it behind the garage .
and then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid , brown .
but if you go to authority , and you always don 't -- you don 't always get the right answer , see .
and then you figure out better and better ways to do it .
now , let 's see ...
and they weren 't the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air .
it 's a paper that came out in February , and most of you probably hadn 't heard about it .
this is a good point .
so when we say that these deep subsurface microbes are just dormant , are we like people who die after a day , trying to figure out how trees work ?
that lake that we 're standing next to is made of pure battery acid .
but the fact that it erupted illustrates perfectly that if you want to look for where carbon dioxide gas is coming out of this oceanic plate , then you should look no further than the volcanoes themselves .
we discovered that literally tons of carbon dioxide were coming out of this deeply buried oceanic plate .
he was the first digital media producer in Tokyo .
and so , I began to think more carefully about the computer .
we are extremely dinosaur @-@ like , and unusual in our two @-@ legged approach to life .
it 's really an island continent .
now , I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution .
( laughter ) I 'd like to show you an animation in this next one , which is one element of the Skycar 's use , but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used .
we don 't know .
again , another medical example here .
Red can be comical : it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana .
they handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes .
while we can 't directly observe growth conditions in the mantle , laboratory experiments have shown some evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures .
and he said , " My mother . "
he fixated on a story Douglass told of how , over Christmas , masters give slaves gin as a way to prove to them that they can 't handle freedom .

so people say a lot of things about reading that feel exaggerated to me .
how precious are these lines from the poet Derek Walcott ?
because whole grain -- it 's easy with white flour to make a good @-@ tasting bread . white flour is sweet .
O.K. ? radical , not subtle .
the first story , about the neighbor .
in politics , the rare candidate who is serious , like Adlai Stevenson , is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn , like Eisenhower .
and first I was praised for it , then criticized for it , but the fact of the matter was , I had become solemn .
it will change every six months , and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh , and it will probably become a landmark in the area .
one of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water .
I 've taken one shot ; I cropped it a few different ways .
I do a lot of workshops all over the world , really , and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors .
( laughter ) You could -- you could highlight it ; you could make it Helvetica or something : it is the actual article .
( laughter ) We can build a better vine .
and if you travel through Asia today , you will also see the results of the third revolution : the revolution of good governance .
I personally experienced the shock and grief because I was in Manhattan when 9 / 11 happened .
while the second Iraq war , fought by his son , President George W. Bush , failed ?
so a great future lies ahead for humanity .
but this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress -- burnt down , forever lost -- each year .
the ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction .
I got this email from him two years ago ; he said , " I think I 've got an answer to some of your questions . "
I had not been elected .
a speck of paint , traveling at the right speed , impacting one of these objects , could render it absolutely useless .
where are things going ? "
why is that ?
and no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level .
like , I almost came out of it , in front of , like , 5,000 people .
I was the guinea pig . , I 'm telling you , this was , like -- talk about a tourist attraction .
this is not true .
what is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed , that it had impact , that you were effective .
now , how do I feel about the time and effort I took to do that , when I really have no idea if I helped you , if it actually helped you get the thing that you wanted ?
but you know what else they do ?
they get pictures .
a possible economic motivation to treat the patients .
meaning that most of the procedures performed on the chart I 've just shown could have been avoided , even in Stavanger .
and if spots light up , we know there 's a certain virus in there .
well , it 's pretty simple .
we put a ton of virus up this guy 's nose . so -- ( Laughter ) -- I mean , we wanted it to work . he really had a cold .
so it 's not here . it 's not now .
this is felt as an inner discomfort .
first , we can flip distance to social .
we can also reframe climate as being about new tech opportunities , about safety and about new jobs .
we can flip identity with better stories .
so thousands of climate communicators are now starting to use these solutions all over the world .
these developments laid the groundwork for the modern field of antibiotics- currently home to our most effective TB treatments .
he was a good movement .
they have to track the sun , because they have to point directly at the sun .
James Watt didn 't actually invent the steam engine , he just refined it .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you 're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
and is only affects the payback period , it doesn 't mean that you couldn 't use solar energy ; you could use it anywhere on Earth .
his character not only remembers everything he has ever seen , but every time he has seen it in perfect detail .
born in Argentina in 1899 , he admired the revolutionaries of his mother 's family but took after his father 's bookish clan .
and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past .
as recently as 1960 , 110 million children were born , and 20 million of those died before the age of five .
and I think that 's doable in well under 20 years .
and that doesn 't seem entirely fair .
teach for America : slight effect .
and so that 's sort of working in the opposite direction .
since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5 , we can place these two cache points 5 parsecs apart .
you jump 3 parsecs , drop 9 units off at the cache point , and then jump the 3 units home , arriving with an empty tank .
Pakistan is home to 200 million people .
and we began to think about using our film to change the way people perceived honor killings , to impact the loophole in the law .
many of the towns had never seen television or social media , and they were eager for their children to learn .
and in one of the villages that we were screening in , they shut it down and said they didn 't want the women to know about their rights .
we are changing the way people in these villages interact , and we 're taking our learnings into other places .
and I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
we 're electing regulators who don 't have the backbone to actually go after these companies .
they approve the merger and then -- spoiler alert ! -- they figure it out .
that 's one Yankee Stadium of workers .
and they say , " Wait , wait -- we 're not a fast @-@ food restaurant , we 're a fast @-@ food platform . "
if Sheryl Sandberg had written a book on gun rights or on the pro @-@ life movement , would they be flying Sheryl to Cannes ?
they didn 't seem as nice , and regulators stepped in much earlier than the regulators now , who would never step in on those nice , nice people .
Amazon has become so powerful in the marketplace , it can conduct Jedi mind tricks .
I think they are trying to build something cool , and are probably , in moments of reflection , as horrified that some of the things that have happened as we might be .
I wanted her to be seen in a clinic that specialized in trauma survivors .
but she took down the address and agreed to go .
if you 're thinking that , it 's probably because you have resources .
and he said , " Well , I have to work in order to pay the rent . "
I 'll sign it and I 'll fax it in for you . "
and so now I had to have him take the two buses back to the office and sign the form so that we could then fax it in for him .
the proliferation of inexpensive cell phones has actually helped quite a lot .
but also , maybe there was something more important that day than their high blood pressure or a screening colonoscopy .
but when they don 't , they have others who can advocate for them , who can get them that disability placard or make sure the disability application is completed .
he was by his own admission a gangbanger .
we spend more on health care than any other country in the world .
maybe it 's because my dad was a civil rights attorney and my parents were socially conscious and demanded that we stand up for what we believe in .
this is true overall in the United States , where about three quarters of all black women deliver in a specific set of hospitals , while less than one @-@ fifth of white women deliver in those same hospitals .
in one demonstration , he caused a pig to lose its voice by tying off one of its nerves .
he was convinced that each organ had a specific function .
today , actually , is a very special day for me , because it is my birthday .
and let me illustrate that .
and not only does he run only one percent faster than the second one , but he doesn 't run 10 times faster than I do -- and I 'm not a good runner , trust me on that .
I had the first 10 years where I had to work a lot and I don 't achieve much .
and we don 't know , because there hasn 't been enough time passed yet to actually figure out how much impact those papers will get ; it takes time to acquire .
we 're not looking at real age .
and you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary .
and it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine .
when we think about what capital letters denote , they denote something important , whether it 's our names , or our titles .
actually , in some ways , America 's the home of capitalization .
and for them , this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America .
so for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea .
or even just new book covers , whether they were from Europe .
so in some ways , this German typeface on an American plaque perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology .
Obits aren 't about death , they 're about life , they 're interesting , they 're relatable .
that 's the impetus behind a project I created called " Overlooked , " which tells the stories of marginalized groups of people who never got an obit .
perhaps in a generation or two , we 'll start to see more women and people of color in our obituaries . "
and I thought , wow , one of the biggest sports in America was introduced by a woman ?
and it sent me on this deep dive through the archives .
and once my team saw the value in it , they were all in .
my all @-@ time favorite is Grandma Gatewood .
and at the finish , they asked her , " How did you survive so rough a place ? "
and then I 'm hoping to partner with this programmer again , to build a similar tool to measure people of color in our obits .
again , it was a really powerful experience .
a lot of them had to make up stories about their past just to get ahead in life .
and there were these patterns of their struggles that came up again and again .
thank you .
we know why these scripts are there .
instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes .
this guy runs the China Investment Corporation .
so they engineered these cells so that when they 're growing in the exponential phase , they would smell like wintergreen .
think about that for a second .
thank you .
why don 't we try to reclaim the promise of public education and remember that it 's our greatest collective responsibility ?
psychologists study behavior to explore the contents of the mind , because our behavior often reflects our beliefs , our values and our desires .
or when we chose to offer candy , as opposed to nutritious food , as a reward for good behavior .
and in turn , this ends up shaping their own behavior .
some , like my grandmother and my siblings , seemed to be born reading , as though history stepped out of their way .
so as technology continues to speed ahead , I continue to read slowly , knowing that I am respecting the author 's work and the story 's lasting power .
we have had CAR T cells stay in the bodies of our cancer patients now for more than eight years .
so one infusion can do the job ; they stay on patrol for the rest of your life .
but then , another fork in the road happened .
we 're so grateful to see patients who were formerly terminal return to healthy lives , as Emily has .
but what does this mean ?
if the region falls sick , the entire planet will eventually suffer .

Hypatia was born around 355 in Alexandria , then part of the Egyptian province of the Eastern Roman Empire , and an intellectual center .
I think we owe that to this generation .
failed experiments look inefficient , but they 're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works .
" they 're too busy . "
anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it , a spurious kind of manifest destiny .
and as soon as the former adversaries were gathered around some small green tables , each of them could claim a victory , and the whole world could breathe more easily .
but long before that , really , the history of the modern world was best told through the bouncing white ball .
( laughter ) No exaggeration .
I couldn 't exult after a tremendous upset victory against our strongest players , because six minutes later , with a new partner , I was falling behind again .
and when I flew away from Japan and started playing singles again with my English archrival , I noticed that after every defeat , I was really brokenhearted .
" well , " said the team spokesman , " because of his emphasis on winning . "

right now , we have slow @-@ moving solutions to a fast @-@ moving problem .
this is also known as a moral hazard .
yet today , the global level of investment in these interventions is effectively zero .
because the truth is when I got this disease , I was all up in the mirror staring at every new spot trying to figure out what is going on .
a lot of them , before they went down some internet rabbit hole , they had been libertarian or they had been socialist or they had been something else entirely .
on the other hand , by talking , a group could exchange knowledge , correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas .
the most intuitive idea is that it 's just the average of all the answers in the group , right ?
imagine what that means to our life support system .
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , National Marine Sanctuaries .
that 's another great idea .
the good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .
to cope with climate change , we need new ways to generate power .
so we aborted using motion capture .
any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are , if the knowledge of how to do so were present there .
and here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
they will float in seawater , but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills .
that 's fine , it 's how we 're designed .
well , in the context of diving , you get too much , you die also .
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces .
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium : you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you 're interested in .
the nursery , in here , is quite different .
we actually have it already with Google Earth .
I 'll just run them very quickly through .
because of the overhanging leaves and branches , you 'll notice that the understory is very dark , it 's very still .
( applause ) -- that we 've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing .
he saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest , and created this beautiful sculpture .
and I brought a little segment to give you of Duke Brady 's " Canopy Rap . "
the " Dirty Jobs " crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
the job in question : herding sheep .
we 're on in five continents , dude !
I don 't like what I 'm thinking right now . "
as a group , they 're the happiest people I know .
how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it 's sort of an analog computer .
and the waiter can come by and say , " Would you like more water ? "
and so people follow workplace norms .
they 've dealt with massive growth that overwhelmed existing communities and the rise of new business models .
but then , in the long journey for my book , all over the world , I kept meeting people who were doing exactly that , from Sydney , to San Francisco , to S√£o Paulo .
and Lisa had been shut away in her home with crippling depression and anxiety for seven years .
they started to get their fingers in the soil .
what matters here is that we relearn how to have these face @-@ to @-@ face discussions , without anyone else listening , with a stranger .
over the roughly one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half millennia of its existence , chess has been known as a tool of military strategy , a metaphor for human affairs , and a benchmark of genius .
today , chess software is capable of consistently defeating the best human players .
so I 'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence .
the human hand , in manipulation of objects , is the hand in search of a brain ; the brain is in search of a hand ; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way .
nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
and I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly , " It 's really important to have a lot of data . "
it 's not just a whole lot of other plants .
by the time they 're 18 years old , 93 percent of first year college males and 62 percent of females have seen pornography at least once .
now , what the scientists are telling us we need to do over the next 80 @-@ odd years to the end of this century , is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by three percent every year , and draw three gigatons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year .
it does , it 's one of the best options , but there are many , many possibilities .
direct air capture is a great example of a chemical pathway , and people are using that right now to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and manufacture biofuels or manufacture plastics .
you know , if we could cover nine percent of the world 's ocean in seaweed farms , we could draw down the equivalent of all of the greenhouse gases we put up in any one year , more than 50 gigatons .
how many ocean @-@ going seaweed farms do we actually have out there ?
there 's no nutrients there that were used up long ago .
and with just a little bit of clean , renewable energy , you can pump that water up and use the nutrients in it to irrigate your seaweed crop .
so I think this really has so many benefits .
and then came the internet , and the market exploded .
our dream was an alarm bell on the desks of officers all around the world so that if anyone dare post a new victim online , someone would start looking for them immediately .
this audacious commitment is part of that will .
they find an audience primed to believe them .
no way to explode a star in a lab to figure out why or how it blew up .
imagine the cost .
our subjects doubled their cheating .
but in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
so , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
when we get bigger distance from cheating , from the object of money , for example , people cheat more .
what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
and the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them .
so on my birthday , what did I do ?
and I feel like every day that I 'm speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me , I feel like I 'm falling out of that plane .
and TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn 't photograph it -- a museum Vitrine .
this access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented .
it gave people amazing content around the globe .
let 's try taking a seat by one of those campfires right now .
700 people that way -- but it 's great and really it 's just -- ES : so Cohh , what is going on in chat right now ?
as these pictures show , the grieving heart in the middle looks very different than the normal heart on the left .
both groups were fed a high @-@ cholesterol diet .
political cartoons were born with democracy , and they are challenged when freedom is .
two in particular are iron and zinc .
there 's about one billion people who are zinc deficient .
and it 's not just us .
cattle are already being affected because the quality of their forage is declining .
and , of course , it will be very helpful to know how these changes could affect our future health and the health of our children and the health of our grandchildren .
let 's invest in ourselves , in our children and in our planet .
it 's the only Spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
anybody who was anybody had an apartment there .
and faux @-@ nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war .
this is the only fashion cover I 've ever done .
and so we proposed what 's at the lower diagram .
it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere , wherever you place it , the area under it is charged for theatrical performances .
I 've had a heart for , like , 40 years now .
and of course , when I think of Monday , I 'll think of " Manic Monday " by the Bangles . it 's a good song .
and public spending is not going up nearly fast enough .
I quickly took down the number , because it said " flexible hours , " and I needed that to work around my basketball schedule .
why would it be looking for human fingers if it 's trying to identify a fish ?
but what it looks like happened is the AI was trained to recognize trucks on highway driving , where you would expect to see trucks from behind .
my great @-@ grandfather made a living grafting peach orchards in Southeastern Pennsylvania .
so this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright , and the Wright Flyer .
with this factory and 100,000 planes a year , we could make all of America 's electricity in about 10 years .
and it also has one of the higher productivity rates as well .
once upon a time , I was a stubborn five @-@ year @-@ old who decided to become a marine biologist .
and when you think about the issue of the border , I have more border than any other member of Congress .
so the question , then , is why does the administration continue to do it , when we 've seen 900 additional children separated from their parents since the summer of 2018 ?
I think we need more immigration judges in order to process these cases , and I think we need to ensure that folks can get representation .
the world is in turmoil : robots have taken over , and only Ethic can set things right .
and this is for good reason : deep @-@ sea vents are well @-@ known in the ancient rock record , and it 's thought that the early Earth had a global ocean and very little land surface .
if the rocks could talk , I suspect they might say this : life on Earth is precious .
on the second of July , 2015 , his life was cut short when he was killed by a trophy hunter .
this is quite common in Zimbabwe , as many people are not exposed to wildlife , even though it 's part of our heritage .
I made a commitment that day that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals .
thank you .
I 've heard there 's something new -- a million times more rad than my phone .
I want to say , " Look -- now I 'm cool " I stood in line and I 'll get mine .
who cares if it 's AT & amp ; T ?
that wavelength is called far @-@ UVC light , and it 's just the short @-@ wavelength part of the ultraviolet spectrum .
and there 's a good , solid physics reason for that : far @-@ UVC light is incredibly , strongly absorbed by all biological materials , so it simply can 't go very far .
one stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming in the last sort of 15 , 20 years generally don 't stop .
as you 've been walking through that world , we 've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you 're not in to vanish , and the parts of it in front of you to appear .
and this is my personal favorite .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with HIV .
fortunately , I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that 's the only way that this work can really occur .
and that was some outreach .
and it dawned on me , as we were there , I 'm going like , " Here we are in the seat of Mother Africa , and we 're trying to teach these people how to dance ? "
what I want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
we work in clay , which hasn 't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it , and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too .
OK , it 's not marketing ; there 's a very interesting car concept here , but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here .
toothbrush , cool .
and so I had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
and so , in conclusion , my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you , was this one here . I 'm also going to steal a little quote out of " Little Prince . "
and there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
and , lastly , under " Harmony , " they had this 13th @-@ century mandala from Tibet .
you know , that 's not a big deal to accomplish .
and he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers , large ones and small ones .
that scene sounds like science fiction , but is battlefield reality already .
the soldier in that case was a 42 @-@ pound robot called a PackBot .
and the tech term " killer application " takes on new meaning in this space .
the U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now , but we know that in technology there 's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .
or another way of thinking about this is , what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India ?
they also record everything that they see .
they lose the strategy .
my story begins when I opened the holy book for the first time ...
you can -- if you love anything , you can work hard and you can accomplish anything you want .
so I 'd get this beta software and hardware from places like HP and Sun and Russell Brown at Adobe .
and I had no manual , so I 'd figure it out and I fell in love with it even more .
and then a couple years ago , I felt a little bit lost , creatively .
I felt lucky to be here , but at this moment , I realized that I was not just lucky to be here , I had the right to be here .
it became more physical when I went to the movie theater .
I got to be who I wanted to be when I needed to be it .
and as I was doing the finishing touches on this talk , I realized that all the powerful connections in my life were through generosity and kindness and love and hope .
and they will continue to circulate in the blood , giving them more time to find the tumor .
and here we see the cancer drug , the firefighters , inside the fire truck , the nanoparticles .
and those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what , to me , is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka , Bangladesh .
and this is the largest project he has got in here , the poorest country in the world .
but I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that 's why , he has given love for us .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
wow . ( laughs ) And sigh , and , whoo , going to get blown away there .
( laughter ) But it is really incredible , and when we do this , what we find is that these dogs can correctly tell us when somebody is infected with malaria 81 percent of the time .
and if you couldn 't predict , you died .
if you 're a conservative , you become more conservative .
and it 's the experience of awe .
well , others have demonstrated , for instance , Professors Haidt and Keltner , have told us that people feel small but connected to the world .
they actually seek risk , and they are better able at taking it .
they were more likely to give a positive response after the performance than they were [ before ] .
and the results are actually incredibly positive .
I know what it 's like to have the government say , " We 're going to kill you in the morning . "
but Sally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three , and what they 're saying to Harry .
no . how about 10 times ?
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
you take a look at this , this is not based on statistics .
I want to be very clear here . I 'm not projecting some past data into the future .
and then the model makes predictions down the road .
that 's not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they 're not put under international pressure , if they 're allowed to pursue their own devices .
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today , this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 , early parts of 2011 .
that power disappears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011 .
these folks are the moneyed interests in Iran , the bankers , the oil people , the bazaaries .
they are growing in political clout , as the mullahs are isolating themselves -- with the exception of one group of mullahs , who are not well known to Americans .
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable .
ca : so you 're kind of trying to say , " People of Iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . "
ca : here 's hoping they hear it that way . thank you very much Bruce .
I 'm from Detroit .
they further go on to say that 40 square miles of the city is vacant .
and these aren 't plots of land where we 're just growing tomatoes and carrots either .
keep Growing Detroit is a nonprofit organization that had a lot to do with those farms .
today , as a physical organic chemist , I 'm committed to use my training to help protect rivers , like the Mississippi , from excessive salt that can come from human activity .
if we add one teaspoon of salt to this Olympic @-@ size swimming pool of ocean water , the ocean water stays ocean water .
so the point here is , because rivers , the volume is so small compared to the oceans , it is especially vulnerable to human activity , and we need to take care to protect them .
and these membranes are negatively charged , and help to repel the negatively charged chloride ions that are in that dissolved salt .
now , I 've introduced this to a number of industrial @-@ water users , and the common response is , " Yeah , but who is going to use my salt ? "
so you can see how circular salt can provide a barrier to our rivers from this excessive salty discharge .
they keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do .
and what all of them had in common was that as they slept , they 'd all been bitten by the only mammal that lives exclusively on a diet of blood : the vampire bat .
" who 's been getting bitten by a bat lately ? "
and so all we had to do was go to the right house , open up a net and show up at night , and wait until the bats tried to fly in and feed on human blood .
it 's that vaccinating the animal source is the only thing that stops rabies .
so , can we vaccinate bats ?
and what 's even better is that these vaccines can actually spread from bat to bat .
but it was very painful at times and continues to be so .
" Oh , yeah ? when ? "
that molecule is there , and they 're making light .
and we think by studying bacteria , we 're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body .
and how do you convince the mothers to actually bring their children for immunization ?
made of gleaming bronze ; endowed with superhuman strength , and powered by Ichor , the life fluid of the gods , this automaton was unlike anything Hephaestus had forged before .
to answer this , I had to build a machine .
( laughter ) I 've been developing an open @-@ source biometric lab , an AI system which I call the limbic Lab .
this process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
and serious competition from Europe , from Korea , and next is China , which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .
they make a little net money for the treasury .
let me focus a minute on the light vehicles , the cars and light trucks , because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here drives one .
so then of the energy that does get to the wheels , only an eighth of it , half of that , goes to heat the tires on the road , or to heat the air the car pushes aside .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) And you know people , this is the problem with quote , objectivity , unquote .
( laughter ) But here 's how I think I like to make change , and that is in making connections .
and they look quite similar .
it 's different , very different from the surrounding buildings , because other buildings are trying to build a wall around the nature .
here 's a short clip of our film .
civil rights groups often do not have any better option to quickly make their recordings accessible to a large audience than by uploading them to social media .
we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience , which will create the new world .
well , I 'll tell you .
think about building a house of Lego blocks , with all of the nooks and crannies that latch together , as opposed to smooth building blocks .
( laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And the more they publish , the more they inspire other Tunica people to get involved .
when these solar storms are moving in space , some of them will inevitably encounter space probes that we humans have sent in order to explore other worlds .
and while these space probes have been made for different scientific endeavors , they can also act like tiny cosmic meteorological stations and monitor the evolution of these space storms .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electrons , something interesting happens .
he said hybrids are like mermaids .
for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on range , not a reduction in range .
we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S.
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we 'll recover him .
( applause ) OK , guys , time to go home .
and pretty soon it 's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin .
I guess this crisis is teaching humanity that now you need to listen to us and to support indigenous peoples directly , to support their initiatives directly .
the kitchen area is dirty and grimy .
collaborate with them on solutions that could work for society and for business .
and so I set up a breakfast meeting in New York City .
and that is , they said , " You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin . "
and she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities .
and by the way , soy is a key ingredient for chicken feed , and that 's the connection to McDonald 's .
and I said , " How about working together ? "
she was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice .
she came back . she goes , " Come on . I don 't have all day . "
and then I took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
that photo is of the semi @-@ finals of the Buenos Aires championships , four months later .
the interesting thing about this climb is it 's not that hard .
but if you 're the leader on it , at the hardest move , you 're looking at about 100 foot fall , onto some low angle slabs .
so you 've got to focus .
fear really sucks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing .
just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the tallest models are about two or three feet high .
and I went home , and I told my sister Christine .
and she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A. ' s major art colleges , CalArts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square @-@ foot gallery .
and to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center 's 3,000 square foot gallery .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
and they have different properties .
that 's our definition of a parallel line .
they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness , it 's called a geodesic .
so we ask the question again , " How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? "
but that 's only because I 'm projecting it onto a flat surface .
how could they see this ?
it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered Euclidean space .
I can touch it . I can play with it . "
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
we started out , Chrissy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathematically perfect models .
we have these technologies . we use them .
but you can do it through playing with material objects .
economic game theorists have a way of modeling this interplay between rationality and practicality called k @-@ level reasoning .
in each case , participants must weigh their own understanding of the best course of action against how well they think other participants understand the situation .
instead , I 'm going to begin with me in graduate school in New Jersey in the mid @-@ 1990s , earnestly studying US history , which is what I currently teach as a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee .
they work hard .
here , again , the nativist answer is no , immigrants are permanently different from us and inferior to us .
but the distinction itself is at the heart of the way nations define themselves .
it 's reinforced in everyday ways that we talk and act and behave , down to the bordered maps that we hang up in our schoolrooms .
the problem with this worldview is that it just doesn 't correspond to the way the world actually works , and the way it has worked in the past .
second , we need to ask questions about responsibility .
when immigrants send money or goods home to their family , it plays a significant role in narrowing these gaps , if a very incomplete one .
thank you .
but with that thought , also came a stronger , a more willful voice from deep within .
" now one more . "
so I took a second and a third stroke .
even the most common type , osteoarthritis , is trickier to prevent than one might think .
and the mission and the magic begin .
I had a signed authorization to act as Anna 's attorney , so I rushed over to the port of entry to see if I could speak with my client .
these refugees , many of whom are families , are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world , where they 're being raped , kidnapped and extorted by criminal groups .
it 's about who you live with .
especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups .
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
and when Shea wasn 't driving the bus , she would be watching over Zion , making sure she was studying .
amber and I bonded over our battles with lupus .
Moses , an officer , Ranger , veteran , was very clear about his water rescue mission : bring relief of free , clean water to the people in Flint .
as teachers , we work every day to provide support socially , emotionally and academically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances .
like most teachers , I have students who go home every day , and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy , well @-@ rounded meal for them .
they come to school with trauma , and when I go home every day , that goes home with me .
so I changed almost everything about my teaching .
and I needed someone to listen , somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend .
but when it comes to teaching professionals , that urgency is lagging .
and after a while , our souls become weighed down by the heaviness of it all .
they found that approximately one in 10 reported clinically significant depressive symptoms .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
these schools are making space for conversations that matter .
they remember what they wrote on it .
every now and then , we all just need a little help holding the stapler .
thank you .
embarrassingly enough , I finished up with " If not this , what ?
now , B Corps are a group of companies who believe in business as a force for good .
and the leaders in this space are doing a few things very differently from traditional heroic leaders .
until 2014 , there was no protection for these workers .
once you 've seen problems like this , you can 't unsee them , so you have to ask others to help you to solve them .
the second big difference for collaborators is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan .
I remember the day really clearly .
so we changed the way we ran our innovation and planning meetings in two important ways .
and I was the foreigner , and I was the boss and I apparently had that intimidating hero look .
and it 's not compelling and it 's not even interesting .
so , we changed it and we created these full @-@ day marketplaces , kind of like a big bazaar .
so I 'm immediately in interdependence land .
my dream is that one day , someone will stand on this stage and tell you how radical interdependence saved my beloved rhinos .
I thought that in the elevation and separation that comes from heroic leadership , that I would be untouchable .
literally , fabricating with biology .
we 're just beginning to realize the potential of nature @-@ based technologies .
in the last century , we expected material innovation to come from the likes of DuPont , Dow , BASF .
for example , if you 're a taxi driver in San Francisco and you decide to work 10 hours per day , then you 're actually having a paying passenger in your car for four hours out of the 10 .
by design , they create more value for the economy .
the negative externality of Uber cars becoming more productive is taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop by as much as 30 percent in New York , for example .
then , maybe , a motorbike or a traditional taxi that you can order and pay for from within the same app .
he wanted to be independent .
so what we built of course , Ushahidi , is crowdsourcing this information .
higher than the likes of Singapore , countries in North America and even countries in Europe .
milk in India is produced by marginal milk farmers , with two or three cows or buffalos , who produce five to ten liters of milk a day .
Raj and I built a simple data intelligence platform that allowed us to map all the recyclers , giving us a bird 's eye view of every recycler in Hyderabad .
when I was young , I used to -- ( sings in Hindi ) .
and just to give you some context , 27 percent of women work in India .
so we heralded a group of mothers @-@ in @-@ law and a few mothers into the office , and we took them to our R and D labs .
on a new nuclear arms race or another national security priority , such as cybersecurity or climate change ? "
are those your kids ? they 're so cute .
those improved ones become our version 1.0s.
now , we were surprised when we won the New South Wales Entrepreneur of the Year in the young category for entrepreneurs under 40 .
in the early days , I was flying back and forth to San Francisco every week for Atlassian , and I racked up a lot of frequent flyer points and got access to the Qantas business lounge .
and if they don 't freeze , and they 're thankful , and they work harder and they stretch to be the best partner they can , it 's likely to be a very successful relationship .
and in doing so , I managed to kick a very small rock off a very big hill that turned into an avalanche that I found myself tumbling in the middle of .
and I think , as you 'll see , there 's reasons for optimism , because I believe that the best is yet to come .
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies .
this lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed .
the monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces .
this is constructed by physical change .
it 's what you pay attention to .
it 's what the brain regards , itself , as positive and important to you .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we 're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .
most of them would be intellectual and academic failures .
the child 's native language is such a case is not English .
such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain .
this results in declines in memory in cognition , and in postural ability and agility .
and of course , a well @-@ ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key .
Oh my ! there 's so many of you .
( laughter ) She has me here because she puts me in her show , what she calls her one @-@ woman show .
really , it 's amazing .
and she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe .
well , I don 't know how else to say it to you , so I 'll just say it my way : the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the , you know , the bankers and the Wall Street . you know it .
thank you everybody .
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath .
and I 'm just trying not to panic and freak out . so I like , take a deep breath .
and actually , I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything .
but my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly .
so , I always teach my kids to respect American ideas , but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- ( Laughter ) -- that she is not gay , she is just confused by this American problem .
I am originally from Jordan .

I met global food companies , financial institutions and local government officials .
and you 've got to admit , over the last year and a half , consumers have been doing some weird things .
everything is focused on betterment , training , development and moving forward .
so that was a sort of a success .
I mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra .
so it 's not about my story . it 's not about your story .
let 's see another super @-@ conductor , a German super @-@ conductor . Herbert von Karajan , please .
now it 's a reversed thing . you 're telling the story . and you 're telling the story .
so I curled up next to her and I drizzled sand on her other arm and then her legs .
and they are having great fun .
forget about pensions . think about life and where it 's going to be going .
and of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they 've been left out in one way or another .
and I was on death row at that time .
the basic thing I got to learn was that if I thought , and if you think , you can , you will .
and that 's part of our duty .
new ways to try and get new options that we can use together with things such as bednets to be able to get to zero .
the males go there for a dance , the females fly into that dance and select a male mosquito of their choice , usually the best @-@ looking male in their view .
( laughter ) Well , except they 've been pre @-@ warned now , and they 'll know you 're making it up .
it 's another way of getting the intuition .
you know about the Human Genome Project .
why do we care about that ?
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
he looked at some research , which said the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clark 's is about one in 8,500 .
now , we probably think a priori that 's unlikely .
even if you believe the number , just like the 73 million to one , that 's not what it meant .
and there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that .
and he wrote to the academicians in Paris , trying to explain his theory .
symmetry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN .
b , for example , rotates the little yellow dot to the B on the starfish . and so on .
so what if I do B , which is a sixth of a turn , followed by C , which is a third of a turn ?
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
and , like Chief Seattle said , " We did not spin the web of life .
he thinks , " What can I do to fix up this dog ?
and he had to close his eyes , it 's so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
and then , among them , you think of your friends and loved ones , the circle at the table .
a theist Christian can think that all beings , even my enemies , are God 's children .
but anyway , that 's the " lovely love . " and then finally , the fifth step is compassion , " universal compassion . "
and you then feel you must act .
I mean , for example , none of us , probably , want to go to prison , but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison . right ?
good , because before I tell you about that good news , I 'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain .
it was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election , eliciting various counter @-@ measures by Israel .
if you 're just talking about social structure , OK , clearly that 's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels .
by cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas .
and I would say the non @-@ zero @-@ sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
100 percent are using text .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy .
there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes .
and it was a simple idea . it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field .
goodbye , Martin Luther King .
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they 're seen .
in fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the U.S. and China , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
what 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry .
I 'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .
they 're discoveries of people and the way people are , and new leadership .
Benki knew this .
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages , and she had a real breakthrough .
and the young women in the village spoke up and said , " We 've changed our dream .
they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it .
we can change the way we see ourselves in the world .
but , at the time , in the 13th century , it was the gadget of the day .
and I will start the world like this .
and it 's increasingly clear that we aren 't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever .
for every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
there is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that underpins this transition approach .
it 's open source . it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
transition groups in Chile , transition groups in the U.S. , transition groups here , what they 're doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
but , how far away is it ?
Chris Anderson : Oh yeah . DP : hold that and don 't let go .
with this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
so , we 're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shouldn 't proceed in that environment .
and on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy .
if you are well @-@ versed with inches , nine inches , centimeters , 16 [ centimeters ] .
below the surface there is hard saline water .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it become like this .
Anjali 's father , a drunkard , sold his child for pornography .
yes , there were eight men who defiled me , raped me , but that didn 't go into my consciousness .
so here we have Penn and Teller , same upside @-@ down .
okay , let 's go back to the slides .
he says , " We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan . "
but he says , " We want a nuclear @-@ free world . "
( laughter ) ... " who said , reach out and touch ... "
so you can imagine my surprise when one day the dean of engineering came and said to me , " Kamau , the students who spend most of the time in the Fab Lab are failing their exams . "
and some of these places are really quite famous .
so we 're really proud to be able to say that we have an original equipment manufacturer in Nairobi that 's provided what 's effectively an industrial robot to supply parts for General Motors .
that 's just because , in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery , it 's created to look at American lives .
he subsequently got married again at 102 , so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him .
it was all part of Clare Boothe Luce 's look .
Hello , everyone . because this is my first time at TED , I 've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit .
its videos are intended to show a kinder , gentler face of Islam , for young people to deal with life 's challenges .
" the 99 . " the characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah : justice , wisdom , mercy , among others .
and I was one of those people .
in fact , I read it in the newspaper .
at the same time , while I was interviewing the Red Brigades , I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
they were constantly short of cash .
then comes the late 1970s , early ' 80s , and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism .
now , I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime , terror , and illegal economy , before 9 @-@ 11 .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
they use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response .
and that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non @-@ aggressively .
and the cost of iteration is so cheap , you might as well .
keep that in mind .
it 's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia , including the Maldives .
what 's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here .
the sun is overhead there . summer rains in southern Africa .
it 's now back there . they come out , it 's time to come back .
he was flying off the coast of Goa , 21 years ago , 1988 . October , 1988 .
but metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words .
when life brought about a series of death and near @-@ death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India , similar to 911 in USA .
we have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
seven nations are involved in building this .
we have to get to this .
and on the other side there was a rising sun .
and when we drop the ballast overboard we climb .
( laughter ) And then he asked me -- and this is something I will never forget in my life -- he just asked me , " You 're the good pilot up there .
we are burning , as you heard , so much energy , not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life CANNOT last for long .
that 's when you throw out all the ballast , all the certainties , in order to adapt to the new situation .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
but much more , to get advices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air , of course it 's possible in the ground .
so , here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy .
so , to avoid that -- I have to avoid it somehow -- is I use dead people .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
and they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do .
and that diet is known as the Hara , Hatchi , Bu diet .
( laughter ) So , we turned to the data again .
and predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here .
she rides her bicycle .
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
what 's the point of all this ?
this was actually just taken last year .
whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .
they want to get back to slower rhythms .
right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism , and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan .
girl : are you ready ? audience : yes !
it was incredible .
Google MapMaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
( laughter ) Yes . I 'm sure ! just change it !
( laughter ) Yeah , I 'm at the Depressio , and I want to get over to Amazonis so I plug it into the Mars map , and click the button and there 's my directions .
we 've got to change this stuff up fast .
October 9th , in France , Jean @-@ Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe .
MD affects his muscle strength , his pulmonary system , distorts his body and makes everyday life more challenging than most .
ten billion video views on Snapchat , per day .
so , first of all , what are we looking for ? bright Green city .
here , for example , is Vancouver , which if you haven 't been there , you ought to go for a visit . it 's a fabulous city .
they 're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars , which is a pretty great thing .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we 're actually using .
so we have a model in potential , an emerging model that we 're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in , and turn them into Bright Green cities .
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
while I 'm talking I 'd like you to also be thinking about : how many places have you lived ?
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
but none of that 's in my medical record .
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . right ?
so with that , I 'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
so I can go back to my story .
and those can be environmental bonds .
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .
now , in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was female genitally mutilated .
we will not cut you .
I am connected to everything and everyone . I was born like that .
as a researcher , every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting .
adherence rates . how many people are taking their insulin every day ?
and you take those data , and we find the patients like him , and we bring their data together . and we bring their histories into it .
it evokes the giddy disorientation that you feel in an unfamiliar place .
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
SS : so Kanzi is very interested in fire .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
how do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with ?
if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease , we can take it enormously the other direction , and obviously , that 's where we need to go , going forward .
so , the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease .
and I think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have strived to understand cancer .
we have designed , and we have worked on the modeling -- and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team -- the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system .
you know , I 've been using it for two and a half months .
the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun .
you think of yourself as the servant .
she has six years to live .
Stacy does her best , but she 's third @-@ generation as well ; she was never taught to cook at home or at school .
he has to bury the people , OK ?
the big brands , you know , the food brands , need to put food education at the heart of their businesses .
now , this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you 're using .
the main problem we have here -- it 's kind of like with AIDS : you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
we have vast budget deficits .
we have only , in government and in politics , started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution .
we 're being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book .
so , it 's not just about the words .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes .
the teachers didn 't know a switch had been made .
the case went on for two years ; I think he 's still appealing the case .
I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing .
this is the hardest hurdle .
the problem is , we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values .
( applause ) So , what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .
people have a hard time figuring that out .
he studied Alzheimer 's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia .
and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain .
and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars .
let 's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance .
they can do graphic design , all kinds of stuff with computers , photography , industrial design .
I CANNOT emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : thank you so much for that .
the thing is , autism comes in different degrees .
you know , the slaughter plants I worked with in the ' 80s ; they were absolutely awful .
how many cattle are MOOing their heads off ?
( laughter ) I had to have long conversations with my wife .
so , it 's an important demonstration of the power of motion .
I met Belinda when she was 16 .
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride , and touch children and be honest .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they 're really quite distinct .
and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn 't respond .
princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers .
England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , " The world must play 20 overs cricket . "
it was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
and look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
( applause ) Now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , " Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? "
I 'm going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
so with that , I thank you .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I didn 't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
so , with " Terminator 2 , " which was my next film , we took that much farther .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , " This is going to be a whole new world , " this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn 't give me .
after the success of " Titanic , " I said , " OK , I 'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I 'm going to go be a full @-@ time explorer for a while . "
they don 't survive on sunlight @-@ based system the way we do .
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? "
I also talked about community @-@ generated data -- in fact I edited some .
and so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
well , at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars , that 's 8.3 hours per day . the average wage in the U.S.
and again , here are some of the lessons .
so you could feel good about selling it .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear @-@ cut forests .
it 's hard to overstate the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they 've collapsed .
not very sustainable .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
he said he didn 't know . he would ask around .
let 's call him Don too .
( laughter ) I fell out of love with this fish .
I actually am .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
what 's the feed conversion ratio ? "
well , he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild .
they 're feasting . "
how are you going to feed the world ?
instead , let 's look to the ecological model .
OK , this is Mount Everest .
camp Two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what 's called the Western cwm .
and , after actually two months of preparation , we built our camps all the way up the mountain .
and this is at Camp Four .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
wow , what a great day that will be once we 're allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
this supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System , of course .
except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in GenBank , Moore 's Law is right here : it 's the blue line .
Oh , yeah , and it takes about 5.6 million Indians .
and I said , " I think she 's dancing . "
so I rethought the whole thing , and then we all came to a consensus .
and here was the introduction of this great British icon called " Elizabeth . "
you remember how India was . there was no pollution .
find that which is not .
of course , all the British press got really upset .
I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film .
are you with child ?
but you get up at 4 a.m.
there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
very , very interesting planet .
water is the key ingredient in the evolution , the origin of life on a planet .
a lot of heating , frictional heating . it 's going 18 thousand miles an hour .
there 's no need to play the market .
it 's about helping people to build lives of dignity , stability , economic autonomy , citizenship .
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped .
which really bothers me .
and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .
not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
no , and I call it the " compassion conundrum . "
it 's all politics .
from the point of view of a public health nerd , junkies are doing dumb things .
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
and then the surgeon pointed out , with a lot of anger , he said , " Why is it ? at the end of the Civil War , they were shooting each other with muskets . if somebody lost an arm , we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it .
so with this , now the top body is lighted up ; it 's walking in our lab .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
but images don 't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
and after the first week , they ignored us .
and I always wondered what happened under that web .
but we 're just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid @-@ ocean ridge , which I think is even more extraordinary .
I think Margaret Mead said it best .
and I bring this up because it 's important to locate this practice in history .
after his lecture , a student got up and said to him , " Give us a poem . "
that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world .
and the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence .
well , that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois , asked about this bioluminescent clam .
so , for example , this fish has a built @-@ in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate .
this is a viperfish , and it 's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name .
and this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it .
so , I 've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .
and I had my window into the deep sea .
and she didn 't answer the damn question !
if they call back any of my friends , they 're not going to ... Well , you see the story .
very simply won .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and if they lose their booklets , their records can still be pulled by searching with their names .
so dealing with a lack of water is quite ingrained in my soul .
taking me to lesson three : look below the surface .
( gasps ) All right .
maybe you 're tired .
she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed .
that had an impact , too .
SB : yeah , and I think we are crowding , and there is losses going on .
and then George Church says , " That 's all right .
these people face grave threats to their safety , their livelihoods , their dignity .
it 's issued by the state government , and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions .
we then try and find out every little thing we can about that record -- the artist , the label and supervital information like " Who 's that playing trumpet on track three ? "
embrace curators ; we are alternative voices to the mainstream music channels , digital or otherwise .
go beyond the algorithm .
your job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects as you can think of .
now , one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it 's going to do , in general .
I mean , with the health system , you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side , but in terms of the system itself ?
I 'll give you three examples .
the technology is there , the infrastructure is there , and yet it doesn 't happen .
in fact , that is the leading cause of under @-@ five mortality .
" not so fast , " say other people .
we made it easy -- I 'll tell you how in a moment .
this is where gut decisions come from .
these people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me , helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other .
we 're undoing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future .
and it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
so , obviously , you CANNOT have two principles of justice , one for yourself and one for others .
so , fairness to one and to the other is not divisible .
an anonymous , faceless , nameless person gets in contact with the network , and then gets an identity .
any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment , only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something .
( applause ) Look at what Rojadeen has done .
and then the next line over says if your friend 's friend 's friend , someone you probably don 't even know , is obese , your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher .
now , what is the point of this ?
there 's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find hemozoin .
and you 're not reading that in the Post .
they 've just been sold a bag of goods .
( laughter ) I 'm the pro @-@ logic guy .
so long as you 're an adult , just think .
if Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
the corals are doing better here . lots of small fish .
this is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
none of it 's a distractor , so we lose that .
we need more patient problem solvers . thank you . ( applause )
it is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ...
because she knows that I adopted her and that I can 't have kids .
KS : that was spectacular .
moderator : you played all of that by yourself .
I am a former cared @-@ for patient myself .
we see beautiful beaches , cute animals , beautiful nature , cultural rites and stuff .
but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we 're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool .
there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
one is fast food , where everything is standardized .
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada .
here 's what he had to say .
in other countries there is protection for our artful designs . "
very low novelty standard , anybody can register anything .
there 's a bunch of other industries that don 't have copyright protection , including the food industry .
then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
you took a pathogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
beautiful stuff .
it 's just gorgeous .
it dances to music .
indeed , I was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president .
okay .
great , here we go .
computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space .
let 's just come down a bit and fly around .
and finally , I 'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery .
what do you think , what in your mind is the first killer app for this ?
this was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
you have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end .
they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet .
but if I ask them , is the TED website going to go down ?
and it 's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
that 's a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
that 's quite an incredible prediction .
in fact , that one is a carbon @-@ oxygen dwarf .
little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust , and they fall out of the tracks , the exact angles makes it hard to get right .
small stuff stinks , but , of course , it 's essential , right ?
and so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
and sometimes , in deep trauma and deep tragedy , there is a spark of clarity .
and essentially we have three mandates .
you only get one chance to make a first impression , and that 's true if you 're a robot as well as if you 're a person .
the thing that I learned about robots that day is that they kind of do their own thing , and they 're not totally aware of us .
he was not only supposed to be able to navigate the physical world , but also be able to navigate my social world -- he 's in my space ; it 's a personal robot .
I want to go over the horizon and find new things , find weird stuff , like this volcanic caldera in Niger .

these are essential skills for us , our families , our communities .
it costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid .
