overview
bounds checking is a compiler @-@ based technique that adds run @-@ time bounds information for each allocated block of memory , and checks all pointers against those at run @-@ time .
as of Android 2.3 and later , architectures which support it have non @-@ executable pages by default , including non @-@ executable stack and heap . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
for systems that lack NX hardware , the 32 @-@ bit kernels now provide an approximation of the NX CPU feature via software emulation that can help block many exploits an attacker might run from stack or heap memory .
Exec Shield allows these controls to be set for both binary executables and for libraries ; if an executable loads a library requiring a given restriction relaxed , the executable will inherit that marking and have that restriction relaxed .
on 32 @-@ bit CPUs , this becomes 1.5 GB rather than 3 GB .
Pax ignores both PT _ GNU _ stack and PT _ GNU _ HEAP . in the past , PaX had a configuration option to honor these settings but that option has been removed for security reasons , as it was deemed not useful .

an improvement on this situation was the ability to relocate executable programs when they were loaded into memory . only one copy of the program was required , but once loaded the program could not be moved .

the LTR x86 instruction stands for load task register and is used in operating systems that support multitasking .
LTR is supported only in protected mode and long mode , not in real mode or virtual 8086 mode . it must be executed when the CPL is 0 , and therefore CANNOT be used by application programs .
LTR loads the special x86 task register with a segment selector that points to a task state segment .
after executing the LTR instruction , the TSS pointed to by the argument is marked busy , but no hardware task switch occurs .

a statistic ( singular ) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . it is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
observability
more formally , statistical theory defines a statistic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . the term statistic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .

second derivative power rule
the laplacian of a function is equal to the divergence of the gradient and the trace of the Hessian matrix .
on the graph of a function , the second derivative corresponds to the curvature or concavity of the graph . the graph of a function with a positive second derivative is upwardly concave , while the graph of a function with a negative second derivative curves in the opposite way .
when using Leibniz 's notation for derivatives , the second derivative of a dependent variable y with respect to an independent variable x is written
the derivative of f is the function
it is possible to write a single limit for the second derivative :
the second derivative generalizes to higher dimensions through the notion of second partial derivatives . for a function f : R3 → R , these include the three second @-@ order partials
another common generalization of the second derivative is the laplacian . this is the differential operator ∇ 2 { \ displaystyle \ nabla ^ { 2 } } defined by

English mathematicians were encumbered by Newton 's dot notation until 1803 when Robert Woodhouse published a description of the continental notation . later the Analytical Society at Cambridge University promoted the adoption of Leibniz 's notation .
in its modern interpretation , the expression dy / dx should not be read as the division of two quantities dx and dy ( as Leibniz had envisioned it ) ; rather , the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shorthand for
