so , we have now made an amazing discovery , a post @-@ doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me , what do the cells do when you put them in ?
just add that up , all these leakages .
well , I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through , and here 's just a few reasons why .
you can hand over a phone this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch , and it was quite incredible .

we close up . we wrap ourselves up .
you 're sitting down . you 're looking at your iPhone -- or your Android , not trying to leave anyone out .
get your testosterone up . get your cortisol down .
I 've turned the computer on , and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard , and it 's put into the computer .
and the floppy disk drive person wears it . ( laughter ) She finds the first sector on the disk , and takes data off the disk and passes it off to , of course , the bus .
it 's kind of stressful typing out , so if you type on this keyboard , you can , like , balance it out .
you know , in Rhode Island , if an animal gets hit on the road , they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it .

this is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom from a data perspective , and I had to go into the system and get it out .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @-@ up calls for us ?

so what I 'm going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients .
we can turn it up or down , on or off .

it 's on . just turned it on .
so the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with Alzheimer 's disease , and the question is , are the lights out forever , or can we turn the lights back on ?
so this is what we did . we implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with Alzheimer 's disease , we turned it on , and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain .
we can turn them down if they are overactive , if they 're causing trouble , trouble that is felt throughout the brain , or we can turn them up if they are underperforming , and in so doing , we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain .
then they had to bring them in .

you can run these off -- they 're really hungry , they really like down @-@ blended weapons pits , so that 's highly enriched uranium and weapons @-@ grade plutonium that 's been down @-@ blended .
well , we 're securing them , and it would be great if we could burn them , eat them up , and this reactor loves this stuff .
and they eat them up , which means that , combined with the fact that the cladding doesn 't last very long , you can only run one of these reactors for roughly , say , 18 months without refueling it .
no refueling means you can seal them up and they 're not going to be a proliferation risk , and they 're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores .

SG : absolutely . so I got a little quick on that , but he 's going to slow me down .
we 've got ourselves in a world that 's massively complex , and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it .

I 'm going to keep using these online dating sites , but I 'm going to treat them as databases , and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up , I think I 'm going to try reverse @-@ engineering this entire system .
so knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people , I decided instead to ask my own questions .
