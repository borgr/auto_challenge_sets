( la@@ ughter ) I know it sounds like a little thing to you , but -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I looked in the rear @@@ -@@ @ view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me .
( la@@ ughter ) She took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much , I had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
and I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in N@@ ash@@ ville .
I fell asleep on the plane until , during the middle of the night , we landed on the Az@@ ores Islands for refu@@ eling .
and I thought to myself , in the middle of the night , in the middle of the Atlantic , what in the world could be wrong in Washington ?
( la@@ ughter ) I was going to talk about information ecology .
I update the slide show every time I give it .

consider sending somebody to N@@ ash@@ ville .
once it 's a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided .
the market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this .
let 's re @@@ -@@ @ brand global warming , as many of you have suggested .
now wait a minute , you may say , how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first ?
they say , " If we could record the activity of our ne@@ ur@@ ons , we would understand the brain . "
but think for a moment what that means .
your bra@@ ins are about 100 million times more complicated .
somewhere , in a pattern like this , is you , your perceptions , your emotions , your memories , your plans for the future .
we thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Cri@@ tic , we should be able , arti@@ ficially , to na@@ g the Ac@@ tor into changing its policy .
in the experiments I told you about , we have lifted the identity of the Cri@@ tic , but we still have no idea how the Cri@@ tic does its job .
so for us , this was a graphic public campaign called Connec@@ t B@@ erti@@ e .
so these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say , " I built that , and I 'm proud of it . "
and let 's face it , designers , we need to re@@ inv@@ ent ourselves .
the news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be .
so what then distinguishes the Israeli / Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland , or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia ?
the problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations , and we can 't have that .
1874 : General George Cu@@ ster announced the discovery of gold in Lak@@ ota territory , specifically the Black Hills .
this is the legacy of Man@@ if@@ est D@@ estin@@ y .
and right now , that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us , that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption .
and that was a stroke of absolute gen@@ ius , because what they did was they harn@@ essed the power of the contract , private power , to deliver public goods .
those factories will probably never see an inspector .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the inter@@ connections of habitat patches for endangered species in Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite National Park .
this is a diagram of the U.S. counter@@ insurgency strategy in Afghanistan .
the circled node is the one we 're trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
when you see a diagram like this , I don 't want you to be afraid .
we 've got a real problem with math education right now .
and in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
that 's an amazing amount of human endeav@@ or .
what does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth ?
the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection , and it operates very differently .
no , I don 't think it is .
every small obstacle , every slight up@@ hill , would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up .
we 're going down@@ hill in some roc@@ ky terrain , and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these cre@@ v@@ asses here .
it all of a sudden da@@ wned on me , in this project , that the purpose of these ri@@ des should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only : love .
and he goes on saying , and everyone looks at him like a hero , probably for the first time in his life .
and only now , " he says , " I 'm beginning to understand where I am , and I actually like it . "
now I remember , when he said it , I felt go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps on my body , because he said it overlooking the Mo@@ ab Mountains here in the background .
anyway , so you 're in for a treat , because he 's fantastic , and his name 's Mark .
and I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities .
it has an intact Hindu culture .
I know it do@@ es@@ n 't look like a school , but it is something we decided to do , and it is extremely , extremely green .
they 're beautiful . they 're b@@ ambo@@ o .
so we basically turned the box into a bubble .
and you know what these are .
there 's nowhere to fl@@ ush .
and they work . people use them . people are ok@@ ay .
I said , " Welcome to Green School . "
it 's becoming a community .
this is the school bu@@ ff@@ alo .
green School is a place of pione@@ ers , local and global .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
it grows as high as a co@@ con@@ ut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this .
we had them engineered by the engineers .
and Bal@@ in@@ ese car@@ pen@@ ters like this measured them with their b@@ ambo@@ o rulers , selected the b@@ ambo@@ o and built the buildings using age @@@ -@@ @ old techniques , mostly by hand .
it may not be the biggest b@@ ambo@@ o building in the world , but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful .
green School is a model we built for the world .
it is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so w@@ ond@@ rous and strange that our fo@@ ref@@ a@@ thers would have considered them mon@@ strous indeed .
the " high seas " is a legal term , but in fact , it covers 50 percent of the planet .
so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the dar@@ ker blue .
in 2009 , when the U.@@ N. reviewed progress , they discovered that almost 100 million square @@@ -@@ @ kilometers of seabed had been protected .
so stay tun@@ ed for further information .
now , I 'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shou@@ ld@@ n 't support , but I am going to tell you that , if it matters to you , your legislators need to know that .
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half @@@ -@@ @ circle of explosion .
but there 's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it .
but there 's also the fear of losing loved ones , and I think that 's even worse .
it 's too painful . you don 't want to think about it .
we have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics , tactics , weapons , dollars and casualties .
eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children . Oh .
or , as we speak now , hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mu@@ til@@ ated .
how interesting .
these just become numbers that we refer to .
it is a chess game .
and in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace , we must understand war and peace from both sides .
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don 't start investing in women and girls .
she was sending them to school . have a new home .
ideas , language , even the phrase ' each other ' no longer makes any sense . "
but let 's sort of start at the beginning .
so , we have companies and non @@@ -@@ @ profits and ch@@ arities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort .
if you try that , I think you 'll agree , and hopefully you can do it more often .
you can put these things away , and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule , at your own time , when you 're available , when you 're ready to go again .
just don 't have it .
certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill -- even the lock@@ set is probably worth 200 dollars .
I got that stair@@ case for 20 dollars , including delivery to my lot .
and they gave me the fence , but they did@@ n 't give me the sha@@ per , so we made a dead@@ bol@@ t out of it .
( la@@ ughter ) And sure enough , we 've had no problems with bull ele@@ ph@@ ants .
( la@@ ughter ) Then , this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle @@@ -@@ @ class front door in America .
we 're getting tired of it . it 's kind of clic@@ h@@ Ã©@@ d now .
human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the ap@@ percep@@ tive mass .
but you 've never seen this one before .
we 'll go , " O@@ oh , that 's nice . "
if I have 100 of these , 100 of those , it makes no difference what these and those are .
A@@ pol@@ l@@ onian mind@@ set creates mountains of waste .
" o@@ ops . scratch . dump@@ ster . "
by the middle of the 19th century , it 's in full flower .
I feel that expectation , and so I accommodate it , and I 'm living my life according to what you expect me to do .
you see this in junior high a lot .
I want you to know that there are farmers ' markets in every community pop@@ ping up .
they start off like 17 cam@@ els , no way to resolve it .
and yet , like many family re@@ unions , it 's not all peace and light .
no , it 's because of the story , because we feel personally involved in that story .
and his basic value was respect , was kindness toward str@@ angers .
he said , " It was like a light that went on in our lives -- it brought us hope . "
because as people walk , they spend money .
that 's a third @@@ -@@ @ side act .
capitalism , fundamentally , is a series of market@@ places .
that means that in terms of biomass , insects are more abundant than we are , and we 're not on a planet of men , but we 're on a planet of insects .
that 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we 're eating , like a cow or a pig or a sheep .
now you may say , " Ok@@ ay , so we 're eating 500 grams just by accident . "
one gram of gold is 30 euros .
the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing expon@@ entially .
on the right @@@ -@@ @ hand side you see a gra@@ s@@ shop@@ per .
a Dutch chocolate maker .
and I 'm going to show to Brun@@ o some first tries , and he can have the first b@@ ite .
they 're extremely sensitive to smell .
well don 't talk rat , but we have a cl@@ ick@@ er , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
a cl@@ ick@@ er , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behavi@@ ors .
and by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second @@@ -@@ @ line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
thank you very much .
it 's the notion that all people in a society deserve fair and equitable rights , opportunities and access to resources .
it can look like this ...
and when our kids threatened to walk out , a lot of the adults in our community were really conflic@@ ted , too .
if you 're seeing it as a cu@@ be floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there 's another way of seeing it .
when you see the cu@@ be one way , behind the screen , those boundaries go away .
so now we 're going to be subjects in the experiment .
J@@ ef@@ f H@@ aw@@ kins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuro@@ science .
we put them in bottles , refriger@@ ate them , and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again .
it serves 220 people a day .
but this story 's not about eliminating it , it 's about minimizing it .
a couple of wor@@ mer@@ ies in there too .
this restaurant looks a little bit like Ac@@ or@@ n House -- same chairs , same tables .
the air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air @@@ -@@ @ conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there .
ac@@ or@@ n House is the element of wood ; Water@@ house is the element of water ; and I 'm thinking , well , I 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine ac@@ up@@ un@@ c@@ ture specialities .
five weeks old , it 's my baby , and it 's hur@@ ting real bad .
so basically , the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway .
and I hope you all take part .
it 's too much to put this poor woman through , she 's been through so much already . "
first time , nobody answered .
maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious .
maybe something 's happening here .
so it 's been wonderful , and the great thing about it is that it has worked in changing how we 're able to get bra@@ ins .
those older people were not going to be able to make the crossing with them .
and got the chance to record this music , this new music that they were creating , and to spread it throughout the world .
and I think what Her@@ bie said : please listen , listen .
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced , and then , based on the musical ability , then that person could either enter or not .
so there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
so we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
but thank you very much for having me !
but in the last couple of years we 've become in@@ famous for a couple of things .
then there was the volcan@@ o that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends , including President Obama .
so what do you get ? you get better decision @@@ -@@ @ making , and you get less her@@ d behavior , and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results .
will government change ?
there was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tam@@ mi@@ e -- and I , we just got real busy and whi@@ p , ba@@ m , boom : K@@ end@@ all and J@@ ay .
he was a troubled k@@ id .
he was having sex .
John@@ ny call , you go .
two things : one , I never had sex .
she 's 16 years old .
this fear , getting outside the man box , totally envelop@@ ed me .
see collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men .
we as men , good men , the large majority of men , we operate on the foundation of this whole collective soci@@ alization .
so we 're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
now I 'm going to give you a story .
so this is the foundation time which I got .
I don 't know if he really meant [ that ] , but it happened .
how do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
this was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket .
I had other options , but I did@@ n 't choose them .
this was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals .
obviously , it was .
and then how did I deal with them ?
and I said , " Do you pray ? " when I looked at the group , I said , " Do you pray ? "
and they did@@ n 't say anything .
friends , this has never happened , where everybody in the prison studies .
it was one of the finest , largest volunteerism in any prison in the world .
we converted this into an ash@@ ram -- from a prison to an ash@@ ram through education .
it was the beginning of a change .
secondly , this concept .
this was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners .
this was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor .
you want to know more about this , go and see this film , " Do@@ ing Time , Do@@ ing V@@ ip@@ ass@@ ana . "
and write to me on Kir@@ an@@ Be@@ di@@ .com , and I 'll respond to you .
this worked .
this is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison .
and you see , everybody 's busy . there was no time to waste .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
and they 're starting to dominate lots of professions -- doctors , lawyers , bankers , accountants .
and in places where you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't think , such as South Korea , India and China , the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little , and families are no longer strongly pref@@ erring first @@@ -@@ @ born sons .
but if we do take account of it , then I think it will go much more smoothly .
I was reading head@@ lines about the recession just like anyone else , and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women .
and those are all things that women do very well .
to see what 's going to happen , you can 't just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce .
they learn much faster .
and this was very dis@@ hear@@ tening for them .
" who 's the dam@@ n man ?
she 's the man now . "
and the other reason it 's kind of urgent is because it 's not just happening in the U.S.
it 's definitely terri@@ fying to stand at the foot of a high bridge , but it 's also pretty ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating , because it 's beautiful up there , and you 're looking out on a beautiful view .
I have been teaching for a long time , and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students .
they produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates .
but I knew that the kids would show up , and I believed it , and I told them every week what I expected out of them .
it meant something to them .
and one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rus@@ es@@ ab@@ ag@@ ina , which is the gent@@ l@@ eman that the movie " Hotel Rwanda " is based after .
we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
so what do you do when the information is all around you ?
in Philadelphia we have a one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information .
to ask them to always have the right answer do@@ es@@ n 't allow them to learn .
and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not dis@@ appoint .
mark Gran@@ ove@@ tter , the soci@@ ologist , had a famous paper " The Streng@@ th of We@@ ak T@@ ies , " and what he did in this paper is he asked people how they got their jobs .
so if you think about what the problem is with your strong ties , think about your significant other , for example .
and you 're creating that random@@ ness , that luck that is going to cause you to widen your travels , through your social universe .
but in fact , there 's more to it than that .
it seems to us that when people start dis@@ sem@@ bling , people start lying about things , that 's when it gets really interesting .
I remember vi@@ vid@@ ly , sitting there in the hospital .
we have char@@ ted our love for our child over time .
R@@ G : and of course , we think it 's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time .
so Al@@ isa 's experience is not isolated .
I was really amaz@@ ed by all the stories that started flooding in .
so I 'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life , this ch@@ asm of happiness that we 're driving our pro@@ verb@@ ial convertible straight into .
there 's something missing from these studies .
there 's another factor in our case .
can we move that up a little bit ?
and so today , what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now .
it will become many things .
Bec@@ ka : the smile , I think .
woman 2 : um ...
P@@ J : you like the sm@@ ir@@ ky look better ?
P@@ J : you were pointing at one , but then I gave you the other one .
so , " Large @@@ -@@ @ scale governmental surveillance of email and internet traffic ought to be permissible as means to combat international crime and terrorism . "
some go from being uncertain to clear voting intention .
but it 's one thing to talk about the brain , and it 's another to see it .
and I shou@@ ld@@ n 't be mis@@ erable .
a single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neuro@@ transmit@@ ters like d@@ op@@ am@@ ine , ser@@ ot@@ onin and nor@@ ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine .
WS : new move -- up@@ per@@ cut , right and left .
we 're bar@@ tering , trading , sw@@ apping , sharing , but they 're being rein@@ ven@@ ted into dynamic and appealing forms .
these four drivers are f@@ using together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defined by hy@@ per @@@ -@@ @ consumption , towards the 21st century , defined by collaborative consumption .
that matches Mr. Jones , with some spare space in his back garden , with Mrs. Smith , a would @@@ -@@ @ be grow@@ er .
these three systems are coming together , allowing people to share resources without sacrif@@ icing their lifestyles , or their cher@@ ished personal freedoms .
it 's amazing that 413 l@@ bs were lost just from the extra exercise .
I don 't want the DVD ; I want the movie it carries .
and this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption .
it 's a new social currency , so to speak , that could become as powerful as our credit rating .
grand@@ mother Jack invites Far@@ ai to sit down as she opens the envelope and reads .
the word " ku@@ fun@@ gi@@ si@@ sa " opens up a flo@@ od@@ gate of tears .
it literally means " thinking too much . "
so as best as we could , over the phone with the ER doctor , we come up with an assessment .
we ensure that su@@ ic@@ idal observations are in place .
there are hundreds of them .
and in the last year alone , more than 30,000 people received treatment on the Friendship Ben@@ ch from a grand@@ mother in a community in Zimbabwe .
she did@@ n 't show up .
but this did@@ n 't happen .
the free English classes help empower people to engage with the Ugandan community , allowing them to get to know their neighbors and sell wa@@ res .
we were perhaps taking her for granted , and maybe she did@@ n 't like that that much .
B@@ J : but when this little cu@@ b saw that I had vac@@ ated my seat and clim@@ bed to the back to get some camera gear , she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .
and that 's not the only le@@ op@@ ards that were being killed through that period .
lion bones and ti@@ ger bones look exactly the same , and so in a stroke , the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the ti@@ gers .
B@@ J : so you have to know , looking into the eyes of lions and le@@ op@@ ards right now , it is all about critical awareness .
so what are our intentions , and what would our intentions be -- if we wake up in the morning , we have designs on the world -- well , what would our intention be as a species now that we 're the dominant species ?
this is what I presented to the White House .
so we 've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .
and at what point did that uniform turn from white to black ?
is there anybody here who do@@ es@@ n 't breathe ?
we see that companies acting eth@@ ically in this world are out@@ performing those that don 't .
and yet , N@@ OA@@ A has now shown us , for example -- you see that little blue thing above Hawa@@ ii ?
does it work ? do I like it ?
it means the way Olympic athletes train with each other .
so therefore , we have these two metabol@@ isms , and I worked with a German chem@@ ist , Michael Bra@@ ung@@ art , and we 've identified the two fundamental metabol@@ isms .
here 's n@@ ylon going back to ca@@ prol@@ ac@@ ta@@ m back to carpet .
Bio@@ technical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor , a cra@@ dle to cra@@ dle car -- concept car .
the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever , some of the materials go back to soil -- it 's all solar @@@ -@@ @ powered .
this is their plan .
and they brought us in and said , " What would you do ? "
we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .
the farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next .
when I was in college , my senior year , I took a course called European Intellectual History .
and she said , " I learned something today .
we know that two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of them are going to go back .
all that green stuff actually naturally absor@@ bs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recycl@@ able stuff ends up getting incin@@ erated or in land@@ fills and leaving many municipalities , diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
and where is this waste handled ? usually in poor communities .
and I think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and we love this , because I love construction now , because we 're watching these things actually happen .
so I think what I 'll do is just call you a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er . "
and I was like , " Why not ' magic pix@@ ie ' ? "
so where I started was with connection .
the things I can tell you about it : it 's universal ; we all have it .
at one point , people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years .
I kind of understood , this is what shame is , this is how it works .
the other thing that they had in common was this : they fully embraced vulnerability .
I could not believe I had pledged alleg@@ iance to research , where our job -- you know , the definition of research is to control and predict , to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict .
( la@@ ughter ) A spiritual awak@@ ening sounds better than breakdown , but I assure you , it was a breakdown .
and I think I have a problem , and I need some help . "
( la@@ ughter ) And it did , and it did@@ n 't .
vulnerability pushed , I pushed back .
and I know that 's knowing la@@ ughter .
you CA@@ N@@ NOT selec@@ tively num@@ b .
there 's no conversation .
and in interactions with people , almost all the time , it is this kind of flexibility that is required .
and the family was united .
for Ms. De@@ we@@ y , this is@@ n 't why she became a teacher .
so there are teachers who have these scripts to follow , and they know that if they follow these scripts , the kids will learn nothing .
stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were stic@@ king to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hum@@ p .
they did@@ n 't make loans and then sell the loans .
and K@@ en and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want .
rules and incentives don 't tell you how to be a good friend , how to be a good parent , how to be a good spouse , or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher .
indeed , we argue , there is no substitute for wisdom .
in fact , they seem to be un@@ musical entirely and to miss the point of the music .
( music ) ( Music ends ) In the end , it 's not the most natural environment , but they 're able to play real music .
so what you 're seeing here -- and I 'm doing a cardinal sin in science , which is to show you preliminary data .
I don 't have any patents , and I 've never received any money from a medical imaging company , and I am not seeking your vote .
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
radi@@ ologists were outra@@ ged by the guidelines .
after the injection , the patient 's breast is placed between the detectors .
of the tum@@ ors that we found , mam@@ mo@@ graphy found only 25 percent of those tum@@ ors .
we grew up , and we grew older .
under clear blue sk@@ ies in July in the wine region of Ontario , I got married , surrounded by 150 family and friends .
and Monday morning , I found out that he disappeared .
I mean , 50,000 blogs are started a day , and so my blog was just one of those 50,000 .
although I should say that my traffic did sky@@ rocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my d@@ ad .
over the last few years , I haven 't had that much time to really think .
if you notice , he 's actually need@@ le@@ pointing his own face .
and he 's a bad guy . he 's like a bad k@@ id in church .
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago .
announ@@ cer : what may be a little thing to some ... Bri@@ de # 3 : you are mine , little man .
now , here 's where our analogy with the Gold Rus@@ h starts to diver@@ ge , and I think rather severely .
here 's this guy : " there are many men in D@@ aw@@ son at the present time who feel ke@@ en@@ ly disappointed .
and that was , of course , the very common story .
you know , it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power .
so it was@@ n 't a big seller .
I want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
they would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's actually kind of an important point in my presentation , because they had@@ n 't invented the off switch .
we 're in 1908 .
they 're clicking on things and st@@ aring at screens . "
but when you actually visu@@ alize it , all the connections that we 're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it do@@ es@@ n 't look technological .
Thomas Th@@ wa@@ ites : as you can see , they had the Christmas decorations up .
but instead of a bel@@ lows , I had a leaf blower .
and so this is after a day and about half a night smel@@ ting this iron .
so this is attempting to make potato st@@ arch plastic .
the first is zero tolerance .
I mean , really .
" what are we going to do with these boys ? "
the answer to that question changes depending on who 's sitting around that table .
a game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school .
this is the boat we were on , by the way .
and what they 're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispers@@ ants can be highly toxic to phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
another explanation that you often hear for reck@@ lessness is hu@@ bris .
I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth , the largest ever built .
they don 't know if they 'll work , and they have no idea what kind of terri@@ fying side effects they could unle@@ ash .
most importantly , we don 't have to change our lifestyles after all .
I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to f@@ aint .
a few days after arriving , I met this wonderful , old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles .
I thought stem cells were a good option , but they had@@ n 't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet .
it was like in one verbal sw@@ o@@ op he had chann@@ eled my thoughts on life and medicine and Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us .
and really , they fundamentally told you , " Are you going to hu@@ g a tree ?

and within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago -- Copenhagen , climate change conference .
I would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non @@@ -@@ @ compliance .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .

and when I had cancer , we thought it 'd be everybody running the other way .
" but when I came to see you , " I said , " I did@@ n 't believe in myself .
I was on cru@@ t@@ ches , my wife was next to me , my girls were doing these roc@@ k@@ star poses up ahead .
you go slow , you get where you 're going , but you get there with this community you built along the way .

I don 't know if this is called a basket @@@ -@@ @ bra , but it ought to be something like that .
we have art students getting together , taking old radi@@ ator parts and doing an iron @@@ -@@ @ pour to make something new out of it .

it 's a micro @@@ -@@ @ controller .

my oldest , Br@@ yan , is 26 , and my youngest , Jul@@ ian , is 12 .
in August of 2013 , Jul@@ ian , who was eight at the time , and I were folding laundry , which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence , I should have known something strange was going to happen .
on the TV were Tra@@ y@@ von Martin 's parents , and they were c@@ rying because of the acquit@@ tal of George Zim@@ mer@@ man .
HS : as Jul@@ ian was getting it , I started to lose it .
HS : well , they better run .
HS : well , you know what , I 'm g@@ onn@@ a call police , too , like I should .
but you can 't ; you 're right , you can 't just go ch@@ asing people .
I don 't like that .
JS : um ...
you never know what some crazy people will think about you .
with racial literacy , and yes , practice , we can dec@@ ode the racial trauma from our stories , and our healing will come in the telling .
running : it 's basically just right , left , right , left , ye@@ ah ?
now , this is when something really b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re happens .
so we all know what to do in this situation , right ?

those expert trac@@ kers have to be part of the pack .

ever since I was a little girl seeing " Star Wars " for the first time , I 've been fasc@@ inated by this idea of personal robots .
three years later -- a lot of programming , working with other graduate students in the lab -- Kis@@ met was ready to start inter@@ acting with people .
we developed Leon@@ ardo in collaboration with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on Studio .
and because it 's new , Le@@ o do@@ es@@ n 't really know what to make of it .
the first was just the screen .
it turns out , when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost .
we try Skype , we try phone calls , but my boys are little -- they don 't really want to talk ; they want to play .
( la@@ ughter ) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study , they would come out to the car and say good @@@ -@@ @ b@@ ye to the robots .
and when it 's in their world , they can relate to it and play with it in a way that 's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
I think that 's very , very important .
H@@ awa Ab@@ di : many people -- 20 years for Somalia -- [ were ] fighting .

( whi@@ st@@ ling ) ( W@@ hi@@ st@@ ling ends ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .

we need those things too , but we 're also bum@@ ping up against their limits .
compassion can 't be reduced to sa@@ in@@ thood any more than it can be reduced to pity .
and those distributions grow .
but we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .
two months later , something incredible happens .
here 's what it looked like in the laboratory .
what did we do to their bra@@ ins ?
we 're the first in the world to record babies in an ME@@ G machine while they are learning .
( la@@ ughter ) Well , almost .
that day , I discovered the power of fashion , and I 've been in love with it ever since .
and so it 's the pursuit of better things , easily shared .
one of the founders went to Switzerland , saw it implemented some@@ place , said , " W@@ ow , that looks really cool .
and so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car ?
from my perspective , one of the things pop @@@ -@@ @ up stores do is create per@@ is@@ ha@@ bility and urgency .
and then I thought , well this is fun .
the women in Bosnia were being raped .
I get there , and there are six other women , out of 183 .

they 've grown used to their face ; they think they 're special .
this was something more than that . he ignored it .
they 're trying to achieve difference in their lives .
we look at O.@@ J. -- he 's a good @@@ -@@ @ looking guy .

would we be happy if our doctor 's face , our lawyer 's face , our financial adviser 's face was covered ?
so we 've talked a lot about facial appearance .
so with modern technology , we used computers to make models .
just imagine , I can make a bi@@ ologically @@@ -@@ @ degra@@ dable template .
can we distribute radio @@@ -@@ @ frequency tok@@ ens to identify people ?
so the gen@@ ome really tells you much more about pre@@ disposition .
not going to be easy . "
so if I zoom into that picture , I can just show you what it means .
two years later , when the time came for me to go to university , my father turned his eyes , his attention , to my younger brothers .
they found something called Twitter .
they were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of dec@@ eption .
if you switch off the cameras tonight , there will be a genocide .
thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
( la@@ ughter ) " That 's cool . "
I mean , these were the faces of my friends .
a year later , I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict .
" Oh , we 're actually doing an art project and we are p@@ asting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job .
and they would put a number : " please call this number if you know what 's going on in Provid@@ en@@ cia . "
women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
behind each image is a story .
the people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .

I use Man R@@ ay , Hel@@ en Lev@@ it@@ t , Gi@@ ac@@ om@@ elli , other people 's art@@ work .
art is not supposed to change the world , to change practical things , but to change perceptions .
or , " How can we help ? "
and in the Egyptian revolution , the Revolution 2.0 , everyone has contributed something , small or big . they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .
we only ranked high when it comes to poverty , corruption , lack of freedom of speech , lack of political activis@@ m .
there are lots of people who are frustrated .
Khal@@ ed Sae@@ ed was killed in June 2010 .
" what are we going to do ? " " I don 't know . "
but did the regime learn anything ? not really .
and I did not really hear anything . I did not know anything .
and that was a personal belief , regardless of what 's going on , regardless of the details .
well , this is about state budgets .
but we have a problem .
now this leaves 10 percent deficit , sort of a mind @@@ -@@ @ blowing number .
receipts go down , some spending programs go up , but most of it is not because of that .
what were those things that allowed us to hide this ?
so what do we need to do ?
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
here 's the scanner going through , scanning the wound .
once it 's scanned , it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be .
and Dr. K@@ ang 's going to walk on@@ stage right now , and we 're actually going to show you one of these kid@@ neys that we printed a little bit earlier today .
put a pair of gloves here .
so Luke , you go to your communications professors -- you 're maj@@ oring in communications -- and you ask them for permission to come to TED , which might have a little bit to do with communications , and what was their reaction ?
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy .
which brings me to my third parad@@ ox .
so she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact .
they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cous@@ in to their cous@@ in .
then you build on that in the next concept .
B@@ G : is this ready for prime time ?
and the journalist was asking him , " Why is this so important ? "
it meant something that would connect us all together .
so Facebook is@@ n 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible , algorith@@ mic editing of the Web .
Google 's doing it too .
so here 's my friend Scot@@ t 's screen shot .
that 's how different these results are becoming .
it was@@ n 't perfect , but it got us through the last century .
we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
so you 're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made .
and we see these amazing structures -- these little kno@@ ts of two colors of thread we call " social hot spots . "
the spiral thread we call a " solo hot spot . "
they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand .
but the parad@@ ox is , when a lot of these people slip into the policy @@@ -@@ @ making mode , that social awareness van@@ ishes and they start talking like accountants .
babies flo@@ p out , they 're flashing Mand@@ ar@@ in flash@@ cards at the things .
it would be a big seller .
and they 've become elegant and sl@@ ender -- they don 't really have th@@ igh@@ s ; they just have one elegant cal@@ ve on top of another .
so me talking about emo@@ tion is like G@@ and@@ hi talking about glu@@ tt@@ ony , but it is the central organizing process of the way we think .
it tells us what to im@@ print .
and the third insight is that we 're not primarily self @@@ -@@ @ contained individuals .
time magazine asked Americans , " Are you in the top one percent of ear@@ ners ? "
they cou@@ ld@@ n 't tell you how they did it , but they could feel cold , they felt a col@@ dness , and they were more often right than wrong .
he was married to a woman named Car@@ ol , and they had a wonderful relationship .
now even light will be bent by those paths .
it did@@ n 't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution .
this is Richard Kel@@ ly who was born 100 years ago , which is the reason I bring him up now , because it 's kind of an anniversary year .
she does very complex tasks , and I haven 't got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she do@@ es@@ n 't like making mistakes .
they shoot everything , every single thing that moves that 's bigger than a small rat ; they sun @@@ -@@ @ dry it or smoke it .
somebody said that yesterday .
we 're in every state now , and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York .
but I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
I know that I 'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here , which is greatly in@@ hibiting my ability to keep it cool .
( la@@ ughter ) Why was the sca@@ rec@@ row invited to TED ?
the po@@ em was very indign@@ ant , and mainly exagg@@ erated , but the only spoken @@@ -@@ @ word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indign@@ ant , so I thought that 's what was expected of me .
I love spoken word . I will keep coming back week after week . "
I use poetry to help me work through what I don 't understand , but I show up to each new po@@ em with a back@@ pack full of everywhere else that I 've been .
fourth , someone has something you thought you knew everything about , but they 're introducing a new angle of looking at it .
and most people respond really well to this exercise .
but in Hiroshima , some people were wi@@ ped clean away , leaving only a wri@@ st@@ watch or a diary page .
but in that instant , I get to share your present .
let me ! let me push the button ! "
and yet , in the world , there are so many people who still heat the water on fire , and they cook their food on fire .
there are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day .
and these ones , who have washing machines but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
this group uses three , one each .
of course , they must be more energy efficient .
she loved this .
( la@@ ughter ) But unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narr@@ atives of human evolution .
now , I 'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity 's problems -- since there 's more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the K@@ ama Su@@ tra .
it 's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
and I want you to see , this is Fu@@ ku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fellowship and wonder .
we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
this is a Be@@ ef@@ alo .
but something much , much more powerful is happening now .
some of you may have read about the FDA 's consideration right now of genetically @@@ -@@ @ engineered sal@@ mon .
it 's a Ha@@ fl@@ inger horse cl@@ oned in Italy , a real " gold ring " of cloning , because there are many horses that win important races who are gel@@ dings .
the computer learned what the mon@@ key brain did to move its arm in various ways .
this is what Frank@@ en@@ stein 's lab looks like .
her celebrated oper@@ atic roles are numerous and varied .
but sadly , today , languages are dying at an unprecedented rate .
but I do know that I 've seen a lot of changes .
and this is the plot behind Stu@@ x@@ net .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , " Well , we don 't know what the target is .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
it 's the kind of original movement for any pup@@ pet for us on@@ stage .
B@@ J : so Tom gave us a call and said , " Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre ? "
B@@ J : about 40 people .
the chore@@ ograph@@ er , To@@ by S@@ ed@@ g@@ wick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of tw@@ ig@@ s , grew up into the big horse .
you can see quite a lot of sk@@ elet@@ ons in the background there .
so here are some half @@@ -@@ @ finished horses ready to be worked in London .
B@@ J : Jo@@ ey .
each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
I had failed .
I was born in Bom@@ bay , India , and just before my first birthday , I contracted polio , which left me paraly@@ zed from the hips down .
many people who contract polio in developing countries do not have access to the same medical care , education , or opportunities like I have had in America .
in each image , I married dispar@@ ate costum@@ es from widely diverse traditions , countries and time frames .
I gam@@ ely employed the mul@@ tic@@ ol@@ ored carpet and a vibrant color , in order to ev@@ oke the spl@@ end@@ or of the mul@@ tic@@ ol@@ ored painted bun@@ ting bird .
there is wh@@ iff of the ra@@ ke about him , and that gives him an enchan@@ ting edge .
in fact , while we drove 14@@ 0,000 miles , people did@@ n 't even notice .
I wanted to be a rock star .
the cho@@ ir people in my high school were pretty ge@@ e@@ ky , and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people .
and I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself .
well a couple of years ago , a friend of mine em@@ ail@@ ed me a link , a YouTube link , and said , " You have got to see this . "
( video ) Brit@@ lin L@@ os@@ ee : hi Mr. Eric Wh@@ it@@ ac@@ re .
so I wrote on my blog , " O@@ MG O@@ MG . "
afterwards , I played a piano track under@@ ne@@ ath so that the sing@@ ers would have something to listen to .
( singing ) This is Jam@@ al Wal@@ ker from D@@ all@@ as , Texas .
and a number of s@@ op@@ ran@@ os uploaded their parts .
here 's our winner of the s@@ op@@ ran@@ o solo .
I said , " Than@@ k you , Scot@@ t . I 'm so glad that you found me . "
thank you so much .
( video ) S@@ op@@ ran@@ o : â« Upon my pil@@ low â« â« Safe in bed â« E@@ W : that 's Georgi@@ e from England . she 's only nine .

" it hurt so much , and I shed some tears , but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words .
what I 'd like to close with then today is the first look at " Sle@@ ep " by Virtual Cho@@ ir 2.0 .
this will be a premiere today .
right , the current wants to run through the play @@@ -@@ @ d@@ ough , not through that LED .
I can start plug@@ ging in lots of lights .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early .
you did@@ n 't really want to jump , but you want out .
you do that because , 27 years before , an air@@ borne ser@@ ge@@ ant had taught me to do that .
I have no idea whether it makes any difference , but he seemed to make sense , and I was@@ n 't going to test the hypothesis that he 'd be wrong .
so then you look around , you 're under a can@@ op@@ y and you say , " This is good . "
and that 's not going to hurt .
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership : Robert E. Lee , John Bu@@ ford at Ge@@ tt@@ y@@ sburg .
and I 'm not sure that was real interaction .
and I saw my battalion commander , because I had let him down .
and that 's a new kind of leadership for me .
we talked about the operation , and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that .
I asked , " Where were you on 9 / 11 ? "
you don 't reset , or re@@ charge your battery every time .
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
I know there are other comp@@ assi@@ onate companies in the world , but Google is the place I 'm familiar with because I 've been there for 10 years , so I 'll use Google as the case study .
they just go ahead and start a fun@@ dra@@ iser .
so what are they ?
there are three components of compassion .
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?
in our experience , there are three ingredients .
so using the super@@ charged attention from step one , we create a high @@@ -@@ @ resolution perception into the cognitive and emo@@ tive processes .
I want you to be happy . "
so the movie will be called " The Great@@ est Mo@@ vie E@@ ver S@@ old . "
this would have been fine .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's very risky .
there 's your story , there 's my story and there 's the real story . "
so how specifically will we see Ban in the film ?
whether it 's a " Flor@@ al Fu@@ sion " or a " Paradise Win@@ ds , " they 'll have their chance .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we 're very much a challeng@@ er brand .
MS : that is a fantastic question .
these devices are@@ n 't accessible to people . "
so they go around and do art installations like this .
this is called the E@@ ye@@ Writ@@ er , and you can see the description .
and now we 've created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
and I went on a run that I know so well .
this is me , all of me .
losing of labels , because we are not j@@ am j@@ ars .
and yet , look around us .
and in a chem@@ ically more complex universe , it 's possible to make more things .
and that is how our solar system was formed , four and a half billion years ago .
in the center of a star , there 's so much energy that any at@@ oms that combine will just get bu@@ sted apart again .
you don 't stabilize the individual ; you stabilize the template , the thing that carries information , and you allow the template to copy itself .
it 's what makes us different .
as long as the city 's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people are@@ n 't going to be engaged .
but that 's not ap@@ a@@ thy ; that 's intentional exclusion .
public space .
( appl@@ ause ) The manner in which we mist@@ reat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change , because we 've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression .
why do some large @@@ -@@ @ scale crises j@@ ol@@ t us awa@@ ke and inspire us to change and evolve while others might j@@ ol@@ t us a bit , but then it 's back to sleep ?
and within each compartment , there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs , each competing with one another for credit , name recognition and of course , resources .
but first we need to picture the world that we 're fighting for .
the slaughter of millions in the tren@@ ches and in the death camps have caused people to ask , " Where is God in all this ?
is God a cold , un@@ feeling spect@@ ator ?
the loving soul of the universe .
is God just another name for the universe , with no independent existence at all ?
and how would we live such a faith ? how would I live such a faith ?
these are real !
it was very James B@@ ond .

Cha@@ z E@@ bert : it was Cha@@ z who stood by my side through three attempts to re@@ construct my ja@@ w and restore my ability to speak .
it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on " Cas@@ abl@@ anca " and " Citiz@@ en K@@ ane . "
I plan to use it on television , radio and the Internet .
the point is Pla@@ to was only 50 years ago , an instant in time .
there are people who don 't want to make eye contact .
if I were in this condition at any point before a few cos@@ m@@ ological in@@ stants ago , I would be as isolated as a her@@ mit .
I 've pressed 5,000 bric@@ ks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days .
so how do we do this ?
we actually had a guy from the BBC 's " Fro@@ zen Planet " on one of these flights .
but the moral controversy surrounding embry@@ onic stem cells -- the fact that these cells are derived from five @@@ -@@ @ day old human embry@@ os -- has encouraged research into other types of stem cells .
and adult stem cells are found in you and me -- in our blood , in our bone mar@@ row , in our fat , our skin and other organs .
and they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
sometimes you even watch satellite , CN@@ N , from the United States .
you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking .
it 's your land ; it 's your resource .
they all have bl@@ ond hair , blue eyes . they 're happy .
and they have big cities , and the cities are all dependent on oil .

the human species , in general , is fal@@ li@@ ble -- ok@@ ay fine .

think back for a moment to elementary school .
well the wrong side of her body is in band@@ ages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
it 's that you can see the world as it is@@ n 't .
and ye@@ ah , it is also why we get things wrong .
he proposed the film to me , and I said , " Y@@ ea@@ h , maybe it 'll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . "
you know the one .
( la@@ ughter ) You know that teacher ?
I did@@ n 't use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my reper@@ toire .
that 's my brother Mal@@ col@@ m there on the right .
now you may be won@@ dering what all this complexity looks like .
and I think it 's sort of we@@ ir@@ d to be living what Sun T@@ z@@ u said .
but I don 't try to deny them that reality of being human .
I had bought a copy of this book , " The Universe and Dr. E@@ in@@ stein " -- a used paper@@ back from a second@@ hand book@@ store in Seattle .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we 're all made of -- and that 's four percent of the universe .
an extraordinary set of teles@@ cop@@ es .
it 's not a thing I often do , so listen carefully .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) But that 's putting it too negatively .
this is one nation under God . "
so , my friend is strictly ag@@ nos@@ tic about the tooth fairy , but it is@@ n 't very likely , is it ?
now , this is an elite audience , and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious .
( la@@ ughter ) He turns off the engines .
and then he says three words .
it feels great .
what would you get done that you 're waiting to get done because you think you 'll be here forever ?
thank you .
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
quite a few more .
how about fitness ?
Ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
in the interval , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
and one night , there 's a kno@@ ck at his hotel room door .
I want to achieve it through not dying . "
who do@@ es@@ n 't want healthier children ?
and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it .
we respond to stories more than data .
and there are two ways to do this .
I have feeling and reality .
where do we get these models ? we get them from others .
I visit her in the hospital .
so in this case , for instance , novel@@ ty could be climbing Mach@@ u Pic@@ ch@@ u for the first time , as I did in 2016 .
I mean , think about the never @@@ -@@ @ ending fight of viruses and bacteria with our immune system .
so think about an alien invasion , now , here , in Milan , or me -- I stopped thinking for 15 minutes .
and somehow , we predict that the rate of innovation should decrease steadily over time .
so you listen to " Su@@ z@@ anne " by Leon@@ ard Co@@ hen , and this experience triggers your passion for Co@@ hen so that you start fran@@ tically listening to his whole production .
and the aim of all this is to raise a generation of people able to come up with new ideas to face the challenges in front of us .
is this something that other people can do ?
the National Movement of India was testimony to that .
it 's like its own little coupling .
why use tri@@ angles ?
( appl@@ ause ) If you , as a matter of fact , put four mar@@ bles inside , you simulate the molecular structure of methane , CH4 .
I see hope . I see happiness in their faces .
now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around .
and now , if you have this pump , it 's like a great , great s@@ prin@@ k@@ ler .
and you put a little fan here .
there 's a hole here , and I shut this .
teachers who have been teaching science for don@@ key years , they just m@@ uck up the definition and they sp@@ it it out .
you can see a g@@ le@@ am in their eye .
over 100,000 children learn science this way .
and we 're just trying to see possibilities .
this is a little straw , and what you do is you just ni@@ p two corners here , and this becomes like a baby cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile 's mouth .
I 'm going to keep this outside , to blow out . I 'm going to suc@@ k in air .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Transl@@ ator ) A@@ W : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other .
my son Paul , he 's 19 years old , he 's driving me home from work one day , and he says , " Ma , did you know that the murder rate in Balti@@ more is higher than it 's ever been ? "
and they kept their word .
and I 'll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
and one of the ideas that was developed at MI@@ T in a workshop was , imagine this pipe , and you 've got valves , sol@@ en@@ oid valves , t@@ aps , opening and closing .
if those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
he liked it very much .
the whole building is made of water .
and if there 's a bit of wind , if you want to minimize spl@@ ashing , you can actually lower the roof .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
and this is what led us to think about the following project I 'll show you now .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pixels .
so as a fashion designer , I 've always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
but then I met a bi@@ ologist , and now I think of materials like this -- green tea , sugar , a few micro@@ bes and a little time .
again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
and in fact , cotton would take up to 18 di@@ ps in indi@@ go to achieve a color this dark .
what I 'm not suggesting is that micro@@ b@@ ial cell@@ ul@@ ose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
it 's not something you have to worry about -- the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suff@@ oc@@ ating us .
so Bol@@ tz@@ mann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium .
now your home@@ work assignment is to really think about this , to contem@@ plate what it means .
this is a bru@@ te fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
very , very high resolution .
has to be visible in bright daylight . will work anywhere .
now , we 've actually done some research -- Ne@@ il Ger@@ sh@@ en@@ fel@@ d and the Fa@@ b Lab@@ s went out into the market .
now , I bought this device from C@@ lif@@ ford St@@ oll for about 900 buc@@ ks .
only if we open enough loc@@ ker doors .
( la@@ ughter ) Now the good news about Architec@@ ts for Hum@@ anity is they 're really kind of the most amazing group .
and the really wonderful thing about this is , when you 're done , well -- you can eat it .
and we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ .
" free Bir@@ d . "
and then finally back into the English , which is , we 're totally f@@ uc@@ ked .
so we 're going to build this new building on sti@@ l@@ ts .
now this film is@@ n 't really hard enough , so I wanted to make it a little bit harder .
and I fear , if we do nothing for our planet , in 20 years , it 's going to look like this .
( la@@ ughter ) Mr. Vice President , I wish I knew how to quit you .
the little things in life , sometimes that we forget about , like pol@@ l@@ ination , that we take for granted .
well , their answer was , " It 's all about risk and reward . "
" well , why ? "
rarely seen by the naked eye , this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment .
here are some images from the film .
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
thank you very much . I appreciate it .
projections are that we could lose polar bears , they could become extin@@ c@@ t in the next 50 to 100 years .
there was no ice around .
we 're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic .
and when you have low productivity in this , in ice , the productivity in cop@@ epo@@ ds go down .
but they 're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe , catch a breath , because right under that ice are all the s@@ war@@ ms of co@@ d .
Le@@ op@@ ard seals , since the time of Sh@@ ack@@ let@@ on , have had a bad reputation .
so this is that story .
it do@@ es@@ n 't work that way .
you get 12 tourists packed into a Z@@ odi@@ ac , floating in these ic@@ y waters , and a le@@ op@@ ard seal comes up and bit@@ es the pon@@ to@@ on .
he said , " If you get sca@@ red , you close your eyes , ya , and she 'll go away . "
she gra@@ bs another one . she does this over and over .
( la@@ ughter ) Now I 've got four or five pen@@ gu@@ ins floating around my head , and I 'm just sitting there shooting away .
and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about , and that we 're familiar with , for the textile industry , the textile industry goes and un@@ winds the co@@ co@@ on and then we@@ a@@ ves gl@@ amor@@ ous things .
and we stored pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in at 60 degrees C , so 140 degrees F@@ ah@@ ren@@ he@@ it , for two months without loss of efficacy of the pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
how many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day ?
have you ever wondered why being around children , who smile so frequently , makes you smile very often ?
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate .
you 've got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you 've got the Mo@@ MA , the Her@@ mitage , the R@@ ij@@ ks , the Van Go@@ gh .
explore .
this is the real cool part . it 's called Collec@@ tions .
I 'm sure there are people here who could tell you about the Richard Fe@@ yn@@ man they knew , and it would probably be a different Richard Fe@@ yn@@ man .
he was a man of many , many parts .
he was full of mach@@ o , a kind of mach@@ o one @@@ -@@ @ up@@ manship .
and what did we talk about ?
the brain do@@ es@@ n 't feel pain .
for example , let 's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier , the one that 's atro@@ p@@ hi@@ ed in sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia and the one that is in@@ hibit@@ ory .
and we 'll make different cells in the brain sensitive to light .
the animal hears a tone . a flash of light occurs .
there 's no audio , but you see that the animal free@@ zes -- the tone used to mean bad news .
and the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
so it 's early days , to be up@@ front , but we 're excited about it .
I wanted to close with one story , which we think could potentially be a clinical application .
let 's zoom in on it so we can see it in more detail .
on the other hand , light can still get into the eye .
so we 're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach .
we 're also exploring new business models for this new field of neuro@@ technology .
( appl@@ ause ) Juan En@@ ri@@ qu@@ ez : so some of this stuff is a little dense .
J@@ e : well , that might change a couple things . thank you .
E@@ B : thank you .
I spent a lot of time counting be@@ ads and things like that .
this is a shop for a bag company .
this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass be@@ ads the size of a golf ball .
and openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges , but it 's quite a basic thing .
but the bridges that we saw that opened and closed -- I 'm slightly squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish -- but I once saw a photograph of a foot@@ ball@@ er who was diving for a ball .
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of in@@ efficiencies that we@@ ren 't being capitalized on .
it was voted the worst place in Britain to live .
so we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
but this phenomen@@ al project 's been happening .
and by night , artificial light in each one eman@@ ates and comes out to the outside .
and so the rest of the site was a public space .
the British government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
and there was a lot of terror .
and it 's in a piece of land that 's this site .
th : these are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure .
you can see that the arm is dis@@ colored , pur@@ pl@@ ish in color .
I don 't design detention centers , and I don 't even design cour@@ thous@@ es .
I 'm going to build the world 's first restorative justice center all by myself .
and we have plans to replicate it in Washington D.C. , De@@ tro@@ it , New York and New Orleans .
next summer , the village will launch , and it pop@@ s up every single week , expanding to more and more communities as it goes .
and I think this is actually a shri@@ mp that 's releasing its bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ es@@ cent chemicals into the water .
now , in keeping with today 's theme , I 'd like to point out -- something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage some@@ place in life can yield tremendous results some@@ place else .
that gives you an idea of the different types of moti@@ vations and dedication .
and I like that .
this is again showing all the different contributions .
that 's all I 'm getting paid for this ?
you may recognize these two guys .
so we res@@ yn@@ the@@ sized this song .
after pre@@ viewing it and confirming it 's what you submitted , you could submit it into the Mechan@@ ical Tur@@ k with no other context .
so basically motion through 3D space .
you mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video ? "
and I just worked and worked through problems , until my little we@@ e battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves .
and in a we@@ ir@@ d way , that 's what I actually like about John@@ ny Cash 's music as well .
so this is@@ n 't finished at all , but it 's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate .
and you can also see the way that it was drawn .
and you type in the address -- it actually creates a music video specifically for you , pulling in Google maps and Stree@@ t@@ view images into the experience itself .
this is a great technology .
as you can see , the virus stopped , and it stopped very , very fast .
they had come from thousands of miles away .
now we don 't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this , to eradicating diseases .
so those are the kind of stakes that we 're after .
last year , it was 1,000 .
we should abandon this idea of eradication .
U@@ mar also has polio .
we 're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child .
now remember , northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio .
here 's a great idea to spread : end polio now .
and what 's it going to be like the next couple of years ?
we spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year .
for me , this became incredibly important .
and it 's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist , even if I have to operate in the West only for now .
but apparently , that was not an issue at the time .
and we see , truly , in some Muslim communities , that tradition .
there is no punishment for apo@@ stasy .
which means that Muslims can , today , look at those things and say , " Well , the core of our religion is here to stay with us .
that trend is generally called Islamic modern@@ ism , and it was advanced by intellectuals and states@@ men , not just as an intellectual idea , though , but also as a political program .
but the fact that those dict@@ ators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islam@@ ists much more stri@@ dent .
they just should be allowed to work for that .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
so for this , we developed many different types of non @@@ -@@ @ visual user interface technology .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
he 's coming up to the grand@@ stand , fellow Feder@@ ation@@ ists .
the secret of happiness is : find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .
the idea of repl@@ icating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
I 've not time to go into more of it .
that 's all the time I have , so thank you very much for your attention .
this did@@ n 't really sit well with my in@@ tuition , and maybe it 's just because I don 't play with particles very often .
so a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
so let 's think about the at@@ oms .
what can we do with just one person 's data ?
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h , that 's a terri@@ fying result .
in other words , it 's kind of random , kind of ad hoc , how we figure out what we should do .
Ari@@ sto@@ tle said , " We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows . "
but here 's the way it works .
suppose I go up and I say , " I 'm going to take your phone . "
it 's wrong to take his phone because he 's a person and he has rights and he has dignity , and we can 't just interfere with that .
what should we be doing ? what 's the answer ?
what 's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do , whether we should use that guy 's data or not ?
not only can we think , we must .
the theme of this story is building a din@@ os@@ au@@ r , and so we come to that part of " Ju@@ ras@@ sic Park . "
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast .
I found a brilliant aer@@ on@@ autical engineer who designs sa@@ ils for America 's Cup racing yachts named Peter H@@ ep@@ pel .
historic Philadelphia City Hall : its pl@@ az@@ a , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than net@@ ting .
now I combine them with hi @@@ -@@ @ tech materials and engineering to create v@@ olu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lowing forms the scale of buildings .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can 't come in and distur@@ b all the existing apartment holders .
so in December we met in Miami , in a hotel conference room .
that 's more than 250 hundred @@@ -@@ @ thousand acres .
so if you think about this practically , here 's where we are .
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each concei@@ ving a baby , OK ?
so two couples each concei@@ ving one baby .
now I don 't want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the conception , because if you do , you 're not going to listen to me , so just imagine that for a moment .
but because this individual lacks recep@@ tors to hear that testosterone , the body do@@ es@@ n 't react to the testosterone .
you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body .
where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African run@@ ner , Ca@@ ster Se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only , really , by a few nucle@@ oti@@ des ?
one of the places we 're seeing it , for example , in our culture , in the United States today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
the F@@ ounding Fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activists , and this is why .
they were moving towards a natur@@ alistic concept .
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the Civil Rights Movement saying , " I am a man . "
Henry can marry , in every state , a woman , but Mary can only marry today in a few states , a woman .
it gets way better .
what does it have to do with the future of health ?
this is an example of this paradigm shift .
we 're moving to this integration of bi@@ ome@@ dic@@ ine , information technology , wireless and , I would say , mobile now -- this era of digital medicine .
we 're now in the era of virtual visits .
and in two years , a $ 100 gen@@ ome .
and by looking at the patterns , for example , in our blood , of 10,000 biom@@ ar@@ kers in a single test , we can look at patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage .
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized .
how about more targeted therap@@ ies for cancer ?
embry@@ onic stem cells are particularly powerful .
we have adult stem cells throughout our body ; we use those in bone mar@@ row trans@@ plantation .
still very early days , but I think , as integration of expon@@ ential technologies , this is the example .
there 's something else that is interesting .
Martin Short is one of my all @@@ -@@ @ time favorite actors .
that is the essence of seeing a person first .
what could we achieve for medical science ?
and they made it clear that we should understand that their prosperity was not our entitlement , and I think that 's good wisdom from isi@@ ri@@ ka .
and so I grew up with isi@@ ri@@ ka .
I 'm under the river with those fish .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
I 'm going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
so they 're restrictive -- don 't use your mobile phone , don 't use your laptop , don 't search the Internet , don 't be on I.@@ M.
and you know what ?
it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better .
it 's pretty bl@@ ea@@ k .
or is it cra@@ p ? is it auto@@ c@@ ratic , controlling , restrictive and un@@ tr@@ usting and un@@ fulfilling ?
just like there 's benefits for humans and animals , there 's benefits for play at work .
two , I 've tried it . I 've tried at Sci@@ ant .
I 'm going to let you make decisions . I 'm going to empower you , and I 'm going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
and we 're going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
let them be on the Internet .
let them take long lun@@ ches .
let them do it . give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . let them have fun at the workplace .
what we need is a players ' uprising .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
but the reality is far from it .
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
thank you .
you love the game .
the excitement from using multi @@@ -@@ @ tracking , the way I did in the piece you will hear next , comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers , all generated from a single source .
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my d@@ ad would bring home the latest Ford or Lin@@ col@@ n and leave it in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
and I 'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environ@@ ment@@ alists .
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives .
and to connect our country after World War II , we did@@ n 't build more two @@@ -@@ @ lane highways , we built the interstate highway system .
we need our best and our brigh@@ test to start enter@@ taining this issue .
I 'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cu@@ be roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer , to my mind , than work .
or look at the foreign word and the sounds : can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it 's pointing you towards ?
the sket@@ ches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
four is blue .
and here is one of my paintings .
and this effect is very pleasant on the mind , and it helps the sentence to feel right .
64 becomes 6,@@ 400 .
four across , four up and down -- it 's 16 .
in my theory , language evol@@ ves in such a way that sounds match , correspond with , the subjective , with the personal , intuitive experience of the listen@@ er .
so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
you know , what I do is write for children , and I 'm probably America 's most widely read children 's author , in fact .
she did it in secret .
and there 's a book -- John Gar@@ t@@ ner .
some of them committed suicide .
Sergey Br@@ in : I want to discuss a question I know that 's been pressing on many of your minds .
audience : it 's people logging on to Google around the world .
and every one of those rising do@@ ts represents probably about 20 , 30 searches , or something like that .
there 's a lot of activity in China .
there 's a lot of activity in India .
and even in Antarctica -- well , at least this time of year -- we from time to time will see a query rising up .
ok@@ ay , not very many people know about it .
we also have a lot of engineers in those meetings , and they don 't always do their laundry as much as they should .
I just wanted to show quickly .
and so in our search results , we never accept payment for our search results .
well let me show you .
first , there 's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indu@@ s script does not represent a language at all .
if you look at a map of India today , you 'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the In@@ do @@@ -@@ @ European language family .
and I 'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .
are you ready ?
ok@@ ay . right to left , how many ? ok@@ ay .
Oh , it 's almost 50 / 50 . ok@@ ay .
and the Indu@@ s script now has this particular property .
most of you said U , which is right .
so we could deliberately er@@ ase some symbols , and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols .
so , as the old saying goes , if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script , then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .
and when she came down those steps , and it was just her and me for that moment , I was so glad that she did@@ n 't have to say to her mother , " I wish D@@ ad could have been here . "
and the Wh@@ it@@ ney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line .
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30 @@@ -@@ @ day challenges , my self @@@ -@@ @ confidence grew .
it turns out , all you have to do is write 1,6@@ 67 words a day for a month .
now is my book the next great American novel ?
and it 's a wonderful thing .
and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half .
but he@@ y , they grow back .
but if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
and that 's the sort of thing that it would be seeing .
finally , there 's one of evening pri@@ m@@ rose that B@@ j@@ or@@ n R@@ or@@ s@@ let@@ t from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern .
and the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver .
because it 's the first thing we draw ; we sur@@ round ourselves with images of it ; it 's probably the most common image on the planet .
our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate .
the average teen@@ ager sends 3,@@ 300 texts every [ month ] .
we 're talking about a society that is ret@@ re@@ ating into depression and dis@@ association when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift .
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke .
the first C is cognitive training .
here 's what my neuro@@ psych@@ ologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it .
un@@ te@@ stable -- that 's when I 'm in my com@@ a .
I 'm not a doctor . I have no medical background whatsoever .
but they asked one question . they said , " Is this repeat@@ able ? "
that was a fair question because my mem@@ o@@ ir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me .
second aspect : I still had crush@@ ing mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches .
this affected my entire body .
and I 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paraly@@ zed .
I believe that we can all rise and shine .
( appl@@ ause ) You know , when I heard Simon 's -- please sit down ; I just want to talk to him for a second -- when I read his book , I went to LA to meet him .
I don 't know what I had in my mind .
I did@@ n 't expect that person that I was going to meet to be him .
tell a little bit about what you 're wearing on your leg .
and if I do this , probably the mic won 't hear it .
and it works . it works .
and it acceler@@ ates the amount and level of the stimulation .
it works .
I must tell you , they 're an amazing -- there 's a hundred people who work in that building -- engineers , scientists , and other team members -- all the time .
the audience is too small .
so he saw a need and he stepped in .
my reading ability improved , but these forced reading lessons did@@ n 't exactly inspire a love of reading .
when she saw her reflection in the mirror , she started to cry .
if he do@@ es@@ n 't kill me , then , I think , I want to do it myself .
I was being sexually abused by my father and his friends .
it 's a 24 / 7 confidential helpl@@ ine in the UK for anyone who might be feeling desperate or su@@ ic@@ idal .
but I guess in a world which is dominated by profession@@ alizing everything we do , I really understood that that simple act of listening could have such a life @@@ -@@ @ changing effect .
( audio ) Good morning , you 're through to the Silver Line .
each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world 's people and not the other way around .
I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim @@@ -@@ @ majority societies .
if I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders , they come to your mind immediately .
well statistically , the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated .
and what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activis@@ m on the ground , in addition to international aid , in addition to education , in addition to health .
but Arch@@ ie Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e was a resour@@ ce@@ ful person .
and he can 't understand how this barbar@@ ism can be tolerated , and he ven@@ ts his frustr@@ ations .
and he had a name for it .
imagine you had one second per product category .
you could count them in five minutes .
what is evolution ?
now Un@@ il@@ ever did this and it did@@ n 't work -- too complicated .
it did@@ n 't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
you just have to believe me , it is , it is .
and I was " other " before being anything else -- even before being a girl .
that n@@ ag@@ ging dre@@ ad of self @@@ -@@ @ hood did@@ n 't exist when I was dancing .
but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is on@@ eness , our essence .
in those moments , I 'm connected to everything -- the ground , the air , the sounds , the energy from the audience .
what do you do when you grow up ? "
you can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them .
it 's out of print -- still ...
but what if you could rate those movies before they get made ?
it 's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation , like the buttons .
it involves light con@@ es and quantum ent@@ ang@@ lement , and I don 't really understand any of that .
now is this a new idea ?
thank you .
but you know , at a local level , you scale ; everybody in this room is scaled .
and here 's scaling of cities .
and you can see , they all follow the same line .
what is the reason for this ?
and it is our interactions and the clu@@ stering of those interactions .
and the question is : can we , as socio @@@ -@@ @ economic beings , avoid a heart attack ?
Laundry pil@@ es up to the sk@@ ies , he has a conversation on the phone for an hour with your mom about God knows what , takes the dog you wanted for a walk ...
and the best thing to do is to show up for class .
and let your presence be a gift .
this is Her@@ mann Go@@ ering .
now nobody believed him .
I don 't doubt that that plays some role , but what I want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on .
what I mean by this is we don 't just respond to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them .
or take sex .
these are stimul@@ i I 've used in some of my studies .
but how attractive you find them , how sexually or roman@@ tically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you 're looking at .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
and that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery .
this is Mar@@ la Ol@@ m@@ stead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
( la@@ ughter ) For a dollar 99 , you can listen to that silence , which is different than other forms of silence .
in the other condition , they 're told that the person in the next room is shoc@@ king them on purpose -- knows they 're shoc@@ king them .
others worry about peace and security , stability in the world .
this message , this word , can come out that this is not an old @@@ -@@ @ fashi@@ oned way of doing business ; it 's a brilliant way of saving your child 's life .
and so today we focus on not just passing out food , but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment , and teaching them about breastfeeding .
and this is climate @@@ -@@ @ proof .
and usually the institutions -- churches , temples , other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net .
but what is most amazing is the effect on girls .
we now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways .
but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ing@@ en@@ ious response , but can 't quite control it .
is it possible that muscle somehow intu@@ i@@ tively knows that it needs this blood supply ? it needs to be constantly contracting , so therefore it 's almost sel@@ fish . it 's gra@@ b@@ bing its blood vessels for itself .
we spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening , but we 're not very good at it .
( la@@ ughter ) But it 's a great intention to have in a relationship .
now we 're already starting to see some experiments here .
and it 's this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has , because it 's so fundamental to our lives .
the way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular , radio waves .
and the answer is yes .
so I 've mentioned to you the four challenges .
capacity : we have 10,000 times more spectrum , 10,000 times more LE@@ Ds installed already in the infrastructure there .
that 's aside .
and then I 've mentioned the availability .
these are potential sources for high @@@ -@@ @ speed data transmission .
and then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world .
it 's just that , whereas that device relies on pul@@ ses of infrared light , your language relies on pul@@ ses , discrete pul@@ ses , of sound .
in fact , the Tower of Ba@@ bel story in the Bible is a f@@ able and warning about the power of language .
how do we know this ?
because this is exactly what our ancestors , the Hom@@ o erec@@ tus , did .
you can follow it through the fossil record .
ok@@ ay , so what this tells us is that , contrary to the old ad@@ age , " mon@@ key see , mon@@ key do , " the surprise really is that all of the other animals really CA@@ N@@ NOT do that -- at least not very much .
once we have language , we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't have before we acquired it .
( la@@ ughter ) Now we have to counter that , though , against the evidence we 've heard that we might have had some rather di@@ sta@@ st@@ eful genetic d@@ alliances with the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als and the Den@@ is@@ ov@@ ans .
the European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their 23 official languages .
and we see this in the in@@ ex@@ orable march towards standardization .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
what we 've found is that mechanically ventil@@ ated air looks like humans .
but the more I talked about it , the more objec@@ ti@@ fied and fragmented my body became .
and in the name of connec@@ tedness , the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico .
it really opened my eyes .
( recording ) Girl : the hardest part is like finding out where he 's at , or like , when his court date is .
EA : according to the Anni@@ e E. Cas@@ ey Foundation , the number of young people with a father incarcer@@ ated rose 500 percent between 1980 and 2000 .
I really miss you .
EA : how does a young black person growing up in America today come to understand justice ?
d@@ w : the group . we all agreed on it .
one check we do have on prosecutors is defense .
and I 'm really glad that he did@@ n 't take his life .
and in the year 2008 , he part@@ nered with me in the first @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ its @@@ -@@ @ kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer something called mind@@ fulness training to active @@@ -@@ @ duty military personnel .
these electro@@ des pick up the ongoing brain electrical activity .
we call it the N@@ 170 component .
and what I mean by this is that when we direct attention to the face , it becomes clearer and more salient , it 's easier to see .
this is having off @@@ -@@ @ task thoughts while we 're engaged in an ongoing task of some sort .
they pressed the button every time they saw the face .
even though it 's quite plain to see that it was up@@ side down .
but that 's all in the context of these very controlled laboratory settings .
and when this mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering happens , it can be problematic .
so we might ask why do we do this ?
think of just the last time you were trying to read a book , got to the bottom of the page with no idea what the words were saying .
because those are the moments in which their attention is most likely to be vulnerable , because of stress and mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .
but if you do engage in mind@@ fulness practice , the more you do , the more you benefit .
they were discer@@ ning .
and he himself has gone on to continue practicing mind@@ fulness in a daily way .
he went from having a really bad b@@ oss -- an attention system that nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite leader and guide , and saved his life .
climate change is already a heavy topic , and it 's getting heavier because we 're understanding that we need to do more than we are .
urban retro@@ fitting : creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there .
increasingly , we 're realizing that we don 't even need to den@@ si@@ fy an entire city .
and that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot .
now , the ship s@@ ank between Rob@@ b@@ en Island to the south , and D@@ ass@@ en Island to the north -- two of the pen@@ gu@@ ins ' main breeding islands .
could I go and speak to older and wis@@ er people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
there was no day of intercultural cooperation .
and I ran@@ g Sir Bob Ay@@ ling , who was CEO of BA at the time , and said , " M@@ ate , we 've got this invitation .
and working with NGOs and building this case .
and that letter basically said , " We 'll observe this day .
and on the 21st of September this year , we 're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
and obviously the life @@@ -@@ @ saving is increased , the concepts help .
why don 't you support the process of the largest ever global tru@@ ce ?
would you go to governments and lobby and use the system ? "
we have about , you know , 38@@ ,000 places that are not worth caring about in the United States today .
unless the people that live here are Mun@@ ch@@ kins , nobody 's going to be using that .
we 're going to have to live closer to each other .
the age of the 3,000 mile Ca@@ es@@ ar sal@@ ad is coming to an end .
we 're not going to be rescu@@ ed by the hy@@ per @@@ -@@ @ car ; we 're not going to be rescu@@ ed by alternative fuels .
sometimes it 's hard to tell the two apart .
which is why in this vast and lon@@ ely cos@@ mos , we are so wonder@@ fully optimistic .
and that 's indeed the case .
the same is true if we look at a Chinese individual versus an African , the Ne@@ an@@ der@@ thal will match the Chinese individual more often .
and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als around 64@@ 0,000 years ago .
so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als , but far back and then have a long independent history .
so this presumably means that these Den@@ is@@ ov@@ ans had been more widespread in the past , since we don 't think that the ancestors of Mel@@ ane@@ sians were ever in Siberia .
when I travel with my work across Europe and the United States , one question always comes up : where is the Palestinian G@@ and@@ hi ?
about seven years ago , they faced extinction , because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village .
but I think the girls could do it .
Hamas Party Member : we were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine .
there is no need to use violence .
in fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .
so I 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MI@@ T are working on to achieve this self @@@ -@@ @ assembling future .
can we really scale this up ? can we really emb@@ ed robo@@ tics into every part ?
but it goes a step further , and it tries to have actual computation .
it basically em@@ beds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
so what this means is that the user can start plug@@ ging in what they want the bric@@ ks to do .
it compu@@ tes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do .
each element is completely identical , and they 're biased .
without them , humanity CA@@ N@@ NOT survive . "
and it was really her strength , I believe , that became the kind of m@@ ud@@ ra and im@@ pri@@ mat@@ ur that has been a guiding light in my life .
now I worked with dying people for over 40 years .
now let 's advance to 10,000 years before the present .
and I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity , at least in the next few hundred years .
and politically , it was aw@@ ful .
Thomas E@@ dis@@ on would have been very , very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today .
and so we have to understand that if we 're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life , we need to power it somehow .
evolution kicked in -- and that 's the cool bit .
this seems most likely .
so we have some kind of pri@@ mor@@ dial sou@@ p .
and they had a look at what was in the sou@@ p , and they found am@@ ino acids , but nothing came out , there was no cell .
and so forgive the molecules on the screen , but these are a very simple kit .
and this movie here shows this competition between molecules .
Lee C@@ ron@@ in : so many people think that life took millions of years to kick in .
so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon , maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for .
but you know , I have a problem with children 's books : I think they 're full of propaganda .
I have another idea .
and if you were here last year , I probably wrest@@ led you to the floor and tried to show you my new E@@ ye@@ Module 2 , which was a camera that plug@@ ged into the Hand@@ spring .
also , though we designed it a few years ago -- it 's just become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous in the last year or so -- this He@@ art@@ stream defi@@ br@@ ill@@ ator which is saving lives .
you pick them up , and once you see something that you 're interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
in contrast to if you went inside the d@@ ome , where it 's kind of wild and crazy and everybody 's learning all kinds of things , or fo@@ oling around , or whatever they 're doing .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session , and from all the different pres@@ enters .
( la@@ ughter ) Tele@@ phones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
let 's think about the future : the dra@@ gon vis @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ vis the ele@@ phant .
in some communities , you might not find a public health center , a post office or even a school , but you 'll find a church or mosque .
many of our faith @@@ -@@ @ based organizations have tremendous amounts of wealth that can be utilized for social change .
an Africa that demonstrates that God loves Africans and that we are just as capable as any other world region in solving our problems in peace ...
and unfortunately , for mort@@ als like you and me , we probably can 't understand it very well .
now , so far I 've mentioned the h@@ ackers An@@ onymous who are a politically motivated h@@ acking group .
but what about the real cyber@@ criminals ?
and then finally , C@@ ag@@ at@@ ay EV@@ Y@@ A@@ PA@@ N , aka Cha@@ 0 -- one of the most remarkable h@@ ackers ever , from Ankara in Turkey .
remember that , when they developed those h@@ acking skills , their moral comp@@ ass had not yet developed .
now I discussed this with Professor Simon Bar@@ on @@@ -@@ @ Co@@ hen who 's the professor of developmental psych@@ op@@ ath@@ ology at Cambridge .
they are recruiting h@@ ackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age activities -- are mobilizing them on behalf of the state .
they 're just relent@@ less and ob@@ ses@@ sive about what they do .
we want to work with you . "
my name is K@@ ate Har@@ t@@ man .
so I 'm specifically interested in how we , as humans , relate to ourselves , each other and the world around us .
I teach courses in physical computing and we@@ arable electronics .
and much of what I do is either we@@ arable or somehow related to the human form .
everybody 's got one -- all of you .
and so when working as an interaction designer , or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on , in or around the human form -- it 's really a powerful space to work within .
this one is called the Talk to Y@@ our@@ self H@@ at .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's fairly self @@@ -@@ @ explanatory .
what kind of an experience do they have ?
and so the In@@ flat@@ able Heart is an external organ that can be used by the we@@ arer to express themselves .
so they can express everything from admiration and l@@ ust to anxiety and ang@@ st .
( la@@ ughter ) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .
and so when I was first living in New York City a few years back , I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them .
so I made a we@@ arable wall that I could wear as a back@@ pack .
do I car@@ ve a message in the snow ?
or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool , like an ic@@ y meg@@ aph@@ one that I can use to ampl@@ ify my voice when I direct it at the ice .
but really the most satisfying experience I 've had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship .
this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the gl@@ ac@@ ier .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , I actually made a device called the Gl@@ ac@@ ier Em@@ brac@@ ing Su@@ it .
and once again , it 's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the gl@@ ac@@ ier and give it a hu@@ g .
these are initial mus@@ ings for this project .
and just as with the wall , how I wanted to be more wall @@@ -@@ @ like , with this project , I 'd actually like to take more a of gl@@ ac@@ ial pace .
women have two copies of that big X chro@@ mos@@ ome ; men have the X and , of course , that small copy of the Y.
sorry boys , but it 's just a tiny little thing that makes you different .
how many are there in the human gen@@ ome ? three billion .
is that a big number ?
and perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es -- decided they would want to sequence it .
that was all done on a machine like this .
it costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it .
then we bring that into software and reas@@ sem@@ ble it , and tell you what the story is .
so unfortunately , this do@@ es@@ n 't help this woman , but it does have severe -- profound , if you will -- implications to her family .
and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra 5 , 10 , 20 years , just because of this one thing .
do you think that 's not going to happen ?
anybody ? nobody .
they all h@@ ated each other , and all moved to different parts of the planet .
imagine one more thing , that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent : " would you be willing to meet your third cous@@ in ? "
thank you .
so most everyone watches TV .
they call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
we love to watch TV .
this is something that clearly separ@@ ates us from the animal kingdom .
so to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
we went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
we surveyed the top @@@ -@@ @ 20 Ni@@ el@@ sen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows .
five , the consumer society .
you can play a game and try and think of one I 've missed at , or try and bo@@ il it down to just four , but you 'll lose .
you need people to want to wear tons of clothes .
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year @@@ -@@ @ olds .
at the top of the international league table according to the latest P@@ ISA study , is the Shanghai district of China .
W@@ inst@@ on Chur@@ ch@@ ill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fat@@ eful year of 1938 .
since time im@@ memorial , there have been authors .
( la@@ ughter ) Now again , we kind of ca@@ ved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
what you 're seeing is year by year frequency of " thri@@ ved " and " thro@@ ve " over time .
EL@@ A : if you were not yet convinced , sea levels are rising , so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature .
pretty much for the vast majority of history , no one gave a dam@@ n about 1950 .
and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
in fact , it 's as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
[ the ] Tas@@ man@@ ian devil is found only on the island of Tas@@ man@@ ia , which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia .
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite dis@@ g@@ usting .
( la@@ ughter ) Ad@@ di@@ tionally , I 've heard horror stories from people whose teachers s@@ col@@ ded them , of course , for do@@ od@@ ling in classrooms .
but this was just the beginning .
and the national police even supported our work during the Ebola response .
over the course of the outbreak , West Africa had almost 29@@ ,000 cases .
we counted survival rate as a success : the end of suffering for the patient and fulfilling joy for families .
for these survivors , life can be compared to another health emergency .
however , many continue to bear intermit@@ tent pain .
simply the ID that denies you health care .
( la@@ ughter ) And then I imagined them looking at a specific picture of me with a beautiful young woman , and asking , " Who on earth is that with D@@ ad ? "
people are living far longer now , and for the first time in human history , it 's common for four generations to be living side by side .
a few months ago , a 40 year @@@ -@@ @ old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live , and she was brought in confused .
she was re@@ su@@ sc@@ itated , stabilized , whis@@ ked over to a CAT scan suite right next to the emergency room , because they were concerned about blood clo@@ ts in the lung .
and the real tragedy was , if you look through her records , she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years .
you might not know that Con@@ an Do@@ y@@ le went to medical school here in Edinburgh , and his character , Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes , was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell .
and Con@@ an Do@@ y@@ le , writing about Bell , described the following exchange between Bell and his students .
she says , " I did . "
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh , except in the bo@@ tanical gardens .
and so when Au@@ en@@ bru@@ gg@@ er became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
and La@@ en@@ ne@@ c thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abd@@ omen using what he called " the cylinder . "
and that is how ste@@ th@@ os@@ cope and aus@@ cul@@ tation was born .
this is a very famous painting : " the Doctor " by Luke Fil@@ des .
I 've often wondered , what would Fil@@ des have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era , in the year 2011 ?
when are they going to come by and explain things to me ?
and the one critical piece missing is that of the patient .
it had a beautiful facility , giant atri@@ um , val@@ et parking , a piano that played itself , a con@@ ci@@ erge that took you around from here to there .
but to her , it mat@@ tered deeply .
I say that because these are difficult patients .
and so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and I tried not to interrupt them .
the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this , but here 's what you should do , here 's what we should do . "
I took this to my colleagues at Stan@@ ford in anthro@@ pology and told them the same story .
we marry , for example , with great p@@ om@@ p and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of sol@@ itude and misery and lon@@ eliness to one of eternal bl@@ iss .
and out of that sense of failure , I remember , I would always examine the patient .
I would feel the abd@@ omen .
and then the next day , I would come , and I would do it again .
and employers who kept complain@@ ing that the kids coming out of school we@@ ren 't actually ready for real work , did@@ n 't have the right attitudes and experience .
it 's not perfect yet , but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands , possibly millions , of teenagers who are really bo@@ red by schooling .
a democracy could be upheld peacefully .
the belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep , proving that the African is capable of governing himself .
that 's what happens in academic journals , it 's what happens at academic conferences -- the Q & amp ; A session after a post@@ doc presents data is often a blood@@ bath .
but we 're also un@@ impressed by authority because it 's so easy to con@@ tri@@ ve .
that should ring alarm bel@@ ls : if you know the answer to your trial , you shou@@ ld@@ n 't be doing one .
the kids got the pills , and their performance improved .
if there is publication bias , if small negative trials have gone missing in action , you can see it on one of these graphs .
it 's perfect .
this is just the same thing on a screen .
something happened in the 7@@ 0s that is sometimes referred to as " the software crisis , " where suddenly , computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for , from a design perspective .
what mat@@ tered was that it was there at all .
they would look and say , " Oh , the progress bar is half done .
if you do it wrong , it sounds like : tick @@@ -@@ @ TA@@ T , tick @@@ -@@ @ TA@@ T , tick @@@ -@@ @ TA@@ T .
the rope became a big thing when women 's clothes became more fitted and the pan@@ t@@ alo@@ on came into being .
govern@@ esses used it to train their wards to jump rope .
those ro@@ pes created a space where we were able to contribute to something that was far greater than the neighborhood .
it 's where they get to shine .
so , a jump rope , you can use it for all different kinds of things .
and I think sometimes the simplest objects can make the most creative uses .
the button and the butt@@ on@@ hole is such a great invention .
it 's one of the most enduring designs in history .
there 's either a d@@ ome button with a little sh@@ ank , or there 's just this sort of round thing with either a rim or not a rim , either two holes or four holes .
and the way you figure that out is : the diameter of the button plus the width of the button , plus a little bit of ease .
as we move across a stair@@ way , the form dict@@ ates our pac@@ ing , our feeling , our safety and our relationship and engagement with the space around us .
when I was 10 years old , there was a girl in my class at school named V@@ ick@@ y .
she would hit herself and give herself bloody nos@@ es and she had hygiene problems -- she had big hygiene problems .
when I was 10 years old , I treated another human being like some worth@@ less other ...
like I was better than her , and she was garbage .
what kind of a nice person does that ?
so , what if I was@@ n 't nice after all ?
the first step is starting to recognize the hate inside ourselves .
and then second : if we want to challenge the hate in our societies , we need to promote policies and institutions and practices that connect us as communities .
but anyway , a year after I began my journey , I wrote V@@ ick@@ y an ap@@ ology .
the producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
it 's very complicated to explain .
and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blog .
micro@@ blog bo@@ omed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tri@@ pled .
and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they 're sick .
in urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they fig@@ ured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
they find themselves sort of sand@@ w@@ ich@@ ed between the urban areas and the rural areas .
most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside , but they don 't have the sense of belonging .
so for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
and also , the bit@@ ter@@ ness and even resent@@ ment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
so any accusations of corruption or back@@ door dealings between authorities or business would ar@@ ouse a social out@@ cry or even unrest .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
and this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a B@@ MW than smile on a bicycle .
a father posted his son 's picture onto the Internet .
so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it 's about the environment .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
and I said , " What is that ? "
who on Earth would write something as con@@ v@@ olu@@ ted and complex and in@@ ane ?
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types .
and this type of activity goes on for quite a while , until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs .
so why despair when the unexpected knoc@@ ks on the horizon ?
we have conducted ourselves in ways that seem as if Africa is dam@@ ned and doomed .
and that all these experiences in history have ir@@ re@@ versi@@ bly , ir@@ repar@@ ably fore@@ closed the chances and possibility for Africa to emerge , thrive and flourish .
so you 'd think , with all this extra space , we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff .
so I 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
we need to think before we buy .
we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
my office fol@@ ds away , easily hidden .
but it was@@ n 't until I got older and I learned more about the National Park System that I realized just how lucky I was .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) But -- ( Appl@@ ause ) Here we are , a few years later .
and I 've seen g@@ lim@@ p@@ ses of this future , and I know that it 's possible .
but we need to take it a step further .
and , actually , I think we can dust off Stephen Ma@@ ther 's play@@ book .
my parents are visiting here from Minnesota , and they don 't really even care about this talk , all they 're talking about is going to Mu@@ ir Woods .
everybody had a job .
we can do this ourselves .
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi @@@ -@@ @ step separation process begins .
I did@@ n 't believe my father , not because he was a li@@ ar , but I 'd never heard this story , and my mother in fact validated that .
and so I and many others were finally able to go to high school , a regular high school , and take regular classes .
my medical exam was something completely different .
if it is , I can do that .
( appl@@ ause ) And then the same day , I got a call from an attorney who was writing a book about civil rights .
we signed it in 2009 , but it do@@ es@@ n 't come into force until ratification , and the president -- no president can ratify a treaty without the consent of the Senate .
and as long as many countries don 't have the same laws as we do and don 't enforce them if they have them , opportunities for disabled people are more limited .
and frequently these cases are not adjudic@@ ated .
people talked to me differently . they acted differently towards me . "
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
so what 's it like to be a baby ?
so they were concerned that the stories we@@ ren 't quite as accurate as police were claiming them to be .
that goes for journalists themselves , people like me .
there was no official investigation into his death .
I got an email from an investment fund manager in New York .
I@@ an Tom@@ lin@@ son was walking through this area , attempting to get home from work .
and I realized : this is really something quite significant .
he realized we had an intention to tell a different version of events ; we were skep@@ tical .
what I saw was the three men trying to pull him down below the seats .
and we could interro@@ gate what they were saying and ensure it was consistent with what other passengers were saying , too .
and it was a physiological response .
now you probably know the answer to this already .
and the first was , I 'd ask other people : " do you like it ? " " yes . "
it 's the last thing she did , the last physical act .
that 's not the expression of joy .
it is@@ n 't just about nice .
so that 's ok@@ ay , is@@ n 't it ?
it 's stu@@ pe@@ f@@ y@@ ingly difficult to make something that ref@@ rac@@ ts light like that , that comes out of the tool correctly , that goes down the line without falling over .
so is that wrong ?
and he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
he had his head mic like I 've got .
I watch that TV show ' Li@@ e To Me . ' I know you 're lying . "
on a given day , studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
Kok@@ o was taught to communicate via sign language .
ask a dec@@ ep@@ tive person to tell their story , they 're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places .
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , po@@ ison the living and further harm the environment .
since 1986 , it h@@ as@@ n 't leak@@ ed .
so long as the sun sh@@ ines , we 'll have no problem with power .
she actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
bare@@ foot technology : this was 1986 -- no engineer , no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rain@@ water from the roof@@ s .
every five years we have an election .
( la@@ ughter ) Men are rest@@ less , men are ambitious , men are compul@@ sively mobile , and they all want a certificate .
tell a woman .
she handled the national press , and she was a star .
that 's what I say in my mind . and I just say " thank you , " and I go on to the next one .
this way , when you have an interaction with a chat@@ bot on your phone or a voice @@@ -@@ @ based system in the car , it sounds a little more human and less cold and dis@@ join@@ ted .
and I created a piece that explo@@ res computer @@@ -@@ @ based in@@ tuition in a physical space .
sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves ; it 'll tell us who we are .
we have this mountain of data , which is an@@ atom@@ y , physi@@ ology and behavior .
there 's a little w@@ imp@@ y box on top there .
I 've got this experience , I 'm in the world .
it can run and hide . it has fears and emotions . it can eat you .
now in evolution , what happened ?
you still have that all@@ ig@@ ator brain . you do . it 's your emotional brain .
that 's because you 're making a prediction .
not like computer memory -- not at all like computer memory .
it 's a memory of very high @@@ -@@ @ dimensional patterns , like the things that come from your eyes .
are we going to really build intelligent machines ?
so you 're not going to see C @@@ -@@ @ 3@@ PO .
I know a lot of people who invented the micro@@ processor .
moreover , the Americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyber@@ war capabilities .
today we 're moving to a multi@@ polar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at Copenhagen .
and these pre@@ emp@@ tive attacks might not just remain in cyber@@ space .
the cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes .
about 15 years ago , when I learned of our new @@@ -@@ @ found ability to create quantum effects that don 't exist in nature , I was excited .
there 's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger .
arm ampu@@ tation is usually caused by trauma , with things like industrial accidents , motor vehicle colli@@ sions or , very po@@ ign@@ antly , war .
every time you contract a muscle , it em@@ its a little electricity that you can record with anten@@ na@@ e or electro@@ des and use that to operate the motorized pros@@ thesis .
we built our own arm at the Re@@ hab Institute of Chicago where we 've added some wr@@ ist flexi@@ on and shoulder joints to get up to six motors , or six degrees of freedom .
you touch yourself , there 's a stimulus that comes up those very same ner@@ ves back up to your brain .
he has not learned how to do this with the chest .
so we 're all motivated to get motor commands to drive robo@@ tic arms .
and we 're fortunate today to have A@@ man@@ da Kitts come and join us .
( la@@ ughter ) And here you can see , on J@@ esse 's chest , when he just tried to do three different things , you can see three different patterns .
so A@@ man@@ da , when you first started using this arm , how long did it take to use it ?
so if it stopped working , I just had to take it off .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , " What hand grasp pattern do I want ? "
T@@ K : that 's Cla@@ u@@ dia , and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her pros@@ thetic .
so it 'll be the smallest and ligh@@ test and the s@@ mar@@ test arm ever made .
I 'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side , with yesterday 's theme .
there was a computer spo@@ ok , a broken wire , a converter that spar@@ ked .
and then I compile all of these numbers on these clip@@ boards that you see here .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
but it 's also used to assign a temperature range .
you place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musical score .
you all know the truth of what I 'm going to say .
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .
on that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies .
we collected data on problems with social gradi@@ ents , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social lad@@ der .
they 're all weighted equally .
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
this is mental illness .
this is violence .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
what about caus@@ ality ?
we 've got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top .
he 's an engineer .
it 's called the Nor@@ den Mark 15 bomb@@ sight .
and he makes this complicated thing .
so what happens during the Second World War ?
well how many clou@@ dless sk@@ ies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
we live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they 've invented gad@@ gets that will forever change our world .
is it because their weapons we@@ ren 't accurate ?
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?
hor@@ sem@@ en of the A@@ poc@@ aly@@ pse that is cancer .
this got us very excited .
we 've completed , now , clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
we have this molec@@ ule , but it 's not a pill yet .
and so I want to thank you for your participation , your collaboration and most of all , for your confidence in our ideas .
( la@@ ughter ) So I made series of images , cut@@ tings , and I assembled them in portfolios .
so this spi@@ der goes through the whole alphabet with identical ad@@ jec@@ tives and substan@@ tives .
so sc@@ rolls are very convenient , because you can create a large image on a very small table .
" Re@@ ef@@ City . "
and in paper@@ cutting , you have the drawing as the structure itself .
so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
I made an artist book that 's in stainless steel instead of paper .
and B@@ ron@@ x literature , it 's all about B@@ ron@@ x writers and their stories .
and for other projects , like in Paris , it 's about the name of the street .
and I wanted to give them an escape .
it is a paper@@ cutting , and then after , I added color on the computer .
it had no windows , no plum@@ bing , no electricity and it was filled with tra@@ sh .
and I was@@ n 't able to see it myself until I lived there .
and after university , I wanted to do something -- probably na@@ Ã¯@@ vely -- to help .
during the year I worked on my house before moving in , I lived in a micro@@ community inside Pol@@ e@@ town , founded by a wild and virtu@@ ous farmer named Paul We@@ er@@ tz .
it 's realizing we have the power to create the world ane@@ w together and to do it ourselves when our governments refuse .
there 's a third way to rebuild , and it declines to make the same mistakes of the past .
while building my house , I found something I did@@ n 't know I was looking for -- what a lot of mill@@ enn@@ ials and people who are moving back to cities are looking for .
or clergy and teachers engaging in civil dis@@ obedience to block water shu@@ to@@ ff trucks .
it means tr@@ usting those who know the problems best -- the people who live them -- with solutions .
or any date for that fact , it 's like , " I don 't exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . "
and I don 't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did .
I would tell them , " He@@ y guys , this is where I 'm going . this is my flight .
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now .
he : almost none .
he : well it goes to the last point that I was at .
then I had to measure morality .
so if I understood the chemistry of trust@@ worthiness , I might help alleviate poverty .
but I 'm also a skep@@ tic .
that 's not what we found .
and whenever we raise oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in , people willingly open up their w@@ alle@@ ts and share money with str@@ angers .
I just found the molec@@ ule behind it .
" He@@ y , a guy just found it . "
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
so if you trust them , their bra@@ ins don 't release oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in .
and we have testosterone .
and I took blood from the bride and the gro@@ om and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the v@@ ows .
she had the biggest increase in oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in .
and it 's so easy to cause people 's bra@@ ins to release oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in .
Dr. Love says eight hu@@ gs a day .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
and lots of generations , lots of t@@ we@@ aking and tor@@ qu@@ ing , and we turn our pu@@ ffer into the Mol@@ a .
so the great thing about the Mol@@ a is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that 's streaming off , that 's right where we put the tag .
and it h@@ as@@ n 't been published , so it 's totally priv@@ y information just for TED .
and in showing you this , you know , when we 're looking at this data , we 're thinking , oh do these animals , do they cross the equ@@ ator ?
and to me that -- I don 't think I could say it any better than the im@@ mortal B@@ ard himself : " one touch of nature makes the whole world kin . "
and sure , it may be just one big old sil@@ ly fish , but it 's helping .
if it 's helping to unite the world , I think it 's definitely the fish of the future .
we have a carbon fiber safety c@@ age that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car .
you 're not powering the prop@@ eller , you 're powering the wheels .
when we do have to do something truly out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ box , we use an incremental design , build , test , re@@ design cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps .
there are thousands of local air@@ strips that don 't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could .
the Transition gives you a safer , more convenient and more fun way of using this resource .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you .
and in neuro@@ science , we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain .
and that is , why do we and other animals have bra@@ ins ?
but apart from that , everything else goes through contrac@@ tions of muscles .
so it 's really important to remember that sen@@ sory , memory and cognitive processes are all important , but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements .
now of course there are other moves , but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution .
we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that 's what we 'd like to know .
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be .
so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is , for example , sen@@ sory feedback is extremely nois@@ y .
forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in d@@ arts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
so I have sen@@ sory input , which I can take in to make beliefs .
now both these sources of information carry important information .
so it 's the optimal way of combining information .
and what this part really says is I have to predict the probability of different sen@@ sory feed@@ backs given my beliefs .
and so they take it in turns to apply the force they 've just experienced back and forward .
so it could be brid@@ ged in in@@ finitely many different ways .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : quick question for you , Dan .

so magic is a very intro@@ ver@@ ted field .
( music ) Please .
( music ) You heard her , go ahead .
there is@@ n 't much doubt , is there ?
and above all , it is a right , it is everyone 's right .
next , use short sentences , because grand@@ ma , like anyone of us , if you make very long sentences , she gets to the end and she can 't remember what you said in the beginning , anymore .
al@@ right ? it 's easy !
and write in order to be understood . write to your grand@@ ma .
this structure , then , can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself , so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself , and that 's shown in green here on this micro@@ graph .
I 'm going to add some resource from the left , here , that def@@ uses into the system , and you can see , they really like that .
we call ourselves P@@ ors and Ra@@ o , and we live and work in India .
on the right side you can see my colleague So@@ ren , who 's actually in the space .
so I 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it 's much faster .
let 's fast @@@ -@@ @ forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later , where I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3D laser scanning system .
all of this happens in seconds .
well , I 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while I 've been speaking , you have been scanned .
humans have long held a fasc@@ ination for the human brain .
there 's a container under@@ ne@@ ath that 's collecting that tissue .
we 've done right now two human bra@@ ins @@@ -@@ @ worth of data .
we 've put all of that together into one thing , and I 'll show you what that synthesis looks like .
we 're just starting to look at this data ourselves .
so I 'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go .
I want you to understand , each one of these is a hypothesis ; it is subject to revision .
now , you may not have focused on this , but index search accounted for 90 % of all search volume about 4 years ago .
and the simplest way to look at it is to look at a Google results page : the only logo on that page is Google 's ; everything else is in the same font .
the third hypothesis I have is no longer controversial , but it 's important to understand what happened .
we started doing things called " T@@ wit@@ ter@@ casts , " the first live concerts and then pre@@ recorded concerts , distributed over Twitter .
you know , every Saturday and Sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stad@@ iums to watch games .
it 's just acceptable that play is a good thing .
already this morning there were some all@@ u@@ sions to the Africa that you hear about all the time : the Africa of HIV / AIDS , the Africa of malaria , the Africa of poverty , the Africa of conflict , and the Africa of disasters .
I 'm working on an initiative now , along with the World Bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries ' mone@@ ys -- to get that sent back .
( la@@ ughter ) The s@@ mar@@ test one , first to come in , was the MT@@ N company of South Africa .
a new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of African countries have had multi @@@ -@@ @ party democratic elections .
yr : ye@@ ah . I have no checklist for that .
( la@@ ughter ) But that would actually get you oriented pretty fast , right ?
when we sat people facing south , they organized time from left to right .
this is a little trick that you 're taught to use as kids .
do German speakers think of the sun as somehow more female @@@ -@@ @ like , and the moon somehow more male @@@ -@@ @ like ?
so , people who speak different languages will pay attention to different things , depending on what their language usually requires them to do .
language can also have really deep effects -- that 's what we saw with the case of number .
I 've told you about how speakers of different languages think differently , but of course , that 's not about how people elsewhere think .
they thought you just wear out , there 's nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
so part of it is like a bas@@ eball g@@ love .
I just told you that , if you make a mu@@ tation in the da@@ f @@@ -@@ @ 2 gene cell , that you get a recep@@ tor that do@@ es@@ n 't work as well ; the animal lives longer .
so maybe it 's working in people the same way .
so the next question , of course , is : is there any effect on age @@@ -@@ @ related disease ?
so in a da@@ f @@@ -@@ @ 2 mu@@ tant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the recep@@ tor .
you see one gene . there are lots of genes actually that bind on FO@@ X@@ O .
and the way that Generation G is different from X , Y , and all the different generations that we may belong to , is that video games are the primary form of entertainment that Generation G is consuming .
part of the reason gam@@ ification has become such an emer@@ gent topic right now is because of Generation G 's effect on culture and society already .
another really interesting example is a thing called " speed camera lottery , " designed by K@@ ev@@ in Ric@@ hard@@ son , based in San Francisco , works for M@@ TV .
of course , it 's also true , and I 'm here to tell you : the kids are al@@ right .
but it 's going to take your help to make the kids awesome .
I have a prescription for you .
it made for a hec@@ k of a profile picture on Facebook for a week .
so we already are doing solar engineering .
but it 's so little , it would be like putting a handful of chal@@ k into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain .
and I do worry about that .
so I am an optim@@ ist about our future selves , but I 'm not an optim@@ ist because I think our problems are small .
( la@@ ughter ) I did@@ n 't know what to say . Kle@@ iner 's second law is , " There is a time when panic is the appropriate response . "
consumers don 't really like these light bul@@ bs .
so , if all goes well , they 're going to have designer bugs in warm v@@ ats that are eating and dig@@ esting sug@@ ars to ex@@ crete better biofuels .
but I 'm really afraid we need much , much more .
it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country .
it wi@@ ped out 75 percent of all species on Earth .
but they will do global economic damage , because they don 't have to hit , necessarily , to do this kind of damage .
the smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years .
it 's right here .
this is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that ble@@ w up over T@@ ung@@ us@@ ka and hit Ari@@ z@@ ona 50,000 years ago .
we have to find these things first .
( la@@ ughter ) But we 'd be rich !
but we 've fig@@ ured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this .
this probe actually can 't use chemical rockets .
how can you change the conversation for extremely oppressed and forgotten people ?
education shapes our children . it shapes the way we teach .
somehow , we live in this world where , in 2017 , the US Constitution is held up as the supreme law of the land , right ?
we are medicine men , we are medicine women , we are sun dancers , we are pipe carriers , we are traditional language speakers .
what used to be 50 C@@ ent in my room then , to a 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old boy 's room now is S@@ au@@ ti So@@ l .
A@@ fro@@ be@@ ats has played the strongest role so far , if you ask me , as far as emancip@@ ating the youth is concerned .
in 2015 , President Obama came to Kenya , and we had the pleasure of being the entertainment for the state dinner that happened at state house , Nairobi .
with almost no force I can control his position and his velocity .
so I started shooting time @@@ -@@ @ lap@@ se photography .
so , I have a gift I want to share with you today , a project I 'm working on called " Happ@@ iness Re@@ ve@@ aled . "
it 's not just another day .
now at the time that I was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment .
so window farms have been evolving through a rapid ver@@ sioning process similar to software .
but I think that Ele@@ en expresses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration .
at the age of 19 , the day after I graduated high school , I moved to a place where it snow@@ ed and I became a massage therap@@ ist .
he 's about my age , and he 's in San Qu@@ enti@@ n State Prison .
and that 's fel@@ ony murder -- 25 to life , par@@ ole at 50 if you 're lucky , and Tony 's not feeling very lucky .
what is that idea ?
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
we 're incredibly used to not having to face life 's hard realities , in a certain sense .
I mean , even the stupid " reply all " regrets can leave us in a fit of ex@@ cruci@@ ating ag@@ ony for days .
and that 's just regret about tat@@ to@@ os .
and I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent m@@ n@@ em@@ onic device .
but one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
but Cambodia is not alone .
but it is in so many countries .
in Burundi I walked into a prison and it was@@ n 't a 12 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old boy , it was an 8 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old boy for ste@@ aling a mobile phone .
but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
and then he said , " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . "
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
we have a program called J@@ us@@ tic@@ e@@ Mak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
or maybe you 've called to mind the to@@ dd@@ ler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a for@@ k .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) You know , I never thought that I 'd end up working at Microsoft .
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
( la@@ ughter ) It 's like the six degrees of separation , but with research .
so for whatever reason , this impl@@ ant is not successfully stimulating aud@@ itory cor@@ tices during mel@@ ody perception .
( music ) ( Limited Frequ@@ ency Music ) I had patients tell me that those sound the same .
because his grave was exhum@@ ed .
the bra@@ ins remain hard@@ wired for music .
now I want to show you one last video .
and here 's a video of Joseph .
and at about four months old , I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss .
there are almost no deaf surge@@ ons anywhere .
you don 't actually have to hear it .
you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
and I don 't think that we should give up on beauty .
I believe that journalism is a public good .
they 're under pressure to communicate their science outside of the academy .
so they 're collaborating with reporters , because for many researchers , it 's difficult for them to write a simple story or a clear story .
and it was a discussion with Rev@@ i that brought us to the edge of the researcher and repor@@ ter , that fu@@ zz@@ y boundary .
but we don 't see nor portra@@ y developing communities the same way .
it could be Somalia today .
it 's a ter@@ rific story .
this also is not a research picture .
Rev@@ i and I analyzed some of the mandates that researchers are under .
but social scientists understand that people 's time is valuable so they pay them for that time .
research environments and reporting trips and NGO projects are very intimate environments ; you make good friends while you 're doing good work .
do we have women as victims , and are men only the perpetrators ?
should they share in the profit ?
this is a for @@@ -@@ @ profit game .
but we can also shar@@ pen our insights .
nobody notices .
a mother fin@@ ishes setting the table for dinner .
the astr@@ on@@ aut is asleep .
when I was little , I could not understand the concept that you could only live one life .
I was sure that I was going to actually experience what it felt like to be a leader of the civil rights movement or a ten @@@ -@@ @ year old boy living on a farm during the dust bow@@ l or an em@@ peror of the Tan@@ g dy@@ nasty in China .
I usually just got cut off .
good afternoon , I 'm proud to be here at TE@@ D@@ x@@ Krakow .
there is also one big thing about hum@@ or , it really hur@@ ts .
( la@@ ughter ) And then I started thinking , of course , we can 't just get rid of cap@@ t@@ ch@@ as , because the security of the web depends on them .
but since it do@@ es@@ n 't know the answer , it CA@@ N@@ NOT grade it .
here 's how it works .
( la@@ ughter ) they contain S@@ no@@ op D@@ og@@ g .
so this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
and the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
by the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is H@@ acker .
there 's a lot of things to say about this question .
right now , the web is parti@@ tioned into multiple languages .
the problem with that is it 's not yet good enough and it probably won 't be for the next 15 to 20 years .
unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is even at the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
if this is what you want to do , you quickly realize you 're going to run into two big hur@@ dles , two big obstacles .
sp@@ id@@ ers use sil@@ k for many purposes , including the tra@@ iling safety dra@@ g@@ line , wrap@@ ping eggs for reproduction , protective ret@@ reats and catching prey .
for example , this garden spi@@ der can make seven different kinds of sil@@ ks .
the frame and radi@@ i of this web is made up of one type of sil@@ k , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different sil@@ ks : the filament and the stic@@ ky dro@@ ple@@ t .
to answer that , you have to look a lot closer at the spin@@ ne@@ ret region of a spi@@ der .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
there 's also ac@@ ini@@ form sil@@ k , which is used to wrap prey .
minor am@@ pul@@ late sil@@ k is used in web construction .
you can see that the repeat units differ in length . they also differ in sequence .
here are stress @@@ -@@ @ strain curves generated by tensile testing five fi@@ bers made by the same spi@@ der .
that 's what the spi@@ der has to interact with their environment .
these are the two species of sp@@ id@@ ers for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spi@@ der sil@@ k research has been to replicate their dra@@ g@@ line sil@@ k proteins .
yet , their dra@@ g@@ lines are not the tough@@ est .
it fre@@ es us from the constraints of our imagination .
you 'll be seeing one of the most high @@@ -@@ @ performance materials known to man .
it is made out of silic@@ on .
this is a setup I put in a physics lab .
and I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing .
but you may not know that he tried to perform lo@@ bo@@ tom@@ ies in the brain , non@@ inv@@ a@@ sively , with focused ultrasound in the ' 50s .
and there was something fundamental that they were missing .
so this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
it 's a target in the thal@@ am@@ us .
pain is something that can make your life mis@@ erable .
and doing that in the U.S.
well , there are other cancer tum@@ ors in the abd@@ omen -- quite lethal , very lethal actually -- pan@@ cre@@ as , liver , kidney .
this is a big fi@@ bro@@ id .
she was offered a hy@@ ste@@ rec@@ tomy , but this is an in@@ conceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .
it is really a sacred space .
everyone 's listening . we 're responding .
( music ) So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
so it 's unpredictable . we 'll paint this pal@@ ette again .
it got a little bit more rhyth@@ mic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
so , my normal working field is called two @@@ -@@ @ pho@@ ton poly@@ mer@@ ization .
what was my motivation ?
when I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water .
and like the play@@ w@@ right said the other day -- I could relate to him : you 're not sure .
when I came out of college , I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California , and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roof@@ s and things like that .
I 've done it with Cla@@ es Ol@@ den@@ burg and with Richard Ser@@ ra , who do@@ es@@ n 't think architecture is art .
( la@@ ughter ) F@@ G : anyway , the S@@ iza thing .
by saying all that , it means your work is good somehow .
( la@@ ughter ) R@@ S@@ W : frank had a sort of ...
( la@@ ughter ) But my point is that ... and I call it the " then what ? "
and I think that 's the issue , you know ; it 's the " then what " that most clients who hire architects -- most clients are@@ n 't hiring architects for that .
and I 've met with some of these people .
but let me just say a couple words .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'm going to make it for you !
with all of us knowing everything , we 're kind of forced by technology to become Budd@@ has or something , to become enlightened .
and of course , we all will be deeply disappointed when we do .
and it 's inside and outside , self and other , and other is all very different .
and so you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it 's you versus the universe -- that 's all Buddha discovered .
it 's totally strange .
basically , she would collect string .
now , a landfill is basically something which is not going to go away , and it 's increasing .
these are actually bric@@ ks that are made from old demolition waste , which includes the glass , the rub@@ ble , the concrete .
can we use that , the ability to understand that all the materials available in that building are still usable ?
one day , I crossed the bridge over the Ox@@ us River .
these are opium @@@ -@@ @ addic@@ ted people on the roof@@ s of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
I saw one day , the largest school in Afghanistan , a girls ' school .
but art can change the way we see the world .
( voices overlapping ) So , my wish ... My wish ... I wish ...
the easy way is just -- I 'm pap@@ ering black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white images on walls .
now I realize that the community wanted to do art projects even more than I wanted .
Lu@@ ana : we 're just a tool for people that want to send a positive message .
( music ) ( Cam@@ era clicking ) Touch the screen , take your picture , type in information .
( music ) Lu@@ ana : it 's the people 's art project .
you CA@@ N@@ NOT know when and how , but it 's worth trying .
so how do we stop this ?
man : this is par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol .
their ability to do that is strengthened when they 're enabled with modern technology .
thank you .
you of course want to record maybe how thick something is , which you can 't measure from space , whether that 's soil or snow .
she 's able to give back and really contribute in a meaningful way .
it was late fall , and we were getting ready for next spring .
I picked it up and he said , " Let me see that . "
ultimately , this technology is helping us to re@@ write our history .
D@@ J : we need to know our history .
[ become a Glob@@ al@@ X@@ plo@@ rer Glob@@ al@@ X@@ plo@@ re@@ r@@ .org ]
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
so we go back and we do that again , and again .
the eventual goal is that we 'll get this into patients .
however , we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molec@@ ule for one @@@ -@@ @ time use .
you have a voice through the arts that do@@ es@@ n 't judge what you 've been through .

" you know , I 'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey .
I strongly believe we can translate the science , bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment .
we all want a clean environment .
a picture that you 're familiar with -- the Amazon rain@@ forests .
that 's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally .
someone once asked me , " Who is better or worse , is it Un@@ il@@ ever or is it P & amp ; G when it comes to their impact on rain@@ forests in Indonesia ? "
thank@@ fully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
imagine your internet access went off for a day , and when it came back , it only stayed on for three hours at a time , with random 15 @@@ -@@ @ hour out@@ ages ?
they 're hard to just get automatically .
we could eliminate sugar across the board for all conf@@ ec@@ tionary products and so@@ d@@ as , and we can replace it with all @@@ -@@ @ natural fresh fruit .
HC : so the key thing to remember here is , we don 't really care what this tuna really is .
as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment , it do@@ es@@ n 't matter .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture -- and that was the main issue with this challenge .
and my lung collapsed , so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well , to stop that catastrophic event from happening .
I was blind , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't speak and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't walk .
she is sleeping in the corner of this apartment . "
( la@@ ughter ) I very quickly realized I had to keep my teaching and my carto@@ oning separate .
I 'd just take a shar@@ pi@@ e , draw one panel after the other , fig@@ uring out what I wanted to say as I went .
it was like I was giving them a remote control over the information .
in 1944 , the " Journal of Educational Soci@@ ology " even devoted an entire issue to this topic .
( la@@ ughter ) He was wrong .
Dr. W@@ er@@ th@@ am does a pretty du@@ bi@@ ous job of proving his case , but his book does inspire the Senate of the United States to hold a series of hearings to see if in fact com@@ ic books caused juvenile delinquency .
as of 2007 , we went from being a primarily rural planet to being a primarily urban one , and that has implications for how we 're going to feed these people , how we 're going to get the food to the people in the cities .
it takes 10 cal@@ ories of fossil fuel energy in our highly industrialized food system in order to produce one cal@@ ori@@ e of food energy .
we 'll also need to grow more food with less water .
in the Global South , we 're seeing desertification , whereas in the north , we 're seeing sub@@ urban spra@@ wl .
that might sound like a lot , because we 're probably at about two percent at the most right now .
why not green food ?
( la@@ ughter ) So I 'm going to take you to task , guys .
so here 's the new history of ga@@ str@@ onomy .
but of course it 's not the real thing , it 's either diluted or it 's completely in@@ ert .
and , sure -- pharmaceutical companies have moral obligations , just like we do .
and it 's also due , sometimes , to the fact that doctors and patients are fal@@ sely influenced by advertising campaigns of pharmaceutical companies .
they have a choice .
except that they 're not as rich as ours , because they don 't have a cere@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x like we do .
in other words , we 're not literally replacing the components of the re@@ tina .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our en@@ co@@ der and trans@@ duc@@ er .
it 's very flat , kind of rigid .
you say , " Well , of course I can 't write today , because I 'm giving a TE@@ D@@ Talk and I have five media interviews , and then I 'm going to a cocktail party and then I 'll be drunk after that .
once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one .

people like Mahmoud are agents of change .
and when you start changing , you CA@@ N@@ NOT stop .
that 's Na@@ j@@ m@@ ud@@ din , the one with the white coat .
terrible Na@@ j@@ m@@ ud@@ din , is that one .
well don 't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over ; not at all . we are going on .
is it really necessary ? "
well now you should see me .
and this was an amazing year .
I 've spent the last year research@@ ing and writing about this subject .
I thought , " Oh my g@@ os@@ h . I 'm going to become a Cro@@ t@@ ch@@ ety old lady . "
what was I supposed to accomplish in this final act ?
and you 're able to go back and forgive them .
these live in a global space which is largely unregulated , not subject to the rule of law , and in which people may act free of constraint .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gent@@ lemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spa@@ w@@ ning more U.@@ N. institutions .
in fact , what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
it 's going to be quite gr@@ um@@ py as China begins to democrati@@ ze her society after liber@@ alizing her economy .
I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough .
and here 's the third factor , which is totally different .
we are now inter@@ locked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before .
it 's its capacity to lock together its institutions .
it is no longer the case .
for us , I think , part of the equation for our survival .
( la@@ ughter ) And if you did this for all thousand TED Tal@@ ks , you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000 .
so I would end up paying hundreds of dollars .
some of you might actually right now be thinking , it 's down@@ right crazy to have 10 TED Tal@@ ks summarized into just six words .
and unfortunately , when I first received the answers -- and here , you 'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed .
but the thing about this filter is that it always leaves the same things in .
when asked to describe their lives , what is interesting is how few people said " m@@ ess . "
51 % wanted to turn his or her life into a story .
so again , we should be suspicious of stories .
you view your life like this instead of the m@@ ess that it is or it ought to be .
just imagine yourself pressing a button every time you tell the good versus evil story , and by pressing that button , you 're lowering your I@@ Q by ten points or more .
you 'll hear this in so many contexts .
but to think that by buying the book gets you somewhere , that 's maybe the bigger fall@@ acy .
they 're the ones who go out and make the worst mistakes .
so if you 're too attached to stories , what will happen is people selling products come along , and they will bun@@ dle their product with a story .
but , say , the alternative story is : " you don 't actually need a car as nice as your income would indicate .
I 'm really not sure , and I 'm not here to tell you to burn your DVD player and throw out your Tol@@ sto@@ y .
even though their disease may have been cured , the resulting nerve damage will have left many of them without a sense of touch in their hands .
well , we focus on needs and people and context .
but then one night , my mom was cooking gr@@ illed chicken for dinner , and I noticed that the edges of the chicken , which had been mar@@ inated in l@@ emon juice , turned white .
most of the others either never responded back , said they did@@ n 't have the time or did@@ n 't have the equipment and cou@@ ld@@ n 't help me .
I 've also entered in her age , her gender and her height .
so I want you to re@@ imagine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
the red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
they need political solutions .
you CA@@ N@@ NOT talk to everybody all the time .
and what is dialogue really about ?
it 's crucial to understand , I believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom @@@ -@@ @ up .
medical appointments would be scheduled during business hours , and I knew that I would need time off to recover from surgical procedures .
chem@@ o brain presents itself through memory loss , an inability to concentrate and an inability to solve problems .
I was lucky that while he may not have even known about this concept of reasonable adjustments , to him , it was just common sense .
I knew that from the time I left the cancer care unit , I had about four hours before this fog screen would come down and I would start to be sick .
so what should be a manager 's first response when somebody says that they 're sick and they don 't know how it 's going to impact their work ?
they draw pictures of what they 're observing with their eyes , through technology like teles@@ cop@@ es and micro@@ sc@@ opes , and also what they 're thinking about in their minds .
it 's these two str@@ ands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can 't go into right now .
but in each one of your cells , each str@@ and of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nan@@ ometers long .
it 's involved with the growing of the micro@@ tu@@ b@@ ules , and it 's able to transi@@ ently couple onto them .
people in the community need to be able to get from one place to another as quickly as possible .
but this is the kind of community I was thinking of -- a lun@@ ar community It had all of the same needs as a community on Earth would have , but it had some very unique constraints .
and solar power had a real problem : the Moon orb@@ its the Earth once a month .
some water @@@ -@@ @ cooled reactors run at over 70 atmos@@ p@@ heres of pressure , and others have to run at as much as 150 atmos@@ p@@ heres of pressure .
the reactors we have today use uranium oxide as a fuel .
it 's a ceramic material similar in performance to the ceramics we use to make coffee cups or cook@@ ware or the bric@@ ks we use to line fire@@ places .
but then I learned about thor@@ ium , and the story got even better .
do we have enough thor@@ ium ?
and thor@@ ium is not a rare substance , either .
there are many sites like this one in I@@ da@@ ho , where an area the size of a football field would produce enough thor@@ ium each year to power the entire world .
after every criminal and societal sanction that we can come up with , people still use drugs , and far too many die .
many people who were reliant on a steady supply of prescription drugs turned to heroin .
lots of people using drugs , high crime rates and an over@@ dose epidemic .
over@@ doses are un@@ common .
this year even more people will get caught up in the illegal drug trade .
logical , but not necessarily true .
why is this ?
where is the infrastructure that creates a space for them so that they can collaborate with other great musicians ?
it 's like we need some mel@@ odic Vi@@ ag@@ ra in our culture , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
these people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued -- they 've argued that believing in God is ak@@ in to believing in fai@@ ries and essentially that the whole thing is a chil@@ dish game .
I think there is an alternative .
in there , we 'll find a lot of the tru@@ ths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
I 'm an independent , individual person . "
well a ser@@ mon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
" give us the new , " we 're always saying .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
what is a calendar ?
and the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
they don 't just deliver us ser@@ mons on this .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul @@@ -@@ @ like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
they 're po@@ ets , they 're philosoph@@ ers , they 're photographers , they 're fil@@ m@@ makers .
and they don 't really change much .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
they 're selling us shoes and cars .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therap@@ ists , the po@@ ets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
and that 's what religions do .
that 's something we can learn from .
if you 're in the art world , look at the example of what religions are doing with art .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
there 's so much we can absorb .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
we 're losing them .
if I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
so he designed a different kind of son@@ ar ping , one that looks random .
John Co@@ st@@ as is the inven@@ tor of these patterns .
so what do these patterns look like again ?
it 's generated by repeatedly multipl@@ ying by the number three : 1 , 3 , 9 , 27 , 81 , 243 ...
let 's think about one of the most beautiful pieces ever written , Be@@ eth@@ oven 's Fifth Sym@@ phony and the famous " da na na na ! " moti@@ f .
( la@@ ughter ) So without further ado , Michael L@@ inv@@ ille , the [ Dean ] of Chamber Music at the New World Sym@@ phony , will perform the world premiere of the perfect ping .
we have a bun@@ ch of engineers , but none of them could please this client .
yes , our workforce needs specialized skill , but that skill requires a far less rigorous and formalized education than it did in the past .
they teach us how to think critically .
green . the product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means .
the first metric is : is it sustainable ?
ninety @@@ -@@ @ seven percent of the world 's water is sal@@ tw@@ ater .
one is a closed photo@@ bi@@ ore@@ actor that you see here , and what you see on the other side is our species - we are currently using a species called S@@ cen@@ ed@@ es@@ mus di@@ morph@@ us .
now the problems with closed photo@@ bi@@ ore@@ actors are : they are quite expensive , they are automated , and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale .
we actually have a solution for that .
there is a draw@@ back to algae , however : it 's very expensive .
and the answer is : yes .
what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world , where there 's barre@@ n desert .
if you are a farmer , you need five things to be successful : you need seeds , you need soil , you need water and you need sun , and the last thing that you need is fertilizer .
most people use chemical fertilizers . but guess what ?
freshwater Mol@@ lies : cheap , they love to make babies , and they love to go to the bathroom .
well , we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab .
here 's the plant species . Sal@@ ic@@ or@@ nia vir@@ g@@ in@@ ica .
next , when a hurricane decim@@ ated the Del@@ aware Bay - so@@ y@@ bean fields gone - we came up with an idea : can you have a plant that has a land re@@ clamation positive in Del@@ aware ? and the answer is yes .
how about this : in sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan Africa , next to the sea , sal@@ tw@@ ater , barre@@ n desert , how about we take that plant , plant it , half use for food , half use for fuel .
we can make that happen , in@@ expen@@ sively .
I say , " I 'm ok@@ ay with that , ' cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thin@@ kers , which is significant . "
so , in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food , fuel and water .
because , you might ask , how do we find the real you , how do you know what the real you is ?
and that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves , something that 's the same throughout life .
you are the individuals you are , and you have this kind of core .
which is there is@@ n 't actually a " you " at the heart of all these experiences .
we do things because of other things .
and so really , there are all these things , like beliefs , desires , sens@@ ations , experiences , they 're all related to each other , and that just is you .
we understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch , you put them together , and you create a watch .
but inte@@ res@@ tingly , it 's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuro@@ science .
but it 's true that neuro@@ science shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together . "
there are lots of different processes in the brain , all of which operate , in a way , quite independently .
you might think that if it 's true , that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self , no permanent essence , does that mean that really , the self is an illusion ?
but I don 't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it .
the watch is@@ n 't an illusion , because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts .
let 's take something like a water@@ fall .
these are the I@@ gu@@ az@@ u F@@ alls , in Argentina .
for one thing , it 's always changing .
of course the water that flows through the water@@ fall is different every single instance .
if you watch the X @@@ -@@ @ Fac@@ tor too much , you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be .
I 've heard some fantastic musicians this morning , and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them .
the true self , as it were then , is not something that is just there for you to discover , you don 't sort of look into your soul and find your true self , What you are partly doing , at least , is actually creating your true self .
and it seems to me that we have actually two kinds of capitalism .
you can buy a machine today for about $ 300 that you can create yourself , which is quite incredible .
and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't wait to trip the mind fantastic .
is this an envelope we 're living inside of , or no , does it go onto in@@ fin@@ ity in both time and space ?
and when I jumped into that water , I y@@ elled in my mother 's French , " C@@ oura@@ ge ! "
I knew there were Portuguese men o ' war , all kinds of moon j@@ el@@ lies , all kinds of things , but the box j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters .
I don 't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
and he is c@@ rying and he 's y@@ elling to my trainer who 's trying to help me .
and at 41 hours , this body cou@@ ld@@ n 't make it .
we 've got Ben@@ ad@@ ry@@ l on board . if I get st@@ ung , I 'll just gr@@ in and bear it .
you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this . "
so now what do I do ?
he had a potentially life @@@ -@@ @ threatening condition called ep@@ ig@@ lot@@ ti@@ tis .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
I understand this tim@@ eless dic@@ tum as a statement about the problems , or more exactly , the con@@ fu@@ sions , of consciousness .
this fasc@@ ination led me to subm@@ erge myself in art , study neuro@@ science , and later , to become a psycho@@ therap@@ ist .
I mean , it 's self @@@ -@@ @ awareness that separ@@ ates Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens from earlier instances of our mankind .
so my question to you is , can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape ?
this is actually a bra@@ in@@ wave sensor that 's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk .
we created the responsive room where the lights , music and blin@@ ds adjusted to your state .
imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight .
so these stories together became the Her@@ ald Tri@@ b@@ une business cover .
because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women .
in South Korea and Indonesia , women own nearly half a million firms .
and that 's just to start .
now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
thank you very much .
and then you decided that green pair of p@@ ants looks pretty good too - click !
and two days later , this package shows up on your door@@ step .
so let me tell you where I first bum@@ ped into this problem .
I was out in the Bay area in ' 99 , 2000 , the do@@ t com boom .
I worked for a fab@@ ulously spectacular flame @@@ -@@ @ out called Web@@ van .
and it really came down to the fact that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do it cost effectively .
and that 's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home .
so long story short , during my one year at Web@@ van , what I realized by talking to all the material @@@ -@@ @ handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking .
so we said , there 's just got to be a better way to do this .
so how did I arrive at this notion ?
well , actually it came from a bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming exercise , probably a technique that many of you use , It 's this notion of testing your ideas .
take a blank sheet , of course , but then test your ideas at the limits - in@@ fin@@ ity , zero .
and say , labor is cheap , land is cheap .
diet Co@@ ke walks up to the front - pick it , put it in the to@@ te , away it goes . "
( la@@ ughter ) So we said mobile shel@@ ving - We 'll put them on mobile shel@@ ving .
and so we got underway on that and then I 'm sitting on my cou@@ ch in 2008 .
others work through the instrument of money .
the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world .
in other words , a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control .
war is simply no longer the best option , and that is why violence has decreased .
to understand how T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Fi@@ elds work , we first need to understand what are electric fields .
we 're , of course , all stuck in the Earth 's gra@@ vit@@ ational field right now .
10 years ago , Dr. Pal@@ ti founded a company called Nov@@ oc@@ ure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
so these are patients who had received surgery , high dose radiation to the head and first @@@ -@@ @ line chem@@ otherapy , and that had failed and their tum@@ ors had grown back .
we divided the patients into two groups .
and then the second group received only T@@ um@@ or Tre@@ ating Field therapy .
so I 'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial .
he won the gold medal in Moscow in the 4,000 meter pursuit .
he received the standard treatments .
it 's still there .
she was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago .
she underwent four different regimes of chem@@ otherapy over two years , none of which had an effect .
thank you .
and on one side of the bun@@ k bed , I had put out all of my G.@@ I. Jo@@ e soldiers and weaponry .
so I did the only thing my fran@@ tic seven year @@@ -@@ @ old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
the first thing I want to do is start with a graph .
and we know that 's a measurement error because it 's m@@ essing up my data .
but normal is merely average .
even in a classroom full of people s@@ mar@@ ter than you , I felt you 'd be happy just to be in that classroom .
Thursday night is illicit drug use .
and into the silence , I said , " I 'd be happy to speak at your school , but that 's not a wellness week , that 's a sickness week .
the absence of disease is not health .
and I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success , which is this : if I work harder , I 'll be more successful .
and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and back@@ wards for two reasons .
we 've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive .
in just a two @@@ -@@ @ minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually re@@ wire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimis@@ tically and more successfully .
she was able to an@@ esthe@@ tize her quickly , and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation .
my colleague , Dr. Paul F@@ ent@@ on , was living this reality .
essentially , to deliver an@@ esthe@@ sia , you want as pure oxygen as possible , because eventually you 're going to dil@@ ute it , essentially , with the gas .
I sh@@ ud@@ der to say simple ; it 's straightforward .
it 's also designed for the environment that it will be used in .
it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts .
this machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier .
so we 're thr@@ illed .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
so I 've talked a lot about an@@ esthe@@ sia , and I tend to do that .
who gets safe surgery and who do@@ es@@ n 't ?
if you could bring up the lights higher , because I 'm just going to use a piece of paper here .
and there 's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self @@@ -@@ @ feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
what 's that new state that the world is heading toward ?
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ dless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
so now we 've spe@@ eded up the time scales once again .
and I think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
and I say , " Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
and now let 's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
and let 's reproduce them by a process of re@@ combination analogous to sex . "
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their sub@@ routin@@ es , and the children inherit the traits of the sub@@ routin@@ es of the two programs .
so I 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
but they do the job .
and in fact , I know , I 'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
( la@@ ughter ) I was riding in a 7@@ 47 with Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , " Oh look . look at this .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don 't quite understand the options of it .
so , fool@@ ish@@ ly or otherwise , I decided to build my own home .
no other major assembly in our lives is constructed like this .
your car do@@ es@@ n 't come to you in pieces with an extra 10 percent just in case , to be assembled at the mercy of the elements .
in fact , truly sustainable housing should be available to everyone and affordable for all .
but something was still bu@@ gging me , something was still keeping me up at night .
wrap your head around that number .
we could usher in an entirely new empowered experience of special needs or aged @@@ -@@ @ care accommodation .
now , in the span of less than an hour , I was understood both as a " si@@ r " and as a " ma '@@ am . "
more specifically , I identify as gen@@ der@@ que@@ er .
trust me , the discomfort can range from minor anno@@ y@@ ance to feeling physically unsafe .
like the time at a bar in college when a b@@ oun@@ cer physically removed me by the back of the neck and threw me out of a woman 's rest@@ room .
but for me , authenticity do@@ es@@ n 't mean " comfortable . "
but for me , the possibility is what this child , who will grow to be a teen@@ ager and then a real @@@ -@@ @ life adult , will call me for the rest of our lives , was both extremely sc@@ ary and exciting .
and I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called " m@@ ama " or something like it did@@ n 't feel like me at all .
and no matter how many times or versions of " mom " I tried , it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable .
so I tried other words .
it felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in .
now one of the most common things that happens when people meet us is for people to " mom " me .
( la@@ ughter ) So , option one is to ignore the assumption and allow fol@@ ks to continue to refer to me as " mom , " which is not aw@@ k@@ ward for the other party , but is typically really aw@@ k@@ ward for us .
and move on .
or say things like , " How can she be a father ?
only men can be d@@ ads . "
and I 'll say that over time , my ability to navigate this complicated map has gotten easier .
so I weigh the costs against the risks and sometimes the safety of my family comes before my own authenticity .
but despite this risk , I know as El@@ li@@ ot gets older and grows into her consciousness and language skills , if I don 't correct people , she will .
the techn@@ ician saw a vul@@ va and sl@@ apped the words " It 's a girl " on the screen and gave us a copy and sent us on our way .
but this situation , this a@@ version to a bag full of pink stuff , forced me to explore my rejection of highly femin@@ ized things in my child 's world .
so , rather than ton@@ ing down or eliminating femin@@ inity in our lives , we make a concerted effort to celebrate it .
I had to choose option two .
I had to engage with some of my most uncomfortable parts to move towards my most authentic self .
I 've always struggled with the parts of my body that can be defined as more femin@@ ine -- my chest , my hips , my voice .
so I talk about it more , I explore the depths of this discomfort and find language that I feel comfortable with .
I 'm working against limiting myself .
I want her to see my journey towards authenticity even when it means showing her the m@@ essi@@ er parts .
and about a year later , Sarah switched shifts and we started working with a new nurse -- we 'll call her Bec@@ ky .
Sarah 's warm and bub@@ bly and said hi to El@@ li@@ ot and me and my wife and when talking to El@@ li@@ ot said something like , " Is your d@@ add@@ y holding your to@@ y ? "
and as the conversation shifted to our pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian , I saw Sarah and Bec@@ ky 's interaction continue , and it went something like this .
it would have been easier for Sarah .
and this is the poster .
and every tick mark here is when he made them cla@@ p .
and this is the shape of the " I Have a Dre@@ am " speech .
if you can think of a better system , keep your hands down .
we need to use it as a means , not as an end .
they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding , for example .
in fact , he was probably six inches t@@ all@@ er than me , and she was about this tall .
we are changing our culture from within , but at the same time we are re@@ connecting with our traditions .
and yes , Qatar wants to be a modern nation .
it 's important for us to grow organ@@ ically .
and for us young people , they 're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves .
which is why I prefer the Richard Wil@@ k analogy of globalizing the local and loc@@ alizing the global .
in a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the bur@@ ger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others ?
I 'm not sure of how many of you in Washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and , the more recent , Museum of Islamic Art opened in Qatar in 2008 .
no , I don 't think so .
we 're here , we 're part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them .
art becomes a very important part of our national identity .
she lives in New York City , but she do@@ es@@ n 't try to be a Western artist .
our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
we will open the museum in a few days , and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Air@@ ways and come and join us .
and I think with time , in the years to come we 'll be learning a lot about our Pic@@ asso@@ s , our Leg@@ ers and our Ce@@ z@@ ann@@ es .
we do have artists , but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet .
it 's important for two things .
te@@ aming is team@@ work on the fly .
but increasingly for a lot of the work we do today , we don 't have that option .
of course , in te@@ aming , the stakes are@@ n 't always life and death .
and I would argue that it 's especially needed for work that 's complex and unpredictable and for solving big problems .
so we 're reaching out to team across big te@@ aming , grand @@@ -@@ @ scale te@@ aming .
OK . five years into the project , not a whole lot had happened .
( la@@ ughter ) All right .
well that 's not true , but we 'll get to the go@@ ose in a minute .
so if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ r , a big one , then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one , and a better one .
so it 's real easy to tell them apart .
in North America in the northern pl@@ ains of the United States and the southern pl@@ ains of Alberta and S@@ ask@@ at@@ che@@ wan , there 's this unit of rock called the H@@ ell C@@ ree@@ k For@@ mation that produces the last din@@ osa@@ urs that lived on Earth .
and we want to look at these three first .
but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related .
you can only determine rel@@ at@@ ed@@ ness by looking for similarities .
it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out .
it 's infl@@ ating very fast .
the sp@@ ik@@ es on the back of the Sty@@ g@@ im@@ olo@@ ch are actually resor@@ bing , which means they 're getting smaller as that d@@ ome is getting bigger .
and Tor@@ osa@@ ur@@ us , when we cut into it , has mature bone .
and everybody says , " A T@@ ric@@ er@@ at@@ ops and a Tor@@ osa@@ ur@@ us can 't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one . "
I mean , here 's Ed@@ mon@@ t@@ osa@@ ur@@ us and An@@ ato@@ tit@@ an .
here 's another one .
the bone hi@@ st@@ ology tells us that Ed@@ mon@@ t@@ osa@@ ur@@ us is a juvenile , or at least a sub@@ adult , and the other one is an adult , and we have an on@@ to@@ geny .
and we get rid of An@@ ato@@ tit@@ an .
and the last one is T. Re@@ x .
so we cut into them .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you very much .
we know this because trying to find a place to live is an example of an optimal stopping problem .
they 're in the explore phase of their lives , and some of those things could turn out to be delicious .
at the other end of the spectrum , the old guy who always goes to the same restaurant and always e@@ ats the same thing is@@ n 't b@@ oring -- he 's optimal .
they 've tried things like choosing something at random or applying what 's called the " first @@@ -@@ @ in , first @@@ -@@ @ out principle , " which means removing the item which has been in the memory for the longest .
and each time he accessed a document , he 'd take it out , consult it and put it back in on the left @@@ -@@ @ hand side .
when computers face hard problems , they deal with them by making them into simpler problems -- by making use of random@@ ness , by removing constraints or by allowing approxim@@ ations .
because , of course , it 's not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
and I see the same process with combining photographs .
but combined , they can create something like this .
also , I have various family members , such as my grand@@ father and great uncle , who fought in World War II .
the bell had run@@ g , and I was seated at my desk , when one of my students , who is deaf , approached me and said that he 'd like to join the military .
now , the second thing that happened , my friend had just moved to Israel .
RO@@ TC , which stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps , allows students working on their college maj@@ ors to concurrently participate in the RO@@ TC program .
I fig@@ ured I better stand in the second line , so I could watch what the cade@@ ts were doing in the row ahead of me .
but once they learned more about me and what I 'm capable of doing , there 's been tremendous support and unity .
plus , he do@@ es@@ n 't view me as a deaf person .
he 's a really sharp soldier .
he 's a veteran , having served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
he just kind of held the l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop out like this . "
it is our light and not our darkness that frigh@@ tens us . "
and not only do these genetic males mate with other males , they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they 're genetic males .
for those of you who don 't know , we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
and I have to take a little bit of artistic license .
we are in effect polluting our children .
and perhaps it 's the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it 's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area .
it 's also the most primitive - all other mou@@ th@@ parts are thought to have started out looking like this one before evolving into something different .
they stal@@ k bl@@ iss@@ ful couples and study their every move and man@@ ner@@ ism .

and it 's not just successfully star@@ ring in films that 's dangerous .
we produce hap@@ pier , more stable and more successful kids .

and from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity , some perspective on it , I realized this seems a little bit dangerous .
it short @@@ -@@ @ circuits the brain , and we 're starting to find it has actual cognitive consequences , one of them being this sort of pervasive background h@@ um of anxiety .

some of you might disagree , some of you might have sca@@ thing but accurate criti@@ ques of me and my points , and of course , I welcome all negative feedback .
and like anyone , my views on many things have changed , and hopefully mat@@ ured , like my potential career choice .
and sometimes I had to be brave , and it was@@ n 't always easy .
back fat , I see you pop@@ ping over my bra today , but that 's al@@ right .
and that 's OK .
so basically what I 'm saying is that the majority of this room right now is considered plus size .
and it starts with becoming your own role model .
for girls who struggle to look inside the mirror and say , I love you .

and then they 'd to@@ w the shar@@ ks back to Pur@@ teen Harb@@ our , bo@@ il them up , use the oil .
it 's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience bas@@ king shar@@ ks .
one , it 's to try and work out the gender of the shar@@ k .
nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened .
we thought bas@@ king shar@@ ks were temper@@ ate animals and lived in our l@@ ati@@ tudes , but in actual fact , they 're obviously crossing the equ@@ ator as well .
so it does seem to be that bas@@ king shar@@ ks , for some reason , have incredibly low diversity .
so Les did a fin@@ er study , and he found out it came out about 9,000 .
the problem with this is they were constrained with samples .
and some are caught in nets , in tra@@ w@@ ls .
so when I saw the black s@@ lim@@ e on the bow of the boat , I thought , " If you take what you 're given in this world ... "
and he was like , " Y@@ ea@@ h , ye@@ ah . later . "
so as a field bi@@ ologist , you just want to get encounters with these animals , and learn as much as you can .
Government institutions were completely dec@@ ap@@ itated , including the presidential palace .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster @@@ -@@ @ hard@@ ened veterans that Haiti was something different .
out of this rub@@ ble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TE@@ RA -- the Tr@@ il@@ og@@ y Emergency Response Application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender @@@ -@@ @ based violence .
we have just published an evaluation of this program , and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable .
and 73 percent of them shared it .
right across the developing world , citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change , positive change , in their own communities .
they are telling their own story , by@@ passing the official narrative .

a transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models .
they 're normally back@@ room or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strateg@@ ists .
we need technological strateg@@ ists in the bo@@ ard@@ room who can ask and answer the question , " What would Amazon or Google do with all of this data ? "
there are no more reasons not to do it .
unfortunately , when I was there , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't find one of them , but you have the ant@@ lers as proof .
now you 've probably heard about the Por@@ cup@@ ine c@@ arib@@ ou her@@ d in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wil@@ d@@ life Refu@@ ge .
and the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before .
so these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines .
in spite of that , people have to live , have to eat this food in order to survive .
the incredibly high price of flying food into these remote Northern aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival .
this is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
you turn it on , light goes everywhere .
now , like I said , I 'm a big fan of technology .
but the actual process of planet @@@ -@@ @ hunting involves a lot of looking at graphs , like the one I 'm showing you here , and an@@ not@@ ating them .

in the world of the Middle East at the moment , the debates are , as you know , shr@@ ill .
and also because that 's where , in terms of our own self @@@ -@@ @ interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
and just like that , you 've been se@@ duc@@ ed into a different way of looking at something because the endor@@ ph@@ ins have brought down your def@@ enses .

what does it have to do with time and savings , this issue of immediate grati@@ fication ?
one percent check the box . the rest do nothing .
we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .
if you think about the problem of ban@@ anas versus choc@@ ol@@ ates , we think we 're going to eat ban@@ anas next week .

if you 're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again .
he died broken by history .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to c@@ rush us , but we endured .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .

one that I 'll highlight here is changing the patient 's name .
I 'm going to show you a few different targets like this , and that 's my talk . so we 'll look at automo@@ bil@@ es .
think about it . when a car receives a radio signal , it 's processed by software .
they actually carried out their attack in real life .
well , you compromise the car by a buffer over@@ flow of vulnerability in the software , something like that .
they vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ ed people on a bus , and then they post @@@ -@@ @ processed the video .
the acceler@@ ometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone .
it 's the Supreme Court , right ?
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
thank you .
in addition to that , it harb@@ ors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth , and much of it we don 't know about .
and so 10 years ago , an international program began called the Census of Marine Life , which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans .
it involved 17 different projects around the world .
it 's from tro@@ phy fish caught off the coast of Florida .
and to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool , because knowing how many fish are there is really critical .
and so from this we 're able to identify these blue highways , these hot spots in the ocean , that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation .
now one of the other things that you may think about is that , when you go to the supermarket and you buy things , they 're scanned .
the Ocean Bio@@ geographic Information System is the database for all the census data .
what I 've plo@@ tted up here is the data that we have on hand .
well , I could stand here for hours , but , of course , I 'm not allowed to do that .
and that 's why biodiversity data can be so valuable .
one of the things that we 're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
we 've got about 75 percent of the fish , maybe as much as 90 percent .
the other point I 'd like to make about this is that this ocean 's interconnected .
so whether you 're a y@@ ak her@@ der living in the mountains of Chile , whether you 're a stock@@ broker in New York City or whether you 're a TE@@ D@@ ster living in Edinburgh , the oceans matter .
and as the oceans go so shall we .
that would be a rigorous , powerful scientific inquiry into the effects of these environmental exposures .

how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Mid@@ west for example ?
the eminent scientists of the Global Foot@@ print Network , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 Ear@@ ths to sustain this economy .

as you can see in this figure @@@ -@@ @ eight flight , they come within inches of each other .
now I think at this point it 's important for me to say that I actually love ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
this is no surprise , though , if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always fav@@ ored the man of action over the " man " of contempl@@ ation .
and instead of working alongside people they 've known all their lives , now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of str@@ angers .
and sure enough , the self @@@ -@@ @ help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like " How to Win Friends and In@@ flu@@ ence People . "
and they feature as their role models really great sal@@ es@@ men .
they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part .
all right , let 's get ready for the worst TED Talk ever .
and we began making food that people could recognize , not things that come from a far@@ away place in plastic bags that you open and you CA@@ N@@ NOT even smell .
simple : by calling and paying and getting .
I went to FE@@ MA . they kicked me out with eight ar@@ mo@@ red guards and AK @@@ -@@ @ 47@@ s .
and we began going to the deeper areas , places that all of a sudden , the bridges were broken , but we had to go , because it was easy to stay in San Juan .
we brought the first water purification system to the island of Vi@@ equ@@ es , where we could be filtering one gall@@ on per minute .
we began trying to be sending the message : we need to start moving away from the places that are already stabilized and keep concentrating in the areas that really need help .
( la@@ ughter ) DT : the public loves you .
JosÃ© Andr@@ Ã©s : this is great . this is how good my talk was .
( la@@ ughter ) N@@ M : so tell us why , what were some of the challenges , and then when you noticed , they started coming to you to ask you .
salvation Army came and asked me for 420 meals on a Wednesday rainy night for a local elderly shop .
I love to help the Sal@@ vation Army , but in my world , they are the ones who are supposed to be helping us to answer those calls of help .
Thursday morning is when I wake up super worried that actually we did@@ n 't have the plan to feed the island .
that 's where we began cooking .
so we went to a town called Mor@@ ov@@ is .
we dropped the sand@@ w@@ ich@@ es .
we arrived with the 120 chick@@ ens , we dropped the food , and the community were very thank@@ ful , but they told us , " We 're OK , we don 't need more food .
what we did was a flat@@ ter organizational chart where everybody was ow@@ ning the situation and we all made quick decisions to solve the problems on the spot .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
and sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it do@@ es@@ n 't have when it do@@ es@@ n 't .

I had some , your sister had some . have some beer . "
I said , " No , I don 't feel right about that . y '@@ all go ahead . y '@@ all go ahead . "
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
and I go to the jail and I see my client who 's 13 and 14 , and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult .
and I finally decided , oh g@@ os@@ h , I 've got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
for example , here in California we 're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don 't result in arrest .

this imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
a war@@ mer ocean releases CO2 , just as a warm C@@ oca @@@ -@@ @ Col@@ a does .
what sea level rise can we look forward to ?
the last time CO2 was 390 ppm , today 's value , sea level was higher by at least 15 meters , 50 feet .
in recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .

this first project is a holiday card I made for my friends .
my goal in this was to get people to notice this going @@@ -@@ @ through @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ motions holiday thing that I 'm sure we 've all felt before .
and I did that through a holiday card , of course .
( la@@ ughter ) This card is literally a four @@@ -@@ @ frame documentary about receiving the card .
( la@@ ughter ) So it 's a recur@@ sive experience .
this next project I want to show you is a wedding invitation , which is a format practically beg@@ ging for rein@@ vention .
far more awesome , in fact , than the format of wedding invitations .
I remember seeing this as a k@@ id , and it totally ble@@ w my mind .
so I began spending an in@@ ordinate amount of time thinking about need@@ les : like , would we find need@@ les with the right f@@ idel@@ ity ?
( la@@ ughter ) So we did it , we really did it !
and then it se@@ gues into the real song for comparison .
( music and singing ) ( Music ends ) We were so excited when we finally got that to work .
we have assumptions about material experience , like that paper should be silent or that websites should be flat .

this is something we actually did do in the fall of 2008 , in a project that was conceptu@@ alized by artist Ste@@ ve Lam@@ bert , organized by The Yes Men and executed by many , many people , some of whom are me .

( la@@ ughter ) But he really list@@ ens -- because that 's all we need -- I 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work .
very quickly , some research by Ma@@ hal@@ ik at Boston College .
and there is a certain very quiet value in that , we like to believe .

the electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago .
( appl@@ ause ) Now let 's get started .
( la@@ ughter ) Un@@ til Vol@@ ta , nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use .
this is the starting point for designing a battery -- two electro@@ des , in this case metals of different composition , and an electro@@ ly@@ te , in this case salt dissolved in water .
admittedly , I 've left out a few details .
so let 's abandon the paradigm of let 's search for the cool@@ est chemistry and then hopefully we 'll ch@@ ase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product .
in fact , I looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity , but instead con@@ sumes electricity , huge amounts of it .
and just a few short years following their discovery , aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material .
it 's about 50 feet wide and re@@ cedes about half a mile -- row after row of cells that , inside , resem@@ ble Vol@@ ta 's battery , with three important differences .
so today at L@@ M@@ BC , we 're building cells 16 inches in diameter with a capacity of one kil@@ ow@@ att @@@ -@@ @ hour -- 1,000 times the capacity of that initial sh@@ ot@@ glass cell .
and then we 've got a four kil@@ ow@@ att @@@ -@@ @ hour cell on the horizon .
temperature : conventional wisdom says set it low , at or near room temperature , and then install a control system to keep it there .
today , we don 't talk about flying trans@@ onically , or even su@@ person@@ ically , we talk about flying hy@@ person@@ ically -- not M@@ ach 2 or M@@ ach 3 , M@@ ach 20 .

Leg@@ o has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
like the concrete block , the transi@@ stor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
I personally don 't accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so I decided to change that .
let me show you how they work .
and the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
the nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don 't learn at schools .

and the European elections , the last European elections , we became the largest party and the most co@@ ve@@ ted youth demographic , sub @@@ -@@ @ 30 .
and what 's interesting is we did that on less than one percent of the competition 's budget .
and I 'm g@@ onn@@ a share the secret recipe of how we did that .
and they can be applied to any business or social cause .
but applying these -- and we 've done this dozens of times , we know that this works .

and there 's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival .
how do we feed the world without destroying it ?
we transformed our apartments into our laboratories , and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way .
ye@@ ah , suc@@ ka , put the scholarships in the bag , ye@@ ah , ye@@ ah .
Oh , you thought I was playing .
there is no other way .
Post@@ Secret@@ .com is the most visited advertisement @@@ -@@ @ free blog in the world .
right . you know what I 'm saying .
and he said , " Frank , I 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . "
secrets can take many forms .
I was born in D@@ en Bos@@ ch , where the pa@@ inter Hi@@ er@@ onym@@ us Bos@@ ch named himself after .
and I 've always been very f@@ ond of this pa@@ inter who lived and worked in the 15th century .
this is me at an early age with a baby ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee .
so I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
this is a very old video from the Yer@@ kes Pri@@ mate Center , where they trained ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es to cooperate .
it 's already a big advance over many other animals who w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be able to do that .
( la@@ ughter ) This was the cooperation and reciprocity part .
in humans , of course , we can study that with ya@@ wn contag@@ ion .
and we study that in our ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es by presenting them with an animated head .
so that 's what you see on the upper @@@ -@@ @ left , an animated head that y@@ aw@@ ns .
and that 's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that under@@ lies em@@ pa@@ thy , and that is universal in the mammals , basically .
and consol@@ ation behavior -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) it 's em@@ pa@@ thy driven .
one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts sp@@ itting water and intim@@ idating them -- then the choices go down .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's as if they 're saying , " If you 're not be@@ having , I 'm not going to be pro @@@ -@@ @ social today . "
so what we did is we put two Cap@@ u@@ chin mon@@ keys side @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ side .
the one on the left is the mon@@ key who gets c@@ uc@@ umber .
the one on the right is the one who gets grapes .
and so one phil@@ os@@ op@@ her even wrote us that it was impossible that mon@@ keys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the French Revolution .
this year , if you think about it , over a billion couples will have sex with one another .
here in Germany , the proportion of people that use contraception is about 66 percent .
Thailand , 64 percent .
they get it in their arm -- and they go about four times a year , they have to get it every three months -- to get their injection .
it 's stoc@@ ked out 150 days out of the year .
and when our el@@ dest daughter was born , we we@@ ren 't , I would say , exactly sure how to be great parents .
and so we waited a little while before we had our second child .
I want them to feel the way I did -- like they can do anything they want to do in life .
people who spoke the same language made that change as a group .
in Germany , this transition started in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , and it took just 50 years for family size to stabilize in this country .
and in Asia and Latin America , the transition started in the 1960s , and it happened much faster because of modern contraception .
I think , as we go through this history , it 's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue .
and so what did they do ?
empowering parents -- it do@@ es@@ n 't need justification .
she was incredibly optimistic about her family 's future .
the families were also we@@ alth@@ ier .
I hope that they 'll be very proud of me for living out what they taught us about social justice and service .
and I thought it was just an amazing day .
the surgery on offer was pretty g@@ ru@@ es@@ ome .
the thought of the war@@ far@@ in was really quite frigh@@ tening .
so I set out to change the entire treatment for a@@ or@@ tic dil@@ ation .
it then comes back into a round form , and then tap@@ ers and curves off .
everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not .
so many people in the medical world don 't want to change .
this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bi@@ onic human .
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe .
in 2010 , two workers per reti@@ ree in the U.S.
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
there are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost lim@@ bs .
it 's a natural process , but it is lost as we age .
the horse just has another no@@ stri@@ l that 's developed because of a riding accident .
could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio @@@ -@@ @ degra@@ dable material on there ?
and it became a question of , how do we all get good at what we 're trying to do ?
and what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than I had understood .
thank you .
because of this , all three brothers and their families had to vac@@ ate their home .
yet , these men remain dead .
but sometimes when his female patients can 't afford his services , their families give the women to J@@ ura in exchange for medical treatment .
many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival , and high rates of suicide are recorded .
and every time we p@@ aged them , we 'd ask them to answer several questions -- " On a one to seven scale , how happy are you right now ? "
we might spend time with people we don 't even like because it 's somehow interesting .
m@@ um@@ mies are a great source of information , except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
( la@@ ughter ) So to address this problem , I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland , Denmark and the U.@@ K.
but there 's a little secret .
are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
so I want to talk today about money and happiness , which are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about , either trying to earn them or trying to increase them .
anyone beg@@ ging for money or trying to extor@@ t from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else . "
what did they spend it on ?
the answer is much bigger .
that is almost equal to the number of people in the Earth .
you don 't have to di@@ g deep down underground .
but moving to our fourth commandment , I really w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be here tonight .
now it 's 11 : 00 pm in Rio .
we are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city .
to do that I 'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to HIV .
but that actually do@@ es@@ n 't mean at all that if we gave people more exports , more trade , that that would increase prevalence .
but I just started again an hour ago . "
people go one , two , three , four , tear .
so you can look at this , and maybe you 've even seen things like this .
and I said , " Hon@@ ey , no , they don 't want to go .
" but what if I saw them ? cou@@ ld@@ n 't we stay together ? "
and so , we made this game , and she got it .
I don 't think the New World felt too new worl@@ dly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships .
I 'd been making games for 20 @@@ -@@ @ some years , and then I decided to do it again .
so this is a game called " S@@ Ã­@@ och@@ Ã¡n le@@ at . " it 's " peace be with you . "
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics , and if you 're going to cover a difficult topic , this is one you need to cover , and I 'll let you figure out what that 's about on your own .
and I also made a game about the Tra@@ il of Te@@ ars .
it 's an expression of beauty , it 's how they say they love you .
and so to me , this beautiful culture , this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games .
we conven@@ tionally divide space into private and public real@@ ms , and we know these legal distinctions very well because we 've become experts at protecting our private property and private space .
what translates generic public space into qualitative space ?
the M@@ all is the greatest civic stage in this country for dis@@ sent .

last year , Vol@@ k@@ sw@@ agen announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gall@@ on .
that is , they can dis@@ connect frac@@ tally and then re@@ connect seam@@ lessly .
let me show you one more .
now let me stop here .
I look at this picture and it f@@ rea@@ ks me out .
I can tell you , there is@@ n 't a person in this room that would sit idly by .
I think that 's true , actually .
all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or val@@ eted .
so I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
I got about 3,000 emails .
so what I you to take away from my talk , the lesson of all of this , is to just be Ste@@ vie Nic@@ ks .
migrants can share perspectives , if only politicians would be willing to listen .
I fled Uganda to come to the United States in the hope of sustaining a voice for my brothers and sisters who experience a more serious plight as migrants .
we see , " I just feel like I 'm not going to have fun if it 's not the both of us . " that was from someone in Michigan .
the next movement is called mo@@ bs .
and we see that women are slightly more prolif@@ ic talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men .
we see that the world is feeling " used " at 3.3 times the normal level right now .
we see " better " is the most frequent feeling , followed by " bad . "
you can see the little pink cursor moving along , representing our position .
for instance , you could find women who feel " addic@@ ted " in their 20@@ s when it was clou@@ dy in Bangladesh .
( la@@ ughter ) " I love how I feel today . "
another technique is directly questioning people .
you can si@@ ft through this data and see what people have submitted .
nobody 's seen this yet , publicly .
and for him , it was@@ n 't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you .
and in classical music we can follow these changes very , very accurately because of the music 's powerful silent partner , the way it 's been passed on : no@@ tation .
in 200 B.@@ C. , a man named Se@@ kul@@ os wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gra@@ vest@@ one in the not@@ ational system of the Greeks .
and you can see how this happened in these excer@@ pts from the Christmas mass " Pu@@ er Nat@@ us est N@@ ob@@ is , " " For Us is Bor@@ n . "
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pin@@ point the pitch 's location .
Moz@@ art was the same way .
and by the 14@@ 00@@ s , music was being written that tried to mirror God 's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
Ah , bal@@ eful stars !
but what 's the actual difference between these two ch@@ ords ?
it 's just these two notes in the middle .
turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .
now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
this is when those big forms arose -- the sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , the son@@ at@@ as , the concer@@ tos .
now this moment so fascin@@ ates me .
what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance ?
is it a mel@@ ody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude ?
it 's the passing on part . it 's the ' why ' part of it .
the culture in which we live now is aw@@ ash with music of impro@@ vis@@ ation that 's been s@@ lic@@ ed , dic@@ ed , la@@ ye@@ red and , God knows , distributed and sold .
what 's the long @@@ -@@ @ term effect of this on us or on music ?
the question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
( music ) And he said , " Yes , yes . I was a little boy .
the sym@@ phony : Isaac S@@ tern , the concer@@ to , I heard it . "
you don 't need to worry about knowing anything .
follow traces . get lost . be surprised , am@@ used inspired .
I love my food .
and as a result of that , I grew up with books everywhere around the house .
and two of the things about Beng@@ al : they like their sav@@ ory dishes and they like their swee@@ ts .
( la@@ ughter ) And then life was fine , dan@@ dy .
Oh , some of you have seen it .
and as it ran , this thing was saying , " Give me input . give me input . "
energy came to it in some form or shape , data came to it in some form or shape .
and as I went to research that even further , I got to a point where I discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis .
that actually for a given body mass of a pri@@ mate the metabol@@ ic rate was static .
and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and dig@@ estive tissue .
when I moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
do you go to a restaurant ?
and by this time I was ho@@ oked .
and this is about 23 years into this process .
are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it ?
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
but technology alone is@@ n 't enough .
( la@@ ughter ) They are competing in a naked bicycle race , and they are headed straight for your front door .
it 's a talking horse .
back in the 1980s , actually , I gave my first talk at TED , and I brought some of the very , very first public demonstrations of virtual reality ever to the TED stage .
and you say , " He@@ y , could you bring the sk@@ im milk ? "
this is an error page , but what if this error page was also an opportunity ?
that 's the kind of out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ box science that I love doing ...
and what 's interesting about this is that Be@@ eth@@ oven was actually s@@ mar@@ ter than Bill G@@ ates .
so he plays the concer@@ to on the piano . it 's great .
everything you know about Be@@ eth@@ oven -- basically wrong .
the very first thing that happens is : it re@@ defines the product .
so the product becomes sheet music , becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home .
every time this happens , we take away some social interaction .
with each of these disruptions , it changes the amount of social interaction .
but there 's also less choice , because in a global pyramid , you can 't always tell what you want .
there 's one more thing that 's not on the list : piracy .
do you think Ch@@ op@@ in would have been comfor@@ ted by the thought , " He@@ y , 20 percent of the people who buy fake Ch@@ op@@ in are more likely to go buy real Ch@@ op@@ in " ?
so if you 're playing Ch@@ op@@ in , the additions from different countries are different on purpose , because he wanted to be able to track who was a pir@@ ate .
well , you can still sell no@@ vels without books .
and it do@@ es@@ n 't mean that we think things will mag@@ ically turn out ok@@ ay , but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
" I 'm a gen@@ ius , therefore I got an A , therefore I 'll get an A again and again in the future . "
when they failed , it was@@ n 't because they were dum@@ b , but because the exam just happened to be unfair .
he found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a k@@ iss immediately , but to get a k@@ iss in three days .
he was taken to court , where a judge set 500 dollars bail .
it 's time to do something about that .
and so that explains this pattern that we 've seen before .
so these types of examples , today there are just a few of them , but I think in the next decade they will become common@@ place .
now , this little boy here , Pam@@ el@@ o , from Zambia , he has tr@@ ach@@ oma .
the repeated infection will scar your e@@ yel@@ ids so that they contract and they turn inside out .
but of course , that only gives them temporary res@@ p@@ ite , because they just grow back more vicious than before .
" F " stands for " face washing . "
they CA@@ N@@ NOT eliminate tr@@ ach@@ oma unless they get more .
well , we believe that we can eliminate tr@@ ach@@ oma in 12 African countries and across the Americas and all across the Pacific .
and we can make significant progress in two countries which have the highest burden of the disease , which is Ethiopia and Nigeria .
we would be on the home straight to eliminate this disease from the whole world .
it 's no exagg@@ eration to say that this had totally transformed her life .
she could work , she could soci@@ alize .
and she said to me , " I have my life back . "
but there are so many T@@ wi@@ bas .
this is something that we can solve .
at 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface , sunlight is barely a g@@ lim@@ mer .
I was drawn to oce@@ an@@ ography by just this kind of challenge .
the wild thing that happened on that trip is that we discovered what everyone who looked before had completely missed : pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thetic cells smaller than anyone thought possible .
we now know those tiny cells are the most abundant pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ thetic organisms on earth .
this amazing discovery happened because we used new technology to see life in the ocean in a new way .
it 's exceed@@ ingly large , span@@ ning from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean and around the globe .
these animals and their movements help connect the surface and deep ocean in important ways .
the animals are ground into fish meal to support increasing demands for aquaculture and for nu@@ trac@@ eu@@ ticals such as kr@@ ill oil .
this could have irreversible global @@@ -@@ @ scale impacts on marine life and food web@@ s .
we need to get out ahead of fishing impacts and work to understand this critical part of the ocean .
the excitement level about this could not be higher on our team of ocean scientists , engineers and communic@@ ators .
this is the first time we 've shared this publicly .
and on that rocket will be a satellite .
because of the power of information , information from technology that is coming down in price and going up in precision .
methane pollution causes one quarter of the global warming that we 're experiencing right now .
and we talked about sn@@ akes -- I don 't know why -- we talked about sn@@ akes and fear of sn@@ akes as a pho@@ bia .
and that little girl was c@@ rying and was terri@@ fied .
and not only is no one talking about it , but we refuse to acknowledge that the source of this crisis is rooted in the same injustice that first propelled the civil rights movement .
he brought us water , he brought us gran@@ ola , and he brought us tissue .
they make a M@@ idden , a pile of refuse -- mostly the hus@@ ks of the seeds that they eat .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
two eyes at the bottom , optic nerve flowing out from the back .
and if you 're thinking of the brain as a computer , this is the transi@@ stor .
it 's called , " Pro@@ chloro@@ coc@@ cus , " and this is oceans ' oxygen @@@ -@@ @ producing power@@ house and , I might argue , one of the most amazing discoveries of recent marine micro@@ biology .
all of human history has depended on this little micro@@ be for the oxygen they breathe every day , no matter where or when they lived .
but we may be less aware of the connection we have with marine micro@@ bes and the physical dis@@ comfor@@ ts we can feel when those communities change .
as an extreme example : the disease cholera is caused by a bacter@@ ium that thri@@ ves in the ocean .
believe it or not , the picture on your right remains a very popular tourist s@@ nor@@ k@@ eling spot on the island of Mau@@ i , even though it 's lost most of its coral cover over the past decade or so .
we 're looking at a side view of the same coral as before , where the protective layer meets the sea@@ water ; so , sea@@ water on your right , coral on your left .
ec@@ ologists all over the world are used to being able to grab a pair of bin@@ ocul@@ ars and go out and observe what their study creatures do each day .
in doing so , we can learn how they respond to our actions and our behavi@@ ors and the environment around them in ways that will help us better manage our oceans .
it was a little over 100 years ago that Be@@ ij@@ er@@ inc@@ k discovered viruses .
and all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range .
and you need the fourth factor , which perhaps is the most important factor .
and he finally asked , " Can I see those ? "
I was starting to inv@@ ent my own moves and bring them to perfection .
the mur@@ mu@@ r of the city dis@@ sol@@ ves into a squ@@ all whose chilling power I no longer feel .
but then something unexpected happened .
the U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later , and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations .
if we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime , then that is the change we need to spread .
so please , without further ado .
we called it the Tel@@ e @@@ -@@ @ Ac@@ tor .
now , it 's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this .
so we got one of these robots .
first , we use a technique called dynamic time war@@ ping from speech recognition .
( la@@ ughter ) I wish she could meet my d@@ ad .
and she would design these toys , where kids in playing with the toys would come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play .
and I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles .
we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .
but really the goal here was , within about a minute , I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pic@@ torial artist several weeks to create .
so basically , I want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space .
now , over time , this is going to heat up the planet .
so basically , what we 're getting here is the sequ@@ el to " An In@@ convenient Truth , " in about two minutes , and that actually brings up an interesting point about games .
so here 's our little solar system , as we pull away from our mel@@ ted planet here .
let 's fly to another one .
one of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO is a mon@@ ol@@ ith that I can drop down .
I want to be able to play " The Day the Earth St@@ ood S@@ till , " " 2001 : a Space O@@ dys@@ sey , " " Star Tre@@ k , " " War Of the Wor@@ l@@ ds . "
one of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy when I was a k@@ id is how it was always presented so two @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sionally and so static .
so here 's a little black hole that we probably don 't want to get too close to .
you might be a ven@@ ge@@ ful god , con@@ ques@@ ting , because you actually can do that , you can attack other intelligent races .
because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now are the result of short @@@ -@@ @ term thinking , and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 , 100 , or 1,000 years out .
let 's say the productivity of bio@@ fuel plantations is 1,200 lit@@ ers of bio@@ fuel per hec@@ tare per year .
the energy consumption of the United Kingdom , the total energy consumption -- not just transport , but everything -- I like to quantify it in light@@ bul@@ bs .
the population density of the UK is 250 people per square kilome@@ ter .
countries are different from each other .
half of the world 's population lives in countries that are already above that line .
so in an attempt to prepare their men for any future conflicts , they founded the National R@@ if@@ le Association to promote rifle practice .
so instead , I 'm asking you to do your home@@ work , write your own Cho@@ ice D using supporting detail .
and he wanted to do this as a matter of principle .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
and so before we could start imaging Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es , we had to take this book apart .
and this is terri@@ bly important , because the diagrams in the manus@@ cript are the unique source for the diagrams that Arch@@ im@@ ed@@ es drew in the sand in the fourth century B.@@ C.
the thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this .
and this did@@ n 't exist in co@@ dic@@ es A and B.
so Athens and The@@ bes went out to fight Philip of Maced@@ on .
now I should say at this point that normally when you 're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been sc@@ raped off , you don 't find unique texts .
but this is just a further evolution of a journey of uncomfortable learning throughout my life .
as a black student attending predominantly white private schools , I 've encountered attitudes and behavi@@ ors that reflected racial stereotypes .
to prepare myself to engage with controversy in the real world , I joined a group that brought controversial speakers to campus .
for many , it was difficult to see how bringing controversial speakers to campus could be valuable , when they caused harm .
it 's my belief that to achieve progress in the face of ad@@ versity , we need a genuine commitment to gaining a deeper understanding of humanity .
it was really crowded , as it is around the holidays , and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused .
I 'm totally over@@ re@@ acting . "
no .
we try to make sense of non@@ sense , and we sw@@ allow the fu@@ rious feelings .
that fur@@ y that my friend felt holds centuries of never being able to directly address or express our indign@@ ation , our frustration and our rage .
time 's up on women being held responsible for men 's bad behavior .
thank you .
with the Fal@@ con 9 and now the Fal@@ con Heavy , we can launch into orbit any pay@@ load that has previously been conceived or is conceived right now .
I was excited .
GS : that 's not terrible , and you said it , I did@@ n 't .
that 's part of the design principle that you , rather than just inven@@ ting ever bigger rockets , you team them up .
what on earth is this ?
we 're bringing the first stages back , and we 're landing them on federal property on an Air Force base .
so I think doing it , I don 't know , 10 kilometers out from a city , maybe it 's only five kilometers out from a city .
and yet , a long @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ ul aircraft can only make one of those flights a day .
GS : ye@@ ah . so we 've got a video , this is a cro@@ pped video from others we 've shown , and then there 's a couple of new bits to it .
but basically , you 're going to lift off from a pad , you 've got a boo@@ ster as well as the B@@ FS , the Big Fal@@ con Sp@@ ac@@ eship .
it will be within a decade -- not this decade .
fundamentally , it 's another place to explore , and that 's what makes humans different from animals , it 's our sense of exploration and sense of wonder@@ ment and learning something new .
among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice .
if Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law , it could be a model .
evaluating Egypt on this basis alone , however , igno@@ res the real revolution .
where women agree , however , is on their own role , and that it must be central and active .
well , there are some technologies which obviously combine both .
and we can question these values .
this is the Ow@@ ens Valley Radio Observatory behind the Sierra Nev@@ ad@@ as , and in 1968 , I was working there collecting data for my thesis .
now , let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime , and that is , SE@@ TI , I think , is important , because it 's exploration , and it 's not only exploration , it 's comprehensible exploration .
you GO@@ T@@ TA get them with your thum@@ b before they find the sugar or something .
now , look , a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country .
it shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there , we 're looking for them out there , but they 're here , right ?
ok@@ ay ? that had a big effect on me .
so to me , it is a privilege , and when I look in the mirror , the facts are that I really don 't see myself .
for some random reason , I can 't imagine , something about cheer@@ leaders turned up in my in@@ box .
identity is , especially when you 're a teen@@ ager , a fluid thing .
I look pretty good in a suit , frankly , so you can see why it would drive them into an anti @@@ -@@ @ capitalist f@@ ren@@ zy .
but if I have to prove who I am , I 'll never send that message .
the goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don 't need identity , which is actually almost all transactions .
it 's something we can do about .
naturally , in these circumstances , I turn to Doctor Who .
because in this , as in so many other walks of life , Doctor Who has already shown us the answer .
you 're not ner@@ ds if you say yes .
who 's seen Doctor Who 's psych@@ ic paper ?
is that what you 're going to tell us ?
that 's a Japanese ATM , the finger@@ print template is stored inside the mobile phone .
it has to be a utility that you can use everywhere .
the first phones that have the technology built in , the Google N@@ exus , the S@@ 2 , the Samsung W@@ if@@ i 7.9 , the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops .
so it turns out that we have upgraded .
we found another one last month .
so the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens ; the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around .
if these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non @@@ -@@ @ Olympic medal .
and as they pick that , these become bone , and then they pick another road and these become plat@@ ele@@ ts , and these become macro@@ ph@@ ages , and these become T cells .
that turns out to be a big deal because now you can take , not just mouse cells , but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells .
and that 's because we tend to think of sk@@ elet@@ ons as sti@@ ff lever systems that produce speed or power .
what new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology ?
but instead I saw this .
if the wall around the erectile tissue was@@ n 't there , if it was@@ n 't reinforced in this way , the shape would change , but the infl@@ ated penis would not resist bending , and erection simply w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't work .
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
and I 'm about to show you some stop @@@ -@@ @ motion foot@@ age that I made recently where you 'll see bacteria accum@@ ulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour .
and this attracts metals from their local environment .
it is also not a monument to design , it is a monument to design 's utility .
does anyone know ? Ch@@ i ?
you see , babies are born in a state of utter fragility .
and this is not something that happens to humans only .
so we feel sometimes that the brain is determin@@ istic , the brain determines who we 're going to be .
it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born .
there are millions of individuals with au@@ tism all around us .
so I feel that we have a bio@@ ethical imperative .
the science is there .
in fact , we believe there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with au@@ tism , and genetic anom@@ alies , much more than just genes .
and so in the past many years , we 've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking .
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed and their bra@@ ins are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers .
they start over here -- they love people 's eyes -- and it remains quite stable .
and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength : predictable situations , situations that can be defined .
well , thank you for listening to me .
we make up half the population of the world , but we 're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories .

you all have a stake in a strong , vibrant media .

it 's for The Guardi@@ an newspaper .
it 's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist , but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world .
but it 's only when you get the whole picture , you can fully understand what 's going on .
my d@@ ad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
he had a Di@@ x@@ i@@ eland jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover Louis Arm@@ strong tun@@ es .

intent changes the picture completely .
he 's the random state of nature we emerged from .
in fact , the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord @@@ -@@ @ injured males was invented by a veter@@ in@@ arian .
but we all had to change , but not just react to the given ; we bend to this new experience with intent .
as the human race emerged from a pre@@ historic chaos , a confrontation with random , brutal nature , they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about .
today we don 't confront the chaos of nature .
how shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create , on all the circumstances we create , on all the places we change ?
in the middle of this chaos , I 'm rolling around in a wheelchair , and I was completely invisible . completely .
I was in a wheelchair ; I did@@ n 't look like a loo@@ ter .
we sat there and compared wheels and tires and spo@@ kes and tubes .
" nurse ! is this the 28th or the 29th ? "
it 's just a set of choices that people make .
and of course all of this requires a broader workforce .
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .

technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
it 'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today .
everyone is both a lear@@ ner and a teacher .
now the students and I enjoyed the class , but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology is@@ n 't .
they got this statement of accomplishment .
I would watch Nova on PB@@ S .
we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
and now you 're riding along with the ISS where it is right now .
I 'm going to double @@@ -@@ @ click on Uran@@ us , and we can see Uran@@ us rotating on its side along with its mo@@ ons .
it only looks like nothing 's moving because , well , Satur@@ n here is 700,000 miles away , and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
it actually flies under@@ ne@@ ath Satur@@ n .
when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China , it has , you know , led to considerable ang@@ st amongst the Western populations .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India .
so within the company , there 's no difference in the forward c@@ itation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries .
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations , because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms .
without that , you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today .
you can 't be a professor without having been a student .
India has the youngest growing population in the world .
in 2009 , they had 400,000 employees , by which time the U.S. employees had moved to 10@@ 5,000 , whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000 .

the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled .
you know , during the Tunisian revolution , sni@@ pers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street .
up until two years ago , all revolutions in human history had a leadership , and when the old regime fell , the leadership and the organization would take power .
you were born , you lived your life and you died .
the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
I 've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like , but I 've been studying nature recently .
could we start to share our intelligence ?
that 's not to say that I 've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles .
I was ga@@ unt . I walked as though my legs were wooden .
Ste@@ ve , both a lawyer and a psych@@ ologist , has treated many patients with severe mental illness , and to this day he 'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen .
'@@ H@@ i , ' I said , and then I returned to the cou@@ ch , where I sat in silence for several moments .
'i think someone 's infiltr@@ ated my copies of the cases , ' I said .
I never struck anyone .
imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand , three @@@ -@@ @ inch diameter , with a single difference .
I study the future of crime and terrorism , and frankly , I 'm afraid .
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed .
and the man replied , " I 'm just an innocent school@@ teacher . "
during this 60 @@@ -@@ @ hour siege on Mum@@ bai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill .
this was done nearly four years ago .
there 's also been a big paradigm shift in crime .
you could ro@@ b 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
of course , criminals and terrorists we@@ ren 't the first to give guns to robots . we know where that started .
but as these get bigger in the future , what other items will you be able to print ?
as we move forward , we 'll see new technologies also , like the Internet of Th@@ ings .
if you control the code , you control the world .
in the United States , there are 60,000 people who have a pac@@ em@@ aker that connects to the Internet .
we recently saw a case where some researchers made the H@@ 5@@ N1 avian influenza virus more potent .
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
or , we decide that we 're going to prevent de@@ men@@ tia , and it will never happen to us because we 're going to do everything right and it won 't come and get us .
the middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accum@@ ulating in our ocean , and the third line is radioactive material lea@@ king from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean .
if you 're multipl@@ ying the ri@@ g , so you multiply how many layers of absor@@ bent you 're using , you can collect a lot more .
what 's happening is that , because the boat changes shape , the position of the front sa@@ il and the main sa@@ il are different to the wind .
in other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
things like c@@ ud@@ dling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
I mean , how could a game so tri@@ vial intervene so power@@ fully in such serious , and in some cases life @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ death , circumstances ?
" I 'm not afraid to do what makes me happy . "
that is worth + 1 physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster .
every single second that you are not sitting still , you are actively improving the health of your heart , and your lun@@ gs and bra@@ ins .
now I get to share one more little bit of science with you .
people have used micro@@ sc@@ opes to look at the micro@@ bes that cover us , I know you 're not paying attention to me , but ...
and I can tell you all the details about the micro@@ b@@ ial study that we did there , but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project .
premature infants have real problems with their micro@@ b@@ ial community .
and he sh@@ ru@@ gged it off , I think he either thought I was just complain@@ ing a lot , or it was the typical M.@@ D. " nothing can be wrong with my children . "
it 's extraordinary to watch .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
turn three . and John 's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
and Lim@@ or designed this , in part , because , like Car@@ ol , she felt threatened by GPS tracking .
they 're wide open , vulnerable to a kind of spo@@ of@@ ing attack .
you can scar@@ c@@ ely imagine the kind of ha@@ vo@@ c you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spo@@ of@@ er .
there is , though , one rede@@ em@@ ing feature of the GPS spo@@ of@@ er .
you may never experience the entire thing yourself .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , did@@ n 't make sense .
why not ?
it was the first cancer virus discovered , and when I call it " on@@ co@@ gene , " meaning " cancer gene . "
so , he made a filtr@@ ate , he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter , and he injected it to another chicken , and he got another tumor .
so , when we dis@@ soci@@ ated the fe@@ ather and put it in a dish , we got a mass of blue cells .
on the right , you see it looks very ug@@ ly , the cells continue to grow , the normal ones stop .
this is what we got .
we in@@ ject them into the mouse , the ones on the right , and none of them would make tum@@ ors .
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
there is the people , and then there is the government or leaders .
but I 'm confident , with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one , I think we can get this and other goals done .
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image .
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel .
I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body .
what should we do ?
and since I study human decision making , I said , I 'm going to run some studies to find some answers .
you are going to solve a series of pu@@ zzles , and I 'm going to show you examples of these pu@@ zzles moment@@ arily .
I 'm going to give you one of these two te@@ as , and keep in mind , I 'm going to pick one of these two te@@ as at random for you .
audience member : pul@@ pit ! B@@ aba Shi@@ v : W@@ ho@@ a ! OK .
we let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver 's seat .
this is a ti@@ pping point .
unlike what you may have seen on " Law & amp ; Order : SV@@ U , " justice is rare for victims of gender violence .
so while Civil Rights protects some victims , we should want to protect all victims .
I 'm here to say , " It 's time . "
and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does .
child : TV . ( children react ) Child : Oh my God .
child : Oh , that is so cool .
second child : it 's magic .
now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side .
mm on video : one , two , three . go !
every one of these circles is a co@@ g , a stack of co@@ gs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomo@@ tive .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
and some even said , this would be St@@ asi 2.0 .
can they really store all this information about us ?
I 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
but then after a while I realized , this is my life .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
a simple volume , the cu@@ be .
so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we 're making the fold , but essentially you 're looking at a folded cu@@ be .
but that 's only half of the story -- 9@@ 9.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
for one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them .
and this is a photo now , it 's not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
after decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it 's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even .
people are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
what does this mean ?
until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor , who was looking at people and giving them me@@ ds .
have you been to southern Spain lately ? there are roads everywhere .
they did@@ n 't say , " No , you know , we 're not going to take this . "
but there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance .
the first one needs little introduction -- " Girl with a Pe@@ arl Ear@@ ring " by Johan@@ nes Ver@@ me@@ er , 17th @@@ -@@ @ century Dutch pa@@ inter .
he 's an 18th @@@ -@@ @ century French pa@@ inter best known for his still lif@@ es , but he did occasionally paint people .
I 'm thinking of an older version of himself .
( la@@ ughter ) So , my work became popular .
but I did@@ n 't want to .
DM : that 's aw@@ ful .
em@@ path@@ izing with someone you profoundly disagree with does not suddenly compromise your own deeply held beliefs and endorse theirs .
thank you so much .
there 's a counter@@ intuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let 's look at the first metric here , over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survival .
so the problems of be@@ es today is@@ n 't necessarily something new . it has been happening since over a thousand years ago , but what we don 't really notice are these problems in cities .
why are be@@ es doing better in the city ?
1971 , we saw it spread to Europe and South America , and then , when we get to the 1980s , and specifically to 1987 , the var@@ ro@@ a m@@ ite finally came to North America and to the United States , and that is when the game changed for hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es in the United States .
think of the kids today . their childhood 's a bit different .
well , really , just change your perspective .
we all know Mubarak is technically dead .
so when these 300 million people , micro@@ blog@@ gers , even they block the t@@ we@@ et in our cen@@ sored platform .
the first five days after the train crash , there were 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media , which never happened in Chinese history .
so , the up is the Embassy data , the PM 2.5 .
I live in Beijing . every day , I just watch the American Embassy 's data to decide whether I should open my window .
maybe in Germany , in German language , it may be just " A@@ ha ! "
Chinese is always che@@ ating , right ?
" We@@ ib@@ o " is the Chinese translation for " micro@@ blog . "
it has its own innovation .
it became the media .
so that 's why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government , they want the em@@ peror to settle the problem .
but now we have We@@ ib@@ o , so I call it the We@@ ib@@ o petition .
so the crac@@ k@@ down is very serious .
but it did@@ n 't change the Chinese political system , and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions .
so , what 's the future ?
Don 't let them ho@@ ok [ up ] with the Chinese cats .
it changes what we see . it changes what we remember .
so this is the foot@@ age that I was showing everybody .
( launch no@@ ises ) So literally what you 're seeing now is the confl@@ u@@ ence of a bun@@ ch of different people , a bun@@ ch of different memories , including my own , of taking a little bit of liberty with the subject matter .
( music ) Tom Han@@ ks : Hello , Houston , this is O@@ dys@@ sey .
and in this particular case , this is the clim@@ ax of the movie , and , you know , the weight of achieving it was simply take a model , throw it out of a helicopter , and shoot it .
( la@@ ughter ) And I 'm not going to argue with you . you 're an astr@@ on@@ aut , a hero , and I 'm from New Jersey , so -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I 'm just going to show you some foot@@ age .
so I showed him this , and this is actual foot@@ age that he was on . this is A@@ pol@@ lo 15 . this was his mission .
and he said , " Hu@@ h , that 's pretty good . can we use it ? "
( la@@ ughter ) J@@ im Cam@@ eron actually photograph@@ ed the real Tit@@ anic .
I 'll give it to J@@ im , because he could use the p@@ at on the back .
and so I 'll just show it one more time .
that do@@ es@@ n 't move . "
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " And the thing without the wheels , that moves . "
he was the master of his universe , and we wanted Hu@@ go to feel the same way , so we created this shot .
so I was kind of proud of it , and I went to a friend of mine , and said , " You know , this is , you know , kind of the best @@@ -@@ @ reviewed shot I 've ever worked on .
so here we have this piece of music by Be@@ eth@@ oven , and my problem with it is , it 's b@@ oring .
( music ) Ok@@ ay , I hear you were laugh@@ ing ner@@ v@@ ously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the int@@ on@@ ation was a little questionable . ( la@@ ughter ) Let 's watch just another cli@@ p .
( music ) So with all these the@@ atric elements , this push@@ es me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dra@@ mat@@ urge .
there was the fl@@ or@@ ist , and I can understand that , once again , we 're putting pressure on the ont@@ ology of music as we know it conven@@ tionally , but let 's look at one last piece today I 'm going to share with you .
this is going to be a piece called " ap@@ ha@@ sia , " and it 's for hand ge@@ stures synchronized to sound , and this invites yet another role , and final one I 'll share with you , which is that of the chore@@ ograph@@ er .
is it music ? here 's how I want to conclude .
so for me , chore@@ ography is very much a process of physical thinking . it 's very much in mind , as well as in body , and it 's a collaborative process .
ye@@ ah , you all have a body , right ?
I 'm going to start really , really simply .
so all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand .
so I have to get myself in the zone . right .
they 're using the information that they receive to generate the begin@@ nings of a phrase .
so they 're solving this problem for me , having a little -- They 're constructing that phrase .
ye@@ ah , down to the floor . can you go under@@ ne@@ ath ?
avoid it . avoid it . W@@ ho@@ om . kick it out of the way .
they 're starting it already , and this is a task @@@ -@@ @ based method , where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves .
I 'm going to think about it in 3D space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that 's in front of me , it 's a space that my body can go inside of .
thank you very much . ( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you . ( appl@@ ause ) Here we go . ( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause )
until 2017 claimed that record -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) and left many people l@@ onging for earlier decades , when the world seemed safer , cleaner and more equal .
( la@@ ughter ) You can always fo@@ ol yourself into seeing a decline if you compare bleeding head@@ lines of the present with rose @@@ -@@ @ tin@@ ted images of the past .
but 30 years ago , the homicide rate was 8.5 per hundred thousand , poverty rate was 12 percent and we emitted 35 million tons of particulate matter and 20 million tons of sul@@ fur dioxide .
but 30 years ago , there were 23 wars , 85 auto@@ c@@ racies , 37 percent of the world population in extreme poverty and more than 60,000 nuclear weapons .
in the 19th century , We@@ ster@@ ners worked more than 60 hours per week .
but my science story do@@ es@@ n 't have that spectacular Hollywood ending .
he was so concerned , he wrote to me from his wife 's email account because he was afraid a phone call could be traced .
( appl@@ ause ) And I have worked hard to back up those words with actions .
and it may seem very obvious , the link , now , but at the time , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't really work out how could I use my photography to do something useful .
the people there have been forgotten , so I thought it was important to go and document their stories .
it was a realization that maybe it was worthwhile going off and doing these things .
many late nights of vod@@ ka @@@ -@@ @ fu@@ eled violence with me sitting in the corner with my bag , just going , " When was this a good idea ? "
now , I have to say , I had a " L@@ on@@ ely Planet " guide to Ukraine and in it , it gave some advice .
but one of the little kids , L@@ il@@ ic , he was the one who had taken my camera , and he started taking photographs .
he had a real eye for things .
that 's him , there .
he had taken a lot of pills and a lot of vod@@ ka .
then in February of last year , when I was on patrol in Afghanistan , I stepped on an I@@ ED .
I went to those places because I wanted to make some kind of change , and photography happened to be my tool .
but the reality is that we can all do something .
( la@@ ughter ) These questions became more complex as I got older .
but in the US , it 's a thing .
( la@@ ughter ) But he would say , " But you 're African .
but what we think of as community support takes on new urgency when you 're in the middle of an opi@@ oid and over@@ dose crisis .
I 'm not sharing this to sens@@ ation@@ alize Ken@@ sing@@ ton .
and one way to provide support was learning how to administer Nar@@ can .
and so I 'm here to explain what that is .
what you see here is two male ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es who are the same size , but one is walking up@@ right , has his hair up , has a big rock in his hand , and he 's the alpha male .
you don 't need to be the biggest and strongest male .
people who don 't like each other need to embrace each other and stand together , and that 's absolutely essential for the unity of the party , and if you don 't do that , the party may fall apart .
the second cost is that everyone wants your position .
alpha male position is a very important position , and everyone wants to take it from you , and so you constantly have to watch your back .
you have to be extremely vigilant .
W@@ K : this is my home . this is where I live .
ca : you tested three , and found that four worked better ?
ca : so what did they make of -- that you were 14 , 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ? they were impressed ?
and when the local sen@@ ator gets on the scale in public and says he 's got to lose weight , so do I !
all start over@@ age and under @@@ -@@ @ credit .
one got us invited to the White House , one 's a recent incar@@ nation .
so here , and at a time when we 've gone from the aud@@ acity to hope to hope for some aud@@ acity , I urge you to do something .
or Jenn@@ y , who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master 's degree .
they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job , and we know many students who did .
D@@ K : so here the video pa@@ uses , and the student types in the answer into the box and submits . obviously they we@@ ren 't paying attention .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions , and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions .
this is from Stan@@ ford 's Computer Science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color @@@ -@@ @ correct that blur@@ ry red image .
they 're typing their program into the browser , and you can see they did@@ n 't get it quite right , Lady Liberty is still sea@@ sick .
and so , the student tries again , and now they got it right , and they 're told that , and they can move on to the next assignment .
so we had to come up with a different solution .
what 's even more surprising is that self @@@ -@@ @ grades , where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incenti@@ vi@@ ze them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades .
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale , and is also a useful learning strategy for the students , because they actually learn from the experience .
and the really amazing thing is , because there were so many students , it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o 'clock in the morning , somewhere around the world , there would be somebody who was awa@@ ke and working on the same problem .
this is the San Francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world .
because the data that we can collect here is unique .
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis @@@ -@@ @ driven mode to the data @@@ -@@ @ driven mode , a transformation that , for example , has revolu@@ tion@@ ized biology .
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer .
the big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer .
now , if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer , you would never notice .
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it 's kind of hard to miss .
educational researcher Benjamin Blo@@ om , in 1984 , posed what 's called the 2 si@@ g@@ ma problem , which he observed by studying three populations .
the first is the population that studied in a lecture @@@ -@@ @ based classroom .
because we CA@@ N@@ NOT afford , as a society , to provide every student with an individual human tu@@ tor .
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone .
and even person@@ alization is something that we 're starting to see the begin@@ nings of , whether it 's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we 've shown you .
so the goal here is to try and push , and see how far we can get towards the green curve .
so , if this is so great , are universities now obsolete ?
so how do we do that ?
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles inland .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
we cleared tons and tons of stin@@ king , ro@@ tting fish carc@@ asses from the local fish processing plant .
I was helping clean the on@@ sen , the communal on@@ sen , the huge giant bath@@ tu@@ bs .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were re@@ claiming their photos .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them , Cin@@ dy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
had the children eaten bo@@ iled swee@@ ts ?
now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
so , how did she know that she was right ?
so , Al@@ ice was very outgoing and soci@@ able , and George was a re@@ cl@@ use .
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
it means that organizations mostly can 't do what George and Al@@ ice so trium@@ ph@@ antly did .
they can 't think together .
so , recently , I worked with an executive named Jo@@ e , and Jo@@ e worked for a medical device company .
but when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
after all , maybe they knew something he did@@ n 't .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neuro@@ log@@ ist 's clinic to do it .
you don 't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
they 're ultra @@@ -@@ @ low cost , and we all know what happens .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it 's too late .
max Little : ye@@ ah . ye@@ ah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . TR : right .
all right , let 's head back to 1964 , and let 's hear where some of D@@ yl@@ an 's early songs came from .
last one , this is " Who 's Go@@ ing To Buy You Ri@@ b@@ bons , " another traditional folk tune .
" the worlds are the important thing .
( music ) We know this tune , right ? we know it ?
that is " When the World 's on Fire , " a very old mel@@ ody , in this case performed by the Car@@ ter Family .
Ste@@ ve Jobs : and we have invented a new technology called multi @@@ -@@ @ touch .
we are not self @@@ -@@ @ made . we are dependent on one another , and ad@@ mitting this to ourselves is@@ n 't an embrace of medi@@ oc@@ r@@ ity and deri@@ v@@ ativeness .
and I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo .
and then they 've said to every single one of their workforce , if you can , help those communities grow , and help them to maintain their spaces .
I cat@@ ap@@ ulted out of the front screen door and threw myself on a fresh carpet of grass .
my mother cooked with the colors and tex@@ tures of her garden .
and there we worked with leading CE@@ Os on African issues , and African companies on tur@@ nar@@ ounds , making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally .
you should have seen my parents ' reaction !
and let 's start at the high level , on the macro @@@ -@@ @ factors .
Egypt : from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent .
and this is what today is about -- it 's about discussing those very opportunities .
B@@ ing Capital 's acquisition of Ed@@ con , a large retail@@ er , is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .
but looking at Gold@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ' work -- we had the famous BR@@ IC Report .
the new report , " The Next Ele@@ ven , " highlights that by 2020 Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world .
bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther signs again .
it 's just a sign of things to come .
but with Africa , let 's start being careful about this .
and E@@ me@@ ka and I have had these discussions .
for Africa to truly be sustainable , we have to move beyond to other industries .
let 's look at agriculture . let 's look at forestry .
as the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [ we will need ] poles for rolling out electricity .
there are only 700 ATMs in the country . opportunity .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard & amp ; Po@@ ors , Mo@@ ody 's and F@@ itch 's .
they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
the air is thick with heat and dust , and it 's hard to breathe .
I can feel the brush of swe@@ at@@ y bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can 't see much else .
slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't offer them any direct help .
it was more like a restaurant .
recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
it 's estimated that more than 4,000 children are ensla@@ ved on Lake Vol@@ ta , the largest man @@@ -@@ @ made lake in the world .
Kofi was rescu@@ ed from a fishing village .
these miners are ensla@@ ved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
when I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be ampu@@ t@@ ated .
has been with me ever since I was a child .
and so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20@@ s .
and my hero@@ ine here -- like S@@ atis@@ h 's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Bur@@ ma .
she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Ran@@ go@@ on .
but we have to practice .
the only thing to do is to get up , make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you .
( appl@@ ause ) So that 's fear . what about anger ?
if we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dre@@ ad@@ ful moments and it can give us real inner power .
and I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy @@@ -@@ @ makers .
because at the beginning I was so outra@@ ged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
I 've got night@@ mare disorder , which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure , and all my dreams involve people ch@@ asing me down the street going , " You 're a failure ! "
( la@@ ughter ) But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dun@@ lap .
this experience changed our lives , and now we 're trying to change the experience .
I get a call from Ca@@ it@@ ria , hear the news , and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another Super@@ cell was forming in their area .
we should inventory the donations piling up here .
co : my car is in my living room !
large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster , but they often fulfill very specific missions , and then they leave .
there 's a gap here .
data is inherently un@@ sex@@ y , but it can jump @@@ -@@ @ start an area 's recovery .
emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient .
but if you give locals the tools , if you show them what they can do to recover , they become experts .
over 80 percent are in low@@ - and middle @@@ -@@ @ income countries , and many have no access to hearing care .
if I were screening An@@ uk at school , sound @@@ -@@ @ atten@@ u@@ ating head@@ phones and noise monitoring would take the place of a sound booth , and I would use a phone adapter instead of a micro@@ scope to examine his ears .
and yet , when we look back on the printing press in the early years , we like what happened .
this is fe@@ ud@@ alism : one owner , many workers .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they did@@ n 't know of each other 's existence beforehand .
and it includes this very ev@@ oc@@ ative screen@@ shot .
the stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted .
this , graph@@ ically , was the answer . ( la@@ ughter ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And that is indeed part of the problem , but only part .
so consider this .
T.@@ S. Eli@@ ot once said , " One of the most moment@@ ous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of pro@@ se . "
or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large ?
I 'm afraid I 'm one of those speakers you hope you 're not going to meet at TED .
and because of the rain until four o 'clock in the afternoon , nobody went to the polling stations .
the problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing .
and the first thing that went right was , of course , these five revolutions which , in my view , very much changed the way we 're living and deepened our democratic experience .
and the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s , which put the individual at the center of politics .
but after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s .
and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : " the government does not know better . "
and of course , you have 1989 -- the end of Commun@@ ism , the end of the Cold War .
it has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics .
the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality .
when the Soviet Union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
these days it 's very popular to believe that this push for transparency , this kind of a combination between active citizens , new technologies and much more transparency @@@ -@@ @ friendly legislation can restore trust in politics .
I find this extremely important , because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions .
thank you very much .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , trust , if we 're going to rebuild it , we have to understand its component parts .
but if any one of these three gets sha@@ ky , if any one of these three w@@ ob@@ bles , trust is threatened .
now here 's what I 'd like to do .
I want each of us to be able to en@@ gender more trust tomorrow , literally tomorrow , than we do today .
would you give me some sense of whether or not you 're here voluntarily ?
that takes care of the em@@ pa@@ thy w@@ ob@@ bl@@ ers .
( la@@ ughter ) But fortunately , it 's often the case that our logic is sound , but it 's our ability to communicate the logic that is in jeop@@ ar@@ dy .
you don 't want to have an authenticity w@@ ob@@ ble ? be you .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
and he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end , he had such popular support in London that he won .
and they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader .
and it did@@ n 't have much more gran@@ de@@ ur than the term " fore@@ man " or " over@@ se@@ er . "
now , you can learn three interesting things from this .
a hundred and forty @@@ -@@ @ seven .
I 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human @@@ -@@ @ centered design -- " Let 's figure out what people want . "
well , here 's an example .
so it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution .
our other partner is East Mee@@ ts West , an American foundation that distribu@@ tes that technology to poor hospitals around that region .
and keep in mind that M@@ om maybe just had a C @@@ -@@ @ section , so that 's already kind of a bum@@ mer .
but here 's the problem : every doctor in the world , every hospital administrator , has seen TV -- curse those " ER " re@@ runs !
and here 's what we developed .
it only fits a single baby , and the idea here is it 's obvious how you ought to use this device .
and one day I looked in -- they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished .
I just heard the best jo@@ ke about B@@ ond Emer@@ u@@ wa .
I just want to say good afternoon , good evening .
I guess there goes my green card .
it comes from popular culture .
he says , " When the Sum@@ erian tablets were first translated , they were thought to be business records .
in 1967 , in the middle of the Bi@@ af@@ ran @@@ -@@ @ Nigerian Civil War , Dr. N@@ jo@@ ku @@@ -@@ @ Ob@@ i invented the Ch@@ oler@@ a vaccine .
in fact , every time I read in Ireland , people get me all mistaken and they say , " Oh , this is Chris O '@@ Bar@@ ney from Cor@@ k . "
my story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison , and I had no language for it .
we are squ@@ an@@ dering the most valuable resource we have on this continent : the valuable resource of the imagination .
I@@ dr@@ is pa@@ uses , then he moves again , and Fra@@ ser says , " Please !
in that moment , Fra@@ ser says , " I am lost already , but not you ... not you . "
( la@@ ughter ) He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential , pure identity : religious , ethnic , historical , ideological .
you 've been seas@@ oned by wind , d@@ us@@ k and sunlight .
pressure can make everything whole again .
brass nails t@@ acked into the e@@ bon@@ y wood , your face has been car@@ ved five times .
so close your eyes for a minute .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon ?
as John C@@ age said , " We are not moving towards some kind of goal .
actually , I need to take this off because I have a thing -- ( go@@ og@@ ly eyes r@@ attle ) Oh .
you can have a camera ; you can get photos of your entire head .
and you just put a little bit like that .
( robot bu@@ zz@@ es ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) And then you have a little hand .
so , I promise -- I mean , it still has -- it do@@ es@@ n 't have any water in it , I 'm sorry .
instead it happened just because I was enthusiastic about what I was doing , and I was sharing that enthusiasm with other people .
Sydney . I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney .
the description read : " the sub@@ urban streets of M@@ into become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of M@@ into . "
to understand this , I think it kind of makes sense to look where we 've come from .
artists can take us to a far @@@ -@@ @ fl@@ ung part of the city that we haven 't explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . I saw their amazing show in New York at the Stat@@ en Island Fer@@ ry Terminal at rush hour .
we , the audience , were given head@@ sets and seated on one side of the terminal .
for " The Sul@@ tan 's Ele@@ phant , " Royal de Lux@@ e came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time @@@ -@@ @ traveling ele@@ phant .
festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well @@@ -@@ @ being .
this is a concept known as thermal radiation .
the first time I tested this was on a roof@@ top in Stan@@ ford that I 'm showing you right here .
so I was really excited , because not only do we make something cool , but we might actually have the opportunity to do something real and make it useful .
one such process I 'd like to highlight are solar cells .
we tell it in our story of evolution as well , from our l@@ ol@@ l@@ oping ancestors to Hom@@ o erec@@ tus , finally up@@ right , to Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens , depicted , always a man , always mid @@@ -@@ @ stri@@ de .
he asked that question , but he never answered it , and here 's why .
we want to get everybody out of the hole , over the social foundation and into that green dou@@ gh@@ nut itself .
so can we find this dynamic balance in the 21st century ?
cities like London , Glas@@ gow , Amsterdam are pioneering circular city design , finding ways to turn the waste from one urban process into food for the next .
but how meaningful is this calculation , really ?
her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , spe@@ ech@@ less .
over the next two years , I watched as she switched jobs five times , eventually landing a luc@@ r@@ ative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory .
she recently returned to D@@ ong@@ gu@@ an on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cran@@ es , temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village .
by opening up their lives to me , they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world .
when you talk to workers , that 's what they want .
I mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that 's not why they 're in the city , and that 's not what they care about .
ca : was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
this is O@@ sh@@ od@@ i Market in Lag@@ os .
so , what am I talking about when I talk about System D ?
all of this is happening openly , and above@@ board .
it 's that the G@@ ala sa@@ usage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called UA@@ C foods that 's active throughout Africa and the Middle East , but the G@@ ala sa@@ usage roll is not sold in stores .
I 'm so OK with it .
it 's basically just sitting there , waiting for Gold@@ man S@@ ach@@ s to give it some money .
yes .
( la@@ ughter ) And when I looked up in the catalog to see how much this three @@@ -@@ @ foot @@@ -@@ @ high mouse cost , here 's how it was described ...
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's when I knew .
the string theory ; the idea that all of reality eman@@ ates from the vibrations of these teen@@ y -- I call it " The Big T@@ wan@@ g . "
we 've been paying a lot of attention to Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky 's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years .
I 'm talking about J.@@ C.@@ R. L@@ ick@@ li@@ der 's human @@@ -@@ @ computer sym@@ bio@@ sis , perhaps better termed " intelligence aug@@ mentation , " I.@@ A.
L@@ ick@@ li@@ der was a computer science tit@@ an who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the Internet .
humans are so amazing -- how we think , our non @@@ -@@ @ linear approaches , our creativity , iter@@ ative hypo@@ theses , all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do .
we require high @@@ -@@ @ end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing .
sil@@ ently , without much fan@@ fare , this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess .
and for this task , super@@ computer field bru@@ te force simply is@@ n 't enough .
Fol@@ dit , a game created by computer scientists , illustrates the value of the approach .
last year , on the site of the Twin Tow@@ ers , the 9 / 11 memorial opened .
the better the process , the less the friction .
as appealing as it might sound , you CA@@ N@@ NOT algorith@@ m@@ ically data mine your way to the answer .
they found a treasure tro@@ ve of documents : 700 bi@@ ographical sket@@ ches of foreign fighters .
it turns out that al Qaeda , too , is not without its bureaucracy . ( la@@ ughter ) They answered questions like , " Who recruited you ? "
analyzing this data was hard . the origin@@ als were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated .
the data was incredibly dispar@@ ate . the U.S. Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country .
there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference , other geospatial data , none of it integrated .
but beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy , we 're also concerned about the quality of life lived .
I see some nod@@ ding heads there .
in India , I found the situation was not a lot better .
we have a precedent for this . good old Henry II here , in the 12th century , invented the jury .
the second phase is in getting decision @@@ -@@ @ making power out .
in fact , if you fly over Germany , for example , and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages , they 're all about a mile apart .
now there 's some trends that will impact cities .
I won 't go through all of them . I 'll just show one .
you have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world .
we actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston .
we can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like 28 times the land utilization with that kind of strategy .
you have a conventional one @@@ -@@ @ bedroom arrangement when you need it .
OK , so if we have a conventional building , we have a fixed envelope , maybe we can put in 14 units .
it says a lot about her peers who elected her .
I think we need to consider everything , everything from alpha to O@@ ME@@ GA .
they are our body 's own repair kits , and they 're pl@@ uri@@ potent , which means they can mor@@ ph into all of the cells in our bodies .
back then , 15 years ago , we did@@ n 't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifes@@ pan .
it 's also involved in social interaction , understanding other people , and self @@@ -@@ @ awareness .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
to you and me , that 's a heart attack .
I don 't know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
the World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe 's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities . we can do better than that .
He@@ y , let 's all be interior sound designers , take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that 's effective and appropriate .
I went to my school kitchen , and I said , " Give me the sc@@ ra@@ ps that my school friends have turned their nos@@ es up at . "
so I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
there will always be waste . I 'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste @@@ -@@ @ free world .
a country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs .
it represents a col@@ os@@ sal waste of food , but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
how have I insul@@ ted my host ? "
some food waste , as I said at the beginning , will inevitably arise , so the question is , what is the best thing to do with it ?
and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest su@@ turing techniques , and he 's the guy giving the lecture .
I ran down the street and collapsed , and the ambulance guys intu@@ b@@ ated me on the side@@ walk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming .
they kind of have this va@@ ult where they 're stored in high @@@ -@@ @ de@@ f , and George Luc@@ as did all the sound effects . ( la@@ ughter ) So sometimes , rememb@@ ering them , it 's like , it 's not like any other kind of memories .
thank you . ( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . very lucky to be here . thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
but first of all , I want you to do me a favor .
where does it come from ?
and for what ?
all the technology is in place for us to communicate , and all the technology is in place to communicate this .
why should we allow such a wonderful , brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings ?
we make things grow .
we are also influenced by our non@@ verb@@ als , our thoughts and our feelings and our physi@@ ology .
what do we do when we feel power@@ less ?
they raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
so I 'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that 's hormones . I look at hormones .
so there are a lot of differences . they take more risks .
here are a couple more .
this one is very low @@@ -@@ @ power .
risk tolerance , which is the gambling , we find that when you are in the high @@@ -@@ @ power pose condition , 86 percent of you will gam@@ ble .
so it seems that our non@@ verb@@ als do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it 's not just others , but it 's also ourselves .
but the next question , of course , is , can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
we then have these co@@ ders look at these tapes , four of them .
so I said , fake it till you make it .
I was thrown from the car .
I knew my I@@ Q because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gif@@ ted as a child .
they say , " You 're not going to finish college .
eventually I graduated from college .
you 're going to stay , and this is what you 're going to do .
I don 't feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
and so I want to say to you , don 't fake it till you make it .
and so I started looking around , and I heard about a bak@@ ery that was run by 20 prostitutes .
thank you .
and from day one , No@@ am and I decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the Web .
to anyone considering NA@@ ND@@ 2@@ Te@@ tr@@ is , it 's a tough journey , but you 'll be profoundly changed . "
so for example , let 's take area .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
I have to say that I 'm very glad to be here .
that was the computer we knew .
so that was 20 years ago , and I was always on the periphery of art .
you know , when people say , " I don 't get art .
so they 'd go to an antique shop , and they 'd look at this cup , and they 'd say , " T@@ ell us about this cup . "
and as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , I 've spent my whole career making new media art .
but I found a sign for Russian @@@ -@@ @ speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
my favorite ones are " no plants . " why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? I 'm not sure .
and I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sand@@ box , and I said great .
if you don 't like the hotel , there 's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night .
now the ir@@ ony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behavi@@ ors that are hard @@@ -@@ @ wired in all of us .
now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect , like help with household cho@@ res or doing some supermarket runs .
reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you .
this year , two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ peer lending platforms .
what I mean by this is , say he started selling second @@@ -@@ @ hand books on Amazon . why should he have to start from scratch ?
what 's interesting is that Publ@@ ic@@ ol@@ or has heard from school administrators who say that attendance improves , gra@@ ff@@ iti dis@@ appears and kids actually say they feel safer in these painted schools .
we evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous , and abundance meant survival .
the interesting thing about studying cogn@@ ition has been that we 've been limited , in a way .
we just haven 't had the tools to look at inter@@ acting bra@@ ins simultaneously .
the problem is , I don 't think these projections are accurate .
now we have multi @@@ -@@ @ language , instantaneous , automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices , all the way down to smartphones .
and if any of us have used these , we know that they 're not perfect , but they 're decent .
not anymore .
it was written by an algorithm .
I want to ask : what have been the most important developments in human history ?
so when you do this and when you plot the data , you pretty quickly come to some we@@ ir@@ d conclusions .
so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when I look at what 's going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey .
they don 't run on capital , they don 't run on labor .
waste was not reduced -- it was eliminated .
and when they started obtaining the writ@@ e@@ ups of those trials through various different means , through Freedom of Information Act requests , through har@@ assing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent .
but people did@@ n 't b@@ other to use those registers .
this is a disaster .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information .
so if there was this world and this screen , and if there was the physical world around me , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't ever get them together in the same place .
normally it lives on the top of Big Ben , because that 's where you get the best reception , but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation .
they connect in a man@@ hole like this . literally , this is where the 5,000 @@@ -@@ @ mile cable pl@@ u@@ gs in .
but what amaz@@ es me is Simon 's incredible geographic imagination .
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a h@@ ack@@ saw , you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud .
well , I became a tap@@ e@@ stry histor@@ ian .
some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
and you can just imagine them .
it was@@ n 't just your standard installation .
and I used to run away from home , when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so .
over the past six months , I 've spent my time traveling . I think I 've done 60,000 miles , but without leaving my desk .
and then I struggled , because I was thinking to myself , " What should I talk ? what should I do ? it 's a TED audience .
you don 't believe me , do you ? ok@@ ay . ( appl@@ ause ) So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don 't understand .
people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen .
it gets even worse than that . let me just walk you through this one .
so I 'll put a little line up here which represents learning , and that 's how we used to do it . we could see things , understand them , take the time to put them into practice .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you , thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
pop@@ corn changes all of that .
let 's go to this Google Map , and I 'll show you how you can edit it .
all you do , go into the timeline , double @@@ -@@ @ click the item , and I 've set it to Toronto , because that 's where I 'm from .
feelings are tunnels .
there 's an area of your brain you 've probably heard referred to as the " reward center . "
it 's actually three intertwined but separ@@ able systems .
how bad ? "
what Pav@@ lov did was make the bell food @@@ -@@ @ related .
if you 're experiencing unwanted pain , talk to a medical provider .
is it sex @@@ -@@ @ related to have pressure directly against your cl@@ itor@@ is ?
she recognized and articulated what she wanted and liked .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Appl@@ ause for lu@@ be , absolutely .
but I want to tell you a dar@@ ker listen @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ her @@@ -@@ @ words story .
there are times when consent is ambiguous and we need a large @@@ -@@ @ scale cultural conversation about that .
number 13 : on occasion , the victim , female or male , may experience a physical response , but this is not a sexual response in the sense of desire or mu@@ tuality . "
this brings me one step closer into the darkness , and then I promise we will find our way into the light .
imagine you 're on the jury and you learn that the victim had org@@ as@@ ms .
that kind of story can give a person all kind of feelings , from rage to shame to confused ar@@ ous@@ al because it is sex @@@ -@@ @ related , even though it is appalling .
I can see it helping people , even as I say the words .
but do have one brave conversation .
one in six men .
say it to a judge you know or a lawyer you know , or a co@@ p or anyone who might sit on a jury in a sexual assault case .
a little easier and safer for the survivors , one in three women .
one in six men .
so for every brave conversation you have , thank you .
thanks .
en : the question I get asked most often is actually the question under@@ ne@@ ath pretty much all the other questions , so , can you get addic@@ ted to your vibr@@ ator , please help me with my erectile dysfunction ?
like , do you just want normal sex or do you want awesome sex in your life ?
( cell@@ o music continues ) ( T@@ aps rhyth@@ m@@ ically ) You found me , you found me under a pile of broken memories with your steady , your steady , steady love .
what I do is I organize information .
but the question is , why is it obvious ?
you arrive in a new city , and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place .
every street is generally perceived as a straight line , and we kind of ignore the little t@@ wi@@ sts and turns that the streets make .
when we do , however , make a turn into a side street , our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 @@@ -@@ @ degree angle .
maybe you 've had that experience as well .
the cognitive map in your mind may tell you , " Ar@@ is , go back to the main cathedral square , take a 90 @@@ -@@ @ degree turn and walk down that other side street . "
the second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines .
she 'll tell you the pu@@ b where her sister used to work , and ... " go past that church where I got married , " that kind of thing .
so we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning .
you might add little symbols along the way .
if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you 've just drawn , you 'd realize your streets and the distances -- they 'd be way off .
no , what you 've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schem@@ atic .
in the 19@@ 30s , Harry Bec@@ k applied the principles of schem@@ atic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever .
of course , what you don 't know is that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart .
so when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago , I tried to make sense of that .
I research@@ ed how each and every bus route moved through the city , nice and logical , every bus route a separate line .
I 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the qu@@ ays and West@@ mo@@ reland Street .
third , adapting to rising seas .
there are no quick fixes .
ok@@ ay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
I don 't know if you can get that here . ( la@@ ughter ) So , z@@ iz@@ zing away , and so - ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) - And for every one - I know , I drew this myself . thank you .
but I got a little bad news for you fol@@ ks . I got some bad news .
but it was@@ n 't until we tested it in people that we actually knew .
and three out of the four drugs we give you if you get cancer fail . and this is personal to me .
so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous .
fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States .
right ? when I got these results , I started talking to doctors , and they told me not to tell anyone , and my reaction is , " Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease ? "
and in biology , the numbers are even better .
I 've been around the early web . I 've been around the early creative comm@@ ons world , and there 's four things that all of these share , which is , they 're all really simple .
it do@@ es@@ n 't actually do what it says on the tin .
we 've got to reveal the dangers in the product .
we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive .
if we look at al Qaeda . Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a sou@@ k somewhere which not many people had heard of .
they were effectively [ doing ] something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franch@@ ised around the world , where there 's poverty , ignorance and injustice .
what I 'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently .
but it 's not an easy road . after the bomb , the victims are not into this .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @@@ -@@ @ up calls for us ?
I did@@ n 't have the tools . I lacked the experience .
more precisely , the timber yard of a hardware store .
what else do we need ?
what else do tra@@ dies love ?
Tra@@ dies especially , and I 'm a tradi@@ e myself , we love egg and bac@@ on rolls .
there 's counsel@@ ors , there 's people who have gone through mental health .
we 've done events for men 's sh@@ eds , so the high rate of suicide is really high for older men .
we need to do events before 9@@ am , which most of our bre@@ k@@ k@@ ies are , and after 5 PM .
here 's some so@@ bering statistics just to give you an idea .
they certainly do .
it 's because perception is grounded in our experience .
and yet , the ir@@ ony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being .
that 's actually what an experiment is .
the first step was to ask a question .
now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of B@@ eau , and the Black@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ e Project .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
I am very , very happy to be amid@@ st some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're reflecting on my glasses .
I have listened to the three previous speakers , and guess what happened ?
they are throwing large sums of money for primary health , for primary education , for food relief .
there you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television .
it may have jeopardized short @@@ -@@ @ term sales , but it builds lasting , long @@@ -@@ @ term loyalty based on shared values .
N@@ ex@@ t@@ pe@@ dition turns the trip into a game , with surprising t@@ wi@@ sts and turns along the way .
but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
I 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
if you include Internet tele@@ phony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
it 's actually about three percent .
and then finally , the one stati@@ stic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen : the export @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ GDP ratio .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
a second reason has to do with peer pressure .
he 's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants , the answer is about 24 percent . that 's their guess .
" foreign aid is the most aid to poor people , " is about the most home @@@ -@@ @ biased thing you can find .
" look what they 've been hiding from you , " he said .
and they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
that was not my intention . I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book .
slightly embar@@ ras@@ sing admission : even when I was a k@@ id , I used to have these little sp@@ y books , and I would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down .
our printing press is the Internet . our coffee houses are social networks .
so that 's why we 're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
and it 's getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that 's great . we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems .
so there 's a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there 's a few more coming on board .
in America , you have the Cy@@ ber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act .
when I got to the - For the next four , five years , I was held in four different children 's homes .
this is from an anti @@@ -@@ @ gay website , where they said g@@ ays are " worthy of death for their v@@ ile ... sex practices . "
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of dis@@ g@@ ust sensitivity .
and what they 've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physi@@ ologically aroused when you show them dis@@ g@@ usting images like the ones that I showed you .
for some participants , we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands .
it was usually too hot , too stu@@ ff@@ y or just too smel@@ ly , and my father would not let us use the air conditioner .
so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop .
we need to look for something else , and we 've gotten ourselves a little bit into a ru@@ t .
that 's the first line of defense for the body .
what it is , it 's a lam@@ ination of two different metals together .
and gra@@ s@@ shop@@ pers have a different kind of breathing system .
my initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know @@@ -@@ @ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
what I and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were mad@@ ly in love , into a functional M@@ RI brain scanner .
( la@@ ughter ) " What ' tis to love ? " Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are said .
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been won@@ dering about this question since they sat around their cam@@ p@@ fires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
but anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them .
as one businessman in New York said to me , " An@@ y@@ thing she liked , I liked . "
you know , if you 're just sleeping with somebody casu@@ ally , you don 't really care if they 're sleeping with somebody else .
but my most important question was always the same .
in fact , I had always thought it was a series of emotions , from very high to very low .
the kind of part of the mind when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
people live for love .
it 's very slow .
we all know of them , but nevertheless -- the Arabs say , " The dogs may bar@@ k , but the car@@ avan moves on . "
and I say back into the job market , because this is not new .
the double income family was the standard .
in short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
and it 's going to have an impact .
and I think that the television is like the global cam@@ p@@ fire .
they tend to be contex@@ tual , holistic thin@@ kers , what I call web thin@@ kers .
these three brain systems -- l@@ ust , romantic love and attachment -- don 't always go together .
with org@@ asm , then you get a real rush of oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in and vas@@ op@@ res@@ sin -- those are associated with attachment .
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you 've made love to them .
in fact , you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else .
and these drugs are going generic .
you fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your " love map , " an un@@ conscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .
he 's not gre@@ edy . he do@@ es@@ n 't see skin color .
and I CA@@ N@@ NOT remember the first moment I encountered au@@ tism , but I CA@@ N@@ NOT recall a day without it .
housing 550 babies , this was C@@ ea@@ us@@ esc@@ u 's show orphan@@ age , and so I 'd been told the conditions were much better .
my husband approached me very cau@@ tiously .
wounds are sc@@ ary , they are nasty , they are ick@@ y , it is why most of us look away when we don@@ ate blood .
anger is important ; it is the fire that cau@@ ter@@ izes our wounds and lets them scar over and heal .
a front @@@ -@@ @ row seat to their torture chamber ?
in all those years , with that guy cha@@ ined to my side , I got a lot done .
pretty soon , that little pos@@ se started to crowd me out of my own body and my own experience .
so these are my illusion glasses .
they 're a little bigger . they 're a prototype .
all we need is a playing card . any card will do .
wake up .
find me when you can . "
well , tonight he sle@@ eps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tuc@@ ked beneath his pil@@ low , scri@@ pted by str@@ angers who were there for him when .
and that can be seen directly through a micro@@ scope , and I 'm going to show you some of this today .
there 's the stam@@ en and the p@@ is@@ til . but look what the stam@@ en and the p@@ is@@ til look like in a micro@@ scope . that 's the stam@@ en .
you have bits of a volcan@@ o . there 's a little bit of a volcan@@ o there . you have tube wor@@ ms .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe it , and I 'd go around dis@@ sec@@ ting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
and I started taking pictures with my three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional micro@@ sc@@ opes .
so I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals .
and so with flight , it 's very metabol@@ ically costly .
so among and within b@@ ats is a huge variation in their ability to use sen@@ sory perception .
this is considered the Five Bless@@ ings .
and indeed , in this image , you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five b@@ ats .
now as I said before , b@@ ats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly . and why is this ?
it 's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wi@@ ping out populations of b@@ ats , and scientists have estimated that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of b@@ ats .
they 're going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone .
so through natural selection , over time , mu@@ tations , variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time .
so this is where we are right now , but what about the future ?
nobody ? one ? how about 10 years ?
some ? how about 30 ?
this bat is my@@ o@@ tis bran@@ d@@ ti@@ i . it 's the longest @@@ -@@ @ living bat .
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night sk@@ ies , and you see this beautiful flying mam@@ mal , I want you to smile . thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
pretty much in every case , that 's how a charity starts .
and I started to research that topic , and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it .
we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it , and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks .
so in 2007 , we brought the campaign across here , and it was , it set the stage for the campaign .
( la@@ ughter ) And he said , " I 'm doing it for Mo@@ v@@ ember . " and I said , " So am I. " And I said , " T@@ ell me your Mo@@ v@@ ember story . "
so they identified that as a priority , and then they 've got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic , essentially the same topic .
they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries .
this guy is sitting here working on his computer , and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month , won@@ dering what he 's going to have for dinner .
any of those yes responses are what we called mind @@@ -@@ @ wan@@ dering .
it 's slow . it 's anti@@ qu@@ ated . it 's not using the best technology , and it 's not using the best people .
he joins the Army . the Army gives him a rifle .
but you drop 25 of those veterans in Jo@@ pl@@ in , Missouri , they get that sense of community back .
I 'm , among several other things , an electrical engineer , and that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology , and more specifically designing and building electronics .
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that be so cool , and that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
speed x 4 .
music : D@@ J Sh@@ ad@@ ow .
( music ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Pret@@ ty cool , hu@@ h ? we think so .
so , you can 't get a smaller ham .
what if bi@@ ologists could only study animals that made people go , " AW@@ W . " right ?
they 're just the right tools for the job .
and so people say to me , " How do I know if a word is real ? "
if you love a word , it becomes real .
if that was the map of all the words in American English , we don 't know very much .
and this is a little @@@ -@@ @ known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
so , this whole time I 've been saying , " The dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . "
it was@@ n 't really what people needed .
thank you very much for your kind attention .
it 's been fantastic .
you just did@@ n 't want to respond to that person that time .
now , the S@@ ock P@@ up@@ pet , on the other hand , is a totally different animal . the s@@ ock pup@@ pet is@@ n 't about ambiguity , per se . it 's about identity .
but actually , what I 've been finding is very different from that .
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile .
if I were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ?
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it 's not going to be accurate all the time .
this is@@ n 't a dec@@ eption @@@ -@@ @ detection machine to tell if your gir@@ l@@ friend 's lying to you on text messaging .
my out@@ box for email is massive , and I never look at it . I write all the time , but I never look at my record , at my trace .
first , lying online can be very dangerous , right ?
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do I want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
while he was there , he traveled to Madrid , where he went to the Pra@@ do to see this picture by the Spanish pa@@ inter Di@@ ego Vel@@ Ã¡@@ z@@ qu@@ ez .
and it was such a blow that it wo@@ ke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , I guess .
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lin@@ gered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night .

now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon .
you need first funds .
( video ) Ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al@@ am Mur@@ u@@ gan@@ anth@@ am : the thing I saw in my wife 's hand , " Why are you using that nasty cloth ? "
democracy will find it difficult to survive such a development because , in the end , democracy is not based on human ration@@ ality ; it 's based on human feelings .
( shooting no@@ ises ) The name of the game is to get after your enemy z@@ om@@ bie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
well , I 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is .
guess what ? their vision is really , really good .
it 's better than those that don 't play .
so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
[ " yellow " ] DB : Red . audience : yellow .

they switch really fast , very swiftly . they pay a very small cost .
right ? so these kinds of results really makes two main points .
they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks .
in fact , this is better than a wheel , because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach , you will notice it 's very hard to do .
( sound of running air ) Yes !
this is a part of the nose of the Anim@@ aris Per@@ cip@@ i@@ ere .
the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .
thank you very much , ladies and gent@@ lemen .
I mean , you have the typical European cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity .
you don 't plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework .
I was air@@ lifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney .
I had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above , as if it was happening to someone else .
and as we held on and we breath@@ ed as one , we knew we we@@ ren 't on this journey alone .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward , we would never be the same .
I so@@ aked it up and I thought , " How could I ever have taken this for granted ? "
and she said , " You 're going to get depressed . "
and then it no longer matters what you look like , where you come from , or what you do for a living .
how beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island .
but that 's still not reason for us to dis@@ engage , because we 've seen that movie before , in Afghanistan .
waited until it was just the right time , followed him very closely behind .
people have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magne@@ ts to let them know that the revolution is near , so stock up .
let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon k@@ ung fu secret .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the air@@ plane .
the U.S. government decided to take action , and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of air@@ planes .
people in our countries here in Europe , in North America , were living with HIV , healthy lives .
the air@@ plane patent holders were not left a choice whether they 'd license their patents or not .
what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of pol@@ arized light in the sky that you and I can 't see . it 's the way our eyes are built .
and what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the home@@ ward path , and compare the two .
so what have we learned from these animals with a brain that 's the size of a grain of rice ?
so my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim , so to , you know , Indians , and L@@ ati@@ no@@ s , everyone , if you 're brown -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) Here 's my advice to my brown friends .
you see , my si@@ bl@@ ings and I are the first generation to go to university , so for a family of immigrants , this was kind of a big deal .
in fact , I think my kids will be the first Vi@@ kings who will have a hard time growing a be@@ ard when they become older .
here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of for@@ aging , or hunting and gathering societies .
it was a 7.6 magnitude . it was fairly big .
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source , and in this case , these guys were New York food blog@@ gers .
these are the ones that are obviously making sense .
so we were able to call R@@ ita , clear the video , make sure that it had been shot , and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried .
so onto Google Maps we go , and we start looking through literally every single bridge .
the bridge looks like it 's crossing the river east to west .
and that , I guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
no one knew what was there . it was utterly un@@ mapped at the time . we knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
who would have thought that two young guys and a start @@@ -@@ @ up would beat out Google Video ? why ?
so I continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
so for me , it 's a collaboration .
but it turns out that try@@ p@@ top@@ han also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate .
so there you have it : the evolution of a head@@ line .
I have to say , this sounds awesome . ( la@@ ughter ) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so when this came up in my local shop , naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims .
so I went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products .
so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuro@@ scientists at MI@@ T fig@@ ured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling ne@@ ural activity in a specific part of their brain .
and in some cases , oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in can even decrease cooperation .
well you can see where this is going .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old standing in that exact spot .
you have Palestine @@@ -@@ @ Lo@@ ves @@@ -@@ @ Israel .
because you 're not in the Middle East .
and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe [ with ] effort , we can avoid it .
now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name .
the American people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issues , to fiscal issues , are moderate , pragmatic centri@@ sts .
so gradually raise Social Security retirement age , maybe only on people not yet born .
if you add Democrats , you add Re@@ public@@ ans , you 've got the American people .
you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a Key@@ ne@@ sian liberal economist , and these people did@@ n 't go to each other 's weddings , they s@@ nu@@ bbed each other at conferences .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , J@@ ake .
and I 'm going to say a few words about each one this morning .
the ver@@ b is the chassis of the sentence .
so which ver@@ bs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the ver@@ b specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change .
you can also say , " B@@ iff went from sick to well . "
even though there are default situations in which one of these mind@@ sets can be applied , they can be stretched and extended .
now , mis@@ matches -- when one person assumes one relationship type , and another assumes a different one -- can be aw@@ k@@ ward .
on the other hand , you want the dam@@ n gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole .
the mind that we rely upon to be happy , content , emo@@ tionally stable as individuals , and at the same time , to be kind and though@@ tful and consider@@ ate in our relationships with others .
it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
let 's say this is an anxious thought .
if you think about the last time you had a w@@ ob@@ bly tooth .
and we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time .
and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those stor@@ y@@ lines and patterns of mind .
but of course the most dangerous animal is the mosqu@@ ito .
in fact , probably adding them all together , the mosqu@@ ito has killed more humans .
and the answer is this thing .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
it 's only the female mosqu@@ ito that will actually b@@ ite you .
so the males will go out , they 'll look for females , they 'll mate . if they mate successfully , then no off@@ spring .
they only live a few days .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it 's actually ready .
and now what we 're doing is we 're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000 , so we can see this work at big scale .
the males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go .
we 've also done this in agriculture .
that actually w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be such a problem , because if we were really all going to die , we would put aside our differences , we 'd spend whatever it took , and we 'd find a way to deflec@@ t them .
of course , the left wants to take action , but the right denies that there 's any problem .
once again , the same process repe@@ ats .
now then we get the Great De@@ pression and World War II .
think of it like this .
it plum@@ mets . something is going on here .
the moral electro@@ mag@@ net is turning back on , and nowadays , just very recently , Democrats really dis@@ like Re@@ public@@ ans .
so there 's a lot we can do , but who 's going to push them to do it ?
rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy .
I realized I 'd intern@@ alized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level .
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
so my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books .
an author visited our school , Jack Gan@@ tos .
so I loved writing so much that I 'd come home from school , and I would take out pieces of paper , and I would sta@@ ple them together , and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because I loved using my imagination .
now when I was in sixth grade , the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the Wor@@ ce@@ ster public school system .
( la@@ ughter ) And a video camera .
my grand@@ parents , they were in the middle of it .
Mrs. Al@@ is@@ ch was there . Mr. Sh@@ il@@ ale was there . Mrs. Cas@@ ey was there .
Mrs. Al@@ is@@ ch cut in front of the line and said , " I taught him how to read . " ( la@@ ughter ) And then something happened that changed my life .
and for him , it 's only his second .
and I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights .
and she responded with , " I 'm here . " ( la@@ ughter ) That 's true . you are alive , and that 's pretty good right now .
all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving C@@ eline with no alternatives .
now , I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally @@@ -@@ @ funded research .
sadly enough , the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research .
I 'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan Africa , so attractive for these HIV clinical trials ?
however , the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries .
public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate .
the final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me , in six seconds .
and I hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
ok@@ ay , so the next question people always ask me is , " Do you get free stuff ? "
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I for@@ got my money and they gave me the dress for free .
and I think the answer that they 're looking for is , " If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er and you have sh@@ ini@@ er hair , you will be so happy and fab@@ ulous . "
and when we 're back@@ stage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
and of course , they were right .
now , sunlight , of course , comes into this .
and vitamin D has had a great deal of press , and a lot of people get concerned about it .
my grand@@ mother grew up in Glas@@ gow , back in the 19@@ 20@@ s and ' 30s when ric@@ kets was a real problem and co@@ d liver oil was brought in .
and the evidence for it preventing can@@ cers is not yet great .
anyway , I came back from Australia , and despite the obvious risks to my health , I moved to A@@ ber@@ de@@ en .
but I also became interested in research , and in particular I became interested in this substance , nit@@ ric oxide .
and I started doing research , and we found , very ex@@ ci@@ tingly , that the skin produces nit@@ ric oxide .
it arises in the skin .
and I was interested in these really complex systems .
we put on cre@@ ams that blocked the enzy@@ me that made it , we injected things . we cou@@ ld@@ n 't turn off the nit@@ ric oxide .
now , we 're still collecting data .
but certainly in people older than my wife , this appears to be a more marked effect .
so what we 've next done is we 've moved on to looking at blood vessel dil@@ at@@ ation .
this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure , by which you dil@@ ate the cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ teries also , to let the blood be supplied with the heart .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ two people are graduating , and all 22 are going to college .
" you did@@ n 't s@@ have . " " but si@@ r - " " No , don 't tell me how often you sc@@ raped your face this morning .
and you know what , they come to admire the drill ser@@ ge@@ ant and they never forget the drill ser@@ ge@@ ant .
she 's the one who feeds me .
Oh ye@@ ah , when I don 't feel so good down there , she takes care of me .
and so they said , " Lo@@ ok , let 's take his RO@@ TC grades and roll them into his overall G@@ PA and see what happens . "
and that 's the key to success .
it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low @@@ -@@ @ income areas , because they 're not getting the gift of a good start .
it devastated me when my mother did that to me .
this is the last cycle , and you can see it 's pretty much fig@@ ured out what its self looks like . and once it has a self @@@ -@@ @ model , it can use that to derive a pattern of locomo@@ tion .
we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , ang@@ st @@@ -@@ @ rid@@ den conversations in this hi@@ de@@ out , and the great moment for one of the ac@@ tresses is to pe@@ ek through the door and say , " Are you coming to bed , honey ? "
I don 't think kids ' movies have anything to do with that .
maybe it 's not just the spar@@ kly dress .
she was a young mother . she was someone who liked to party .
she thinks she 's dre@@ aming , but she 's not .
and she re@@ members struggling with her mother to the front , crow@@ ds and crow@@ ds of people , " Take my child ! take my child ! "
I learned about compassion .
last April , I went back to a very strange -- what I called a der@@ an@@ ged high school re@@ union .
what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo , and I don 't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .
Rwanda is a place that ha@@ un@@ ts me a lot .
and I called him Luc@@ a , which means " The br@@ inger of light , " because he does bring light to my life .
a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the dar@@ k@@ est corners of the world .
we perform a million of these a year in the United States alone .

so here 's Al@@ lan teaching an English @@@ -@@ @ speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minim@@ ally invasive surgery .
but for this examination , which is really hard , we have a problem .
because for them it 's not a surgery test , it 's an English test .
and we currently have access to eleven language pairs .

now , the story that I start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story .
because it took a lot of craf@@ ty work to infec@@ t this bacter@@ ium .
the next thing is that virus DNA made stuff that ch@@ op@@ ped up the bacteria DNA .
because , you see , DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make .
so now you understand how viruses can attack cells .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
if we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier , we could start by saying , " These viruses make copies of themselves by sli@@ pping their DNA into a bacter@@ ium . "
so a professional science writer would say , " That has to go .
why don 't you say , " Li@@ sten , let me tell you a story . "
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
it 's found 31 workers .
everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow .
they 're from multiple agencies .
the people on the top row are the pro@@ ven@@ ly reliable ones .
and they 're looking at how many of the people they 've induc@@ ted are available each hour next week .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
let 's make it personal .
she may have pos@@ sessions that she would like to trade at times she do@@ es@@ n 't need them .
what have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last 20 years ?
these mechanisms , these facilities are not in the gift of Cra@@ ig@@ s@@ list or G@@ um@@ tree or Ya@@ ho@@ o , they 're controlled by the state .
and for that they have to be able to access state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art markets .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisticated I.@@ T. project ?
not necessarily .
it simply passed the National L@@ ot@@ tery Act and this is what followed .
let 's call it national e @@@ -@@ @ markets , NE@@ Ms for short .
think of it as a regulated public utility .
so this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums .
this kind of data can become routine .
that 's what a lot of people said about tur@@ bo trading in financial exchanges 20 years ago .
we developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and anim@@ ations , and then share their cre@@ ations with one another .
what do I mean by fluent ?
so young people today have lots of experience and lots of famili@@ arity with inter@@ acting with new technologies , but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
let me show you about what it 's like to code in S@@ cr@@ at@@ ch .
so , of course , making a fish game is@@ n 't the only thing you can do with S@@ cr@@ at@@ ch .
and it do@@ es@@ n 't just stay on the screen .
so there 's a new block that says how much video motion there is , and then , if there 's so much video motion , it will then tell the ballo@@ on to pop .
( c@@ ric@@ kets ch@@ ir@@ ping ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( ch@@ om@@ ping ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) As kids are creating projects like this , they 're learning to code , but even more importantly , they 're coding to learn .
and it 's the same thing with coding .
when you learn to code , it opens up for you to learn many other things .
let me show you an example .
he wanted to keep score .
now those are important skills that are@@ n 't just relevant for coding .
it 's probably not so likely , but regardless of what he does , he 'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned .
I get it .
we bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
at sle@@ ep@@ overs I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they did@@ n 't want to k@@ iss me without ou@@ ting myself .

[ " what does equality mean to you ? " ] [ " Marriage " ] [ " Freedom " ] [ " Civil rights " ] [ " T@@ reat every person as you 'd treat yourself " ] It 's when you don 't have to think about it , simple as that .
today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
and a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
visibility really is key .
once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
where exactly does one become a second @@@ -@@ @ class citizen ?
we already are all of those things , and we always have been .
so please don 't gre@@ et us as str@@ angers , gre@@ et us as your fellow human beings , period .
thank you .
what is it , then ?
may we all be granted a grace of mercy .
welcome to Doha .
that is my job for the next two years , to design an entire master plan , and then for the next 10 years to implement it -- of course , with so many other people .
my mother has an acc@@ ent that is so different to my father , and we 're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country .
there are about five or six acc@@ ents in this country as I speak .
let 's look at today .
but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells , with your genes and your environment , and you print your own personal medicine .
the way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it .
we asked people , " Do you want this action , and to have buildings painted like that ? "
the freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of an@@ archy in the city , while the barbar@@ ism of the ' 9@@ 0s brought about a loss of hope for the city .
we demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city , up to eight stories high , the t@@ all@@ est of them .
but people were waiting in long qu@@ eu@@ es under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
we built the bright new reception hall that made people , Tir@@ ana citizens , think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests .
and finally , this ra@@ vel@@ ing can also lead to more and more damage .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be cancel@@ ed for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
but actually , if you look at how countries come out on this picture , you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity .
but let 's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started P@@ ISA , and I 'm giving them a colored bubble now .
what you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results .
this is the blue bar which is driving costs down .
you go to the next country on the list , Luxembourg , and you can see the red do@@ t is exactly where it is for Korea , so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does .
P@@ isa has transformed that debate , and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany .
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did Hungary .
it did@@ n 't fire its teachers . it changed its education policies and practice . very impressive .
but the test of truth is , how do you weigh that priority against other priorities ?
how do the media talk about schools and teachers ?
but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture .
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success .
high @@@ -@@ @ performing systems have made teachers and school principals inven@@ tive .
you 've seen Finland doing so well on P@@ ISA , but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools .
every school succe@@ eds .
they invest resources where they can make the most difference .
that 's where other forms of research need to kick in , and that 's also why P@@ ISA do@@ es@@ n 't venture into telling countries what they should be doing .
and the example of P@@ ISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems .
it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible .
it has taken away exc@@ uses from those who are complac@@ ent .
but this is different .
but there 's an intri@@ gu@@ ing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity .
to explain what this means and what this thing is , please let me quickly take a couple of steps back .
I ended up in physics by accident .
and it gets even better , because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence .
so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which CA@@ N@@ NOT be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system .
so if it 's a cell or a ter@@ m@@ ite or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
the nodes in the network are the system 's components , and the links are given by the interactions .
this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics , biology , computer science , the social sciences , but what about economics ?
in this little example , you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted .
and it has implications for systemic risk .
so we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007 .
OK , so now we analyzed the structure , so how does this relate to the control ?
now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs ' value .
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
we want to contract that gap .
and across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
I don 't know in inches how much that is .
wanting them is one thing .
is it a place where you can express your inf@@ anti@@ le wishes ?
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize .
committed sex is pre@@ med@@ itated sex .
secondly , we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet , and start moving them around .
( appl@@ ause ) Number seven : particle acceler@@ ator mis@@ ha@@ p .
a lot of very so@@ ber @@@ -@@ @ minded physi@@ ci@@ sts , believe it or not , have had exactly the same thought .
secondly , we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth .
this is the genetic biodiversity store@@ house of corn .
scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent .
you know , 10 years ago , or 15 years ago , really , you walk into an astronomy convention , and you say , " You know , there 's probably a black hole at the center of every gal@@ axy , " and they 're going to ho@@ ot you off the stage .
in 1989 , a large aster@@ oid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth .
so you say , ye@@ ah , well , what are really the chances of this happening ?
but we would have lots of time , if we see it coming .
suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle .
it is the only Ger@@ man@@ ic language that requires this .
what is the average difference here ?
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
now effectively everything I 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families .
does this have cumulative effects ?
you can put it lou@@ der if you can .
and what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these av@@ at@@ ars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world .
and the feedback that comes from the av@@ atar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin .
and that 's exactly what they do .
this is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a percep@@ tual task .
and yet , they can find them by t@@ acti@@ le discrimination , and they can press it and select it .
we had an animal running on a t@@ read@@ mill at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States , producing the bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ms necessary to move .
well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neuro@@ logical problems that we have in the world .
there 's a group of people in Kenya .
people cross oceans to go see them .
they jump high . they wear red .
the Ma@@ as@@ ais , the boys are brought up to be warri@@ ors .
this was the cross@@ road .
it was a sha@@ me@@ ful thing for him to carry the rest of his life .
they were all in a circle .
just tell me how to get there . "
so I went back and I had to go back to the tradition .
so I went to him very early in the morning , as the sun rose .
the first thing he sees when he opens his door is , it 's me .
he gave me a list of another 15 men that I went -- 16 more men -- every single morning I went and visited them .
they all came together .
I found W@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Mar@@ ts , vacuum clean@@ ers , and lots of food in the ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia .
I was in a land of plenty .
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya .
I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman .
I wanted to do something .
because there had not been any school for girls .
and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she 's walking to school , the mother is blamed for that .
if she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she 's punished .
Ang@@ eline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had .
but she was older . she was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade .
we gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ five girls will not be married when they 're 12 years old .
( appl@@ ause ) I want to challenge you today .
be the first . people will follow you .
be bold . stand up . be fear@@ less . be confident .
and corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself -- or , in the case of our context , your friends , your family or your financi@@ ers .
ok@@ ay ? friends , family and financi@@ ers .
but we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been mis@@ educated about it , and we have to admit that .
the first thing is that the big myth , number one , is that in fact it 's not really a crime .
that 's the honest truth .
the point I 'm making is that it is a crime .
today , I 'm focusing on public sector corruption , which the private sector also participates in .
we call them petro@@ dollars . the treasury was bur@@ sting with money .
we 're standing today in the Central Bank , and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I 'm going to be speaking about .
ok@@ ay ? we 're talking about ir@@ responsibility in public office .
the then @@@ -@@ @ Prime Minister went to Parliament to give a budget speech , and he said some things that I 'll never forget .
it went right into my heart .
so the 10 or 15 percent is pure mis@@ chief .
ok@@ ay ? two thirds of the money stolen or wasted .
they are the Pi@@ ar@@ co Airport accused .
it was a constitutional outra@@ ge of the first order , and I have lab@@ eled it the P@@ lot to Per@@ vert Parliament .
so that is the kind of outra@@ ge of the thing .
those of us who are , sometimes you feel like you 're a little bit on your own doing some of this work .
one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
and there was a lady with a sign , a very simple sign , a kind of bat@@ tered @@@ -@@ @ looking bl@@ on@@ de lady , and the sign was made out of Bristol board , as we say in these parts , and it was made with a marker .
it said , " If you 're not outra@@ ged , you haven 't been paying attention . "
if you 're not outra@@ ged by all of this , you haven 't been paying attention .
what if -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) But to make it in these wron@@ gs , you have to read a lot of sp@@ y no@@ vels and follow some of that stuff , right ? ( la@@ ughter ) But what if this was@@ n 't the first time ?
and I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council , which is a not @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ profit .
let 's understand , because we lack context .
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something .
only here . so what was the reason for the generosity ?
it 's a not @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ profit blog that I run .
the Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
so I plun@@ ged into this struggle , and I asked four questions .
so they hit my question with a question .
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country 's history .
you could see what I applied for and what replies I got .
we need to increase the consciousness .
cra@@ bs have this complicated structure under their car@@ ap@@ ace called the ga@@ stri@@ c mill that gr@@ in@@ ds their food in a variety of different ways .
imagine a network of ne@@ ur@@ ons with one neuro@@ mod@@ ulator .
so here 's the good news about families .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
in ag@@ ile , workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short sp@@ ans of time .
so instead of having executives issue grand pro@@ clam@@ ations , the team in effect manages itself .
so what is Ag@@ ile , and why can it help with something that seems so different , like families ?
in 1983 , J@@ ef@@ f Su@@ therland was a techn@@ ologist at a financial firm in New England .
in Su@@ therland 's system , companies don 't use large , massive projects that take two years .
Su@@ therland said it was the best Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving ever .
what worked well this week ?
getting over our fear of riding bikes . making our beds .
what did@@ n 't work well ? our math sheets , or greeting visitors at the door .
you know , the key idea of ag@@ ile is that teams essentially manage themselves , and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids .
kick someone , lose des@@ ser@@ ts for a month .
it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't light up their world for many years to come .
my wife counts them among her most trea@@ sured moments as a mom .
I think the time is right for an Ag@@ ile Family Man@@ if@@ es@@ to .
we 'll set a few rules and we 'll stick to them .
the truth is , their ideas are st@@ ale , whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively .
we 'll make Sunday meals more important . "
it turns out there 's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal .
so move where you sit . that 's adap@@ tability .
our instinc@@ t as parents is to order our kids around .
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the water@@ fall as much as possible .
just yesterday , we were having our family meeting , and we had voted to work on over@@ re@@ acting .
so one of my daughters threw out , you get five minutes of over@@ re@@ acting time all week .
but then her sister started working the system .
now give us a punishment . ok@@ ay .
to me that is a certified ag@@ ile miracle .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And by the way , research backs this up too .
and I said , " But what if they drive into a d@@ itch ? "
J@@ im Col@@ lin@@ s , the author of " Good To Great , " told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preserve the core , they stimulate progress .
so ag@@ ile is great for stimulating progress , but I kept hearing time and again , you need to preserve the core .
we don 't like dilem@@ mas . we like solutions .
this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right .
and suddenly we were worried , like , do we have a mean girl on our hands ?
do you know where your parents went to high school ?
in fact , he asked to be buried in that ra@@ vine where he thought it was hidden .
you don 't need some grand plan . you don 't need a water@@ fall .
in fact , they need to be able to read discer@@ n@@ ingly .
and so on . so I suddenly fig@@ ured that , how come all the rich people are having these extra@@ ordinarily gif@@ ted children ?
( la@@ ughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
I said , " You won 't believe the children who told me and where they 're from . "
the net charge on an ion is equal to the number of pro@@ tons in the ion minus the number of electr@@ ons .
so what 's my wish ?
it will be called the School in the Cl@@ oud .
the lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything 's done from the cloud .
and there was this little girl who was following me around .
that number is hard to visu@@ alize .
you 're not even close .
so visible or not , we know this molec@@ ule very well .
these are the colors we typically use for them .
and there are four at@@ oms in particular that stand apart from the rest as the main building blocks of life , and they are the same ones that are found in ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ rine : hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .
that 's it .
we 're not talking about two cars that are coming off an assembly line here .
so nature 's molecules are everywhere , including the ones that have decom@@ posed into these black mixtures that we call petroleum .
now , our dependence on them for energy -- that means that every one of those carbons gets converted into a molec@@ ule of CO2 .
it is , at its core , a window through which the beauty of the natural world looks richer .
we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet .
anyway , once we made it there , then it 's a game park , as I said , an extin@@ c@@ t game park .
again , another one , " That 's a mon@@ key . " " that 's a pig , " etc .
you either don 't know what you 're looking for , or you 're looking in the wrong place , " he said .
there were these three people and me , and I am taking the pictures , that 's why I am not in .
how would you feel if you were me ? you have something extraordinary in your hand , but you are in the middle of nowhere ?
the feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement , of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility , of making sure everything is safe .
here is a close @@@ -@@ @ up of the fossil , after five years of cleaning , preparation and description , which was very long , as I had to expose the bones from the sand@@ stone block I just showed you in the previous slide .
and in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism , who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there .
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child , because you don 't leave anyone with this kind of child , even a minister .
so she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the Luc@@ y species , known as Austr@@ al@@ opi@@ th@@ ec@@ us af@@ aren@@ sis .
so , this girl died when she was about three , 3.3 million years ago .
that 's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children , so I think the new fossil fixes this problem .
and the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa .
that 's because we Africans concentrate -- I am from Ethiopia , by the way -- we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere , or from outside .
( la@@ ughter ) Hello .
and their eyes would say -- " No@@ body ever sees me .
thank you . "
( laugh@@ ing ) And I 'd be , like , " This is my job . "
and meanwhile , I was tour@@ ing locally and playing in night@@ clubs with my band , the Dres@@ den Dol@@ ls .
I maintain cou@@ ch@@ surfing and crow@@ d@@ surfing are basically the same thing .
and meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
asking makes you vulnerable .
at the end of the night , I stripped and let everyone draw on me .
I see them as trust .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
now no sooner - this was in the 1950s - and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum @@@ -@@ @ beating people to protect the animals , than the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed .
they did . they agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 ele@@ ph@@ ants to try to stop the damage .
it made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions .
when I came to the United States , I got a shock , to find national parks like this one des@@ erti@@ fying as badly as anything in Africa .
this picture is a typical seasonal grass@@ land .
to prevent that , we have traditionally used fire .
when I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much @@@ -@@ @ vil@@ ified livestock to address climate change and desertification , I was faced with a real dilemma .
I believe I 've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this .
we 've only explored about five percent of our ocean .
this is South Los Angeles . ( la@@ ughter ) Liqu@@ or stores , fast food , vacant lots .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
I see wheel@@ chairs bought and sold like used cars .
it was on a strip of land that we call a par@@ k@@ way .
because this time it was@@ n 't coming up .
I use the garden , the soil , like it 's a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that 's my emb@@ ell@@ ishment for that cloth .
I wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in can@@ dy long enough to make old age sweet .
see , they asked me what I wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
( la@@ ughter ) My finishing move was going to be The Tra@@ sh Comp@@ actor .
( la@@ ughter ) I was crushed , as if by a tra@@ sh comp@@ actor .
( la@@ ughter ) Li@@ ke a bo@@ omer@@ ang , the thing I loved came back to me .
we found ourselves out@@ numbered day after w@@ ret@@ ched day .
I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship .
and so if we really want , like Buc@@ k@@ min@@ ster Ful@@ ler said , a world that works for everyone , with no one and nothing left out , then the non@@ profit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation .
but it do@@ es@@ n 't seem to be working .
why have our breast cancer ch@@ arities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer , or our homeless ch@@ arities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city ?
why has poverty remained stuck at 12 percent of the U.S. population for 40 years ?
and the answer is , these social problems are massive in scale , our organizations are tiny up against them , and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny .
we have one for the non@@ profit sector , and one for the rest of the economic world .
so in the for @@@ -@@ @ profit sector , the more value you produce , the more money you can make .
but we don 't like non@@ profits to use money to incenti@@ vi@@ ze people to produce more in social service .
we have a vis@@ cer@@ al reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
was 23@@ 2,000 dollars , and for a hunger charity , 8@@ 4,000 dollars .
some people say , " Well , that 's just because those M@@ BA types are gre@@ edy . "
the second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing .
but we don 't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity .
our attitude is , " Well , look , if you can get the advertising donated , you know , to air at four o 'clock in the morning , I 'm ok@@ ay with that .
people are year@@ ning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply .
that 's an important fact , because it tells us that in 40 years , the non@@ profit sector has not been able to wrest@@ le any market share away from the for @@@ -@@ @ profit sector .
so Dis@@ ney can make a new $ 200 million movie that fl@@ ops , and nobody calls the attorney general .
moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific ne@@ ur@@ ons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those ne@@ ur@@ ons .
so how do we ask this question ?
it 's one thing to believe that flies have emo@@ tion @@@ -@@ @ like states , but how do we actually find out whether that 's true or not ?
what can we do ? it 's not so easy .
Val@@ ence means good or bad , positive or negative .
so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state .
and a final possibility is that there 's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyper@@ activity , but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in AD@@ HD .
but in each fly , we put it back only into certain ne@@ ur@@ ons and not in others , and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyper@@ activity .
so what they 're doing is working with seven bree@@ ds of primitive , har@@ dy @@@ -@@ @ looking cattle like that M@@ are@@ m@@ man@@ a Pri@@ miti@@ vo on the top there to rebuild , over time , with selective back @@@ -@@ @ breeding , the au@@ ro@@ ch@@ s .
you get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes fal@@ cons .
everybody thought is was finished .
now there are 8@@ 80 . they 're increasing in population by three percent a year .
you know , do you want extin@@ c@@ t species back ?
I think that 's , you know , part of how it 'll work .
and they say , " No , no , that 's what it says here in our holy book . "
great news . it drives me nuts that most people don 't seem to know this news .
but it 's heart @@@ -@@ @ stopping . it 's mind @@@ -@@ @ blowing stuff .
that 's what the data is telling us . if the trajectory continues , we get to , w@@ ow , the zero zone .
I mean , it 's about three Rol@@ ling St@@ ones farewell concerts away .
so why are@@ n 't we jumping up and down about this ?
so inertia versus momentum .
it 's not going to kill you .
could we really be the great generation that Mandela asked us to be ?
some of you know him . he set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tah@@ ri@@ r Square in Cairo .
you 're full of surprises , if I may say so .
so , the company back then was doing really well , but you were basically a streaming service for other people 's films and TV content .
you 'd persuaded Wall Street that you were right to make the kind of radical shift away from just sending people DV@@ Ds , so you were doing it by streaming .
we were like , " Holy ... ! " -- I can 't say that .
R@@ H : that 's the bit@@ ch about the internet -- it moves fast , you know ?
everything around us moves really quick .
so then you have a lot of par@@ ano@@ ia about what 's coming next , and that 's part of the founding eth@@ os , is really worrying about what 's coming next .
so that 's an advantage .
I pride myself on making as few decisions as possible in a quarter .
then , of course , the market shifted -- in that case , it was C + + to Java .
we do the opposite , which is : everybody gets all the information .
so what we 're trying to do is build a sense of responsibility in people and the ability to do things .
there 's just -- R@@ H : sure , that 's a big symbolic one , vacation , because most people , in practice , do that , anyway .
and we try not to make it intense , like y@@ elling at each other -- nothing like that .
back in the day , you opened up your algorithm to the world and said , " He@@ y , can anyone do better than this recommendation we 've got ?
R@@ H : ye@@ ah , it was super exciting at the time ; this was about 2007 .
so what we 've done is invest a lot on the algorithms , so that we feature the right content to the right people and try to make it fun and easy to explore .
which ones of these are your best movies ? "
everyone would rate " Sch@@ ind@@ ler 's List " five stars , and then they 'd rate Adam Sand@@ ler , " The Do @@@ -@@ @ Over " three stars .
and it works out much better to please people to look at the actual choices that they make , their revealed preferences by how much they enjoy simple plea@@ sures .
but are@@ n 't there risks with this , if this go @@@ -@@ @ only @@@ -@@ @ with @@@ -@@ @ revealed @@@ -@@ @ values approach is taken too far ?
other times , people want to watch very intensive film .
ca : but -- yes , indeed .
R@@ H : in practice , you 're right that you can 't just rely on algorithms .
I think you 're right , which is , when people talk about Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , they talk about the shows that move them : " 13 Re@@ as@@ ons Why " or " The Crown . "
but what we want to do is offer a variety .
instead , we 've seen great viewing across a whole range -- " Black Mir@@ ror " -- we 're fil@@ ming season five now .
and that was a struggling show when it was only in the BBC .
and if we 're as great as we can be , and we have a variety of mo@@ ods , then more often , people will choose us .
R@@ H : you know , I think we learn .
I mean , you 've done incredibly well with Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , you 're a bil@@ lion@@ aire , and you spend a lot of time and indeed , money , on education .
R@@ H : sure . right out of college , I was a high school math teacher .
R@@ H : it depends on the k@@ id .
think about it as : with multiple kids , there 's all different needs that need to be met , so there 's not any one model .
well first of all , because I am a maker .
we would like it to become a large , collectively generated database of do @@@ -@@ @ it @@@ -@@ @ yourself information on smart materials .
but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
Jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and did@@ n 't work , so others could study and reproduce it .
her project 's goal is to highlight the expres@@ sive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the buil@@ der .
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
we often tackle problems from un@@ conventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the Internet .
there was basically a factory of industrial machines .
and I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it 's actually kind of fragile .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shoc@@ king phone call .
I 'm confident that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
Chris An@@ derson : El@@ on , what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all @@@ -@@ @ electric car ?
ca : I mean , this is a beautiful but expensive car .
ca : so that seems like a win for the consumer .
and they have an expected return on that capital .
em : more from solar than any other source .
it was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one ?
and you have to do that .
thank you so much .
I was in the third year of my seven @@@ -@@ @ year under@@ graduate degree .
and I believe the answer is yes .
and that is exactly what we found .
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation .
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident micro@@ b@@ ial landscape .
they kill our livestock .
and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
in 2003 , I was ready to do a talk about the Sk@@ oll Foundation and social entrepreneurship . no call .
what I have here is a cin@@ der block that we 've coated half with a nano@@ technology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
there 's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis , because they 're picking zero or one .
so they 're smart , but poor .
there 's almost no difference .
the bottom players , you see all the activity in dor@@ some@@ dial P@@ FC .
that 's kind of a mistake together .
they play lots of trials with different amounts each time .
this turns out to be something that 's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at Cal@@ tech and learn about .
very complicated . the right brain schem@@ atic is the un@@ informed person , and the left is the informed .
that is , it looks as if the un@@ informed brain activity is happening first , and then it 's followed by activity in the informed brain .
and by the way , these were trials where their deals were made .
here 's the case where the disagreements occur .
that is , the informed brain seems to be deciding , " We 're probably not going to make a deal here . "
ok@@ ay , so the next part of this study I 'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of T@@ et@@ sur@@ o Mat@@ su@@ z@@ awa .
now we move the pay@@ offs .
we 're actually going to make the left , left pay@@ off for the mat@@ cher a little bit higher .
it 's s@@ prin@@ k@@ led around , but if you average the ch@@ im@@ ps out , they 're really , really close , within .@@ 01 .
the ch@@ im@@ ps are playing better than the humans , better in the sense of adhering to game theory .
and these are two different groups of humans from Japan and Africa . they replicate quite nic@@ ely .
none of them are close to where the ch@@ im@@ ps are .
now there are three things I want you to see now that I 've described Le@@ ster@@ land .
now , what can we say about this democracy in USA @@@ -@@ @ land ?
here 's point number two .
it 's at least possible the Le@@ sters would act for the good of Le@@ ster@@ land .
I don 't mean R@@ od Bl@@ ago@@ j@@ evich sense of corruption .
so here 's the model of government .
now , there 's good news and bad news about this corruption .
one bit of good news is that it 's bi@@ partisan , equal @@@ -@@ @ opportunity corruption .
the chief policy man took this idea to Cap@@ it@@ ol Hill , and as he reported back to me , the response was , " H@@ ell no !
if we de@@ regulate these guys , how are we going to raise money from them ? "
this is the root .
but we CA@@ N@@ NOT ignore this corruption anymore .
grab that issue , sit it down in front of you , look straight in its eyes , and tell it there is no Christmas this year .
so it 's not that mine is the most important issue . it 's not .
turns out , the analy@@ tics here are easy , simple .
irrelevant .
when she said that , I sc@@ ram@@ bled .
I tried to think , " How do I respond to that hop@@ elessness ?
and what hit me was an image of my six @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old son .
do you have that love ?
all of us have to act to get it back .
it was made of glass , and this building really helped me to do my job good .
the only thing I had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stu@@ ffed for the collection .
and it was on June 5 , 1995 , that I heard a loud ban@@ g against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duc@@ k .
this is the dead duc@@ k . it flew against the window .
but next to the dead duc@@ k is a live duc@@ k , and please pay attention .
the live duc@@ k mounted the dead duc@@ k , and started to cop@@ ulate .
one is dead , one is alive . that must be nec@@ ro@@ phil@@ ia .
I look . both are of the male sex .
so I -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I took my camera , I took my note@@ book , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior .
you can pass it around .
it 's a mo@@ ose trying to cop@@ ulate with a bronze statue of a b@@ ison .
this is in Mon@@ tana , 2008 .
these are pig@@ e@@ ons in Rotterdam .
it 's been there for three days , and it 's laying on its back .
but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
so this is the motor .
and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently , you can really change things .
it 's involved in every physical interaction you do every day , every manipulation task , anything you do in the world .
we can create very compelling illu@@ sions .
we can do this for all kinds of surfaces and it 's really a lot of fun .
and you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work .
you can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills , at least he would have some sense of progress .
people were not c@@ uring cancer or building bridges .
what happened in the S@@ is@@ y@@ phic condition ?
I said , " How many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? "
so there is a store in the U.S. called I@@ K@@ EA .
I can 't say I enjoy the process .
no , the taste was great .
but then we told them , " Lo@@ ok , this orig@@ ami really belongs to us .
when you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
now think about kids .
and then we emb@@ ed elastic .
they had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched .
I 'm biased .
in infrastructure , we 're working with a company out of Boston called Ge@@ osy@@ n@@ tec .
and we 're developing a new paradigm for piping .
so this is@@ n 't expensive pumps or valves .
the third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win .
there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena .
and I noticed in the upper right of the scat@@ ter chart some dar@@ ker do@@ ts , some black do@@ ts , that were a different color .
and I realized , this is it .
and I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insec@@ to@@ id thum@@ b clicking .
and I remember thinking , this is it .
I felt like qu@@ iz show conte@@ stant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers .
and it was fri@@ gg@@ in ' dem@@ or@@ alizing . it was terrible .
I 'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers , when we knew our friends ' phone numbers .
there 's so much information out there .
being a Renaissance man or woman , that 's something that was only possible in the Renaissance .
these are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts .
if we have those facts at our mental fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps , we 're going to be able to make informed decisions .
she was a 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girl from Sur@@ rey , England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Ph@@ u@@ ket , Thailand .
what would you do if your 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter came up to you with this ?
you say where you 're from , and I say , " Oh , ye@@ ah . "
it 's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met .
that 's often the advantage of time .
and it 's not effective if you say , " Well , hold on .
that do@@ es@@ n 't work . that 's just anno@@ ying .
in the movies , when computers like Wat@@ son start to think , things don 't always end well .
things always go terri@@ bly wrong .
for the most part , they are just normal fol@@ ks who are universally interested in the world around them , curious about everything , thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject .
ladies and gent@@ lemen , the choice is yours .
thank you very much .
if I come over here -- ( L@@ augh@@ s ) He 's smart .
thanks , little guy .
so I can see everything that Rom@@ o sees , and I get a robot 's @@@ -@@ @ eye @@@ -@@ @ view of the world .
I 've always wanted a picture of a 1,500 @@@ -@@ @ person TED audience .
so there are all of you through Rom@@ o 's eyes .
so I can go in and I can say let 's make Rom@@ o excited .
ok@@ ay . awesome .
you can imagine an eight @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girl , for example , who has an iPhone , and her mom bu@@ ys her a robot .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see Rom@@ o doing on the left .
so we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home , that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination .
told him my idea , and you know , he is one of the bra@@ vest men in the world , as is General Bla@@ ir , who , in the end , gave me permission to try this experiment .
I picked one unit -- Char@@ lie Company , Third of the 17@@ 2nd , they 're mountain infantry -- for two reasons .
I started with the 16@@ 07 Massachusetts Bay Colon@@ y P@@ equ@@ ot Indian Wars .
gave them about a nine minute response , and there we went .
it 's our trailer , because I know , obviously you guys are busy , many of you may not have had a chance to see it .
if we could roll ?
Michael M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty : specialist Michael M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty .
it 's un@@ beli@@ evable .

twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him , of course , and I said , you know , " It 's going to be OK . "
you go and see anybody ?
so building community among those students , very important .
they were in the lab working , and they saw the work , not as school@@ work , but as their lives .
it was that connecting .
because so many students are bo@@ red in class .
and most important , giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work .
and then he said something that gives me go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps .
he said , " Cho@@ ice , not chance , determines your destiny . "
choice , not chance , determines your destiny , dreams and values .
take control of your health and get on with your life . "
Don 't you in the front row worry or anything .
all right , I GO@@ T@@ TA gel up .
many of us will have im@@ plan@@ tables that will actually look real @@@ -@@ @ time at what 's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now .
un@@ coordinated care today is expensive at best , and it is deadly at worst .
it 's like a bad@@ ge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live .
I was optimizing my life for quality of life , and quality of life for me means time in snow .
Col@@ er@@ id@@ ge felt that true philosoph@@ ers like himself pon@@ dered the cos@@ mos from their arm@@ chairs .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans .
so the philosophical breakfast club helped inv@@ ent the modern scientist .
and " What proportion of the Earth is covered in water ? "
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet .
fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human sh@@ it .
but then you look at that already min@@ us@@ cul@@ e water and sanitation budget , and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply , which is great ; we all need water .
we ing@@ est nutrients . we ex@@ crete nutrients as well .
in Rwanda , they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners ' bo@@ wels .
but there are things to worry about .
this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult , and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me .
either one would kill you ; in only one of them will you find a major le@@ sion .
why does this matter ? well first because , for brain disorders , behavior is the last thing to change .
College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year .
A@@ bed could still turn his wheel left so that I would see him who@@ os@@ h by out my window and I would remain whole .
but A@@ bed did not slow , and on that x@@ ero@@ xed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , I was left without anger .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the inf@@ idel@@ ity of a parent or spouse , money inherited ?
were we instead our bodies , their in@@ born endow@@ ments and deficits ?
A@@ bed then rose and turned on the TV so that I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be alone when he left the room , and returned with pol@@ ar@@ oids of the crash and his old driver 's license .
and so I did@@ n 't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash , A@@ bed did not even mention the bus driver .
( la@@ ughter ) I realized society did@@ n 't value my passion .
I passed an audi@@ tion for Cirque D@@ u Soleil .
( appl@@ ause ) On the basis of this result , this is now a procedure that 's done throughout the world , and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery .
they shut down . they turn off .
or at least , they shou@@ ld@@ n 't if they 're interested in re@@ producing . that -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) is not the way any human being speaks casu@@ ally .
lingu@@ ists have actually shown that when we 're speaking casu@@ ally in an un@@ monitored way , we tend to speak in word pac@@ kets of maybe seven to 10 words .
it 's much less reflective -- very different from writing .
that 's what people did then , speaking like writing .
once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message , then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak .
we see this general b@@ agg@@ iness of the structure , the lack of concern with rules and the way that we 're used to learning on the black@@ board , and so we think that something has gone wrong .
another example is " sl@@ ash . "
S@@ ally : " for this summer program at NY@@ U . "
and so , there are always - ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) - there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep sp@@ inning .
increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cogn@@ i@@ tively beneficial .
take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old today .
two @@@ -@@ @ percent growth quad@@ ru@@ ples your standard of living in 70 years .
in college , we 've got cost inflation in higher education that d@@ war@@ fs cost inflation in medical care .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
and that 0.8 is the big challenge .
( la@@ ughter ) O@@ ption A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago .
hurricane San@@ dy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century , maybe for a couple of days , in some cases for more than a week , electricity , running water , heating , gasoline for their cars , and a charge for their i@@ Ph@@ ones .
when you get older , and you 're all fre@@ aked out , whatever , the ment@@ ors calm us down .
( la@@ ughter ) And sort of measure the impact . stuff like this are things I made , just to sort of understand what these things are .
I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about p@@ iss , and sort of really sad things , and so I wanted to think about something happy .
my hair 's clean -- it 's ok@@ ay .
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
and I wrote this book , " The Laws of S@@ impl@@ icity . "
it 's a very short , simple book . there are ten laws and three keys .
you know the un@@ i is the most challenging , so number ten is challenging .
so enjoy your su@@ shi meal later , with the laws of simplicity .
because that 's what this is about . I have to simplify this thing .
anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a k@@ id a big cookie or a small cookie , which cookie are they going to take ? the big cookie .
str@@ ang@@ ely , not the big pile . so , I think it 's as simple as this .
basically , it always depends .
it 's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world .
and so , this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here , because life is finite .
and then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more -- that 's very good , too .
you see , the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors , but they did@@ n 't re@@ design the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility .
we shape our destiny , and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to re@@ design their factories , we 're going to need to re@@ inv@@ ent our organizations and even our whole economic system .
let 's look at some data .

how could you possibly answer that question ? "
and the number of electr@@ ons on your device won 't actually increase or decrease .
and that targeting is based not on a profile of who they are , but of determining something that 's directly relevant to their query or question .
imagine this : you 're a woman , you 're married , you have a k@@ id .
do you think you 'd go home ?
do you think you 'd continue doing the thing that you were doing ?
we wanted to see if we could build machine @@@ -@@ @ learning models that could understand the emotional impact of language .
could we predict which comments were likely to make someone else leave the online conversation ?
and that 's no mean fe@@ at .
right now I can see you , and I can gauge how what I 'm saying is landing with you .
thank you .
rather , I build body parts , bi@@ onic legs that augment human walking and running .

Ne@@ uro@@ Em@@ bo@@ died Design is a methodology to create cy@@ borg function .
a few years ago , my good friend J@@ im E@@ wing -- of 34 years -- reached out to me for help .
the answer was Team Cy@@ borg , a team of surge@@ ons , scientists and engineers assembled at MI@@ T to rebuild J@@ im back to his former climbing pro@@ w@@ ess .
you don 't reach down like this ; it 's way too aw@@ k@@ ward .
because of this neuro@@ logical embo@@ di@@ ment , J@@ im do@@ es@@ n 't feel like a cy@@ borg .
I got D 's and often F 's in school .
during the tw@@ il@@ ight years of this century , I believe humans will be un@@ recogn@@ izable in morph@@ ology and dynamics from what we are today .
( crashing waves ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .
and likely , the harmon@@ ics of my voice as it went higher coupled with how loud I was singing recre@@ ated either the pre@@ datory call of an ec@@ hol@@ oc@@ ating bat or a bird , and the spi@@ der did what it should .
I love this .
the spi@@ der 's responding to its external world in a way that we get to see and know what 's happening to its internal world .
try this with me .
( video ) ( Two overlapping voices talking ) ( Single voice ) Intell@@ igent technology depends on personal data .
I could have put the two voices in different spatial locations , I could have made one lou@@ der .
you might still see a patch of red on the screen , because we 're showing increases with larger colored clouds , larger colored areas of red .
but it 's a lot different when we changed the creator 's intent .
changing the music and the sound effects completely alter the emotional impact of that scene .
I believe it is the era of the emp@@ ath .
but I am looking to create a world where we can care about each other more effectively , we can know more about when someone is feeling something that we ought to pay attention to .
let 's face it : driving is dangerous .
but I had no idea that car was stopping , and I think we can do a lot better than that .
I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other .
you can 't really directly sense the world around you .
you and everyone else . this is the safe way to drive .
actually , no . with cars , it 's not impossible .
that guy could be a problem .
before we address the kidnapping , I 'll first address this bu@@ zz@@ ard / vul@@ ture question I get all the time .
like the ladies in N@@ ash@@ ville , the detec@@ tive thinks that vul@@ tures circl@@ ing in the sky will lead him to the body .
so they have to sca@@ venge .
the tur@@ key vul@@ ture that you see here is super cool , because it 's one of the few bird species that can actually smell .
the answer : the tradition has been for researchers to exclude animal sca@@ ven@@ gers from decom@@ position studies by placing a c@@ age over the dec@@ ay@@ ing subject matter .
why ?
a lot of times at a crime scene when people see a sk@@ elet@@ on@@ ized body , they think , " W@@ ow , this has been here for a really long time un@@ discovered . "
and the sk@@ elet@@ on@@ ized body could have been there for as little as five days if sca@@ ven@@ ged by vul@@ tures .
the failure to account for vul@@ ture sca@@ ven@@ ging can result in forensic scientists in@@ accurately estimating how long someone has been dead and then searching through the wrong missing person 's files .
therefore , the goal is to get forensic scientists to focus on vul@@ ture evidence and to get law enforcement to consider vul@@ ture sca@@ ven@@ ging and a possible recent death when sk@@ ele@@ tal remains are found .
the detec@@ tives write back and say , " We found the body buried in a shallow grave .
we also found the fea@@ thers you mentioned . "
you all get your California Technology License .
and yet , I 've taken that idea and made it my own .
whether it 's nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
and second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they 're really not that way .
so I started this talk talking about the t@@ ush , so I 'll end with the bottom line , which is , walk and talk .
and this probably is not what you 're expecting .
let 's talk a little bit about how nuclear f@@ ission works .
and I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world .
so it 's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here .
that 's between , say at an average use , that 's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that .
so thank you guys .
and stor@@ yt@@ elling is much like what 's happening right now : I 'm standing up here , the unitary authority , and I am talking to you .
and you may disagree with it , you may think I 'm an in@@ suff@@ erable fo@@ ol , you may be bo@@ red to death , but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own head .
( la@@ ughter ) He did@@ n 't mean it compli@@ ment@@ arily , but Jo@@ e put it up in the lobby , he was so proud of it .

we know why .
you were so excited , we just let you go . "
I am powerful , and I am strong .
I put a " + 2 " on his paper and a big smil@@ ey face .

I want to start to show just a few pictures to you , and after I 'll speak .
I must speak to you a little bit of my history , because we 'll be speaking on this during my speech here .
there I learned different things .
we made a lot of trips , financed development , economic projects in Africa with the World Bank .
to build our development , we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything .
she said , why don 't you put back the rain@@ forest that was here before ?
it was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park .
we must protect the forest in this sense .
we tried to do a new presentation of the planet , and I want to show you now just a few pictures of this project , please .
India has no more trees . Spain has no more trees .
and we must rebuild these forests .
the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , even if we reduce them , everything that we do , we produce CO2 , are the trees .
so more than just explosions , chemistry is everywhere .
so when I asked him , he told me three things .
he said first , his curi@@ osity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure , about what worked and what did@@ n 't work .
she 's going to be four years old , and anyone who knows a four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old knows that they love to ask , " Why ? "
we all were at that age .
they don 't need banks . they got no money in the banks .
how many places in America are going to change ? none .
as a profession , we have to stop this . the science is clear .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
you know , they convinced me . I 'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing , the Pal@@ m@@ Pilot .
that thing lasted all of three weeks . it was over .
when the safety of America is threatened , we will spend any amount of money .
and so we 've fig@@ ured out that you 've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways m@@ im@@ ics what a good parent does .
man , her office was packed .
well , trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable .
you just had to do things sometimes .
but then , they were very surprised when I graduated from high school .
and then I told them , " I want to be a teacher . "
and I am going to be their help along the way .
I had a k@@ id one day come into my class having been st@@ ab@@ bed the night before .
I was like , " You need to go to a hospital , the school nurse , something . "
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
laptops , computers , tablets -- you name it , they have it .
and so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question .
however , the moral and political choice is still up to us , as citizens and as voters .
over the past few years , I 've been won@@ dering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
tree .
three together , that 's spar@@ k@@ les .
two women together , they have an argument .
so after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
the character on the left is two mountains stac@@ ked on top of each other .
what 's the plan ?
and it 's working beautifully .
it actually costs an enormous amount to mo@@ p up the damage from the dropout crisis .
what it do@@ es@@ n 't count are all the kids who are in school but being dis@@ engaged from it , who don 't enjoy it , who don 't get any real benefit from it .
if you 've got two children or more , I bet you they are completely different from each other .
like , " Which one are you ? remind me . "
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
they 're important because they speak to parts of children 's being which are otherwise un@@ touched .
curi@@ osity is the engine of achievement .
now the reason I say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here , if I can say so , has been to de @@@ -@@ @ profession@@ alize teachers .
you know , you 're not there just to pass on received information .
and people can spend an aw@@ ful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's as old as it gets , I 'm afraid .
but if nobody 's learning anything , she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it .
that 's it .
they should be diagnostic . they should help .
" no , I 'm fine . "
that 's one of the problems of the test .
there 's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Frank@@ lin .
the system we have today is@@ n 't fair to them .
the U.S. is@@ n 't number one .
it 's because there 's so much variation in the teaching profession .
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best .
for example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
we also had students fill out surveys with questions like , " Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? "
so it tells us we 're asking the right questions .
a peer review day , and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your ess@@ ays .
but we still have more work to do .
in other words , you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous .
and quite inte@@ res@@ tingly , over something like a 60 @@@ -@@ @ year period , we 're seeing the doubling in life expectancy , over that period where the urbanization has tre@@ bled .
this building was wired for change .
and again , the transition from one of the many thousands of sket@@ ches and computer images to the reality .
again , coming back to that thing about the lifestyle , and in a way , the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit .
Hu@@ bert was saying , absolutely correctly , " These are the new ca@@ thedr@@ als . "
we know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30 .
but this is@@ n 't what twenty@@ som@@ eth@@ ings are hearing .
as a culture , we have tri@@ vi@@ alized what is actually the defining decade of adul@@ thood .
( laugh@@ ing ) is@@ n 't that true ?
do something that 's an investment in who you might want to be next .
last but not least , Em@@ ma believed that you can 't pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
that job offer gave her the reason to leave that live @@@ -@@ @ in boy@@ friend .
my colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are resha@@ ping our everyday lives , what kinds of new routin@@ es are possible .
and we concluded a very important insight , which was that as people 's relationships to the things in their lives change , so do their relations with other people .
what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now ?
how might we think differently about our relations with technologies , things that effectively become social participants in their own right ?
He@@ y guys .
and after about 45 minutes , you get really intr@@ icate projects like leaves sorted by h@@ ue , so you get a color f@@ ade and put in a circle like a w@@ reath .
and he 's like , " I don 't know , but I can show you . "
you can make one of these brush@@ es just on the fly .
you guys are facing that way , so I 'll ho@@ ok it to this one .
you can kind of sketch with Play @@@ -@@ @ Do@@ h and just Google for game controllers .
ho@@ ver the mouse over the " take a photo " button , and you 've got a little cat photo booth .
and d@@ ads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways .
I always add humans to any technical -- if you 're drawing a technical diagram , put a human in it .
like this d@@ ad who wrote us , his son has cere@@ br@@ al pal@@ sy and he can 't use a normal keyboard .
and a huge erup@@ tion of discussion around accessibility came , and we 're really excited about that .
and I love the car@@ rot on the turn@@ table .
it 's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own pas@@ sions , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their back@@ yards and in their kitchens .
and I 'm talking about the very end .
I met J@@ im and Sh@@ ir@@ ley in their 8@@ 0s .
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
we 've learned an amazing amount .
the first walks around the badly injured to@@ dd@@ ler completely .
she was rush@@ ed to hospital , but it was too late . she died .
as I thought , that 's most of you .
I don 't think it does make a morally relevant difference .
each of us spends money on things that we do not really need .
fortunately , more and more people are understanding this idea , and the result is a growing movement : effective al@@ tru@@ ism .
according to one estimate , the G@@ ates Foundation has already saved 5.8 million lives and many millions more , people , getting diseases that would have made them very sick , even if eventually they survived .
but you don 't have to be a bil@@ lion@@ aire .
take , for example , providing a guide dog for a blind person .
that 's a good thing to do , right ?
I 've enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student .
so , when I was in art school , I developed a shake in my hand , and this was the stra@@ igh@@ test line I could draw .
and then when I got home , I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
now , it looks like you 're doing yourself out of a job , but you 're not . you 're actually making yourself more useful .
so we can begin to see the seed of a completely open @@@ -@@ @ source , citizen @@@ -@@ @ led urban development model , potentially .
probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Lin@@ us Tor@@ val@@ ds , the open @@@ -@@ @ source pioneer , which was that idea of , " Be la@@ zy like a fox . "
in order to do that in 20 minutes , I have to bring out four ideas -- it 's like four pieces of a puzzle .
at this time there was a -- the main question was about English .
I think it 's time that the educ@@ ation@@ ists made their own spec@@ s , and I have such a set of spec@@ s . this is a brief look at that .
so the same Guardi@@ an rebu@@ ts , " Are video games art : the debate that shou@@ ld@@ n 't be .
so it was not very constructive . ( la@@ ughter ) So , I 'm making fun of it , but we discussed this for so many days . you have no idea .
so it 's quite a he@@ f@@ ty collection .
that 's a good English sentence .
we 've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary , and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence , well , close to dropping off the map of our psych@@ ic plain .
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
there 's been an aw@@ ful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men 's violence against women and children , h@@ as@@ n 't there ?
but on a big scale , we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues , and we haven 't seen that yet , have we ?
and some people will say , " He needs sensitivity training . "
my argument is , he do@@ es@@ n 't need sensitivity training .
if we can make this point that I 'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power , it 's going to change the paradigm of people 's thinking .
there 's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes , coaches , administrators , as part of their educational process .
Pen@@ n State is the mother of all te@@ ac@@ hable moments for the by@@ stan@@ der approach .
so the question is , how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using , and start w@@ asting less of it ?
in fact , it already is .
and we 're not burning anything .
that 's 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well @@@ -@@ @ being but does contribute to climate change .
that 's 40 billion -- with a B -- every year in the U.S. alone .
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future , it is@@ n 't on this slide .
so what are we waiting for ?
but my ti@@ ger mother said , " No . "
that is me playing my imag@@ inary piano .
an opera singer must start training young to learn ac@@ rob@@ atics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
I turned to books .
books banned in China , of course .
but the fifth commandment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any : " you shall honor your father and mother . "
" honor , " I said . " that 's so different , and better , than obey . "
( la@@ ughter ) Bo@@ oks have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
having a dream shat@@ tered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
so because of books , I 'm here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority marty@@ r@@ dom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a per@@ n@@ icious sickness . "
( appl@@ ause ) And my question is : how did we get from there to here ?
my mother said that she thought I 'd really rather have a blue ballo@@ on .
about 20 years ago , I was asked by my editors at the " New York Times Magazine " to write a piece about De@@ af culture .
it felt as valid , perhaps , even as American culture .
then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a d@@ war@@ f .
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
the experience of D@@ own syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adul@@ thood .
one of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of D@@ yl@@ an Kle@@ bold , who was one of the perpetrators of the Col@@ umb@@ ine massacre .
we were sitting in the kitchen . sue Kle@@ bold was fixing dinner .
so , my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Min@@ ne@@ apolis .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , I wanted to protect my child from illness .
the sco@@ op was quite a very simple story .
this was what many call immer@@ sion journalism , or under@@ cover journalism .
so I built a pros@@ thetic baby , and I went into the village , pre@@ tended as though this baby had been born with a de@@ formity , and here was the guys who do the killing .
they got themselves ready .
in their bids to kill , I got the police on standby , and they came that fat@@ eful morning to come and kill the child .
another key story that comes to mind , which relates to this spirit child phenomenon , is " The Sp@@ ell of the Al@@ bin@@ os . "
I 'm sure most of you may have heard , in Tanzania , children who are born with al@@ bin@@ ism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society .
second official : I don 't even know the place called [ unclear ] .
so I 'm surprised .
repor@@ ter : when Metro News contacted investigative repor@@ ter An@@ as A@@ reme@@ ya@@ w An@@ as for his reaction , he just smil@@ ed and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown on@@ screen .
how did you end up in jail ? this was just a few weeks ago , I believe , ye@@ ah ?
now I 'm interested in dol@@ ph@@ ins because of their large bra@@ ins and what they might be doing with all that bra@@ in@@ power in the wild .
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dol@@ ph@@ in .
they 're outside the dol@@ ph@@ in 's normal reper@@ toire , but they 're easily m@@ im@@ ic@@ ked by the dol@@ ph@@ ins .
and the dol@@ ph@@ ins could get in on the game .
this is a scar@@ f to@@ y , and I 'm trying to lead the dol@@ ph@@ in over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal .
so I 'm reaching over . she 's got the scar@@ f on her right side .
it 's a society really , that looks a lot like the TED Conference .
and the first one is a college @@@ -@@ @ educated professional , creative type , manager , engineer , doctor , lawyer , that kind of worker .
they 're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at , and they 're actually getting so severe that they 're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement .
we could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip .
let me end it with words from politicians who were similarly distant .
but fortunately , Henry Kra@@ mer , who put up the prize for -- that was a one @@@ -@@ @ mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the English Channel , 21 miles .
and when all expenses were paid , the debt was handled , and everything was fine .
so this just summarizes it . " over billions of years , on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable , wonderful and fragile .
AA : when they got bo@@ red with their father 's project , they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own .
TM : and I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing , or on the other .
they are imag@@ inary musical instruments .
so here they are .
but the thing about fake news is that we don 't always know what is fake and what is real , but we base our decisions on facts we get from the press and social media .
( la@@ ughter ) Man@@ ip@@ ulations are always sex@@ y .
and it 's on us to find a way to rebuild trust , because fake news destro@@ ys it .
so if it 's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents are@@ n 't home , he@@ y , it 's just bat@@ ter up .
we 're playing against each other .
you may have noticed in the bas@@ eball and piz@@ za comparison , under the bas@@ eball , it 's all commands .
now she 's got the robot doing it .
we use something broadly called model @@@ -@@ @ based design .
twenty mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds later , the whole process is repeated until the qu@@ ad strikes the ball .
what happens when we couple this machine athle@@ ticism with that of a human being ?
democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power , whether it was of ty@@ rants or of high priests , their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth .
I said , " Why ? these are important decisions .
when riot police have to protect parliaments , a scene which is increasingly common around the world , then there 's something deeply wrong with our democracies .
democracy could not work without the citizens deliber@@ ating , deb@@ ating , taking on public responsibilities for public affairs .
average citizens often were chosen for citizen ju@@ ries to decide on critical matters of the day .
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
now , more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels .
I 'm here to talk about very real kill@@ er robots , autonomous combat d@@ ron@@ es .
now if responsibility and transparency are two of the corner@@ stones of representative government , autonomous robo@@ tic weapons could undermine both .
this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military , but that directive needs to be made permanent .
we have license plates on cars , tail numbers on aircraft .
thank you .
" why do you say such things , A@@ boo@@ dy ? "
I looked it up , and he was right .
it was a few weeks later , we started receiving all these " Man wol@@ ves will rape you if you go and drive . "
ninety percent said yes , she 's a tra@@ itor .
but you learn lessons from these things that happen to you .
it 's about women themselves .
thank you , everyone .
so , as a reflection of this , we started the Financial Crisis Observatory .
consider the financial price time series , a given stock , your perfect stock , or a global index .
the root mechanism of a dra@@ gon @@@ -@@ @ king is a slow mat@@ uration towards instability , which is the bubble , and the clim@@ ax of the bubble is often the crash .
perhaps more surprisingly , the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine , par@@ tu@@ ri@@ tion , the act of giving birth , ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tic seizures .
we have applied this theory to many systems , land@@ slides , gl@@ ac@@ ier collapse , even to the dynamics of prediction of success : block@@ bu@@ sters , YouTube videos , movies , and so on .
let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles .
this is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble , a factor of three , 300 percent in just a few years .
they told me , " Di@@ di@@ er , ye@@ ah , the market might be over@@ valued , but you forget something .
so we invented a new way of doing science .
we created the Financial Bu@@ b@@ ble Experi@@ ment .
we do our work . we write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time .
but with modern encry@@ p@@ ting techniques , we have a h@@ ash , we publish a public key , and six months later , we release the report , and there is authentication .
it works in the places where they live , and the work is done to improve their health .
and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals -- what were we aiming at ?
if you get a red cross , well , I 've looked carefully around the room and it 's not going to make much difference to this crew .
this is a big deal , so the tic@@ ks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
ten percent of those same 7,@@ 800 houses had safe electrical systems .
we arrive in the morning with tools , tons of equipment , trades , and we train up a local team on the first day to start work .
that work continues for six to 12 months , until all the houses are improved and we 've spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house .
( appl@@ ause ) In 2010 , for example , there were 8@@ 31 , all over Australia , and the Torres Strait Islands , all states , working to improve the houses where they and their families live , and that 's an important thing .
why ? because that fl@@ ush@@ es the bug out .
we put washing facilities in the school as well , so kids can wash their faces many times during the day .
we wash the bug out .
( la@@ ughter ) And the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug .
they could trap the flies , send them to him in Per@@ th .

you 're going to park the light right on top of the chambers .
tourists in glass @@@ -@@ @ bott@@ omed boats would be viewing the dro@@ wned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water .
Lar@@ ry Br@@ illi@@ ant : should we feel good , or should we feel bad that 50 years of fore@@ knowledge accomplished so little ?
let 's review them both . first of all , the meg@@ at@@ ren@@ ds .
there have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
we may see the eradication of gu@@ ine@@ a wor@@ m next year -- there are only 35,000 cases left in the world .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome . ( la@@ ughter ) It 's an amazing phenomenon .
the European 20 @@@ -@@ @ 20 @@@ -@@ @ 20 plan is an amazing breakthrough , something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon .
in the last century -- that 's the one that was seven years ago -- half a billion people died from small@@ po@@ x : more than all the wars in history , more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world .
and that changed , first with ships when we had the Renaissance , the Scientific Revolution and also the Industrial Revolution .
I call them brothers from another mother .
clearly I have a German mother somewhere .
" what are you carrying ? "
the BR@@ CK is our part to keep Africans connected , and to help them drive the global digital revolution .
in the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
but it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
my father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it did@@ n 't work .
so in America , it was kind of ridic@@ ulous that they said I should go to high school .
I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
many people helped me along the way to get here .
while this sound may be m@@ add@@ ening to us , perhaps it 's music to a mosqu@@ ito 's ears .

including the return of the large pre@@ dat@@ ors , like the grou@@ pers , the shar@@ ks , the j@@ acks .
and that 's not enough .
because the ocean gives us more than half of the oxygen we breathe , food , it absor@@ bs much of the carbon pollution that we throw in the atmosphere .
we need a healthy ocean to survive .
and fishing near the surface targets mostly species that migrate between the high seas and country 's waters , like tuna and shar@@ ks .
now I 'm going to show you a map .
let 's create a giant high seas reserve , two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the ocean .
despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , I 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabol@@ ic syndrome .
you can think of insul@@ in as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
what if obesity is@@ n 't the cause of insul@@ in resistance at all ?
when we become insul@@ in @@@ -@@ @ resistant , the home@@ o@@ sta@@ sis in that balance devi@@ ates from this state .
we know that 30 million ob@@ ese Americans in the United States don 't have insul@@ in resistance .
" another jo@@ ke on old white males . Ha ha . the w@@ it .

I do want to test this question we 're all interested in : does extinction have to be forever ?
in the case of the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine , regrettably , we shot every one that we saw .
and normally , when water free@@ zes , as you know , it expands , and the same thing happens in a cell .
if you freeze tissues , the water expands , damages or bursts the cell walls .
what we did is something called som@@ atic cell nuclear trans@@ plantation .
that was a miracle , but it was workable .
and just last February , the last time we did these trials , I saw a miracle starting to happen .
we haven 't announced this publicly before .
we found the biggest bird in the world , bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar , and it too was a flesh e@@ ater .
by the early 19@@ 30s , 3,000 to 4,000 th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines had been murdered .

we went into that pu@@ p to see what was in it , and we did find th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine DNA .
it was a eu@@ re@@ ka moment . we were very excited .
it has to be a different species . what could it be ?
in other words , if th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine tissues were being produced by the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine DNA , it would be able to be recognized .
when the baby pop@@ ped up , it was filled with blue @@@ -@@ @ green tissues .
this is a key question for everybody .
at any rate , he led us down this bush track , and there , right where he remembered , was the hu@@ t , and tears came into his eyes .
there were the wooden boards on the sides of the hu@@ t where he and his father and his brother had sle@@ pt at night .
so could we put it back ? yes .
I think gradually , as we see species all around the world , it 's kind of a man@@ tra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild .

( video ) Barack Obama : ... a single standard for all who would hold power .
compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries , I think you 'll find the Party being near the top in upward mobility .
they interview their superi@@ ors , their peers , their sub@@ ordinates . they vet their personal conduct .
does patron@@ age play a role ? yes , of course .
but merit remains the fundamental driver .
now , We@@ ster@@ ners always assume that multi @@@ -@@ @ party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy .

and the problem , of course , with all of this is that , with all those paper forms -- and I 'm telling you , we have paper forms for every possible thing : we have paper forms for vaccination surveys .

and it actually worked great .
and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology , and we need to scale it now .
that 's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation .

at Microsoft Applied Sciences , along with my ment@@ or CA@@ TI Bou@@ lan@@ ger , I re@@ designed the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital work@@ space .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
why phosph@@ orus in particular ?
only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant . eighty @@@ -@@ @ five percent is lost .
the solution I 'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time , even before plants existed on Earth , and it 's a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic mush@@ room that is very mysterious , very simple , and yet also extremely complex .
it can go beyond the root 's one @@@ -@@ @ mil@@ lime@@ ter scope to seek out phosph@@ orus .
and over time , this mush@@ room has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tin@@ i@@ est trace of phosph@@ orus , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
now let 's add a my@@ cor@@ rh@@ iza plant into the diagram I used earlier .
you 'll see that of this 25 percent , most will benefit the plant , more than 90 percent .
a very small amount of phosph@@ orus will remain in the soil .
that 's completely natural .
if you recall the graphs I showed you earlier , 85 percent of phosph@@ orus is lost in the soil , and the plants are unable to access it .

but does it just happen over there ?
my first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African iv@@ ory .
and that 's how my relationship with corruption really began .
in 1993 , with two friends who were colleagues , Simon Taylor and Patrick Al@@ ley , we set up an organization called Global W@@ itness .
now , they 're all people we 've investigated , and they 're all people who cou@@ ld@@ n 't do what they do alone .
so we spoke to sources in country , tra@@ w@@ led through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal .
in 2011 , natural resource exports out@@ weighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa , Asia and Latin America . nine@@ teen to one .
now let 's go back to the oil and mining companies , and let 's go back to Dan E@@ te@@ te and that $ 1 billion deal .
two thirds of the value of the world 's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws . two thirds .

let 's talk about our collective journey into the future with artificial intelligence .
now , AI can generate fake faces and simulate your face saying stuff that you never said .
so all this amazing recent progress in AI really be@@ gs the question : how far will it go ?
also , shou@@ ld@@ n 't those people who don 't want human extinction have a say in the matter , too ?
we are not alone in these abilities .
what was remarkable is , they explored this keyboard on their own . there was no intervention on our part .

all kinds of possible senti@@ ent beings may be interconnected through this system , and I can 't wait to see these experiments un@@ fold .
what that means is that what we 're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
I can hardly wait .
JC : today . this is the first time you 're talking about it .

there are lots of music venues on our map .
awesome .
maybe our challenges lie in city infrastructure : public transportation , affordable housing .
next , and this is a very big one , we need leadership , and we need a strategy .
in music cities , from Berlin to Paris to Bogo@@ t@@ Ã¡ , music advisory councils ensure that musicians have a seat at the table .
they 're volunteer councils , and they work directly with a designated advocate inside of city hall or even the chamber of commerce .
talk about and celebrate what your city has .
and three , you can use your vote .
changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .

and today I 'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that 's what 's crucial , how and why they set meaningful and aud@@ acious goals , the right goals for the right reasons .
An@@ dy was a superb leader and also a teacher , and he said to me , " John , it almost do@@ es@@ n 't matter what you know .

and I 'm not a D@@ J , and I 'm not a musi@@ cian , so I 'm a little bit sca@@ red of that .
why consciousness ?
ok@@ ay , the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us , and that is , all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them .
the disappointment of robo@@ tics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot , so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing .
but the second one had an incredible influence , and may still be around , and that is , " Well , if consciousness exists , it 's really something else .
their existence is observer @@@ -@@ @ relative .
that 's the only absolute phenomenon .
so the objection that you can 't have an objective science of consciousness because it 's subjective and science is objective , that 's a pu@@ n .
your mental states are identical with your behavior ?
and I 'm probably not going to do it proper service here , but my interpretation of how it works is that Bit@@ coins are released through this process of mining .

one thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
this problem 's been bu@@ gging me for well over a decade .
now , for a period of three years , I gathered data , not just me but also some of my friends , and I used to teach in university , so I forced my -- I mean , I asked my students to do this as well .
these people I still do hang out with .
in fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar @@@ -@@ @ powered cl@@ ocks project from my youth .
here 's three quick ideas I came up with .
now , when we look at these three ideas together , you 'll notice that the five senses theory do@@ es@@ n 't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
at the top is God , at the bottom is man , mankind , and on the left is the sun , on the right is the moon .
it 's a syllab@@ ary . it 's not exactly an alphabet .

A@@ O : you did teach yourself to play , and as a consequence , playing the piano for you , De@@ rek , was a lot of kn@@ uc@@ k@@ les and kar@@ ate ch@@ ops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
this one is " English Country Garden . "
and having said to your d@@ ad , N@@ ic , that I would try to teach you , I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I was@@ n 't allowed near the piano .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
( appl@@ ause ) But De@@ rek , your ear is so much more than that .
DP : g minor .
most pi@@ an@@ ists would have a heart attack if you said , " Sor@@ ry , do you mind playing ' F@@ light of the B@@ um@@ ble@@ be@@ e ' in B minor instead of A minor ? " as we went on .
and here is De@@ rek 's take on Art Tat@@ um 's take on " Tig@@ er Ra@@ g . "
then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
so that was the goal of my design .
because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I cou@@ ld@@ n 't afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pom@@ p@@ id@@ ou Center in Paris by ourselves .
that was the problem .
but I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
for example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .

RB : I don 't actually think that the stereo@@ type of a business@@ person t@@ reading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works .
what is that ?
RB : yes , I mean , we 've got -- we 're setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word .
and so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important .
but we 're also trying to make them self @@@ -@@ @ sustaining clinics , so that people pay for some other aspects .
so I would like to thank you for that inspiration , and for coming to TED today . thank you .
we throw it away .

and what 's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desper@@ ately sleep @@@ -@@ @ deprived .
good . we 'll talk more about that later , about what are your tips .
very important .
and the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated , but they are physically linked within the brain .
the other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate , make worse , the mental illness state .
so what have we got ?
stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable , we can certainly make them healthier , but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness .
our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre @@@ -@@ @ industrial age , when we were almost wrapped in a du@@ vet .
we used to understand intu@@ i@@ tively the importance of sleep .
this is a pragmatic response to good health .
if you have good sleep , it increases your concentration , attention , decision @@@ -@@ @ making , creativity , social skills , health .
and I can only recommend that you do the same .
on the field of battle , we are brave and noble warri@@ ors .
now I was@@ n 't trying to be smart .
now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers .
( la@@ ughter ) Ano@@ ther thing about pri@@ mes , there is no final biggest prime number .
but the third thing about prime numbers , mathemati@@ cians have always wondered , well at any given moment in time , what is the biggest prime that we know about ?
Don 't f@@ rea@@ k out .
a random odd number is a lot harder to test .
( la@@ ughter ) But ( 2 ^ 13 ) - 1 , ( 2 ^ 17 ) - 1 ( 2 ^ 19 ) - 1 , are all prime numbers .
after that point , they thin out a lot .
word up , L @@@ -@@ @ Do@@ g .
but he did@@ n 't know what the factors were .
he took away one and wrote that number on the board .
it took him , by his estimate , " three years of Sundays . "
this is the largest prime number we knew in 1996 , a very emotional year for me .
( la@@ ughter ) But I came to a realization about my own ability .
put simply , in a room full of randomly selected people , I 'm a ma@@ ths gen@@ ius .
not years ago , not months ago , days ago .
let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful .
this is the Cu@@ be@@ Stor@@ mer II .
it was@@ n 't my highlight of 2012 .
B@@ MA has expanded .
stereotypes have been broken .
it shou@@ ld@@ n 't take minutes or hours to work .
XL : Y@@ EP . you heard it right .
do I shake their hand ? do I turn around and run away ?
but the moment we turned on the laser , like you see now , all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode .
SR : now , in the spirit of the third quote , we want to tell you about a recent project that we 've been working on in lab that we 've called Project In@@ ception .
yes we can .
so what would happen here if , while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box , we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks ?
and yes , it 's an acryl@@ ic painting of a man , but I did@@ n 't paint it on canvas .
I painted it directly on top of the man .
that also means you 're probably going to end up with an ear@@ ful of paint , because I need to paint your ear on your ear .
( audience counting ) Stop . stop , stop , stop .
it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage .
and the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in are enhanced by social contact and social support .
and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable .
and the dams they built in the rivers provided habitats for ot@@ ters and mus@@ k@@ rats and duc@@ ks and fish and rep@@ tiles and amp@@ hibi@@ ans .
but here 's where it gets really interesting .
it 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bar@@ k ?
he used to pick people up here every day .
and so these are questions like , " How can a democracy balance freedom and security ? "
you can see the relationships between the different names themselves .
I could have family and friends read me material , and I could then read it back as many times as I needed .
one of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lo@@ is would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
I 'd written my first co@@ auth@@ ored labor law book on a ty@@ pe@@ writer in 1979 purely from memory .
( la@@ ughter ) I no longer would be cen@@ sored .
he then turned to being a water@@ sk@@ ier and was a champion disabled water@@ sk@@ ier .
do you love being read to ?
but I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't give up the technology , because it 's allowed me to lead a great life .
it 's carried in the bit@@ es of infected mosqu@@ it@@ os , and it 's probably our oldest scourge .
we 've got 300 million cases a year and over half a million deaths .
now this really makes no sense .
these two environments are totally different , but not only that , they 're both utterly hostile .
so the in@@ sect is continually trying to fight off the paras@@ ite , and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off .
and each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other , they have totally different physi@@ ology .
we can do more education , we can try to convince these people to use the nets .
OK . so , the first one I was very tim@@ id , and I 'll begin .
and actually , he was . I think he 's dead , though I don 't know , maybe he 's not dead .
do you have that ?
this is what someone that specializes in malware and h@@ acking looks like .
today 's cyber@@ criminal , what do they look like ?
let me show you how most malware is now distributed today .
find these resources . apply them .
for me , I like to call him Frank .
do you have an American Express in your wal@@ let ?
if I did it slowly , it 'd be on your shoulder .
do you remember what it was ?
can I show them ? rather b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re . is this yours , si@@ r ?
and it can be very impressive to watch them at work .
so you can imagine that building a soft robot is a very different process than sti@@ ff robo@@ tics , where you have links , gears , scre@@ ws that you must combine in a very defined way .
you see the camera fixed on top .
and here you see the soft robot in action , and it just goes inside .
it goes around .
this makes it possible to reach many different targets , such as tum@@ ors , deep inside a solid organ by using one single insertion point .
but of course , we are not even close to what nature fig@@ ured out in millions of years of evolution .
this is our life with be@@ es , and this is our life without be@@ es .
these people are moving pol@@ len from flower to flower with a pa@@ int@@ brush .
tom@@ ato grow@@ ers now put bum@@ ble@@ be@@ e colonies inside the greenhouse to pol@@ lin@@ ate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pol@@ l@@ ination when it 's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes .
humans have been drawn to hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es since early recorded history , mostly to harvest their honey , which is an amazing natural swee@@ ten@@ er .
I was 18 years old and bo@@ red , and I picked up a book in the library on be@@ es and I spent the night reading it .
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies .
so I went to work for a commercial be@@ e@@ keeper , a family that owned 2,000 hi@@ ves of be@@ es in New Mexico .
hon@@ ey@@ be@@ es can be considered a super @@@ -@@ @ organism , where the colony is the organism and it 's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual be@@ e organisms .
now this society has no central authority .
for example , we study hygiene , where some be@@ es are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest , from the colony , and it keeps the colony healthy .
and more recently , we 've been studying res@@ ins that be@@ es collect from plants .
so seven years ago , when hon@@ ey@@ be@@ e colonies were reported to be dying en mas@@ se , first in the United States , it was clear that there was something really , really wrong .
the very farms that used to sustain be@@ es are now agricultural food deser@@ ts , dominated by one or two plant species like corn and so@@ y@@ beans .
and they 're tr@@ uc@@ ked in in semi @@@ -@@ @ loads , and they must be tr@@ uc@@ ked out , because after blo@@ om , the al@@ mond or@@ ch@@ ards are a vast and flow@@ er@@ less landscape .
how much is it going to take to contam@@ inate humans ?
this is a new class of insecti@@ cides .
campaign to have them planted in public gardens , community spaces , mead@@ ows .
and we need to diversify our farms .
so let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large @@@ -@@ @ scale change .
and we call that the mem@@ e @@@ -@@ @ ome .
so from this , we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection , but luc@@ k@@ ily , computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space .
and I want to kind of zoom in on that and see if we can get a little more resolution .
this is their kind of reson@@ ance for the conversation around the environment .
now often , when we 're faced with this amount of content , we do a couple of things to simplify it .
and so then we might say , well , gratitude , that was last year .
you don 't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather .
they are home .
very different than nation @@@ -@@ @ states , which are abstr@@ actions .
you can run for the Senate out of a different state , but it 's hard to do that as a mayor .
and as a result , mayors and city coun@@ cillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level , and this is the third feature about mayors , than national governing officials .
they work together in climate change , for example .
Bogo@@ ta , where Mayor M@@ ock@@ us , when he was mayor , he introduced a transportation system that saved energy , that allowed surface buses to run in effect like sub@@ ways , express buses with corridors .
in that journey from pol@@ is to Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ is , we can re@@ discover the power of democracy on a global level .
and the only question is , are you ?
and one night , the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal .
and really , that 's where this case should have ended .
well , why ?
but maybe my work has made me different from most people .
[ ... in the dark ] ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) So what is the difference , then , between the way I believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived ?
and it 's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don 't know .
so I don 't mean stup@@ idity , I don 't mean a cal@@ low indifference to fact or reason or data .
so that 's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today , but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts ?
how can you ever know all of this ?
so I 've been up here a little over 10 minutes , I 've already lost three papers .
so what do we do about this ? well , the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect , if you will .
one is , how can a simple little molec@@ ule like that create a perception in your brain that 's so clear as a pe@@ ar or a ban@@ ana ?
and the fellow said , " Ab@@ solu@@ tely nothing .
and Lu@@ ria said , " At the North Pole , there is always snow .
and you can get moral argument off the ground , then , because you 're not treating moral principles as concrete entities .
you would probably begin by saying , " To do what ? "
trust is the response .
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trust@@ worthy .
how to do it ?
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of s@@ ocks of the color I wanted .
so , of course , with lots of program@@ mable computers and robots around , this is an easy thing to picture .
how many of you know what I 'm talking about ?
raise your right hand .
you guys have very insecure computers , OK ?
the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional folding .
so I 've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA .
one of my first questions doing this was : how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA ?
so the net effect of all 250 of these str@@ ands is to fold the long str@@ and into the shape you 're looking for .
and if it 's the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic .
so he says , " All right . "
and ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it , principally having to do with vision .
it might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States .
( la@@ ughter ) Well , it turns out that these probably we@@ ren 't bad guys .
and as it turns out , timing is also really , really important .
and finally -- there were the photos .
( la@@ ughter ) On@@ ce I had all of this information , I was able to create a super profile , so it was still me , but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem .
let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances .
did he drink half a bottle of whis@@ key and then draw the hall@@ uc@@ ination he got from being drunk onto paper ?
now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle .
( la@@ ughter ) So that 's all that happens .
I could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whis@@ key , and that I should rather drink it .
but let me show you a slow motion in a completely dar@@ k@@ ened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration .
so what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom , burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol .
thank you very much .
Arm@@ strong and Al@@ dr@@ in were alone , but their presence on the moon 's gray surface was the culmination of a con@@ vul@@ sive , collective effort .
the A@@ pol@@ lo program was the greatest peace@@ time mobilization in the history of the United States .
A@@ pol@@ lo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
twelve walked on its surface , of whom Al@@ dr@@ in , following the death of Arm@@ strong last year , is now the most senior .
in the middle years of the century , polio was eradicated and small@@ po@@ x eliminated .
you hear it all the time .
silic@@ on Valley says the markets are to blame , in particular the incentives that venture capit@@ alists offer to entrepreneurs .
we could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the outline of a plan .
we won 't go to Mars , because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth .
but 30 years of research have taught us that fam@@ ines are political crises that catastro@@ ph@@ ically affect food distribution .
if you go to an am@@ us@@ ement park and don 't want to stand in the long lines for the popular ri@@ des , there is now a solution .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
in Washington , D.C. , long lines , qu@@ eu@@ es sometimes form for important Congres@@ sional hearings .
so now , for lob@@ by@@ ists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don 't like to wait , there are companies , line @@@ -@@ @ standing companies , and you can go to them .
for two reasons , I think .
one of them has to do with inequality .
so let 's see what -- Some people are in favor , some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement .
and let 's say it 's a foundation . they will provide the funds .
H@@ M : well , the intrinsic motivation should be to learn .
Elizabeth L@@ of@@ tus : I 'm Elizabeth L@@ of@@ tus , and you said worth a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?
you 'd measure how many -- EL : how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them .
H@@ M : to be frank , I just think this is , not to off@@ end anyone , a very American way .
now , what this , even this brief debate , brings out is something that many economists overlook .
I know it . I 'm seeing it .
and the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset .
you can re@@ make your streets quickly , in@@ expen@@ sively , it can provide immediate benefits , and it can be quite popular .
when we started out , we did some early surveys about how our streets were used , and we found that New York City was largely a city without seats .
we closed Broad@@ way from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
but the results were overwhelming .
it was like a Star Tre@@ k episode , you know ?
you can have fun with paint .
all told , we 've created over 50 pedestrian pl@@ az@@ as in all five bor@@ ough@@ s across the city .
but I can 't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods .
I love this because it looks so easy .
after this big expansion , you 've seen no net increase in injuries , and so there is something to that ax@@ i@@ om that there is safety in numbers .
one Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n paper called this bike lane that we have on Pro@@ spec@@ t Park West " the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip . "
so if you di@@ g below the head@@ lines , though , you 'll see that the people were far ahead of the press , far ahead of the politicians .
the bikes are being used six times a day .
quite radical .
but even in modern times , relations have been close at times .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evapor@@ ated .
the more Iran got isolated , the more peace there would be .
so according to In@@ dy@@ k , and these are his words , the Iran@@ ians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment .
Tehran was not interested .
it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
there are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ rus , where you perceive faces .
how do you test this ?
tables and chairs and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvan@@ ic skin response is flat .
it 'll p@@ at his brother on the shoulder , it 'll answer the phone when it rings , it 'll wave good@@ b@@ ye .
some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
but that costs millions of dollars .
he had a br@@ ach@@ ial av@@ ulsion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the arm was paraly@@ zed , lying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the arm was ampu@@ t@@ ated .
he had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm , ex@@ cruci@@ atin@@ g@@ ly painful , and he cou@@ ld@@ n 't move it .
" now , " I said , " now , look , w@@ ig@@ g@@ le your ph@@ an@@ tom -- your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . "
stroke you normally think of as damage to the fi@@ bers , nothing you can do about it .
one of the two aspects of this problem are very intri@@ gu@@ ing .
so , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trim@@ med down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
so , if there 's a gene causing this trim@@ ming and if that gene mut@@ ates , then you get deficient trim@@ ming between adjacent brain areas .
normal people say , she 's warm like the sun , she 's radi@@ ant like the sun , she 's nurturing like the sun .
well , it 's one or two mu@@ tants .
now , none of you is a Mar@@ tian . how did you do that ?
the patient says , " Well , if it 's metallic and sh@@ in@@ y , it do@@ es@@ n 't mean it 's gold .
there were many epidemics there .
after 10 years of working overseas , I was exhausted .
and that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed .
and then a bun@@ ch of community activities for changing norms .
yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce HIV and reduce diar@@ rhe@@ al diseases in places with aw@@ ful economies without healing the economy .
some of them were new stories .
and for a while they were familiar formats , but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium .
it was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
she captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time .
I double checked the newspapers .
he 's always taking off his sun@@ glasses or turning to the camera , but these things just happen in text .
I think in non@@ fiction real @@@ -@@ @ time stor@@ yt@@ elling , there are a lot of really excellent examples as well .
they are the bits that we use to create the structures , the frames , that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experi@@ mentation .
and they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
first of all , it 's China 's economic performance over the past 30 years .
I want to be able to do what China 's doing .
what this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy , is we 've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way , and that has its roots in economics .
at its very best , the Western model speaks for itself .
but what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more , something that would be better than what we have right now ?
I would argue the same thing that makes you more Sustain@@ ble is what gives you a higher quality of life , and that 's living in a wal@@ k@@ able neighborhood .
so sustainability , which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability .
doing so is@@ n 't easy , but it can be done , it has been done , and it 's being done now in more than a few cities , around the globe and in our country .
now I 'm head of a biom@@ ater@@ ials lab , and I 'm really fasc@@ inated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time .
it 's hard . it 's durable .
and this led him to propose that material as a new material for intra@@ oc@@ ular lenses .
and bone is actually quite good at repairing .
and we simplified it a lot , so we got rid of a lot of these steps .
so it creates , in essence , an artificial cav@@ ity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
this is a hi@@ st@@ ology slide of what we see when we do that , and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone .
you can see here a very squ@@ ish@@ y one and now a material that 's also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable tough@@ ness , and it 's no longer b@@ rit@@ tle .
now 60 years later , the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for , like here , where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall .
about eight years ago , people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower .
within the tower , people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower .
designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven 't had any education in architecture or design .
and with each inhabit@@ ant finding their own unique way of coming by , this tower becomes like a living city , a place which is alive with micro @@@ -@@ @ economies and small businesses .
today , they live in this area , approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people , who live in this community of self @@@ -@@ @ built multi @@@ -@@ @ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration , Z@@ ita C@@ ob@@ b , the founder of the wonderful Sho@@ ref@@ ast Foundation , based out of F@@ ogo Island , New@@ found@@ land .
I 'm a writer and artist , and I make work about technology .
( la@@ ughter ) And I do these things mostly because I find them completely fascinating , but also because I think when we talk about technology , we 're largely talking about ourselves and the way that we understand the world .
I think there 's way , way more of these .
here 's another thing that 's really big on kids ' YouTube .
this is the very first one I could find .
and the more time you start to spend with them , the cra@@ z@@ ier and cra@@ z@@ ier you start to feel that you might be .
so the main way people get views on their videos -- and remember , views mean money -- is that they stuff the titles of these videos with these popular terms .
and so there 's auto@@ play , where it just keeps playing these videos over and over and over in a loop , end@@ lessly for hours and hours at a time .
and this stuff really , really does affect small children .
it 's like , how much do we really understand -- by agency , I mean : how we know how to act in our own best interests .
so all of these things we 're working to address within this are not going to be addressed just by building the technology better , but actually by changing the society that 's producing these technologies .
H@@ W : James , it 's such an important discussion , and I know many people here are really open and prepared to have it , so thanks for starting off our morning .
I 'd pump him for information , I 'm mentally scri@@ b@@ bling notes for the stories I plan to write .
only months later , I discover who he really was .
he was the China representative for the American So@@ y@@ bean Association .

we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't do .
and for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
and then more years pass , and the cancer begins to grow .
this time , there 's new treatments on the horizon .
they 're exotic . they 're experimental .
they 're going to attack the cancer in new ways .
I say , " Ke@@ ep him alive if you can . "
it was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ life care , and of healthcare for all of us .
and they were readily available .
how can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
the medical professionals too , you out there , you 're in denial too .
in the same span of time , computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude .
meaning , in fact , that farmers are rational and profit @@@ -@@ @ minded just like everybody else .
and that business is agriculture .
we know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market , and the risks of trans@@ acting in rural , agriculture markets , are extremely high .
in Africa , small farmers bear the br@@ unt of this risk .
this is a tragic example of arrested development , or a bud@@ ding green revolution stopped in its tracks .
this is powered by low @@@ -@@ @ cost V@@ SAT technology , aggres@@ sively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market .
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open out@@ cry , because we don 't think the country 's ready for full electronic trading .
EC@@ x is the market for Ethiopia 's new millennium , which starts in about eight months .
we believe that the stakes are high , but that the returns will be even greater .
Ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value .
about 25 years in total , and then three years ago , I found myself talking to I@@ K@@ EA 's CEO about joining his team .
the second number is six : this is six degrees centi@@ grade , what we 're heading towards in terms of global warming .
now there are 500 cities , nearly , with a million people or more in them .
so think about it .
we will go all in .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
we 've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children 's rights .
thank you .
the battle against malaria is being won , with deaths from malaria down 27 percent , according to the latest World Bank data .
this shou@@ ld@@ n 't surprise us , because actually , everybody grows .
foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years .
now , that 's completely changed now .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don 't always succeed , but they try and deliver .
very good . I think you 're secret@@ ly saying to your head , probably five and a half percent .
and if I lay sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story , it 's remarkably similar .
twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan African growth is slightly better than India .
people with hearing loss often hall@@ uc@@ inate music or voices , sometimes as elaborate as the c@@ ac@@ op@@ hon@@ y of an entire mar@@ ching band .
patients with sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia often have elevated levels of ser@@ ot@@ onin in the brain .
but it 's clear that hall@@ uc@@ in@@ atory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary perception than we once thought .
the war @@@ -@@ @ loving Amaz@@ ons , " the equals of men " in courage and skill , were familiar to everyone in ancient Greece .
it was long assumed that they were imag@@ inary , like the cycl@@ ops and cen@@ ta@@ urs .
and , because a female mounted arch@@ er could be as fast and as deadly as a male , all children were trained to ride and shoot .
this amaz@@ ed the ancient Greeks , whose women led restricted indoor lives .
but in later representations , they wi@@ el@@ ded bo@@ ws and battle @@@ -@@ @ axes , ro@@ de horses , and wore pointed caps and patter@@ ned tro@@ users characteristic of step@@ pe nom@@ ads .
more than 1,000 ancient S@@ cy@@ th@@ ian k@@ ur@@ gans , or burial moun@@ ds , have been excav@@ ated , containing sk@@ elet@@ ons and weapons .
the women 's sk@@ elet@@ ons show battle injuries : ribs sl@@ ashed by s@@ words , sk@@ ul@@ ls b@@ ashed by battle @@@ -@@ @ axes , and arrows embedded in bones .
is it possible that the my@@ thic realm of thr@@ illing Amazon tales was a way to imagine women and men as equal compan@@ ions ?
( la@@ ughter ) But I think the dry statistics of what 's known as transit @@@ -@@ @ oriented development only tells part of the story .
second : Regulation .
they 're susceptible to human error .
those have such a wide turning radius , that we have to deploy an enormous amount of pa@@ vement , of asph@@ alt , to accommodate them .
or take the critically important wheelchair .

it 's a fear of difference , and architects hear this all the time from their clients : " if I try that new idea , will I be su@@ ed ?
so what do I mean by that ?
that , to me , only implies that there 's even more congestion on the roads , frankly .
and if you think that 's out@@ lan@@ dish , you 'd be amaz@@ ed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity .
all of these ideas , to me , are no@@ st@@ alg@@ ia @@@ -@@ @ free .
and I just cur@@ dled with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y that year , until I hat@@ ched my de@@ vious plan .
and then I did it .
all of those A 's . ( la@@ ughter ) And I got ready to return the book to the draw@@ er , when hang on , some of my other class@@ mates had app@@ all@@ ingly good grades too .
I don 't understand why I felt so great doing it .
I was never caught .
we know pri@@ mates do . blue@@ birds are actually very prone .
I don 't know . I think it cuts very close to the bone , because let 's think about what happens when we feel je@@ alous .
je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is exhaus@@ ting .
when S@@ wan@@ n is in his je@@ alous thro@@ es , and suddenly he 's listening at door@@ ways and bri@@ bing his mi@@ stress ' servants , he def@@ ends these behavi@@ ors .
is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?

in the eye of a theoretical phy@@ sic@@ ist , the H@@ ig@@ gs bos@@ on is a cle@@ ver explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass , but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution .
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
it surro@@ unds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .
and eventually , the H@@ ig@@ gs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself .
at first , the first thing I thought was , I want to run away .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
thank you very much .
that 's Europe . " but , ye@@ ah .
the nano@@ technology sector is actually fascinating to study this , because the word itself , nano@@ technology , came from within government .
if the state is thought about in this more strategic way , as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism , because that 's what we 're talking about , right ?
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and I was living on the dark side .
all of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen .
night after night , he took me up on the terrace , on his shoulders , and pointed out J@@ up@@ iter and Satur@@ n and the Great Be@@ ar to me .

my Ge@@ ig@@ er counter do@@ si@@ meter , which measures radiation , was going ber@@ ser@@ k , and the closer I got , the more fre@@ ne@@ tic it became , and fran@@ tic . my God .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run deci@@ de@@ dly differently .

the power of mo@@ therland so fundamental to that part of the world seems pal@@ li@@ ative .
they have cultivated a brand of professionalism , business ac@@ umen and innovation .
they have invented nar@@ co @@@ -@@ @ sub@@ mar@@ ines and boats that are not detected by radar .
when they 're entering a new market , they send a family member to supervise it , or , if they 're partnering with a new organization , they create a family tie , either through marriages or other types of ties .
which is why wonderful organizations like Brid@@ ges to Pro@@ sper@@ ity build bridges in this kind of place -- this is in Rwanda .
in our world of construction , the changes seem positively gl@@ ac@@ ial .
it 's in my blood .
concrete gets a pretty bad name sometimes , but in the hands of people like Rud@@ y Ric@@ ci@@ o@@ tti here , look what you can do with it .
thank you .
immediately , the paraly@@ zed rat can stand .
and what this is is that it is wholesale blan@@ ket surveillance on everyone .
they are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrong@@ do@@ ings .
they 're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
they even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
but people are brut@@ ally honest with the Internet , and when these leaks started , many people were asking me about this .
and when the leaks started , the very first thing I t@@ wee@@ ted about this was a comment about how , when you 've been using search engines , you 've been potentially lea@@ king all that to U.S. intelligence .
what am I sending to worry about this ? am I sending naked pictures or something ?
let 's look at that last equation .
now I was getting a little anxious .
my training had started .
" go for it , brother . "
in fact , I 've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven 't quite found theirs yet .
maybe a year passes , nothing .
he 's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
that small town k@@ id with the big city dreams was the suicide bom@@ ber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
for young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
what if I had been forced into that same state of wai@@ thood ?
what makes his story different ?
he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , " Ne@@ ver . "
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
raise your hand . ye@@ ah ?
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a City started in the most unique way imagin@@ able .
there was no ba@@ il@@ out on the horizon .
so I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there .
and I weighed 220 pounds .
we had also not required developers to build side@@ walks on new developments for a long , long time .
it was taking place inside the homes , mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids .
and then came the next stage of the equation .
it was time to push what I called MA@@ PS 3 .
it 's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you , the player , the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
so you can see up here .
now , if we had more people in the room , instead of just wrestling in a closed node , we might reach out and try and grab some other people .
and we have to connect both levels , so if you 're up there , you 're going to be reaching down and reaching up .
this is called the Death Star Configuration .
any science ge@@ e@@ ks , you get that one .
stand up ! it 's easier if you stand up .
everybody , up up up up up !
Don 't start wrestling yet .
creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thum@@ bs into the node .
we had excitement . as you started to wrest@@ le , maybe you 're starting to win or this person 's , like , really into it , so you kind of get the excitement going .
we had joy . you were laugh@@ ing , smil@@ ing . look at your faces . this room is full of joy .
and speaking of physical connection , you guys know I love the hormone oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in , you release oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in , you feel bonded to everyone in the room .
thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game .
this is what he had to say .
we will not have a vocal ch@@ ord left , " S@@ ous@@ a said .
it 's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re @@@ -@@ @ creation of their culture . in that sense , it 's read @@@ -@@ @ write .
a culture which is top @@@ -@@ @ down , owned , where the vocal ch@@ ords of the millions have been lost .
never before in the history of human culture had it been as profession@@ alized , never before as concentrated .
so , between 1931 and 1939 , they raised rates by some 448 percent , until the broadcasters finally got together and said , ok@@ ay , enough of this .
so , we need something different , we need a different kind of solution .
we 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest bu@@ ff@@ alo@@ s in Gabon , ele@@ ph@@ ants , and even tur@@ tle ne@@ sts .
that would give us bi@@ ologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests .
to the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
they published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
take for example the case of lions .
so I created this , the Car@@ ne@@ gie Air@@ borne Observatory , or CA@@ O .
this is how we see a rain@@ forest , in kal@@ e@@ id@@ os@@ cop@@ ic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another .
we can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red , and the Amazon River and flo@@ od@@ plain cutting right through it .
the canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce .
the 2010 mega @@@ -@@ @ drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe .
this area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil , totally un@@ explored , almost totally unknown scientifically .
look at this 100 @@@ -@@ @ square @@@ -@@ @ kilome@@ ter g@@ ash in the forest created by gold miners .
so what we 've been doing is using the laser @@@ -@@ @ guided spec@@ tro@@ sc@@ op@@ y from the CA@@ O to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rain@@ forest .
my six si@@ bl@@ ings and I were good kids , but caused our fair share of trouble .
I saw new and previously un@@ th@@ ink@@ able possibilities to live and contribute , both for myself and others in my circumstance .
I inspected the solar panels on our roof . ( la@@ ughter ) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the dr@@ one on our basketball ho@@ op .
could we do the same for transportation ?
we 're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake .
compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
if it is a new paradigm , though , there must be other uses for it .
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
half a billion of us live in meg@@ ac@@ ities .
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repos@@ itories of knowledge .
so yesterday , I was out in the street in front of this building , and I was walking down the side@@ walk , and I had company , several of us , and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down side@@ walks .
you up for that ? ok@@ ay .
ok@@ ay . what I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight .
so we need to think about it here .
we want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful .
everything we do is an approxim@@ ation of sophistic@@ ation .
now , if ne@@ ur@@ ons are the functional information processing units of the brain , then the owners of these two bra@@ ins should have similar cognitive abilities .
maybe the human brain actually has the most ne@@ ur@@ ons of any brain , regardless of its size , especially in the cere@@ br@@ al cor@@ te@@ x .
so , a ro@@ dent brain with 86 billion ne@@ ur@@ ons would weigh 36 kil@@ os .
we are pri@@ mates , so the correct comparison is to other pri@@ mates .
and it turns out that both human and other bra@@ ins cost about the same , an average of six cal@@ ories per billion ne@@ ur@@ ons per day .
that 's the first time I 've ever played it .
in turn , that regulates everything from breathing rate to heart@@ beat , body temperature , and dig@@ estion .
and it 's not just beautiful .
now the chip is really beautiful , but what can we do with it ?
let me show you .
in that tiny chip , you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection .
we did@@ n 't stop with the lung on a chip .
you can see one right here .
now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can flu@@ id@@ ically link them .
we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household clean@@ ers .
and we are living in a unique moment in history .
ships have automation now .
not all of them , but some of them were , because for the minority of un@@ scrup@@ ulous ship owners , it can be easy to hide behind the anonym@@ ity offered by some flags of convenience .
and if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries ' carbon emissions , it would come in about sixth , somewhere near Germany .
and in fact , shipping has a role to play here , because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures .
and the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right wh@@ ale has been reduced by up to 90 percent .
they had good salaries , but theirs is still an isol@@ ating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element .
in Gan@@ do , there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water , and no school .
for this reason , I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family .
today , not so much has changed .
fundraising was not an easy task .
I even asked my class@@ mates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes , but to sponsor my school project .
I started to build a prototype like that .
and see now , we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings , but we often don 't have so much material .
another factor in Gan@@ do is rain .
but for us , the rain is good .
around this half of the country , most of your ca@@ ves are made of lime@@ stone .
the second most exciting thing for a cave explo@@ rer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .
if you squ@@ ish a handful of snow to make a snow@@ ball , it gets really small , hard and dense .
but the we@@ ir@@ dest thing about gl@@ ac@@ ier ca@@ ves is that the entire cave is moving , because it 's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that 's slowly sliding down the mountain .
he and I have both been exploring ca@@ ves a long time and we 've been climbing mountains a long time , but neither one of us had ever really explored a gl@@ ac@@ ier cave before .
so in July of that year , we went out on the gl@@ ac@@ ier , and we found a big crack in the ice .
we had to build snow and ice anch@@ ors so that we could tie off ro@@ pes and rap@@ pel down into the hole .
well , cave maps are@@ n 't like trail maps or road maps because they have p@@ its and holes going to overlapping levels .
to make a cave map , you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave , and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations .
then you use a comp@@ ass and an in@@ clin@@ ometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings .
there was a huge pit or shaft called a mou@@ lin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the gl@@ ac@@ ier .
it was so cold outside , we actually had to sleep inside the cave .
B@@ rent named this cave P@@ ure Im@@ ag@@ ination , I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined .
well not too much lives in them because they 're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year .
it 's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years , and it 's just now starting to s@@ pro@@ ut .
not only would it lift , but it might never return .
someone who is , as the It@@ alians say , " g@@ ago@@ ot@@ z . "
that 's not going to do anything terrible to him . "
( la@@ ughter ) Well , they were happy as could be , because he had@@ n 't said a rational word in the weeks of observation .
and to their amaz@@ ement , after it was over , he began speaking like he was perfectly well .
and let me tell you this story .
it had to do with death and disease and lots of other things .
that proved to be a lot of bo@@ vine ster@@ cus .
and they tried everything they had .
well , I was a grown man who had all of these rit@@ uals , and it got so there was a th@@ rob@@ bing , there was a fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ous fear in my head .
you 've seen this painting by Ed@@ v@@ ard Mun@@ ch , " The S@@ cream . "
and he du@@ g in his he@@ els and said , " No . I know this man better than any of you .
well , the Gil@@ bert and Sul@@ li@@ van fans in this room will remember " Rud@@ dig@@ ore , " and they will remember M@@ ad Marg@@ aret , and they will remember that she was married to a f@@ ella named Sir Des@@ par@@ d M@@ urg@@ atro@@ y@@ d .
( la@@ ughter ) But I had something better .
every once in a while , I get somewhat depressed and a little ob@@ sessional .
things change .
something from childhood comes back to ha@@ unt you .
there is redemption .
through this act of immense open @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ tedness , he was to become the embo@@ di@@ ment of what in South Africa we call " u@@ buntu . "
without you , I 'm just a guy talking to an empty room , and I spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it 's not the same as this .
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet .
I make an instant decision that I 'll never look at that again .
now these studies are ing@@ en@@ ious , but they 're simple .
ancient Egypt had such my@@ ths , ancient Babylon , ancient India .
and it stays with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical organism .
but again , there are skep@@ tics who doubt whether legacy really is im@@ mortality .
by 2010 , De@@ tro@@ it had become the poster child for an American city in crisis .
between 1950 and 2000 , the region grows by 30 percent .
there are very important people , business and land assets in De@@ tro@@ it , and there are real opportunities there .
on October 14th , before we discovered it , it made its closest approach to the Earth , within about 15 million miles .
well , I could think of a million things , but there 's what you want and what you can have , and ' O@@ um@@ u@@ am@@ ua was moving away and f@@ ading very rapidly .
so this is about all the time we were going to have to study it easily .
now I bet most of you don 't have careers that critically depend on whether or not it 's clou@@ dy last night .
in the case of ' O@@ um@@ u@@ am@@ ua , it reflected more red light , making it look very much like the organic rich surface of the com@@ et recently visited by the Ros@@ e@@ tta spacecraft .
we 're part of a much larger environment , and in fact , we may even be surrounded by inter@@ stell@@ ar visitors and not even know it .
this unexpected gift has perhaps raised more questions than its provided answers , but we were the first to say hel@@ lo to a visitor from another solar system .
will future technologies like the Large Syn@@ optic Survey Tel@@ es@@ cope help us detect these things sooner ?
JI : awesome , thanks so much . let 's thank Karen again .
E@@ in@@ stein said that " I never think about the future - it comes soon enough . "
industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see , hear , feel a lot more than ever before , generating pro@@ di@@ gious amounts of data .
of course , electronic sensors have been around for some time , but something has changed : a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and , thanks to advances in cloud computing , a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data .
they are self @@@ -@@ @ aware , they are predic@@ tive , reactive and social .
it 's jet engines , locomo@@ tives , gas turbines , medical devices , communicating seam@@ lessly with each other and with us .
it 's self @@@ -@@ @ learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss .
or take healthcare .
if all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken , they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster .
and innovation is disrup@@ tive .
it makes products more affordable .
second , there is a concern that in the future , there will only be room for engineers , data scientists , and other highly @@@ -@@ @ specialized workers .
there are people who argue that today 's innovation is all about social media and sil@@ ly games , with nowhere near the transform@@ ational power of the Industrial Revolution .
they 've made our lives healthier and more rewarding .
and the new wave of innovation which is beginning to swee@@ p through industry is no different .
I had two advantages as I went into the fight .
but then I discovered something .
and I get letters , I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what 's worked for them .
I said , " What kind of trouble did you have ? "
I can 't go on this way , and I 've fig@@ ured out how I 'm going to end it if I don 't get better . "
and major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken .
chances are , if you 're living on less than four dollars a day , and you 're an ampu@@ tee , you 've lost your lim@@ b in a vehicle accident .
it 's also about human performance .
we see that they squ@@ at . they k@@ ne@@ el in prayer .
so the second thing we learned , and this leads into my second point , which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user @@@ -@@ @ centric .
do they all get there on time ? the supply chain .
( clicking ) Noti@@ ce anything about it ?
that 's a hom@@ em@@ ade noise dam@@ pen@@ er .
we also saw that our users had modified it in other ways .
and if you look at the knee , it 's got those poin@@ ty edges , right ?
we did a lot of iter@@ ations , not just around this , but some other things .
and this goes into my last point .
our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user .
not only have I tried four times , but the greatest sw@@ imm@@ ers in the world have been trying since 1950 , and it 's still never been done .
it 's an expedition of some 30 people .
and the debate has ra@@ ged , h@@ as@@ n 't it , since the Greeks , of is@@ n 't it what it 's all about ?
of course there are .
it was a very real moment , with that crowd , with my team .
the three things I did sort of blur@@ t out when we got there , was first : never , ever give up .
that allowed us to watch participants ' consum@@ matory behavior .
in one of the studies , we bring rich and poor members of the community into the lab , and give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars .
they 'll never meet that stranger ; the stranger will never meet them .
he approaches as the red truck successfully stops .
there 's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top lab@@ s all over the world , show@@ casing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse .
Hello , TE@@ D@@ Women , what is up ?
a lot of people with CP don 't walk , but my parents did@@ n 't believe in " can 't . "
( la@@ ughter ) G@@ rowing up , there were only six Arabs in my town , and they were all my family .
and I 'm from Jersey , and we are really concerned with being ch@@ ic , so if my friends wore he@@ els , so did I.
( la@@ ughter ) But one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
College was im@@ itating life .
my big break came in 2010 .
and she looked at me and she went , " Five , four , three , two ... "
" yo , is she ret@@ arded ? "
the disabled are the largest - Y@@ ea@@ h , cla@@ p for that , man . come on .
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 D@@ NC .
I like one of the definitions that Al@@ an K@@ ay has for technology .
what are its tendencies over time ? one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms , which we 've heard a lot about .
and the trick that Richard D@@ aw@@ kins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
this is not on another planet . these are things that are hidden away on our planet .
but a more interesting way , the current way to take the long view , is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective .
those fun@@ gi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans .
and if we take the long @@@ -@@ @ term trends of life , if we begin to say , what does evolution want ? there 's several things that we see .
we see the movement from a general @@@ -@@ @ purpose cell to the more specific and specialized .
and we see a drift towards complexity that 's very intuitive .
like those chloro@@ pl@@ ast cells -- they 're completely surrounded by other life .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co @@@ -@@ @ evolution .
and he was the King of England , and that was the entire wealth of England at the time .
in fact , you can buy , for 50 buc@@ ks , a stone @@@ -@@ @ age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago .
it 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas .
that 's the definition of " infinite game . " a finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing .
there was no difference whatsoever . and at the Big Ban@@ g , what it expanded was the potential for difference .
that 's what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms .
imagine Van Go@@ gh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints .
we have a moral obligation to inv@@ ent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .
we want a trillion z@@ il@@ lion species of one individuals .
maybe in some ways the fact that what we 're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it .
all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology . this is the infinite game .
that 's what we 're talking about .
you see , technology is a way to evolve the evolution .
and if you play that well , you 'll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone .
but really , the question is , why ? right ?
and you can trans@@ cend time by sending a message at your convenience , and someone else can pick it up at their convenience .
and the mobile phone , in addition , is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it 's convenient .
so we forget , but we 're also adap@@ table , and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .
it 's where you expect to find stuff .
I 'm sending money back , and it works like this .
they also write them in Hind@@ i .
and China is a country where you get a lot of f@@ akes .
this is how it 's shifting .
and for the next three decades , I was on and off various di@@ ets .
that 's what a thermo@@ stat does , right ?
five years after a diet , most people have reg@@ ained the weight .
at worst , they ru@@ in lives : weight ob@@ session leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
what if we told all those di@@ e@@ ting girls that it 's ok@@ ay to eat when they 're hungry ?
my d@@ ad 's the guy with the cigarette .
he 's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MI@@ T , where I also have a position , and we were talking about cancer .
and Andrew had been doing his own bits of research , and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from studying the literature was that there 's actually a big bottlenec@@ k .
so we took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open @@@ -@@ @ source license to anybody that wanted it .
and we had a long list .
I happened to look out the window , and hand on my heart , on the night of this conference -- it was the sum@@ mer@@ time -- and that 's what I saw , a double rain@@ bow .
how do we do that ?
so , it might not be enough .
we need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
so to conclude , we can say that research in the human@@ ities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago .
and were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park , the music would f@@ ade to silence , and the play button would disappear .
to the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp , but under a micro@@ scope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye .
let 's consider the big three : HIV , malaria , tuberculosis .
I 'd like to now switch to talk about another key short@@ coming of today 's vaccines , and that is the need to maintain the cold chain .
a key attribute of our Nan@@ op@@ at@@ ch is that the vaccine is dry , and when it 's dry it do@@ es@@ n 't need refrigeration .
within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Cel@@ sius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all .
and the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nan@@ op@@ at@@ ch within the laboratory setting .
but I also had noticed that it was@@ n 't working .
SS : Oh , ye@@ ah . PM : what was that story ?
PM : and in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you 've learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons .
PM : and you did focus in the book -- and the reason , as you said , in writing it , was to create a dialogue about this .
I met one of them , I was in Beijing .
I looked at them , we went around and introduced ourselves , and they all said their names and where they 're from , and I said , I 'm Sher@@ yl Sand@@ berg , and this was my dream .
PM : have you been surprised by the global nature of the message ?
there is a circle that 's been started for rescu@@ ed sex workers in Miami .
PM : if you were invited now to make another TE@@ D@@ Women talk , what would you say that is a result of this experience , for you personally , and what you 've learned about women , and men , as you 've made this journey ?
about taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world .
he shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm .
in the end , I accepted the job without actually having been here .
so , it was just before the time that the Leon@@ ardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Me@@ t , to New York , to see my new domain .
to see what European sculpture and decorative arts looked like , beyond those Renaissance collections with which I was so already familiar .
and I thought to myself : what the hell have I done ?
there was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and , in fact , if there was any emo@@ tion going on , it was a kind of rep@@ ulsion .
( la@@ ughter ) So , I started thinking about why it was , in fact , that I dis@@ liked this object so much .
where all the little girls would come either as a prin@@ cess or a fairy .
there was one who would come as a fairy prin@@ cess .
it was a Dum@@ bo night@@ mare . ( la@@ ughter ) But something more profound was happening as well .
the label had told me that these pieces were made by the S@@ Ã¨@@ v@@ res Manu@@ factory , made of porcelain in the late 17@@ 50s , and designed by a designer called Jean @@@ -@@ @ Cla@@ ude du@@ Pl@@ es@@ sis , actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned .
but , that tu@@ tu for example -- actually , this is a piece that does dance in its own way .
this is an object which is all about escap@@ ism .
and that seems fine .
we 've eliminated , in a sense , that constant of the imagination that these v@@ ases represented in people 's lives .
I think it 's beginning to happen .
and it 's based , actually , on a more elevated piece of porcelain .
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war , having just finished the washing up . ( la@@ ughter ) He seems also to have forgotten his sword .
I really hope that others , all of you , visiting objects in the museum , and taking them home and finding them for yourselves , will allow those objects to flourish in your imagin@@ ative lives .
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's what my mom was like when I did it .
then the human wa@@ its , until it 's their turn again .
but I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player , and more like a do@@ er that just clic@@ ks and works together .
and I thought : how can we make an artificial intelligence model -- a computer , compu@@ tational model -- that will model some of these ideas of impro@@ vis@@ ation , of taking risks , of taking chances , even of making mistakes ?
what I found is that people actually loved the ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rous robot .
when they talked about it after the task , with the ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rous brain , they said , " By the end , we were good friends and high @@@ -@@ @ fi@@ ved mentally . "
whatever that means .
so let 's look at a few seconds from this performance , where the robot list@@ ens to the human musi@@ cian and impro@@ vis@@ es .
this is the modern Middle East , where two mill@@ enn@@ ia after the coming of Christ , vir@@ gin births are still a fact of life .
marriage is your ticket to adul@@ thood .
I used to play it on the guitar , you know .
a state that actually per@@ v@@ ades and under@@ lies all emotional states , and all the jo@@ ys and sor@@ rows that can come one 's way .
but there 's also wicked joy , you can rejoice in someone 's suffering .
mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors CA@@ N@@ NOT happen at the same time .
usually , when we feel anno@@ yed , hatred or upset with someone , or obs@@ essed with something , the mind goes again and again to that object .
they are real Olympic champions of mind training .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
so it 's my grand@@ mother 's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest .
so , I 'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impacted the health of women , and where we need to do more .
all three were non@@ smokers .
and when these genes are over @@@ -@@ @ expressed , it 's associated with improved survival only in young women .
and now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time .
but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates , in fact , to the basic pillars of management .
how do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business ?
plus I have to pay for the middle office .
improve inter@@ personal feelings , the more people like each other , the more they will cooperate .
integr@@ ators are not middle offices , they are managers , existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate .
these rules , they come from game theory and organizational soci@@ ology .
you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the bu@@ ff@@ ers that make us self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient .
you simultaneously improve performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both .
just knowing my ro@@ om@@ mates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
now , when you experience fear , your sympa@@ thetic nervous system kic@@ ks in .
so you have a rush of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine , your heart rate increases , your breathing gets faster .
( music ) Than@@ k you .
it 's also been a real issue in terms of access .
we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
so why are we fighting it in the classroom ?
so here 's what we can do .
so rather than driving our kids into a classroom , her@@ ding them out there at 8 o 'clock in the morning -- I h@@ ated going to class at 8 o 'clock in the morning , so why are we forcing our kids to do that ?
then they come into the classroom for some in @@@ -@@ @ person interaction .
they can have discussions amongst themselves .
they can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions .
I was@@ n 't all that smart , and I would be sc@@ ram@@ bling , taking notes , and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour .
they can re@@ wind the professor .
so this form of self @@@ -@@ @ pac@@ ing can be very helpful to learning .
some are never graded .
and these kinds of technologies really help , the bl@@ ended model can really help revolu@@ tion@@ ize education .
the A@@ ak@@ ash is 40 dollars .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
the second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Cam@@ den , New Jersey police department .
now , at that time , Cam@@ den , New Jersey , was the most dangerous city in America .
so basically , they cou@@ ld@@ n 't be scaled or transferred to other places .
and every single judge in the United States of America can use it , because it 's been created on a universal data set .
well , I 'm a science journalist and multimedia producer , who has always been fasc@@ inated by gross stuff .
but then adults step in , and we tell kids not to pick their nos@@ es and not to touch the s@@ lu@@ gs or to@@ ads or whatever else they find in the back@@ yard , because those things are gross .
and that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Chan@@ ge@@ .org.
people online , and sometimes even in real life , were dis@@ respectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
how about from Wh@@ ite@@ boy@@ 77@@ AG@@ S : " people always need something to ( female dog ) about . "
in a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
at the first bend in the line , it left its course , and crash@@ ed into a wall .
ideas are opportunities and innovation .
at eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya 's I@@ de@@ as , and my non@@ profit , Maya 's I@@ de@@ as for the Planet .
for most people , these experiences disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize .
these can be everyday sens@@ ations that are@@ n 't inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical and emotional reactions .
that then sti@@ rs up the same feelings of panic and helpl@@ essness as if they 're experiencing the trauma all over again .
that 's a score of 6 .
so how would you divide a 4@@ x@@ 4 , 10@@ x@@ 10 , or 32@@ x@@ 32 canvas ?
the degrees of expression appropriate to a given situation can , however , vary greatly across cultures .
in one study , both blind and sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emo@@ tion when winning or losing their matches .
ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee la@@ ughter looks different from ours , but uses some of the same muscle movements .
scientists have a lot of theories rooted in our evolutionary history .
" how much pain medication are you taking ? "
I looked at my wife , S@@ adi@@ ye ; we did some calculating .
" about 115 mill@@ igra@@ ms oxy@@ co@@ done , " I responded .
I had been given no warnings , no counseling , no plan ...
what happened next really came to define my entire experience of medical trauma .
the result is that I was launched into acute opi@@ oid withdrawal .
the result , put another way , was hell .
I would swe@@ at prof@@ us@@ ely almost constantly , and yet if I managed to get myself out into the hot August sun , I might look down and find myself covered in go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps .
we called surge@@ ons and pain doc@@ s and general practitioners -- anyone we could find on the internet , and not a single one of them would help me .
I was simply not the kind of patient they were designed to see .
I took the little orange prescription bottle , I set it on my night@@ stand ...
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ ks for that , that was my response , too .
in it , they teach physicians how to tap@@ er opi@@ oids in the easier cases , and one of the their recommendations is that you never start at more than a 10 percent dose reduction per week .
( appl@@ ause ) Why do I believe this ?
I am a data ner@@ d , and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar , that the program works , and if it do@@ es@@ n 't work , we should change the plan .
and in the 200@@ 0s , over 7,000 .
we were obviously making a difference .
and all of a sudden , he looked at the back of the room , and he saw his daughter , and he called out his daughter 's name , Mic@@ ha@@ ela , and he said , " Mic@@ ha@@ ela , come up here . "
you can 't make that one up .
and one day , I was thinking about how all data has a location , and I realized that the answer had been st@@ aring me in the face .
the pictures that I was finding were years out of date , and because of that , it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today .
how much oil is stored in all of China ?
today , it 's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks .
and we 've accomplished close to zi@@ p .
here 's Mount Pin@@ at@@ u@@ bo in the early ' 9@@ 0s . that put a whole bun@@ ch of sul@@ fur in the strat@@ osphere with a sort of atomic bomb @@@ -@@ @ like cloud .
but if you do this , it 's quick .
that 's what the world looks like , under one particular climate model 's view , with twice the amount of CO2 in the air .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric life@@ times -- much longer than before -- because they 're le@@ vit@@ ated .
the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their lab@@ s .
but here 's a case which is harder to reject .
there 's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
it 's using this as risk control , not instead of action .
many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that .
I 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to trans@@ gress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
and I 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retro@@ fitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on ster@@ oids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
this socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighbor@@ hoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new , inclusive and more equitable land use policies .
they bar@@ ric@@ aded the place , and the teenagers were evicted , and the teenagers decided to fight back , not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process .
they were also lucky , they said , because they began to di@@ g in a sort of Bermuda Tri@@ angle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
seated in this audience are 9@@ 96 small figures .
it could be a few cl@@ aps or a strong appl@@ ause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
so to us , I think we 're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that 's also got a sort of musical @@@ -@@ @ like quality to it , an instrument .
so here 's a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of cl@@ ashing against each other to kind of make sense of the du@@ ality and the tension .
and here is a prototype .
it comes out of the idea of a window .
this is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it 's made up of three different thick@@ nesses of wooden sections .
this grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
they 're also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
let 's first begin with a thought experiment .
and so , given this one equation , it 's natural to ask , so what can you do with this ?
another important consequence is goal seeking .
and these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda .
whereas my wife , she calls me the star of her life .
but it 's not true ! we only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds .
these teachers call themselves " pick @@@ -@@ @ up artists . "
everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if se@@ duction can progress to reproduction .
it is a sort of poetry of deliberate aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness .
we 've had to clear land .
forty percent food waste is a major problem .
but that 's really big in the U.@@ K.
they 'd say , " Le@@ yl@@ a , how do I make it technically efficient ? "
or , " How do I make it green materials ?
because the problem is with use .
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
building on this strength , they attracted investment and started to process , being able to export higher @@@ -@@ @ value products like st@@ arch from c@@ assa@@ va .
hence , Sam@@ in@@ u left to the city , where he soon realized that life was not easy .
but if we can tap into commercial debt , it is a small number -- only 0.1 percent of all the debt in the world today , 10 cents out of every 100 dollars .
I think it 's reck@@ less to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long @@@ -@@ @ term returns .
they 're economic issues , and that makes them relevant to risk and return .
and they are really complex and they can seem really far off , that the temptation may be to do this : bury our heads in the sand and not think about it .
Cal@@ PER@@ S is another example .
we did@@ n 't have the luxury of pre @@@ -@@ @ recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surro@@ gate .
the more speech you have , the better s@@ ounding voice you 're going to have .
RP : so that 's speech synthesis .
I met her when she was nine , and since then , my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice .
what we 've done so far is we have a few surro@@ gate tal@@ kers from around the U.S.
who have donated their voices , and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices .
I want to end by circl@@ ing back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work .
when his mom first heard this voice , she said , " This is what William would have s@@ ounded like had he been able to speak . "
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
thirteen years ago , we set ourselves a goal to end poverty .
the aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments , which have fallen for two consecutive years .
it 's a common reaction .
but it took an innocent question from my then @@@ -@@ @ four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter to make me appreciate that .
I did@@ n 't have any change to give him , and she was disappointed .
so I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money ch@@ asing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon .
the money was@@ n 't actually physically printed .
that confidence was based on two pillars .
it was the same elsewhere .
well , this is where Dor@@ oth@@ y and the Man@@ go Tree charity that supports her comes in .
Governments have been aiming to get aid to 0.7 percent for years , so let 's set the limit at half of that , 0.@@ 35 percent of their income .
the thing that I fear , the only thing that I fear , apart from the fact that I 've run out of time , is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one .
today , money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool .
and 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidi@@ ze agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have over@@ produced .
and as you 're looking at this system , if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight , then bio@@ energy works in a different way . and we 've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels .
the oil price goes through the floor . that company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil price back up .
now inte@@ res@@ tingly , the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network .
there were no str@@ angers . right ?
I 've even got this little bit from " V@@ ag@@ ina Mon@@ olo@@ gues " I 'm going to do .
and this k@@ id looks me dead in the eye , without missing a beat , and says , " My favorite pa@@ j@@ am@@ as are purple with fish .
but I am here to tell you , no matter what your walls are made of , a clos@@ et is no place for a person to live .
" well , we 've never been there but we 've heard it 's fab@@ ulous . "
you are speaking your truth .
or actively trying to avoid it .
so one of the first things we need is we need an aircraft that can take off and land in small spaces and quickly take you where you want to go .
it has multiple redundant motors and batteries , you can lose one , it will continue flying and land normally .
it 's intelligent and has cameras , li@@ dar and radar , so it can detect and avoid unexpected obstacles .
it 's about 40 kil@@ ow@@ att @@@ -@@ @ hours .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : OK , so when these things first roll out -- right now , it 's a single person aircraft , right ?
ca : yours is .
this thing takes off .
could we do a poll here ?
R@@ L : it 's pretty good .
so you can really wrap a business around that .
the technology need to mature in terms of safety , to get to the safety levels that we expect from aircraft .
R@@ L : my personal view is that ride sharing actually allows you to operate that entire business much more efficiently .
you know , there are mill@@ enn@@ ials that say they never want to own a car .
ca : cool . thank you for that .
so it 's no wonder that the values that under@@ ly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that under@@ ly the Internet .
and so it 's no surprise that many h@@ ackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
and it 's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just was@@ n 't going to be possible in the few months that they had .
they 're looking for answers to questions , and they want to take action when they 're done , which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this .
in one Saturday afternoon , they were able to pop@@ ulate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions , but more importantly than that , they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government .
I auth@@ ored this answer , and a few others .
and I 'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation .
they actually love it .
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the House .
they 're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved , besides voting or signing a petition or pro@@ testing .
here , I discovered something obvious : wilderness is our natural habitat , too .
we need these last wild places to re@@ connect with who we really are .
there is no doubt this is the biggest conservation opportunity in Africa in decades .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to te@@ ase out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions .
and it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for .
and so if you do this , then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in English , but what you 're conveying is really a meaning , the meaning of a sentence in English .
let 's take this sentence : " I told the car@@ pen@@ ter I could not pay him . "
now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays , and almost all of that is done in the language domain .
and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English @@@ -@@ @ specific .
and that gives another interesting idea .
and that 's evident here with the slower conduc@@ tion .
John I saw just last week in the clinic .
but actually it does , but it just do@@ es@@ n 't do it well enough .
but I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist called Yam@@ an@@ aka .
and I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration , repair and hope .
[ " I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist ; on his present showing this is quite ridic@@ ulous . " ] So they did@@ n 't think much of him then .
I think there are two ways you can think about this : as a fantastic 21st @@@ -@@ @ century drug discovery tool , and / or as a form of therapy .
drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this .
that 's straightforward , because that 's what pl@@ uri@@ potent cells can do .
but cru@@ cially , you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts , ideally from an un@@ affected relative .
that way , you 're matching for genetic variation .
and what you 're looking at , and this is amazing , these are living , growing , motor nerve cells from a patient with motor ne@@ ur@@ on disease .
and again there are two ways to think about this , and they 're not mutually exclusive .
so this is a proof of concept .
so I just want to end with the theme I began on , which was regeneration and hope .
so here I 've asked John what his hopes are for the future .
they are these huge collections of gal@@ ax@@ ies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
and as laboratories , to describe gal@@ axy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
and , in fact , if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around this cluster .
so that was very big .
the second things is very hot .
this is in false color .
and the question is , if it 's not gal@@ ax@@ ies , what is emitting this light ?
and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide .
so , it 's very funny .
they don 't understand why it 's expanding at an ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing rate .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
here is a computer simulation .
I listened and thought to myself , " What are these rating agencies , and why is everybody so upset about their work ? "
rating agencies are rating companies .
the customers of these rating agencies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own ratings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul , not just a trim@@ ming at the margins .
well , a country has many gar@@ den@@ ers , and one of them is the government , so we have to ask the question , how is a country governed ?
a poster child example was the enc@@ ycl@@ ope@@ dia business .
most of the cost was the commission to the sal@@ es@@ men .
and what I 'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third , and it maps exactly on to the kind of Por@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ Hen@@ derson logic that we 've been talking about .
after my neuro@@ surgery , part of my brain was missing , and I had to deal with that .
we are so close to being able to do this .
but they could be out there , very easily .
but even if we don 't run across it in our life@@ times , we can still think there is one out there , and we 're just trying to get closer and closer to it .
instead , apparently , the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gam@@ ma 's software .
this is the managing director of Gam@@ ma International .
as I said , it 's a $ 5 billion industry .
what I thought was most fascinating was they 've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year .
in the United States , where I live , there have been no congres@@ sional hearings .
neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stom@@ p on it .
so even though this looks like a simple to@@ y , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
I collect bran@@ ding ir@@ ons that were used to mark slaves as property .
I collect sh@@ ack@@ les for adults and restraints for adults as well as children .
they were in Africa .
there was something else I realized .
thank you very much .
it 's in a shopping m@@ all , and it sells fish eggs .
it 's a ca@@ vi@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ ven@@ ding machine .
this is the Art @@@ -@@ @ o @@@ -@@ @ mat , an art @@@ -@@ @ ven@@ ding machine that sells small artistic cre@@ ations by different artists , usually on small wood blocks or mat@@ ch@@ boxes , in limited edition .
I started doing this on my own .
( la@@ ughter ) These are people who don 't necessarily regularly engage with science .
you can kind of tell from their reactions .
this is what that looked like .
and it started to make me think about a couple of things .
but when you open them , you have different r@@ arities of the toys .
I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal .
he 's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
and caregi@@ ving itself develops patience -- a lot of patience -- and em@@ pa@@ thy , creativity , resilience , adap@@ tability .
and a 2012 study of employers showed that deep , flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adap@@ tability in a global service economy .
it 's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch .
now , when we go , fewer and fewer businesses close for si@@ e@@ sta , reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24 @@@ -@@ @ hour competition .
they 're psychi@@ atri@@ sts .
but in fact , the change is actually already happening .
this is a picture I In@@ st@@ agra@@ m@@ med earlier .
and the difference today is that the gold of today is mobile .
there 's another great African that you 've heard that 's busy disrup@@ ting the automobile industry in the world .
so , people like to call Africa a mobile @@@ -@@ @ first continent , but actually it 's mobile @@@ -@@ @ only , so while everybody else is doing all of those things , we 're solving the world 's problems .
males have a spi@@ ked , bar@@ bed penis that they literally sta@@ b into the female , and they don 't sta@@ b it anywhere near her vag@@ ina .
from fl@@ ac@@ ci@@ d to ejaculation in less than a second .
I mean , imagine putting a penis into another penis .
it looks and feels like it sounds : wor@@ m@@ wood S@@ cru@@ bs .
was there a neuro@@ logical cause for their condition ?
the heavy metal door s@@ lam@@ med shut behind me .
( la@@ ughter ) Over the subsequent months , we tested Jo@@ e and his fellow inmates , looking specifically at their ability to categor@@ ize different images of emo@@ tion .
at the age of 12 months , most children are able to im@@ itate the purpos@@ eful actions of others .
so for example , your mother raises her hands to stretch , and you im@@ itate her behavior .
if you doubt this , try , as I 've done , to rene@@ ge on a promise you 've made to a four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old .
you will find that the mind of a four @@@ -@@ @ year old is not na@@ Ã¯@@ ve in the s@@ ligh@@ test .
that 's not to say it 's impossible .
it is now clear that the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala of mammals , including pri@@ mates like us , can show neuro@@ gene@@ sis .
when you think about it , it is ir@@ onic that our current solution for people with stressed am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ ae is to place them in an environment that actually inhib@@ its any chance of further growth .
the evidence is actually the other way .
the gar@@ ter sna@@ ke , which d@@ ines on neuro@@ toxic sal@@ am@@ an@@ ders , has evolved resistance to sal@@ am@@ ander toxins through some of the same genetic changes as the sal@@ am@@ an@@ ders themselves .
but the travel options are very limited ; plane tickets cost nearly half of their monthly salary .
that 's two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of all trips taken around the world .
the internet exists in a restricted , argu@@ ably manip@@ ulated form within China , yet it is massive and has va@@ stly improved the lives of its citizens .
those situations don 't really define themselves more until the second decade of life .
in other words , one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other .
but once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm , they look beautiful .
Jack@@ ie , on top of it , was , by virtue of sk@@ ele@@ tal markings , destined to be six feet five .
now you can imagine looking at Jon@@ as at only 14 , that male pu@@ ber@@ ty is early in this family , because he looks more like a 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old .
SP : but is this necessarily a bad thing ?
time and again , a thin@@ ker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was inde@@ f@@ en@@ sible , ir@@ rational , inconsistent with values already held .
few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hang@@ ings or beating children .
companies were created to give people a chance to inno@@ vate and not have to put everything on the line .
well , imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company .
imagine if this data were open and free , accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike .
and yes , this is ambitious , but there is momentum on this issue , and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum , and it 's just starting on this issue .
you really can make this change happen .
now , a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word .
global citizens , inno@@ v@@ ators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
and I want you to help me do that in this next cli@@ p .
now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .
but it did@@ n 't even slow down the animal .
the leg is acting as a foot .
and in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot .
look carefully : this is slowed down 100 times , and watch what it 's doing with the rest of its leg .
you can see it here well on this debris .
when you touched the cock@@ ro@@ ach leg , what did it feel like ?
they assumed that they were for protection and for sen@@ sory structures .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) A little better than nature .
Dan Kod@@ it@@ sch@@ ek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot , and here 's R@@ He@@ x , now , going over those steel -- those ra@@ ils . no problem !
so here 's R@@ He@@ x with p@@ add@@ les , now converted into an incredibly maneu@@ ver@@ able swimming robot .
we discovered they work by inter@@ molecular forces alone .
and here is Ri@@ SE .
Chris An@@ derson : the rights of citizens , the future of the Internet .
you 've been called many things in the last few months .
ca : so just to give some context for those who don 't know the whole story -- ( Appl@@ ause ) - this time a year ago , you were stationed in Hawa@@ ii working as a consultant to the N@@ SA .
as a sy@@ sad@@ min , you had access to their systems , and you began revealing certain classified documents to some hand@@ picked journalists leading the way to June 's re@@ vel@@ ations .
when I really came to struggle with these issues , I thought to myself , how can I do this in the most responsible way , that maxim@@ izes the public benefit while minimizing the risks ?
they were only tried by a secret court .
the N@@ SA was previously asked by Congress , was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ball@@ park estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercep@@ ted .
ca : ed , there was a story broken in the Washington Post , again from your data .
in another event , they intercep@@ ted all the calls in Washington , D.C. , by accident .
and she then requested a copy from the N@@ SA and received it , but had never seen this before that .
we have a right to privacy .
ca : some people are fu@@ rious at what you 've done .
the prerogatives of people like D@@ ick Ch@@ en@@ ey do not keep the nation safe .
our economy is not the enemy .
ca : but it 's alleged that you 've stolen 1.7 million documents .
ca : come here , because I want to ask you about this particular revelation .
I mean , this is a story which I think for a lot of the tec@@ h@@ ies in this room is the single most shoc@@ king thing that they have heard in the last few months .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be threatening dis@@ sid@@ ents .
it 's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here , but I see them .
( appl@@ ause ) I mean , The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you .
and even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 , 74 shuttle flight , the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so -- one in 35 , one in 40 .
you get lighter and lighter , the force gets on us heavier and heavier .
until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we 're weigh@@ tless .
we knew everything there is to know about the spac@@ e@@ suit and we trained underwater thousands of times .
and so we protect those .
so I think absolutely , fol@@ ks do have a right to privacy , and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected .
I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the pe@@ tr@@ i dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance .
now what you 'll see people say publicly is there is no " but for " case , and so there is no case where , but for that , the threat would have happened .
this is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government , and President Mad@@ ison would have been proud .
we use the standards , we use the products that we recommend , and so it 's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people 's need to be .
I have this friend who really would like to expand his business .
when people have the knowledge , they can find solutions without having to helped out .
and I went and searched , and this is what I found .
you 're working because you want to change the world .
we 've had a more rapid turnover of companies .
and the micro@@ biom@@ es that have a lot of micro@@ bes in common are close to each other .
now , we did study some other species of pri@@ mate .
and the final group that we studied , all the way on the right , is people living in the USA .
( la@@ ughter ) But the other way to think about it is that Americans are like super @@@ -@@ @ cap@@ tive mon@@ keys .
I 'm looking forward to a future where we have the tools that we need to restore and replen@@ ish our micro@@ biom@@ es , and in that world , the mon@@ keys will live hap@@ pier and healthier lives , and so will we .
in many patriarchal societies and tribal societies , fathers are usually known by their sons , but I 'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter , and I am proud of it .
the neighborhood comes and comm@@ is@@ er@@ ates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father .
until the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life .
but when she enters her te@@ ens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort .
she is confined under the four walls of her home .
so this brother , he sacrifices the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so @@@ -@@ @ called honor .
she is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them .
yes , I must mention it .
and all these good values , I tried to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her personality .
the shri@@ mp are just one step on its journey .
is it maybe protecting its si@@ bl@@ ings ?
Israeli scientists Freder@@ ic Liber@@ sat and R@@ am G@@ al found that the ven@@ om is a very specific chemical weapon .
now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
this is Tox@@ o@@ plasma gon@@ di@@ i , or Tox@@ o , for short , because the terri@@ fying creature always deserves a cu@@ te nick@@ name .
estimates vary a lot , but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Tox@@ o in their bra@@ ins .
now typically , this do@@ es@@ n 't lead to any over@@ t illness .
the paras@@ ite holds up in a dor@@ man@@ t state for a long period of time .
he was one of the New York School abstract expres@@ sion@@ ists who , together with his contem@@ por@@ aries , invented American modern art , and contributed to moving the American ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist towards modern@@ ism in the 20th century .
it did@@ n 't look all that special from the outside , as I said , but when we walked inside , I was immediately struck by three things : first of all , it was ple@@ as@@ antly cool despite the op@@ pressive heat outside .
but I wondered , what about when it ra@@ ined ?
take the O@@ cul@@ us of the Pan@@ the@@ on .
the wireless technologies developed for mobile devices , with some minor modifications , are completely suitable to solve this .
we 'll start off easy .
Bi@@ onics has defined my phy@@ sic@@ ality .
technology is inadequate .
I made my height adjustable .
technology had eliminated my disability , and allowed me a new climbing pro@@ w@@ ess .
next , dynamic interface .
how do my bi@@ onic lim@@ bs move like flesh and bone ?
Bi@@ onics also allows for extraordinary athle@@ tic fe@@ ats .
and that capability is embedded in the chips of the bi@@ onic lim@@ b .
indeed , Bi@@ onics is making a profound difference in people 's lives .
we the people need not accept our limitations , but can trans@@ cend disability through technological innovation .
the story of Adri@@ anne Has@@ let @@@ -@@ @ Dav@@ is .
Adri@@ anne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack .
it is her expression . it is her art form .
we will not be intim@@ idated , brought down , diminished , conqu@@ ered or stopped by acts of violence .
so a chip , a poet and a boy .
we could call it clu@@ efulness .
he was@@ n 't sharing in my celebration .
and I said to him , " You know , Aaron , it 's not my field , not my field . "
I had to focus on , what was I going to say to you ?
she started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington , D.C.
I 'm not going to fail that .
and as we have mar@@ ched , people around the country have begun to say , " Can we do the same thing in our state ? "
and so they developed a platform , which we are announcing today , that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform .
and the basic way this works is this .
now I 've asked you .
thank you very much .
so when I became a fashion model , I felt that I 'd finally achieved the dream that I 'd always wanted since I was a young child .
in my case , for the last nine years , some of my neighbors , some of my friends , colleagues , even my agent , did not know about my history .
here is mine .
many are not so fortunate .
so when I was eight years old , I was at a fi@@ e@@ sta in the Philippines celebrating these myster@@ ies .
Ge@@ ena R@@ oc@@ ero : sure . well , first , really , I 'm so blessed .

now it 's been 14 billion years since that Big Ban@@ g , and so it 's got f@@ aint and cold .
and those small , little , in@@ hom@@ ogene@@ ities , 20 parts in a million , those were formed by quantum mechanical w@@ ig@@ g@@ les in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cos@@ mos .

ca : so , given that this vacation led to the creation of the world 's biggest private foundation , it 's pretty expensive as vac@@ ations go . ( la@@ ughter ) MG : I guess so . we enjoyed it .
at this stage , we were talking about the poorest , and could you have a big impact on them ?
there was a lot we did@@ n 't know .
our na@@ Ã¯@@ vet@@ Ã© is pretty incredible , when we look back on it .
Ma : ye@@ ah , in ' 97 , we read an article about diar@@ rhe@@ al diseases killing so many kids around the world , and we kept saying to ourselves , " Well that can 't be .
I don 't tell them who I am . pair of k@@ hak@@ is .
and I kept hearing from women , over and over and over , the more I traveled , " I want to be able to use this shot . "
and I would come back and talk to global health experts , and they 'd say , " Oh no , contraceptives are stoc@@ ked in in the developing world . "
and so condoms were stoc@@ ked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.
( appl@@ ause ) CA : bill , this is your graph . what 's this about ?
we go from 20 million not long after I was born to now we 're down to about six million .
that was eradicated , so that got down to zero .
measles was killing a couple million a year .
that 's down to a few hundred thousand .
we can actually accelerate the progress .
ninety @@@ -@@ @ eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters , and yet , people 's charity , when they see a natural disaster , are wonderful .
these causes have been a bit invisible .
ca : maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big , sad face to get engaged .
you shou@@ ld@@ n 't just say , ok@@ ay , because of that , because we don 't have a perfect record , this is a bad endeav@@ or .
mg : ye@@ ah , I 've had a lot of women say to me , " I really don 't think I could work with my husband .

I was actually really excited .
mg : that 's what I said , the employees , it went away for them three months after you were there .
Sunday , 11 o 'clock , you 're away from work , what comes up ? what 's the argument ?
B@@ G : because we built this thing together from the beginning , it 's this great partnership .
she 's got a lot of insight .
ca : so , in vaccines and polio and so forth , you 've had some amazing successes .
we do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you 're going to have different failures .
it took three more years to get it than we expected , and then there was no way it was going to get out there .
ca : you 're spending , like , a billion dollars a year in education , I think , something like that .
and we stayed with their family , and we really , really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania .
their children , their six children , the two in the middle were tw@@ ins , 13 , a boy , and a girl named G@@ race .
and when we 'd go out to cho@@ p wood and do all the things that G@@ race and her mother would do , G@@ race was not a child , she was an adolescent , but she was@@ n 't an adult .
ca : I mean , this is another pic of your other two kids , R@@ ory and Pho@@ e@@ be , along with Paul Far@@ mer .
ca : you 've easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all bil@@ lion@@ aires .
I mean , the beauty of philanthro@@ py is this mind @@@ -@@ @ blowing diversity .
there are probably some bil@@ lion@@ aires in the room and certainly some successful people .
thank you .
so here you see a familiar sight .

there 's nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .

and this territory is fantastic .
and here is something : nobody is obliged to be a gen@@ ius , but everybody is obliged to participate .
that means intelligent people are in this angle . that is intelligence .
from this to here , that , it 's gen@@ ius .
P@@ tol@@ emy , Er@@ at@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es , E@@ in@@ stein , things like that .
because at the vertical of us , if you look like that , " Ah ! my God , there is God . Ah ! God ! "
that means , when your brain is not enough big , when you don 't understand , you go , " Ah , it 's God , it 's God . " that 's ridic@@ ulous .
out , more of the horizontal . you are an intelligence .
what , what else we can say about that ? why do that ?
it 's OK . we are in the light .
that 's why we must adapt .
no , you must really understand that .
however , Sierra Leone is in@@ famous for a decade @@@ -@@ @ long rebel war in the ' 9@@ 0s when entire villages were burnt down .
people don 't realize that .
Gab@@ by G@@ if@@ for@@ ds : yes .
she did@@ n 't have much other information .
every injury is different . it 's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable , which is another TB@@ I kind of injury .
PM : after you got married , however , you continued very independent lives .
( la@@ ughter ) MK : ye@@ ah , you know , legislation is often at a col@@ oss@@ ally slow pace , but my wife , and I have to admit , a lot of other members of Congress that I know , work incredibly hard .
you 've got to find a replacement for me . "
PM : this is a picture of family and friends gathering , but I love these pictures because they show the Gab@@ by and Mark relationship now .
and Gab@@ by , what 's on the agenda now ?
MK : that 's our political action committee , where we are trying to get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country , and to try to pass some reasonable legislation .
it 's not too difficult to do that .
mountains . gor@@ geous mountains .
in March of 2006 , police interrogated B@@ ren@@ dan D@@ as@@ sey , a 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old high school student with an I@@ Q around 70 , putting him in the range of intellectual disability .
OK ? you 're nod@@ ding .
P@@ 2 : and she 's behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here .
P@@ 1 : that 's what she said , because she thinks you know more , too .
so by honesty , they meant a confession , and his confession would definitely not end up setting him free .
and I know many people are going to struggle with that term , " false confession , " and with believing that false confessions actually occur .
and I get that .
and the fact is , we can never know precisely how often false confessions occur .
these cases are crystal clear because we have the DNA .
juveniles are more sugg@@ esti@@ ble and susceptible to social influence , like the intense pressure accusations and suggestions coming from authority figures in interrogations .
B@@ ren@@ dan : like , if his story is , like , different , like I never did nothing or something .
but it 's certainly possible .
of course , che@@ ating is far from murder , and I know that .
other studies tell the same story .
therefore we must be saved by that final form of love , which is forgiveness . " thanks .
there are guides to raising a bilingual k@@ id even if you only speak one language at home .
but taken together , I am sorry , I do not see help when I look at that shelf .
specifically , I don 't think we know what paren@@ ting is supposed to be .
well , for star@@ ters , there has been a major historical change .
now add to this problem something else : we are also navi@@ gating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce .
( la@@ ughter ) Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world , couples fight , and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gri@@ pes .
happiness and self @@@ -@@ @ confidence can be the by@@ products of other things , but they CA@@ N@@ NOT really be goals unto themselves .
these two guys shared a similar vision .
which is more than twice the size of your average novel , and we had to put every single one of those letters in the correct order , without a single typ@@ o .
our approach was to think of the gen@@ ome as the operating system of the cell , with the cell containing the hardware necessary to boot up the gen@@ ome .
because of the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of these technologies , we found that we could readily automate the processes and move the laboratory work@@ flows out of the scientist 's hands and onto a machine .
four hundred parts per million : that 's the approximate concentration of CO2 in the air today .
that 's the challenge we 're facing when capturing CO2 directly out of the air .
turns out , it 's actually significant .
if we make the edges of those pe@@ tals exactly right , if we control their shape , we can control diff@@ r@@ action , and now we have a great shadow .
that , of course , has to be bigger than my thum@@ b .
it starts wrapped around a hub .
there was an issue at that time with the size of the fon@@ ts , the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory .
this looks more like bric@@ k@@ laying than type design , but believe me , this is a good bit@@ map O , for the simple reason that it 's sym@@ metrical in both x and y axes .
for a certain kind of temper@@ ament , there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that CA@@ N@@ NOT be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability .
that 's a victory . that 's good , right there .
will they out@@ live the now @@@ -@@ @ obsolete screens and the flood of new web fon@@ ts coming on to the market ?
I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retro@@ spective of pa@@ inter Elizabeth Mur@@ ray .
I learned so much from her .
there were some moti@@ fs and elements that would come up again later in her life .
one of the works , in fact , so did@@ n 't meet her mark , she had set it out in the tra@@ sh in her studio , and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value .
in that moment , my view of success and creativity changed .
and he said , " You learn how little you know . "
now , it 's very energy @@@ -@@ @ dense , it produces solid , reliable power , and it do@@ es@@ n 't make any CO2 .
it makes lots of energy .
what should I do ? what can I do ?
it 's a big ring of magnetic co@@ il , super@@ conducting co@@ il , and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this , and the hot gas in the middle , which is called a plasma , is trapped .
you see the laser beam and the pel@@ let in the center .
now , that 's not quite good enough , because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that , but it was pretty good .
now this is I@@ TER , pronounced in French : EE @@@ -@@ @ ta@@ ir@@ h .
actually , the science to make those machines was really in time to produce fusion during that curve .
however , there has been a bit of politics going on , and the will to do it was not there , so it dri@@ f@@ ted to the right .
for example , it took them about three years to decide where to put it .
but you have to compare that to the cost of making Mo@@ ore 's Law .
so those have a couple of very good advantages .
so when you com@@ press that , the plasma co@@ ols down faster than the compression speed , so you 're trying to com@@ press it , but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing .
so finally , most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen , but as a matter of fact , fusion is getting very close .
they said these are path@@ ological curves , and we don 't have to discuss them .
let 's see , first iter@@ ation , second , third , fourth .
so in Man@@ ghet@@ u sculpture , you 'd see this recur@@ sive geometry .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
anywhere you go in the Sahel , you 'll see this windscreen .
he said , " but wind and dust goes through pretty easily .
and then you take this symbol , and you put it back in so it 's a self @@@ -@@ @ generating diversity of symbols .
so all these little P@@ DA@@ s and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa .
we 've started a pilot program in Ghana .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no far@@ ther than Africa to find these robust self @@@ -@@ @ organizing algorithms .
science starts with observation , but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence , isolate them , and test them with scientific rig@@ or .
we 're eth@@ ically precluded from even using human@@ oid shapes and ba@@ iting them up in the water .
from the perspective of Shar@@ k Att@@ ack Mitigation Systems , we 're a biotechnology licensing company , so we don 't make we@@ tsu@@ its ourselves .
and that 's not the only trick we learned from Sil@@ icon Valley .
even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago , we 've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I 'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now .
and the image on the left is from our satellite , and we see buildings are being built .
from water security to food security .
we 'll see crops as they grow in all the fields in every farmer 's field around the planet every day .
if you took the difference between today 's image and yesterday 's image , you 'd see much of the world news - you 'd see floods and fires and earthquakes .
we want to ensure everyone can see it .
in short , we want to democrati@@ ze access to information about our planet .
you see , this will be an entirely new global data set .
the col@@ dest materials in the world are@@ n 't in Antarctica .
they 're not at the top of Mount E@@ ve@@ rest or buried in a gl@@ ac@@ ier .
under most circumstances , the energy in a laser beam he@@ ats things up .
but why would you want to cool at@@ oms down that much ?
I failed at getting published for almost six years .
imagine trying to use words to describe every scene in a film , every note in your favorite song , or every street in your town .
you need context to tell whether you 're hearing Russian , Spanish , or English .
which is fitting , seeing as today , one in five soldiers develop depression , or post @@@ -@@ @ traumatic stress disorder or both .
and yet , despite how common@@ place these disorders are , our current treatments , if they work at all , only suppress symptoms .
thank you .
and she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit , and were helping people learn in a social way .
so I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabl@@ e@@ top surface .
with this interface , we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and ar@@ cade games , where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible .
but au@@ tism is not a single condition .
in addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause au@@ tism .
and I remember many nights , I would be sitting at home , just , like , concentrating and focusing , trying to feel the Force , and I did@@ n 't feel anything , don 't worry .
but if it were just radar , then we would have this 50 years ago .
you 're going to f@@ ry them like if they were in a microwave .
the second thing : machine learning .
they are his heart@@ be@@ ats .
so this white box that you see here is the device , and Z@@ ach is turning it on ...
and indeed , today we are working with multiple doctors in different disease categories .
now we all have this feeling that we 're somehow just getting better as a human race , in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably progressing , but it 's not like we 've evolved into a new species in a century .
U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t passes him , and as the run@@ ners come to the finish , you 'll hear a be@@ ep as each man crosses the line .
and then consider that U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t started by prop@@ elling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as human@@ ly possible .
now , 530 is a lot more than one , and that 's partly because there are many more people training today and they 're training more intell@@ igently .
the record is always tren@@ ding downward , but it 's punc@@ tu@@ ated by these steep cli@@ ffs .
and because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe , with the gal@@ ax@@ ies flying away from one another , the scientists who discovered it call it " The Big Ban@@ g of Body Types . "
suddenly , anybody who could be an N@@ BA player wanted to be , and teams started scour@@ ing the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships .
the average N@@ BA player is a sh@@ ade under 6 ' 7 , " with arms that are seven feet long .
these men are seven inches different in height , but because of the body types advant@@ aged in their sports , they wear the same length p@@ ants .
ok@@ ay , and what we 're looking at here , this is Sam 's optic nerve , which is a direct extension of her brain , so I 'm actually looking at her brain as we look there .
that is a huge challenge .
we can look at the flu@@ xes .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
all of those things are emer@@ gent properties .
if it does , it 's sk@@ ill@@ ful .
this is the impact of the ozone hole on sea level pressure , so low pressure , high pressures , around the southern oceans , around Antarctica .
we can look at other examples .
the erup@@ tion of Mount Pin@@ at@@ u@@ bo in 1991 put an enormous amount of aerosols , small particles , into the strat@@ osphere .
models are successful at modeling lake out@@ bursts into the North Atlantic 8,000 years ago .
we can look at this across the world .
or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business @@@ -@@ @ as @@@ -@@ @ usual type of attitude .
I was tired of fa@@ king normal .
it 's not nearly enough .
so what 's the play if you 've landed here and you 're 50 or 55 or 60 ?
I have had to get off my throne .
if you need to get food stamps , get the dar@@ n food stamps .
do what you need to do to go another round .
first of all , for those of you who are not familiar with my work , I create multicultural characters , so characters from lots of different backgrounds .
ok@@ ay .
obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED .
you guys are a @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ zing , by the way .
ok@@ ay , well , I 'm just g@@ onn@@ a answer this really fast , as , like , three or four different people .
AB : yes ?
and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of appl@@ ause .
what year was it , first of all ?
of course , I could just make up an answer and you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't know , so I come prepared for that .
I brought with me a book of cal@@ end@@ ars .
( la@@ ughter ) I did@@ n 't mean to look at you , si@@ r -- you were just sitting there .
what year was it , first of all ?
audience : April . AB : April what ?
( la@@ ughter ) Good , thank you very much .
there was a gent@@ l@@ eman up here who had a 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit calculator .
where is he , would you stand up , 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit guy ?
OK , what I 'm going to try and do , is to square in my head a five @@@ -@@ @ digit number requiring a 10 @@@ -@@ @ digit calculator .
so you can actually , honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size .
now , I have to apolog@@ ize to our mag@@ ician friend L@@ enn@@ art Green .
Oh , I did this row already .
six .
Y@@ uck .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
let me explain what that is .
( la@@ ughter ) Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right , because this is my big finish , OK .
so , without any more st@@ alling , here we go .
next , I do 57 squ@@ ared , which is 3,@@ 249 , so I can say , three billion .
thank you very much .
thank you .
my mother looked at me and she said , " How did they treat you ? "
now , color blind@@ ness , in my view , do@@ es@@ n 't mean that there 's no racial discrimination , and there 's fairness .
he is the first person to develop a mathematical calculation for diversity .
now , I also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands that this progress will help them , because they 're expecting us to be great role models .
you see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave , it 's wo@@ ven into the fabric of America .
so right now , what I 'm asking you to do , I 'm asking you to show courage .
accidents are inevitable .
Mt : sorry . now , one way of persu@@ ading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
much as the Victor@@ ians f@@ aked their mechanical mar@@ vels , we can add a layer of dec@@ eption to help us feel more comfortable with our robo@@ tic friends .
we give them a friendly face and a reas@@ suring voice .
and now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Music ) MT : and that 's it . thank you very much , and thank you , EDI . EDI : thank you , Marco .
why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person ?
it 's very hard to know who needs to have information and who do@@ es@@ n 't .
but what we found is we had to change .
and he says , " They 're their personnel records . "
the fact that I know something has zero value if I 'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it .
so as a consequence , what we did was we changed the idea of information , instead of knowledge is power , to one where sharing is power .
H@@ W : thank you so much . thank you .
but once your appliances can talk to you , who else are they going to be talking to ?
I can now tell you that the only thing worse than getting a terrible night 's sleep is to have your smart bed tell you the next day that you " missed your goal and got a low sleep score . "
we were seeing what the IS@@ P could see , but more importantly , what they could sell .
SM : so true .
and I had someone write in , I 've had people write in about , can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart 's broken ?
it 's been sampled 5@@ 47 times .
I do hope that comes back soon .
it runs a risk of being completely bl@@ and .
Rock@@ ists , who are racist but only about rock music , constantly use the argument to - That 's a real word . that is a real word .
they constantly use the argument to de@@ value rap and modern pop , and these arguments completely miss the point , because the dam has burst .
so what happens when operating costs are low ?
I think they use interactions to assess density , so when they 're really crowded , they meet more often , and they search more thoroughly .
so the most familiar resource for ants is a pic@@ nic , and this is a clu@@ stered resource .
they were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up .
now , we 've seen this before in the savings and loan deb@@ acle , and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders , and that no honest l@@ ender would ever infl@@ ate the appraisal , because it 's the great protection against loss .
so we knew again about this crisis .
the Fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals .
and so , while lions are ro@@ aming the cam@@ p@@ site , the F@@ BI is ch@@ asing m@@ ice .
thank you very much .
what would you say ?
but I asked him , " What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance ? "
he said , " You listened .
this is what suicide does .
horri@@ ble , absolutely horri@@ ble .
I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
and my initial conclusion was that they 're just better people .
but that 's completely wrong .
it could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
all she was telling me is that she do@@ es@@ n 't trust her leaders .
we want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
that 's a san@@ e response to war .
that 's what 's so complicated about war .
and trust me , if a room full of peace @@@ -@@ @ loving people finds something compelling about war , so do 20 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old soldiers who have been trained in it , I promise you .
it 's hor@@ mon@@ ally supported .
half a second later , I heard du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ t @@@ -@@ @ du@@ h .
" Ma '@@ am , I miss almost all of it . "
he 's not a psych@@ op@@ ath .

ordinary people matter .
journalists , scientists , philosoph@@ ers matter .
fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy do@@ es@@ n 't cook the way that they like their food prepared .
and so we were very happy , thus far .
one of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month .
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who are@@ n 't making their own .
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fet@@ ching water .
that 's the best way to do it .
thank you .
tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you 've worked on .
and what do they do ?
" this is the way it ought to be . "
and B , we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tom@@ ato sau@@ ce , then they would embrace it .
what How@@ ard Mos@@ ko@@ witz was doing was saying , " This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tom@@ ato sau@@ ce . "
right now , we don 't have the option to choose the virtu@@ ous t @@@ -@@ @ shirt over the non @@@ -@@ @ virtu@@ ous one . so what would it take to do that ?

once those images are collected , another expert physician then diagnos@@ es those images and talks to the patient .
these information pac@@ kets included colors , pixels , geometry and rendering of the disease on the medical image .
then remember those billions of information pac@@ kets ?
and what happens after the lights go out ?
as I 've traveled around the world , I 've met many though@@ tful people who have told me that God put fi@@ ref@@ lies on Earth for humans to enjoy .
but how could these bright lights have benefited some pro@@ to @@@ -@@ @ Fi@@ ref@@ ly ?
we can actually see the gift - it 's shown here in red - as it 's being passed from the male to the female .
his own female responds , " May@@ be . "
you might not notice when the first few fl@@ ames fl@@ ick@@ er out , but in the end , you 're left sitting in darkness .
now , that 's not to say that smell is not important to people .
he basically went through systematically , showing that only the molec@@ ule in question was the one that stimulated the males , not all the others .
it 's all about culture .
well , we really ought to talk about ar@@ mp@@ its , and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones .
they simply don 't sec@@ re@@ te those od@@ or@@ less precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the sm@@ ells that in an ethno@@ centric way we always thought of as characteristic of ar@@ mp@@ its .
it 's going to be difficult , it 's going to be embar@@ ras@@ sing , but we need to look .
her n@@ ip@@ ple is completely hidden by the baby 's head , but what you 'll notice is a white dro@@ ple@@ t with an arrow pointing to it , and that 's the sec@@ re@@ tion from the are@@ ol@@ ar g@@ lands .
it 's a very interesting sec@@ re@@ tion .
and this is a big problem . it 's continuing .
how many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas ?
so we asked ourselves , how many countries do we need to focus on , keeping in mind that the European Union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy ?
this is a slide that shows the h@@ erring population in Norway that was crashing since the 1950s .
the fishery comes back .
and it 's not just in Norway .
but in the oceans , we don 't have that war .
in the oceans , biodiversity is not at war with abundance .
did@@ n 't anyone get that ? ( la@@ ughter ) Illegal fishing .
illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management I 'm talking about .
what were you eating ?
are you sure that 's what it was ?
we don 't know how to read the sentences .
if you 're going to do a study like that , you can imagine you 'd like to look at lots and lots of people .
so you must be going , " Hu@@ h , did you find any unexpected heroes ? "
identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community , and to give strength there , too .
forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right .
which is to say , you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell .
but I was at war with myself , and I du@@ g terrible wounds into my own psych@@ e .
we don 't seek the painful experiences that he@@ w our identities , but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences .
one of the artists I met said to me , " We were in training to be not artists but angels . "
and that 's what they did .
( la@@ ughter ) But its time has not yet come .
in Russia , the anti @@@ -@@ @ propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets .
in Saudi Arabia recently , two men who had been caught in car@@ nal acts were sentenced to 7,000 l@@ ashes each , and are now permanently disabled as a result .
so who can forge meaning and build identity ?
Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights , and for the millions who live in un@@ accepting places with no resources , dignity remains elusive .
and yet , every step forward is so sweet .
in 2007 , six years after we met , my partner and I decided to get married .
mar@@ rying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence .
in October , it was my 50th birthday , and my family organized a party for me .
I 'm glad we all get cake .
thank you .
so it was the fall of 19@@ 02 , and President The@@ od@@ ore Ro@@ ose@@ vel@@ t needed a little break from the White House , so he took a train to Mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called S@@ me@@ des .
a few days later , the scene was mem@@ ori@@ alized in a political cartoon back in Washington .
wild tur@@ keys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea ot@@ ters , and pan@@ d@@ as are twice as lo@@ vable as lad@@ y@@ bugs .
the one brought to Ta@@ ft 's table weighed 18 pounds .
but even with all this marketing , the life of the bil@@ ly pos@@ sum turned out to be just pa@@ the@@ tically brief .
the to@@ y was an absolute flo@@ p , and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year , and what that means is that the bil@@ ly pos@@ sum did@@ n 't even make it to Christ@@ mas@@ time , which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a to@@ y .
our imagination has become an ecological force .
so a brief history of technology in the N@@ FL .
more people watched the game because it was more exciting .
the ball comes off track .
there really was@@ n 't a whole lot going on .
they signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it .
they signed up because their family said this was important .
and now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts .
I just said it because it s@@ ounded right .
" thank you for your service . "
when I first came back from Afghanistan , I thought that if you make it back from conflict , then the dangers were all over .
it keeps playing out in all of our minds .
it plays out in all of our memories .
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me , " What did you do ? "
what I wanted to better understand was what 's behind that , and why " thank you for your service " is@@ n 't enough .
we signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right .
these are the people who I served with , and these are the people who I honor .
these questions are almost universal .
we knew we needed to re@@ imagine what a doctor 's visit looks like , to get kids out of poverty and to give them a fair shot at a healthy life .
in the first two , we returned 1.6 million dollars to 750 families in Boston alone .
this year -- ( Appl@@ ause ) This year , we 've expanded to nine sites in four states .
or think about medical care .
one mom used her refund for her son to study abroad in Spain .
because here 's what it does well .
it broad@@ ens your pool of potential dates beyond your existing social and professional circles .
so , when things are@@ n 't working out , I tend to take a step back , apply my business toolkit to figure out why , and to fix it .
the zero date also gave me a chance to see how they responded to me asking them out .
I fig@@ ured not everyone would di@@ g my mo@@ x@@ ie , and I was right .
but we had agreed to meet on the Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n Heights Pro@@ men@@ ade with a fl@@ ask of whis@@ key to watch the sunset , and honestly , it was two blocks from my apartment .
plus , this guy had a po@@ d@@ cast , I have a po@@ d@@ cast , worst case scenario , we can talk about our po@@ d@@ casts .
he was a lawyer and a writer , and his eyes tw@@ ink@@ led when he laugh@@ ed and they squee@@ zed tight when I kis@@ sed him and at some point in the evening , our zero date became a first date .
Don 't treat it like a game , and don 't treat it like a resume review .
it 's finding your person .
good luck .
look at these images .
so let me tell you how we got here .
( video ) Hol@@ o@@ gram : how did I survive ?
I survived , I believe , because provi@@ d@@ ence watched over me .
SS : turns out these answers were pre@@ recorded in a studio .
so I saw this and began to wonder , can we create a model like this for anyone ?
if you can leverage this kind of passive information , just photos and video that are out there , that 's the key to scaling to anyone .
and here 's the same output model from different angles .
it turns out this problem is very challenging , but the key trick is that we are going to analyze a large photo collection of the person beforehand .
( video ) Daniel Cra@@ ig : right , but somehow , we 've managed to attract some more amazing people .
George W. Bush : it 's a difficult bill to pass , because there 's a lot of moving parts , and the legislative processes can be ug@@ ly .
and what I did exactly was , I let a computer watch 14 hours of pure Barack Obama giving addresses .

thank you .
basically what this syndrome causes , is that I CA@@ N@@ NOT gain weight .
a lot of people think , " L@@ iz@@ z@@ ie , how in the world are you saying there are benefits when you can only see out of one eye ? "
I was my parents ' first child .
I credit pretty much everything that I 've done in my life to my parents .

( la@@ ughter ) I am a fun k@@ id , and she 's the one missing out .
what did I do ? why don 't they like me ? "
they sat me down and said , " L@@ iz@@ z@@ ie , the only thing different about you is that you 're smaller than the other kids .
you have this syndrome , but it 's not going to define who you are . "
they said , " Go to school , pick your head up , smile , continue to be yourself , and people will see that you 're just like them . "
and so that 's what I did .
I can 't see out of one eye , but I can see out of the other .
( appl@@ ause ) I wanted to graduate college , and I just finished college .
I wanted to have , lastly , my own family and my own career .
now I want to end , with asking you again .
( la@@ ughter ) But being an artist is also a daunting job .
( la@@ ughter ) Or a slight sense of un@@ ease or maybe down@@ right panic .
and when I wake up from that , I have the most terrible taste in my mouth .
( la@@ ughter ) And so , what I like to do is , I like to take images from really remote cultural areas and bring them together .
( la@@ ughter ) Liter@@ ally .
( appl@@ ause ) What I want to do is create an a@@ ha moment , for you , for the reader .
your interaction with an image , your ability to read , question , be bo@@ thered or bo@@ red or inspired by an image is as important as my artistic contribution .
but there are many aspects to this life that are far from id@@ yl@@ lic .
I 'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father 's cre@@ mation .

I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
the bottom line is , time is a powerful force .

it 's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of .
and we seem to think that any item shar@@ per than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10 .

let them fo@@ ol around with it on their own terms and trust me , they 're going to learn things that you can 't get out of playing with D@@ ora the Explorer toys .
these kinds of target @@@ -@@ @ based practices also help kids develop attention and concentration skills , so those are great .

when I teach the history of the English language , I require that students teach me two new s@@ lan@@ g words before I will begin class .
at some level , we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries , but we 're really not sure who those hands belong to .
to give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting , it occurs right before happy hour .
in the past , some of the winners have been " t@@ we@@ et " in 2009 and " h@@ ash@@ tag " in 2012 .
and we have made some questionable choices , for example in 2006 when the word of the year was " Pl@@ u@@ to@@ ed , " to mean demo@@ ted .
here is Samuel Rog@@ ers in 18@@ 55 who is concerned about some fashionable pron@@ unci@@ ations that he finds offensive , and he says " as if contem@@ plate were not bad enough , balcony makes me sick . "
in response , the American Heritage Dic@@ tionaries include usage notes .
usage notes tend to occur with words that are troubles@@ ome in one way , and one of the ways that they can be troubles@@ ome is that they 're changing meaning .
American Heritage has that as the first definition .
( la@@ ughter ) And then they include a usage note , which is worth looking at .
Ah , the U@@ s@@ age Panel , that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more len@@ ient about this .
now , what I hope you 're thinking right now is , " Wa@@ it , who 's on the U@@ s@@ age Panel ?
and what should I do with their pronoun@@ cements ? "
but who looks at the front matter of dictionaries ?
there are about 200 people on the U@@ s@@ age Panel .
( appl@@ ause ) Here 's what we can do for you .
we can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage .
I will be honest with you : I do not like the word " imp@@ ac@@ tful , " but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether " imp@@ ac@@ tful " is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written pro@@ se .
so to be responsible , what I do is go look at usage , which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Bo@@ oks .
it gets in because we use it and we keep using it , and dictionary editors are paying attention to us .
if a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means , it 's real .
that word might be s@@ lan@@ gy , that word might be informal , that word might be a word that you think is il@@ logical or unnecessary , but that word that we 're using , that word is real .
think of a hard choice you 'll face in the near future .
it might be between two careers -- artist and accoun@@ tant -- or places to live -- the city or the country -- or even between two people to marry -- you could marry Bet@@ ty or you could marry L@@ ol@@ ita .
or whether to don@@ ate your life savings to charity .
chances are , the hard choice you thought of was something big , something moment@@ ous , something that matters to you .
what makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate .
in any easy choice , one alternative is better than the other .
we shou@@ ld@@ n 't think that all hard choices are big .
let 's say you 're deciding what to have for breakfast .
there are amazing things you can learn as a phil@@ os@@ op@@ her , and all from the comfort of an arm@@ chair .
well , that struck me as the height of extra@@ vag@@ ance and fri@@ vol@@ ity .
if only God or Net@@ f@@ li@@ x would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers , I 'd be set .
it was@@ n 't who I was .
suppose the bank , wo@@ oing you , adds 500 dollars a month to your salary .
a higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before , but it might not be enough to make being a ban@@ ker better than being an artist .
that 's not the case with options in hard choices .
so now we 've got a puzzle .
the weight of one is greater , lesser or equal to the weight of the other .
you might say that we become the authors of our own lives .
now , people who don 't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are dri@@ f@@ ters .
and that 's why hard choices are not a curse but a go@@ d@@ send .
these were the men I looked up to .

however , when we looked at the survey data , we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords , and the long passwords were a lot more usable , and in some cases , they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords .
they ran the code .
so we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually 1.8 times stronger than those affiliated with the business school .

so why should we believe the science ?

and that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun .
but also because in the ideal case , it 's about laws .
so just because the prediction comes true do@@ es@@ n 't actually logically prove that the theory is correct .
and I have a good example of that too , again from the history of science .
today we would draw the picture more like this , this comes from NASA , and you see the Earth 's orbit is actually quite small .

well , scientists can model it using a computer simulation .
and by that he meant it 's organized because they do it collectively , they do it as a group , and skep@@ ticism , because they do it from a position of distrust .
scientists can say no , it 's false .
most of us trust our cars .
it 's not because of the gen@@ ius of Henry Ford or Kar@@ l Ben@@ z or even El@@ on Mus@@ k .

the biggest question was , what do we want to translate it to ?
when I gather up enough of these sequences , I begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be .
most importantly for me , this is what the code on your cell phone looks like .

why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?
( appl@@ ause ) R@@ ick Per@@ ry : absolutely , I think it 's - Paul Blo@@ om : each of the people on@@ stage agreed with the premise of her question , which is as Americans , we should care more about Americans than about other people .
and in fact , in general , people are often sw@@ ay@@ ed by feelings of solidarity , loyalty , pride , patriotism , towards their country or towards their ethnic group .
residents of other countries feel the same about their nation , and we feel the same about our ethn@@ icities .
now some of you may reject this .
now , this distinction is natural enough and often moral enough , but it can go aw@@ ry , and this was part of the research of the great social psych@@ ologist Hen@@ ri Taj@@ fe@@ l .
Taj@@ fe@@ l was born in Poland in 1919 .
he left to go to university in France , because as a Jew , he cou@@ ld@@ n 't go to university in Poland , and then he en@@ listed in the French military in World War II .
and in fact , when the war ended and he was released , most of his friends and family were dead .
their answers had nothing to do with Kand@@ insky or Kle@@ e .
this bias seems to show up very early .
so one of the pup@@ pets might like green beans .
but the question is , does this matter to babies in how they treat the pup@@ pets ? and it matters a lot .
they tend to prefer the pup@@ pet who has the same food tastes that they have , and worse , they actually prefer pup@@ pets who punish the pup@@ pet with the different food taste .
the ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands .
one avenue is to appeal to people 's emotional responses , to appeal to people 's em@@ pa@@ thy , and we often do that through stories .

all men are created equal .
they fought with amazing , incredible courage and val@@ or .
there is one battle that illustrates that .

the Germans thought an attack from the back@@ side would be impossible .
I 'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend .
that 's more in a single day than all three major U.S. networks broadcast in the last five years combined .
let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean .
so anyway , there are lots of these photos being erron@@ eously reported as spam and abuse , and one of the engineers on the team had a hun@@ ch .
here 's how the experience works today .
before , only 20 percent of people were sending the message , and now 60 percent were , and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result .
it 's both art and science .
so we decided to simplify into an up @@@ -@@ @ down kind of voting binary model .
now , when you set a goal to design for the entire human race , and you start to engage in that goal in earnest , at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you 're living in .
now , in San Francisco , we get a little mi@@ ffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can 't use our phones to navigate to the new hi@@ p@@ ster coffee shop .
designing for low @@@ -@@ @ end cell phones is not gl@@ amor@@ ous design work , but if you want to design for the whole world , you have to design for where people are , and not where you are .
so then , step two ...
that is what I need for my characters in my books : a passionate heart .
and of bro@@ th@@ els where children are forced to receive five , 15 clients per day , and if they rebel , they are tortured with electricity .
she 's sex@@ y , s@@ lim and tall , with a deep tan .
now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wr@@ ink@@ les ?
( la@@ ughter ) Well , she did@@ n 't say that exactly .
so here 's a tale of passion .
the pro@@ tag@@ onists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Map@@ end@@ o .
outside , there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated .
women are 51 percent of humankind .
they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the volum@@ inous Bo@@ ter@@ o style .
I fear abuse of power , and the power to abuse .
we need a critical number of women in positions of power , and we need to nurture the femin@@ ine energy in men .
I 'm talking about men with young minds , of course .
not better , but to make it good .
and I would suggest that this has something to do with the Internet . it 's not a flu@@ ke .
so remember before the Internet ? ( la@@ ughter ) I call this B.@@ I. Ok@@ ay ?
so , in B.@@ I. , life was simple .
this is the Before Internet , B.@@ I. , innovation model .
we do all kinds of things .
what was happening there was you would have these manufacturing devices , and they we@@ ren 't making proto@@ types or Power@@ Points .
the factory was in the designer , and the designer was literally in the factory .
so I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex , what you need to do is very simple .
scores of Somali @@@ -@@ @ American kids came out to embrace sport despite the fat@@ wa against it .
the first is in the strength of her family and all the other families to continue telling their stories and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism .
so what I 'm going to show you is , in retro@@ spec@@ t , a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time .
three reasons : one was they were low @@@ -@@ @ resolution .
so these are the things we were saying in those TE@@ Ds .
so we informed our audience that what they will just now hear will be a random paper , a mixture of the two papers which we did@@ n 't know what each was writing .
now for me , a question often is why we still embrace this idea of a self @@@ -@@ @ made man on which capitalism relied from its beginning ?
thank you .
and we now have over 200 satellites in orbit , down@@ linking their data to 31 ground stations we built around the planet .
in total , we get 1.5 million 29 @@@ -@@ @ meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ el images of the Earth down each day .
a deep stack of data , documenting immense change .
and lots of people are using this imagery .
consumer @@@ -@@ @ mapping companies are using it to improve the maps you find online .
or helping to find the refugees fleeing Myanmar .
anyone can go online to plan@@ et@@ .com open an account and see all of our imagery online .
or you can create a time lap@@ se through the 500 images that we have and see that change dramatically over time .
and you can share these over social media .
OK , so humanity now has this database of information about the planet , changing over time .
what we 're doing with artificial intelligence is finding the objects in all the satellite images .
the same AI tools that are used to find cats in videos online can also be used to find information on our pictures .
and if you could do that for all of the millions of images coming down per day , then you basically create a database of all the siz@@ able objects on the planet , every day .
this is Beijing .
and let 's look here in the port of Vancouver .
so , we zoom in on Vancouver , we select the area , and we search for ships .
and it outputs where all the ships are .
but we frequently find ships that are not doing that .
the pictures don 't lie .
in time , we could get more sophisticated browsers that people pull in from different sources .
but ultimately , I can imagine us abstr@@ acting out the imagery entirely and just having a quer@@ y@@ able interface to the Earth .
so , Planet 's Mission 1 was to image the whole planet every day and make it accessible .

because I 'm not a pack rat .
so , you know , I love Apple computers .
well , it 's not . " E.@@ T. " is about divorce .
when you look at a movie like " Ja@@ ws , " the scene that you expect -- we have the screen ?
you 're not supposed to ri@@ p off the shar@@ k or the mon@@ ster .
this is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience .
what I 've realized is what my grand@@ father did for me when I was a k@@ id , everyone has access to now .
J@@ J@@ A : OK , now .
and the mystery box , in honor of my grand@@ father , stays closed .
let 's meet some of them .
actually , nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall .
by the end of the course , they take the final exam , get a grade , and follow to the next course .
this is true off the playing field as well .
the end result is that we m@@ ess up .
we showed that performance was slower and more error @@@ -@@ @ prone when we drew their attention to the step @@@ -@@ @ by @@@ -@@ @ step details of what they were doing .
when the pressure is on , we 're often concerned with performing at our best , and as a result we try and control what we 're doing to force the best performance .
social media plays a big role here , too .
fast @@@ -@@ @ forward from my high school soccer game to my fresh@@ man year in college .
I was in the chemistry sequence for science maj@@ ors , and boy did I not belong .
even though I studied for my first midterm exam -- I thought I was ready to go -- I bombed it .
if you could 've looked inside my brain during that first midterm exam , you likely would 've seen a ne@@ ural pain response a lot like the math @@@ -@@ @ anxious individuals I study .
it was probably there during the stres@@ s@@ ful study situation as well .
but when I walked into the final , my mind was quiet , and I actually got one of the highest grades in the entire class .
you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most bi@@ ologists visu@@ alize their molecular hypo@@ theses .
why ?
because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard .
we are really excited to see what bi@@ ologists will create with it and what new insights they 're able to gain from finally being able to anim@@ ate their own model figures .
when the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945 , it immediately expanded there , and soon it started to train the German Communi@@ sts to build up their own secret police .
in 1989 , more than 9@@ 0,000 employees worked for the St@@ asi .
thirdly , the St@@ asi worked as a kind of public prosecutor .
last but not least , the St@@ asi had its own armed forces .
it was founded to crash down protests and u@@ pris@@ ings .
please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented .
telephones were wi@@ ret@@ apped , including the phone of the German chan@@ cell@@ or in the West , and often also the apartments .
the St@@ asi also shad@@ owed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took .
contrast that with S@@ now@@ den , for example .
but the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of em@@ pa@@ thy with the object of observation .
the agent who shad@@ owed me did@@ n 't know who I was or why I was surveyed .
and in a way , the minister was right , because technical instruments can only register what people are doing , but agents and sp@@ ies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking .
this guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betra@@ y their fellow citizens .
sometimes it 's said that inform@@ ants were pres@@ sured to becoming one , but that 's mostly not true , because a forced inform@@ ant is a bad inform@@ ant .
the officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the inform@@ ant , and to be honest , the example of the St@@ asi shows that it 's not so difficult to win someone in order to betra@@ y others .
we took those who were around you . "
this reminds me of the novel " 1984 " by George Or@@ well , where the only apparently tru@@ stable person was an inform@@ er .
that 's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime .
it was called Zer@@ set@@ z@@ ung , and it 's described in another guideline .
instead , he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central .
so that makes a fundamental difference .
as you can probably gather , S 's and T 's , together or independently , are my k@@ ry@@ p@@ ton@@ ite .
singing for me is sweet relief .
but I am actually pretty good at a couple of things .
I earn 1,000 times the median wage , but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff , do I ?
now the or@@ thodox reaction , of course , is raising the minimum wage costs jobs . right ?
why ? because the fundamental law of capitalism is , when workers have more money , businesses have more customers and need more workers .
there is no evidence for it .
it 's not that they don 't have good entrepreneurs in other places , even very , very poor places .
it 's just that that 's all that those entrepreneurs ' customers can afford .
once upon a time , there was a woman named M@@ iss Marg@@ aret .
so much so that she mar@@ ched down to that human @@@ -@@ @ resource department to see if she was eligible for an early retirement .
and everybody knows what bad data does .
I wanted to talk about bi@@ ases , the un@@ conscious ones and the conscious ones , and what we do .
because now I know that when you engage people in the why , it challenges their perspective , and it changes their attitudes .
now I know that teaching people transitional change instead of shoc@@ king them into change is always a better way of implementing change .
thank you .
as a k@@ id I always loved information that I could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers .
I always wanted to know , what are people trying to hide with numbers ?
well , we had data that told a different story .
in fact , we could probably pretty accurately estimate conception .
so why this temperature jump ?
well , think about when a bird sits on her eggs .
until a couple of days later I saw some spo@@ tting and then I noticed heavy blood flow , and we had in fact had an early stage mis@@ carriage .
when it gets too cold in the house , your thermo@@ stat kic@@ ks in and says , " He@@ y , we need to blow some heat around . "

we 're looking at each other , and I looked at the doctor , and I said , " Why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diag@@ nose his condition , but this previous doctor wanted to order an E@@ K@@ G and a CAT scan ? "
we house the parents of almost three million of our community 's children , and we 've become the new asylum , the largest mental health provider in this nation .
he was a Vietnam veteran . corrections suited him .
I was not so much any of those things , and I 'm sure that worried him about me .
and just in case you wondered , they shared one toilet in those small confin@@ es .
hundreds of men stream@@ ed out of their cells .
even in prison , it 's no small thing to lock someone up .
out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments .
inmates and staff started inter@@ acting more often and openly and developing a rap@@ port .
to be honest with you , preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions .
and I find myself thinking a lot about that last point , tell your truth .
that 's all bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence . like I said : just like fi@@ ref@@ lies .
there 's still 97 percent , and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises .
this is a Gi@@ ant Australian cu@@ ttle@@ fish .

and power governs how any form of government operates , whether a democracy or a dictatorship .
this is why it is so fundamental for us right now to grab hold of this idea of power and to democrati@@ ze it .
we begin to opt out .
think about the change that you want in your city , and then think about how you would get it , how you would make it happen .
could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know ?
this is the challenge and the opportunity for us .
think about how experiments in participatory budgeting , where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation of city funds .
T@@ ed is 30 .
and I part@@ nered with the School Nutrition Association , and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day .
there is Ms. B@@ ren@@ da in California , who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counsel@@ or if anything is am@@ iss .
and they made thank you piz@@ z@@ as , where every k@@ id signed a different top@@ ping of a construction paper piz@@ za .
for me , I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies , because one woman said to me , she said , " Before this day , I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school .

we were actually very lucky , and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening .
and finally , this is how the R@@ ci@@ f Plaza will look like when the project is completed .
both the ma@@ ize and the vegetables are grown on most Kenyan farms , which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm .
on the way back to the ministry in the car , she turned around to me and said , " Rose , you 've always been interested in finance .
they said , " W@@ ow , that 's great , but that 'll be late .
no more years of the cup .
it 's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress .
in other animals , we have YouTube .
lots of creatures - this horse is just one example - develop self @@@ -@@ @ destructive behavi@@ ors .
and it turns out we 're actually so much more complicated than that .
a week later , P@@ ing was discovered in the apartment alongside the body of her owner , and the vacuum had been running the entire time .
I don 't think , though , that that 's a problem .
today , however , we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects , but they 're giving them these drugs as patients , both in ethical and much less ethical ways .
we get ever more vulnerable .
at 19 , I helped a friend whose parents had force@@ fully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage .
so throughout my life , I 've seen women - family , friends , colleagues - live through these experiences , and they seldom talk about it .
so in simple words , life in India is not easy .
so in the months that followed , I covered a trail of events in Bang@@ al@@ ore which had no space in the mainstream news .
walking to the fruit seller 's or the tailor 's , I got sta@@ res so sharp that they s@@ lic@@ ed away bits of me piece by piece . "
it was on news channels across the world .
small changes allow us to make discoveries , like the planet found by Her@@ sch@@ el .
science can , in our life@@ times -- even in a decade -- transform what it means to have a specific illness .
but not for all illnesses .
but that , too , became too complicated .
that drug makes the voices somewhat quie@@ ter , but it did@@ n 't restore his bright mind or his social connec@@ tedness .
it 's a strategy that has worked again and again and again .
and that challenge is that we 'd like to learn from the bra@@ ins of hundreds of thousands of living people .
and today , it 's increasingly possible to make progress on a scale that was never possible before .
now , the creation and elimination of syn@@ ap@@ ses is a normal part of human development and learning .
there are hundreds of places in our gen@@ om@@ es that shape risk for brain illnesses , and any one of them could lead us to the next molecular insight about a molec@@ ule that matters .
these projects bring together people with diverse backgrounds and training and interests -- biology , computers , chemistry , math , statistics , engineering .
what 's the future that we could hope to create ?
and in the same kind of tr@@ ance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you 're reading , there 's something really so@@ oth@@ ing and easy .

why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth ?
it 's stup@@ idly constructed , it 's got way too many arbitrary coupling con@@ stants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles , and what the hell is dark energy ?

when our father did speak to us , it was from the pul@@ pit of his mind .
the children became the parents to the parent .
although there 's still the kind of tempor@@ ariness that our parents felt about being here , but we children knew that the game was up .
I think there was a feeling that they would not be able to continue with the ideals of the life that they expected .
having started the process , my father did not continue .
it was left to my mother to educate me , and as George Lam@@ ming would say , it was my mother who fa@@ thered me .
now I also had a 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old son , and turned my attention to Bag@@ eye and I went in search of him .
but we sat down , and he had a Caribbean friend with him , talking some old time talk , and my father would look at me , and he looked at me as if I would mirac@@ ulously disappear as I had arisen .
this will close the generation gap , perhaps .
quality of air became better , and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effor@@ t@@ lessly right in the back@@ yard of our house .
today , we are making forests in houses , in schools , even in factories with the corpor@@ ates .
we have strong theories about how these common gal@@ ax@@ ies form and evolve .
but we don 't understand how rare gal@@ ax@@ ies form and evolve .
that 's interesting , right ?
small details on our body , like a scar or wr@@ ink@@ les , tell the story of our lives .
this discovery tells us that we still have a lot to learn , and we should keep looking deeper and deeper in space and keep searching for the unknown .
this is Nev@@ ada 's Black Rock Des@@ ert , about as far as you can get from the galleries of New York and London and Hong Kong .

the results are normal , so here 's some pain medication , and follow up with a primary care doctor , but if the pain persists or if it worsen@@ s , then come on back . "
when she came to our clinic , though , we tried a different approach .
our approach started with our medical assistant , someone who had a GE@@ D @@@ -@@ @ level training but knew the community .
our medical assistant asked some routine questions .
" let 's get your vital signs " - measure your blood pressure and your heart rate , but let 's also ask something equally as vital to Ver@@ on@@ ica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles .
" Ver@@ on@@ ica , can you tell me about where you live ?
she looked a little bit relieved , because for the first time , she had a diagnosis , but I said , " Ver@@ on@@ ica , now let 's talk about your treatment .
she told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent .
it 's a term many of you are familiar with .
you jump right in along with your friends .
she 's in the water . she 's swimming away from them upstream , rescu@@ ing children as she goes , and they sh@@ out to her , " Where are you going ?
in healthcare , we often pay for volume and not value .
we pay doctors and hospitals usually for the number of services they provide , but not necessarily on how healthy they make you .
it 's not that doctors don 't know these are important issues .
first , they sit down and they say , let 's identify the clinical problem among a certain set of patients .
let 's say , for instance , let 's try to help children who are b@@ ouncing in and out of the hospital with asth@@ ma .
the root cause analysis that an up@@ stream@@ ist brings to the table is to say , let 's look at the living and the working conditions in your life .
it 's clear to me that there are so many stories of up@@ stream@@ ists who are doing remarkable things .
by some estimates , we need one up@@ stream@@ ist for every 20 to 30 clin@@ icians in the healthcare system .
in the U.S. , for instance , that would mean that we need 25,000 up@@ stream@@ ists by the year 2020 .
these stories are compelling because not only do they tell us that we 're this close to getting the healthcare system that we want , but that there 's something that we can all do to get there .
doctors and nurses can get better at asking about the context of patients ' lives , not simply because it 's better bed@@ side manner , but frankly , because it 's a better standard of care .
health is a common good .
no , you seem to be thinking clearly , and your vision is perfectly sharp .
and everything looks normal except the children 's faces .
so this picture 's nice , if I do say so myself , but it shows only an@@ atom@@ y .
bra@@ ins are like muscles .
is it really specialized just for face recognition ?
to tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function , you need to m@@ ess with it and see what happens , and normally we don 't get to do that .
so it turned out by total chance that two of the electro@@ des happened to be right on top of his face area .
imagine taking the sk@@ ull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that .
I drove my Hond@@ a 350 across the United States in an " E@@ asy Ri@@ der " kind of way .

something like that .

it 's kind of hard to imagine the un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space .
and so what our nick@@ name ended up becoming , and what ended up stic@@ king , was the L@@ ow@@ line , so the L@@ ow@@ line was born .
what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel , and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible .
so , like a crazy person , I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project .
here 's the under@@ bel@@ ly of this solar can@@ op@@ y which we built to show the technology .
so what we 're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space under@@ ne@@ ath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community @@@ -@@ @ driven focus in a rapidly gen@@ tri@@ fying area .
and right now , we 're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way .
and in a tw@@ ist you would not believe in a Ste@@ ven Spi@@ el@@ berg film -- the Ga@@ ul@@ e@@ iter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same th@@ ief who had stolen s@@ ocks from Mr. T@@ es@@ z@@ ler 's ho@@ si@@ ery mill .
it was a brutal beating . and mid@@ way through that brutality , one of Mr. T@@ es@@ z@@ ler 's sons , Andrew , looked up and said , " Is it time to take the cap@@ su@@ le now , Pap@@ a ? "
and once for an interdisciplinary class , I was screening the opening segment of Ing@@ mar Ber@@ g@@ man 's " The Seventh Se@@ al . "
this is what I 'm passionate about . it is precisely this .
so this is what inspired me .
I am trying , or will try to convey this inspiration .
we also hear about the store@@ house of biodiversity .
while many believe it , few know it .
if you go out there , in this mar@@ sh , you 'll be amaz@@ ed at the -- You can barely see the animals .
I 'll try to use an approach that 's slightly materi@@ alistic , but it also attempts to convey that , in nature , there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony .
we 'll start by thinking that water is like blood .
this is an image of rain in motion .
what phenomenon -- if it 's not a desert , what phenomenon makes water g@@ ush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
they use sunlight to do this process .
so , in a typical sunny day in the Amazon , a big tree manages to transfer 1,000 lit@@ ers of water through its trans@@ pir@@ ation -- 1,000 lit@@ ers .
any idea ? a really big kettle .
a gig@@ antic kettle , right ?
look over there , in the southern hemisphere , the At@@ ac@@ ama ; Namibia and Kal@@ a@@ har@@ i in Africa ; the Australian desert .
where are the ar@@ teries ?
there is a new type of river , which origin@@ ates in the blue sea , which flows through the green ocean -- it not only flows , but it is also pum@@ ped by the green ocean -- and then it falls on our land .
there is another frac@@ tal analogy .
like endoc@@ r@@ inal g@@ lands and hormones , there are those gases which I told you about before , that are formed and released into the atmosphere , like hormones , which help in the formation of rain .
the desert is trapped in this condition . it will always be dry .
and he drove me out to the University of Pit@@ ts@@ burgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation .
well , I 'm now a truste@@ e of the university , and at my installation ceremony I said , " I 'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation .
I said , " Well , I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there . "
that good food 's not for rich people -- good food 's for everybody on the planet , and there 's no excuse why we all can 't be eating it .

and that weekend , I was going back home and Her@@ bie Han@@ coc@@ k was playing our center that night -- first time I 'd met him .
he said , " Well , that 's the electronic commerce network . "
( la@@ ughter ) And J@@ ef@@ f and I did become friends , and he 's organized a team of people and we 're going to build this center .
and after about 10 pictures they all settled down .
and I promised these people that I was going to build this thing , and we 're going to build it all right .
and my hope is that I 've made a few here tonight .
the world has been much , much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this , you know .
well , it 's very clear that poverty here was almost hal@@ ved , and in U.S. , when we asked the public , only five percent got it right .
of course they think so , because they don 't even know what has happened .
that 's basically what I will do .
now , the next pre@@ conceived idea is first countries and people need to be very , very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters .
the Western domination is over , as of today .

for me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
and here 's just one example .
so here 's a letter . it says , " De@@ ar people , I bet you 10 buc@@ ks you won 't send me a blue wh@@ ale .

but Nic@@ o 's the best reader I could hope for .

China was getting serious about market economics and about university education , so they decided to call in the foreign experts .
it 's doubled over those 25 years , more than doubled , from 10 million to 20 million .
hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty .
now , the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I 've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing .
fifty percent now in urban areas .
this is profound structural change .
and let me start with cities .
when the visibility dropped to [ less ] than a few meters , they stopped the buses and I had to walk .
we have to invest strongly in energy , we have to use it much more efficiently , and we have to make it clean .
take the example of California .
do the first one well , the structural , the second one on the climate becomes much easier .
over the last few years , actually more than a few , Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly .
again , I think it 's a strong ambition but it is a pl@@ au@@ sible one .
and technology is changing very rapidly .
how do we know it ?
it allows us to see better .
so what is new about big data ? what is the big deal ?
well , to answer that question , let 's think about what information looked like , physically looked like in the past .
there is , if you will , a liquidity to information .
take , for example , Martin Lu@@ ther .
three of the traits were ones that people did@@ n 't need to look for , but that the machine spo@@ tted .
we now need to rec@@ ast our gaz@@ e at the I , the information , which is less apparent , but in some ways a lot more important .
my work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions , and created a lasting stigma for me and my family .

for a moment , all I saw was white , bright white , like these lights .
some of us will see it coming .
early in my career , I faced this dilemma by simply lying .
as I assessed him , I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him , and like so many other cases , he looked me in the eye and asked that question : " am I going to die ? "
in that moment , I decided to do something different .
I decided to tell him the truth .
his reaction shocked me to this day .
whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret , their guilt is universal .
and who does the emp@@ tying ?
as you can see , there 's no protective equipment , no protective clothing .
from them , Min@@ ty learned about the secret communications that occurred along trade routes , information that would prove invaluable later in her life .

big problems need big solutions , spar@@ ked by big ideas , imagination and aud@@ acity , but also solutions that work .
here in the United States , where we have healthcare reform , we don 't have the professionals we need .
the subjects are familiar - basic and clinical sciences - but there are major differences .
third , they learn public health : to assess their patients ' drinking water , housing , social and economic conditions .
they need the chance to be the doctors their patients need .
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing , and I am an expert on this person , and so I write about it .
and I won it -- I reached all of these people , and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day .
and why are they reading this ? "
you have your Google search , where you say , " What is M@@ ena Tro@@ t@@ t ? "
and then you find these things and you 're happy or un@@ happy .
I would spend hours looking at the connections , saying , " Oh , the little k@@ id up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there . "
I have this record , this 1910 census , of another Gra@@ bow@@ ski -- that 's my ma@@ i@@ den name -- and there 's a The@@ od@@ ore , because there 's always a The@@ od@@ ore .
if you look at my driver 's license , I have the same look , and it 's a pretty disturbing thing , but it 's something that is really important .
then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time .
it 's obviously a very big commercial company , and so this little , " Sh@@ h -- it 's not really them , " was put on the side of the imagery .
but you can also show two things : first , the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality .
but it will be very difficult to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model , so you need a story where people also care about wealth accumulation for other reasons .
and then , in the post@@ war period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
now , what could be done ?
Thomas Pi@@ ket@@ ty : well , you know , I think if you look back through time , the history of income , wealth and taxation is full of surprise .
when inequality gets too extreme , then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetu@@ ation of inequality over time and low mobility .
look , the reason why I put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that we can have an open and transparent debate about this .
now , with my students , I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks .
now , it 's basically a fun thing we developed in our class where they map out what risks they 're willing to take .
it 's OK . that risk did@@ n 't work out .
at the end of the flight , we exchanged contact information .
so I invited him to come down , and he and his colleagues came to Stan@@ ford and met with the students , and afterwards , we had lunch together .
each team now has an idea that another team thought was horri@@ ble , and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant .
they all started out as crazy ideas .
apparently , all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this , and it got me thinking : when did I stop doing this ?
because apparently we don 't .
but what 's leading them to do this ?
they 're under pressure to be online and available at all times , talking , messaging , li@@ king , commenting , sharing , posting - it never ends .
what 's a highlight in someone 's life versus what 's normal in the context of everyday .
air@@ brush@@ ing is now routine .
seventeen percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they we@@ ren 't feeling confident about the way that they look .
now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this .
it is not ok@@ ay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their hair@@ cuts or the size of their brea@@ sts , or to inf@@ er that the determination or the success of an Olymp@@ ian is down to her not being a loo@@ ker .
we can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks .
giving them the air@@ time , because only then will we create a different world .
this diagram shows the body 's lym@@ ph@@ atic system , which has evolved to meet this need .
it 's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body .
I mean , the brain is this inten@@ sely active organ that produces a correspond@@ ingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared .
it was ing@@ en@@ ious , but it was also beautiful .
thank you .
I choose to be called Mary .
my mother was his second wife , married to him at the age of 16 .
my half brothers were his first priority .
with an education , you can survive .
but I was missing something : my mother .
I was 13 years old .
boarding school was heaven , but it was also so hard .
OK , I keep telling students in my class , " It 's not about the A 's ; it 's about doing your best . "
girls and women have a part to play in this just as much as men .
when I finished my high school career , I moved my sisters to Nairobi , where they live with my step@@ sister .
back here , we all played together .
soon , my mother learned that many Somalis found refuge in a small town in Minnesota .
so I made studying my top priority and soon started flour@@ ishing within the classroom .
when I first started wearing it , I was excited .
but when I started middle school , the students te@@ ased me about not having hair , so to prove them wrong , I started showing them my hair -- something that goes against my beliefs , but something I felt pres@@ sured to do .
so the question I 'd like to raise here , and I do believe it 's the most important question we need to answer , is this one : if Internet is the new printing press , then what is democracy for the Internet era ?
I 'm not saying it 's easy .
I live in Washington , D.C. , but I grew up in S@@ ind@@ he@@ k@@ ela , a village in Or@@ iss@@ a , in India .
when the opportunity came , I crossed two oceans , with borrowed money for air@@ fare and only a $ 20 bill in my pocket .
in the U.S. , I worked in a research center , part @@@ -@@ @ time , while taking graduate classes in economics .
these are people who live in a country other than their country of birth .
that would be larger , in its size of the economy , than France .
by 2005 , a decade later , at a time of political crisis , economic crisis , the share of poor people went down to 31 percent .
in El Salvador , the school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances .
and then there is the case of Venezuela , where , because of exchange controls , you send 100 dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even 10 dollars .
of course , nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel .
first , relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars .
the remittance arrives .
that means that for the two years or three years of his life , he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees .
we must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper .
my parents are not there anymore .
it 's the sense of , " This is something I 'm willing to do only if no one else is watching . "
but by contrast , good people are people who go to work , come home , raise their children , watch television .
there are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched , the behavior they engage in is va@@ stly more conform@@ ist and compliant .
it renders off @@@ -@@ @ limits all kinds of behavi@@ oral choices without our even knowing that it 's happened .
we can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or un@@ detec@@ table , but the constraints that it imposes on us do not become any less potent .
at what point will you think , well , actually , we 've succeeded in moving the dial ?
and I 'm sure many people in the room are won@@ dering the same question .
in developing countries , one third of that population is living in slums .
in some American cities , voter turnout was close to five percent .
the city of L.@@ A. , a city of four million people , elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes .
this is Le@@ bl@@ on .
this is where over 70,000 of the city 's poorest residents live .
that is higher than Norway , Switzerland or Sweden .
Le@@ and@@ ro started a campaign using one of our tools , the Pressure Co@@ ok@@ er , the same one that B@@ ia and J@@ ov@@ ita used , and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve .
Hand@@ washing with soap keeps kids in school .
many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from life@@ bu@@ oy brand .
ic@@ onic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
most of these discussions are still happening online .
unlike DNA , which is mainly fixed , micro@@ R@@ NA@@ s can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time , telling us which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment .
it is the uncontrolled regulation of genes .
( appl@@ ause ) Ano@@ ther important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud , so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contex@@ tual information .
today , cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear .
it not only costs us billions of dollars , but it also costs us the people we love .
it will give us the chance of detecting it early , understanding it better , and finding a cure .
two years ago at TED , I think -- I 've come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange del@@ usion .
I had this company that I 'd spent 15 years building . it 's called Future ; it was a magazine publishing company .
and 15 years later , there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such head@@ y times .
it took eight years of blood , swe@@ at and tears to reach 350 employees , something which I was very proud of in the business .
I was going around with this big sign on my fore@@ head : " los@@ er . "
and the reason I 'm telling this story is that I believe , from many conversations , that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rol@@ ler@@ co@@ aster -- emotional rol@@ ler@@ co@@ aster -- in the last couple years .
and at about the same time , and I think partly because of that , I started doing something that I 'd forgotten about in my business focus : I started to read again .
it 's connected ; it all ho@@ oks into each other .
and so , it 's the profound thing that Richard talks about : to understand anything , you just need to understand the little bits ; a little bit about everything that surro@@ unds it .
you 're going to have to f@@ uck up really badly to make it bad . "
there 's a year to do this , and already -- I hope to show you a bit later -- there 's 25 or so ter@@ rific speakers signed up for next year .
and one key way that we 're going to do this is to introduce this book club .
it only has four million citizens , and there are one million Syrian refugees living there .
it was just two hours after she had arrived after a long tre@@ k from Syria into Jordan .
every day , on average , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes - 3@@ 2,000 people .
this is a blessing . "
despite his extreme physical state , he was completely present with me , guiding , nurturing , and being my father as much if not more than ever before .
I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely un@@ scal@@ able , but my father insists that there are no dead ends .
why ?
and it means questioning disciplines like demo@@ graphics .
no . it 's science , not magic .
thank you .
then , at the age of eight , we moved to Botswana .
six years later , I returned to the country .
how could a country go so bad so fast ?
we 've had three generations of leaders , in my mind .
the first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent .
La@@ e@@ ti@@ tia 's a young woman from Kenya who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school because her family cou@@ ld@@ n 't afford to pay fees for her .
today , we have 700 of them that are being gro@@ omed for the African continent , and over the next 50 years , we expect to create 6,000 of them .
so today , I 'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy .
we 're building 25 brand new universities in Africa that are going to cultivate this next generation of African leaders .
( appl@@ ause ) Over the next 50 years , this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent .
well , why did I spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor ?
the real ir@@ ony is , for every 100 dollars worth of assets this program gave someone , they spent another 99 dollars to do it .
what if , instead , we use technology to put cash , whether from aid agencies or from any one of us directly into a poor person 's hands .
that 's what we 've started to do at Gi@@ ve@@ Direc@@ tly .
so far , we 've looked for the poorest people in the poorest villages , and in this part of the world , they 're the ones living in homes made of mud and th@@ at@@ ch , not cement and iron .
so let 's say that 's your family .
something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we can now do efficiently and free of corruption .
I believe in aid .
there was a paper published in the medical journal The Lan@@ ce@@ t in England a few years ago called " A man who pric@@ ked his finger and sm@@ elled pu@@ tri@@ d for 5 years . "
most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash , some money .
it fits 1,100 people , it 's j@@ am@@ med to the g@@ ills , and up on the stage , waiting to shake your hand , waiting to hand you your I@@ g Nobel prize , are a bun@@ ch of Nobel prize winners .
he looked through the records , and he discovered that a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling co@@ con@@ u@@ ts .
thank you .
for us , it 's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone .
we had never seen that before .
my father , " How can people protect what they don 't understand ? "
humanity takes center stage at TED , but I would like to add a voice for the animals , whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us .
as animals blessed with the power of rational thought , we can mar@@ vel at the intr@@ ic@@ acies of life .
Lin@@ da must be either married or not married - there are no other options .
researchers presented participants with a news article that showed no weapons of mass destruction had been found .
in the course of discussion , you 'll be exposed to counter @@@ -@@ @ arguments and re@@ butt@@ als .
that 's not how it works in Afghanistan .
so , after hours of talking and tracking them down , and about 30 cups of tea , they finally agreed that we could sit down for a second j@@ ir@@ ga , and we did .
with every case that I take , I realize that as much as I 'm standing behind my clients , that they 're also standing behind me , and that 's what keeps me going .
law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us .
we live in a different world .
they used pl@@ iers to take out her finger@@ nails .
and so we decided to take this case to the Supreme Court .
so this le@@ ash has some additional electronics .
now , I can tell you that it 's easy a lot , but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it .
and it was here that fate brought Frank into contact with a journalist and ge@@ ologist named Charles Mac@@ la@@ ren .
its position at the southern entrance of the D@@ ard@@ an@@ elles stra@@ it would 've made a formidable strategic location for both defense and trade .
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fuel @@@ -@@ @ efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
and the social benefits : the rate of single @@@ -@@ @ occupancy vehicles is , I told you , 75 percent ; I think we can get that down to 50 percent .
we 've tri@@ pled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982 .
and why is this going to happen ? because we 're going to do congestion pricing , we are going to do road tol@@ ls , gas taxes are going to become road pricing .
what you can do with that tool : we can create an economic engine .
pan@@ ties . no , seriously , go@@ ogle it .
it was at that point where I felt like , oh my God , this is just taking over my life .
Don 't let it claim you .
we all know that the way to cope with trauma , with loss , with any life @@@ -@@ @ changing experience , is to find meaning .
but here 's the thing : no one can tell us what our experience means .
so what about you ?
what it means today may not be what it means a year from now , or 10 years from now .
claim your experience .
sometimes there 's a pay@@ off .
so I got down to the lobby , and they were ec@@ static because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was NE@@ D : no Evidence of Disease .
and to her credit , she could talk about her reasons for embracing and then cl@@ inging to this identity .
it was pushing people away .
so this is Anna Haz@@ are , and Anna Haz@@ are may well be the most cutting @@@ -@@ @ edge digital activist in the world today .
and in 2011 , he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in India , a topic that Indian elites love to ignore .
but then he decides , " Let me t@@ weak my tactics a little bit . "
so a note for a dating tip here , in some cultures , if you want to please your lover , you call them and hang up . ( la@@ ughter ) So why do people leave missed calls ?
so when Haz@@ are asked people to leave him a missed call , let 's have a little guess how many people actually did this ?
thirty @@@ -@@ @ five million .
I co@@ founded A@@ va@@ az , which uses the Internet to mobilize people and now has almost 40 million members , and I now run Purpose , which is a home for these kinds of technology @@@ -@@ @ powered movements .
so what 's the moral of this story ?
so Henry Tim@@ ms and I - Henry 's a fellow movement buil@@ der - got talking one day and we started to think , how can we make sense of this new world ?
because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society .
new power is the deployment of mass participation and peer coordination - these are the two key elements - to create change and shift outcomes .
and we see new power all around us .
this is Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without ow@@ ning a single square foot of real estate .
new power works like a current .
old power is held by a few .
they 're not aff@@ ron@@ ted by differences , they 're fasc@@ inated by them , and that is a huge shift in mind@@ set , and once you feel it , you want it to happen a lot more .
that guy could teach it .
about 12 years ago , I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place .
they in@@ un@@ dated our campaign with their propaganda , that as you know , links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy .
so , I thought a lot about the first word I 'd say today , and I decided to say " Colombia . "
she had the balls to get out . I need to do the same thing . "
" ye@@ ah , right , if he do@@ es@@ n 't do that , he 's going to get killed . "
this picture that I have here , you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees , and that man you see there with the three stars , he 's Cap@@ tain Juan Manuel Val@@ dez .
I call it ben@@ join in the local ver@@ n@@ ac@@ ular , and the bo@@ tanical name is Termin@@ alia b@@ ent@@ zo@@ e , sub@@ species b@@ ent@@ zo@@ e .
while we may not be sure , one thing is certain : we will not want this plant to disappear .
so who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide to reveal all its secrets .
so we asked ourselves : does the typical office building help us in that sense ?
go to the Open House and express your options .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ five fishermen work for me .
so what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands , without a master plan and like a giant work in progress .
unfortunately , during that time , another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs .
( appl@@ ause ) And at the end , the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment .
and this is the model , how it 's going to work . so , it 's the same system ; the vehicle is different . and that 's the model .
so , in a city , you have to work fast .
and I think creativity , innovation is starting .
and we CA@@ N@@ NOT have all the answers .
at the end , I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song .
( appl@@ ause ) But here 's the good news .
there 's probably never been a drug @@@ -@@ @ free society .
it 's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform .
that 's my drug education man@@ tra : safety first .
what are you doing right ? "
they lived in a poor rural community in the state of Pu@@ e@@ bl@@ a , in central Mexico .
they made beautiful hand@@ made products .
one night , seven years later , I was out with some friends and we were talking about the life of the entrepreneur .
and we called it F@@ uc@@ k@@ up N@@ ights .
we feel that we need something else to be a good entrepreneur .
in fact , econom@@ e@@ tric research has proved that if the process of declaring bankruptcy takes less time and less money , more new firms will enter the market .
when a firm dies , some people will lose their jobs .
being aware of the lessons learned .
and being aware of the responsibility to share those lear@@ nings with the world .
how , maybe , is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema ?
and actually , why do we record ?
we started to publish every week sessions on the Internet .
we published all those films for free on the Internet , and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way .
how could I edit my films in a bus crossing the An@@ des ?
my desire was to make it as a tre@@ k .
well , when I arrived in Peru , actually , I had no idea about what I would do there .
this is important to record that whole person .
what 's the point of that ?
to re@@ inv@@ ent life today , we have to make new forms of images .
and it 's very simple .
B@@ G : you told me that most of the videos you have made are actually one single shot .
I mean , you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length , etc .
otherwise , you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning , and so is that the case ?
V@@ M : " H@@ Ã­@@ bri@@ dos " is - I really believe Brazil , far from the clic@@ hes , is the greatest religious country in the world , the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experi@@ mentations in spirit@@ u@@ alities .
so they gave Albert Alexander , this Oxford policeman , the drug , and within 24 hours , he started getting better .
his fever went down , his appe@@ tite came back .
second day , he was doing much better .
day five , they ran out of pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , and the poor man died .
now , what did that lead us to ?
basically , the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria that resistance is now a problem , because we 've now selected for just the resistant bacteria .
this is serious .
Ac@@ ine@@ tob@@ ac@@ ter is a nasty hospital bug , and car@@ bap@@ en@@ em is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug .
they 're related , because if we invest heavily in new oil wells , we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil in the same way that 's going to happen for antibiotics .
and if you thought that these two were entirely , fully balanced between these two options , you might consider the fact that this is really a game that we 're playing .
the game is really one of co@@ evolution , and co@@ evolution is , in this particular picture , between che@@ e@@ ta@@ hs and gaz@@ elles .
now , this is clearly not a game that can be sustained , or one that we can win by simply inno@@ vating to stay ahead .
we 've got to slow the pace of co@@ evolution down , and there are ideas that we can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well .
if you look at the price of pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , the cost per day is about 10 cents .
and so we stand at a crossroads .
what I saw behind every excuse was deep fear , and what I learned was that to become a doctor , we have to put on our white co@@ ats , put up a wall , and hide behind it .
what if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients ?
you knew what he was about , and he had no need to hide from you .
the IC@@ U doctor looked at me in the eye , pointed at my then 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old sister , and said , " Do you remember when you were that age ?
can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don 't do everything for her ? "
they ask me how I could be so brave .
his name was Simon Kuz@@ nets and the report that he delivered was called " National Income , 1929 @@@ -@@ @ 1932 . "
it 's dry as a bone .
on page seven he says , " The welfare of a nation can , therefore , scar@@ c@@ ely be inf@@ erred from a measurement of national income as defined above . "
it 's not the greatest sound b@@ ite in the world , and it 's dressed up in the cautious language of the economist .
do I have rights ?
but I believe that we 're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution .
not indicators of effort or intention , but real achievement .
here 's the United States - considerably richer than New Zealand , but with a lower level of social progress .
so this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress .
and with more and more of the world 's population living on this part of the curve , it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development .
a couple of years ago , I put a video on You@@ tube , and in the video , I acted out every terrible conference call you 've ever been on .
it 's kind of funny .
tell them you 're very excited to support their work , ask them what the goal of the meeting is , and tell them you 're interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal .
but that 's not just with au@@ ti@@ stic people , either .
it 's like I 'm walking in two worlds most of the time .
and my parents thought it was cu@@ te , so they did@@ n 't bring it up , but when I got into school , they did@@ n 't really agree that it was cu@@ te .
so at the end of their talk , the panel , they had questions and answers , and boom , my hand went right up , and I get the microphone , and I look at them and I say , " Than@@ k you .
and not only that , where 's the f@@ lip chart with the action items and the follow @@@ -@@ @ up and the accountability ?
it was in a phase III trial .
it was interesting .
all she said was , " Ja@@ w @@@ -@@ @ dropping . "
and my family 's favorite video ?
bill G@@ ates .
because the night Pe@@ te was diagnosed , he told us that he was going to get AL@@ S in front of philanthro@@ pi@@ sts like Bill G@@ ates , and he did it .
because he wants them to see what the reality of this is , and how he 's never , ever going to give up .
so now , everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells .
and it actually turns out that the extrac@@ ell@@ ular matrix is different from every single part of the body .
so now , this has a whole bun@@ ch of applications , but basically the idea is , wherever you put this product , you 're able to reas@@ sem@@ ble into it immediately .
now , some diplomats and development experts and specialists , they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century .
fact is , we 're living in the most peaceful moment in human history .
Ste@@ ven Pin@@ ker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all @@@ -@@ @ time low .
now , Gaza , Syria , Sudan , Ukraine , as g@@ ha@@ stly as these conflicts are , and they are hor@@ rific , they represent a relatively small bli@@ p upwards in a 50 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ long secular decline .
Manuel E@@ is@@ ner and others have shown that for centuries , we 've seen this incredible drop in murder , especially in the West .
but consider this one fact : in the 18@@ 00@@ s , one in 30 people lived in cities , today it 's one in two , and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there .
so urban geograph@@ ers and demo@@ graph@@ ers , they tell us that it 's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predic@@ ts violence , no .
I call this tur@@ bo @@@ -@@ @ urbanization , and it 's one of the key drivers of fragility .
we can 't only focus on those cities that work , the Sing@@ apo@@ res , the Kuala Lum@@ pur@@ s , the Du@@ ba@@ is , the Shang@@ ha@@ is .
one way to do this might be to start tw@@ inning our fragile cities with our healthier and we@@ alth@@ ier ones , k@@ ick@@ starting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices , of what works and what do@@ es@@ n 't .
place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities .
if I have one single message for you , it 's this : there is nothing inevitable about lethal violence , and we can make our cities safer .
fol@@ ks , we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop hom@@ ic@@ idal violence in half within our lifetime .
but then I realized , " No , this is exactly what the gra@@ s@@ ses want us to do .
it 's a very elaborate and beautiful dance , but I 'm going to just give you a close @@@ -@@ @ up on one piece of it , and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chick@@ ens , his laying hen@@ s .
the E@@ gg@@ mobile is a very ric@@ ke@@ ty contra@@ ption -- it looks like a pra@@ i@@ rie scho@@ oner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chick@@ ens .
so the chick@@ ens do their kind of little break@@ dance and they 're pushing around the manure to get at the g@@ ru@@ bs , and in the process they 're spreading the manure out .
now , I want you to just look really close up onto what 's happened there .
well , look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
again , give each species what it wants , let it realize its desires , its physiological distinc@@ tiveness .
people did not agree on what emo@@ tion they saw on his face .
that was the most frequent response that we received .
so di@@ e@@ ters , for instance , see apples as larger than people who are not counting cal@@ ories .
so how is that possible ?
people 's states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment .
how far away was the finish line ?
however , in reality , these cars are the same size , but that 's not how we see it .
it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues , it has now expanded .
and let me show you what it looks like today .
this is their perception of why you shou@@ ld@@ n 't m@@ ess with un@@ contacted Indians .
these are Indians , trained as indigenous park ran@@ gers , patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay .
( appl@@ ause ) But let me conclude by saying , this work can be spirit@@ ually rewarding , but it 's difficult and it can be dangerous .
we gave them cameras and training .
the success of this project got me thinking how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world .
the second thing I learned is that we have to enable them to film in a safe way .
unfortunately , I can 't show you the hidden cameras we 're using today - for obvious reasons - but these are cameras we used before .
we are checking maps , looking at maps , double @@@ -@@ @ checking the information , and looking also at the metadata of the material .
they are trying to change the behavior of the community from inside .
this is a much more powerful and much , much more effective weapon .
but we have to use its power wisely .
so you can imagine that 's a transition that h@@ as@@ n 't been entirely seamless .
one of the interesting side effects seems to be that my short @@@ -@@ @ term memory is entirely shot .
or , " Oh cool , did you go there for the mar@@ athon ? "
how come this has remained the high @@@ -@@ @ water mark ?
you 've heard that the average American spends 90 percent of their time indo@@ ors .
we did@@ n 't go indo@@ ors for nearly four months .
it was 24 @@@ -@@ @ hour daylight .
living conditions were quite s@@ part@@ an .
it 's 110 miles long ; most of its surface is what 's called blue ice .
planes can 't land here , so we were at the most risk , technically , when we had the s@@ lim@@ m@@ est chance of being rescu@@ ed .
Tar@@ ka took this photo of me one evening after I 'd nearly passed out with hypo@@ therm@@ ia .
we both had repeated b@@ outs of hypo@@ therm@@ ia , something I had@@ n 't experienced before , and it was very hum@@ bling indeed .
I remember just wanting to lie down and quit .
I 've put on 30 pounds in the last three weeks .
the hospital 's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day .
the red area , so the potential working @@@ -@@ @ age population in 2030 , is already set in stone today , except for much higher migration rates .
that 's where it gets tr@@ ick@@ y .
let 's take Germany again .
as a matter of fact , the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades , in spite of robots and automation .
there 's a huge up@@ sk@@ illing challenge ahead of us .
and four , for how to retain the best people , or in other words , how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture .
now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the non@@ urban .
well , today 's human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these g@@ le@@ aming ca@@ thedr@@ als of technology .
but it turns out , this " new " human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
they may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
but here 's one from the vets : what do you call a veter@@ in@@ arian who can only take care of one species ?
thank you .
there were lines of bodies laid in the street .
and there was blood all over the pa@@ vements .
there is no story line , no script , no drama , no clim@@ ax , and it 's called S@@ low TV .
so we sent the Li@@ st@@ ening Post 's Mar@@ cel@@ a P@@ iz@@ ar@@ ro to Oslo to find out what it is , but first a warning : viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing .
( la@@ ughter ) Thomas Hell@@ um : and then follows an eight @@@ -@@ @ minute story on Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era about some strange TV programs in little Norway .
then a new tunnel .
he 's watched all the program , and at the end station , he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage , and his head hit the cur@@ tain rod , and he realized he is in his own living room .
and it 's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program , and together with thousands of others along the route , they made the program what it became .
so on our next project , we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a swe@@ ater , and J@@ im@@ my Kim@@ mel in the AB@@ C show , he liked that .
( music ) ( Video ) J@@ im@@ my Kim@@ mel : even the people on the show are falling asleep , and after all that , the k@@ nit@@ ters actually failed to break the world record .
one of the key technologies driving mass location tracking is the inno@@ cu@@ ous @@@ -@@ @ s@@ ounding Automatic License Pl@@ ate Reader .
Mike h@@ as@@ n 't done anything wrong .
license plate readers are@@ n 't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today .
thank you .
I draw to better understand things .
I 'm going to talk about Rome .
not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home , driving into R@@ ISD everyday , driving back .
I 've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years .
here 's a little map . and I thought of maps at the beginning ; maybe I should just try and do a little at@@ las of my favorite streets and connections in Rome .
here that same line of text w@@ ra@@ ps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned up@@ side down and read both ways .
over the Spanish Steps we go .
over the Pan@@ the@@ on and the 26 @@@ -@@ @ foot diameter O@@ cul@@ us .
they bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint I@@ vo , that little spiral structure you see there .
they continue without their tabl@@ ec@@ lo@@ th , looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch .
Mar@@ cell@@ o , on the other hand , is sort of a la@@ zy guy , but he 's not due at work until about noon .
right through the Pi@@ az@@ za del@@ la Ro@@ t@@ ond@@ a , in front of the Pan@@ the@@ on -- again w@@ rea@@ king ha@@ vo@@ c -- and finally getting to work .
and if you want the information , so that we complete this cycle of understanding , all you have to do is read these paragraphs .
today , I want to show you a new kind of map .
men are my default .
who is your default ?
who do you implicitly feel connected to ?
the implicit association test , which measures un@@ conscious bias , you can go online and take it .
seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white .
fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white .
I 'm going to suggest to you , no .
so in fact , what the scientists are telling us is , no way .
( la@@ ughter ) Lo@@ ok at them directly in their faces and memor@@ ize them , because when we look at awesome fol@@ ks who are black , it helps to dis@@ soci@@ ate the association that happens automatically in our brain .
why do you think I 'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me ?
just st@@ are at them , right ? ( la@@ ughter ) But these are the things . so go looking for your bias .
please , please , just get out of denial and go looking for dis@@ confirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong .
and we were outside , it was late at night , and we were sort of won@@ dering where we were going , we were lost .
and I saw this person across the street , and I was thinking , " Oh great , black guy . "
I was going toward him without even thinking about it .
I 've got a 6 ' 5 " black guy son . I was married to a black guy .
who 's missing ?
like , I don 't think this is going to work for me .
I 'm sure I 'm going to blow this . "
so go away from your comfort into a bigger , brigh@@ ter thing , because that is how we will stop another Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on from happening .
many of us , any@@ ways , will be in holidays , and you 've got to listen to the conversations around the table .
( la@@ ughter ) " Un@@ cle Jo@@ e is racist . "
because we 're not saying anything .
we 've got to be willing to say , " Gran@@ d@@ ma , we don 't call people that anymore . "
" uncle Jo@@ e , it is@@ n 't true that he deserved that .
so then we found out something which was very amazing for us .
I 'd like to think that 's why mathemati@@ cians don 't really b@@ other going on nights out anymore .
so what that means then is that if some people think that you 're attractive , you 're actually better off having some other people think that you 're a massive M@@ inger .
that 's much better than everybody just thinking that you 're the cu@@ te girl next door .
now , I think this begins to make a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages .
now if you do this , it can be mathem@@ atically proven , in fact , that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances of finding the perfect partner .
( la@@ ughter ) than everybody that you 've seen before .
a Valentine 's Day card like this .
( la@@ ughter ) OK , so this method do@@ es@@ n 't give you a 100 percent success rate , but there 's no other possible strategy that can do any better .
OK , so that was Top Ti@@ p # 2 .
now , I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce , apart from , I don 't know , Pi@@ ers M@@ organ 's wife , maybe ?
now , you can be for@@ given , perhaps for thinking that the arguments that prece@@ de a marital break@@ up are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation .
now of course , it takes a bit more than just a low neg@@ ativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship .
so those are my top three tips of how ma@@ ths can help you with love and relationships .
it was the m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana march , a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis .
so in the following week , I was back in the streets , but that time , I was@@ n 't a member of any media outlet anymore .
but we had a very solid and clear conviction , that we knew that the hyper@@ connected environment of social media could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the country .
but then something happened , something that was@@ n 't predicted , that no one could have anticipated .
they were against the bus fare hi@@ ke that had just happened in the city .
if you could read it , you would understand me .
but that was also useful , because we were still at the web , so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country .
now , programming , for those of you here that haven 't done it yourself , requires laying out in ex@@ cruci@@ ating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal .
so from this v@@ ant@@ age point , I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past , can do today , and what it could do in the future .
it shows that computers can listen and understand .
the similar images actually have similar backgrounds , similar directions of the faces , even some with their tongue out .
here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday .
with our deep learning algorithm , it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images .
in the last 25 years , as capital productivity has increased , labor productivity has been flat , in fact even a little bit down .
I wanted to see how children cop@@ ed with challenge and difficulty , so I gave 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds problems that were slightly too hard for them .
they understood that their abilities could be developed .
so what do they do next ?
and in study after study , they have run from difficulty .
and we got more effort , more strategies , more engagement over longer periods of time , and more perseverance when they hit really , really hard problems .
and we can actually change students ' mind@@ sets .
I am a gra@@ ff@@ iti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
my art contributes to fundamental change by encouraging an audience to address big questions from that perspective .
some of the people said , " I 'm a German girl .
" I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage , i.e. , the j@@ ung@@ les of Africa , and then he can sho@@ vel manure in his artistic way . "
there were demonstrations of veterans in front of the Art Institute of Chicago .
that action and the subsequent legal and political battle led to a landmark First Amendment decision that prevented the government from demanding patriotism be mandatory .
it w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have been safe for me to be there , to say the least .
thank you .
and it lets us look at our world in a completely new way .
and we can do that not just to visu@@ alize the pulse , but also to actually recover our heart rates , and measure our heart rates .
and as new parents , we all want to make sure our babies are healthy , that they 're breathing , that they 're alive , of course .
so I too got one of those baby monitors so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep .
we can see how our ve@@ ins and ar@@ teries are pul@@ sing in our bodies .
maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions .
she wanted to see if there 's any difference in the way her class@@ mates move .
so here are two examples .
( appl@@ ause ) I call it the visual microphone .
that 's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light b@@ oun@@ ces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras .
but at some point , they ban@@ ded together to hun@@ t bigger game .
more protein than a hun@@ ter 's family could eat before it ro@@ tted .
let 's also do it for ours .
this is the future of travel , and I invite you to join me to do that , to change your travel .
I have a confession to make .
most of you , if not all , have .
shared memories -- that 's where the old BBC building was ; and personal memories -- that 's where I gave my first k@@ iss .
many cou@@ ld@@ n 't use cur@@ sive , could barely print .
that moment made me think a lot that for most of them , it was surely the very first time that someone applauded them for something they had done .
thank you very much !
but the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us , the police , the military , are the ones that committed most of the crimes .
now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999 .
he gradu@@ ted from I@@ owa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country .
so then we said , how many people were executed on March 29 , 1984 ?
so we 're going to focus on Gra@@ ve 15 .
or the children remain with their family and the child welfare system provides help and support .
but it 's also a confusing and traumatic exit from the family .
and although there are several reasons why , I want to discuss one reason today : implicit bias .
but here 's the distinction : when they present to the committee , they delete names , ethnicity , neighborhood , race , all identifiable information .
on this particular day , she cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe her eyes .
that was a bit more inspiring .
these are game @@@ -@@ @ changing nations , and will be h@@ ug@@ ely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic .
Eur@@ ys@@ the@@ us hoped to humili@@ ate Her@@ cul@@ es with ten impossible tasks that p@@ itted him against inv@@ inci@@ ble mon@@ sters and un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able forces .
the second target was the L@@ er@@ na@@ ean Hy@@ dr@@ a , a giant ser@@ p@@ ent with many heads .
the Cer@@ y@@ ne@@ ian H@@ ind was a female de@@ er so fast it could ou@@ tru@@ n an arrow .
Her@@ cul@@ es was to retrieve the belt given to her by her father A@@ res , the god of war .
deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end of the ' 9@@ 0s and the beginning of the 200@@ 0s .
so supermarkets , the sla@@ ugh@@ ter@@ houses , and so on that buy products from illegal clear @@@ -@@ @ cut areas , they also can be liable for the deforestation .
but more importantly , it avoided the emission of three billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere .
what we see here , those brown trees , these are really dead trees .
in the world , 60 percent is energy .
actually , no .
it pays for itself within one year .
let 's go to Nairobi to find that out .
unlike in the West , Mega@@ ffic do@@ es@@ n 't rely on road@@ side sensors , which are very expensive to install in Nairobi .
third principle is : think and act horizontally .
even if we keep their DNA in some fridge , that 's not going to be rever@@ sible .
( la@@ ughter ) Un@@ fortunately , I heard the bil@@ lion@@ aire Ste@@ ve For@@ bes , on Fox News , saying exactly the same thing , but seriously .
there is not a single soci@@ ological study , psychological study , that 's ever shown that .
my friend , Daniel Bat@@ son , spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations .
he does it . there is a choice , but it 's obvious , it 's immediate .
with T@@ ania Sing@@ er at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute of Le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g , we showed that the brain networks for em@@ pa@@ thy and loving @@@ -@@ @ kindness are different .
now , 15 years of collaboration with neuro@@ science and ep@@ ig@@ ene@@ tics said yes , our bra@@ ins change when you train in al@@ tru@@ ism .
it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the al@@ tru@@ istic love .
we have 25,000 kids in school , four percent overhead .
we need sustainable harmony . I love this term .
what emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America .
for many , it is their first time inter@@ acting with Islam on such an intimate level .
and why have we , as Americans particularly , become a nation that strives for security above all else ?
they have gri@@ eved it , they have died into it , and allowed and encouraged po@@ ison to turn into medicine .
the government finally made a decision that " The V@@ ag@@ ina Mon@@ olo@@ gues " could not be performed in Uganda .
there 's a young woman named Carri@@ e Re@@ th@@ lef@@ sen in Minnesota .
thank you very much .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : and how are you doing ? are you exhausted ?
we need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomo@@ tion , and we need the sensors , power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi @@@ -@@ @ intelligent ant robot .
and it survi@@ ves , b@@ oun@@ ces on the table , it 's incredibly robust , and of course survi@@ ves quite well until we lose it because it 's very tiny .
so this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier .
we all move in this kind of b@@ oun@@ cy way when we run .
but ultimately we want to add everything on@@ board the robot .
and you 'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off , and the robot tum@@ bling through the air .
what is it ?
so now we know that our number must contain at least three zer@@ oes - which also means that the leading digit must be 3 or greater .
they made some ast@@ ounding discoveries .
for about 300 years after its founding in 283 B@@ CE , the library thri@@ ved .
it 's possible the fire destroyed part of the spra@@ w@@ ling collection , but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit the library for centuries after the siege .
but I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding .
this is in a village where most of the people are even illiterate .
so there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
I 'm standing there thinking , " This is very confusing . I don 't know what 's going on . "
we settled and we liked it .
I did it for your own good .
so I came home once again and said to my mom , " Dol@@ ly and Gir@@ l@@ friend said I deserve pleasure , that I should be having org@@ as@@ ms , and that white men should figure out how to find the cl@@ itor@@ is . "
apparently , white men have a problem finding the cl@@ itor@@ is .
culture should not be a defense for child abuse .
it could be your daughter , your sister , your cous@@ in .
the aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them , because every child has a right to pleasure .
weeks later , we met at the local Star@@ buc@@ ks , and I started right in with the tough @@@ -@@ @ love budget conversation .
I know that we can break free from the gri@@ ps of money shame , because I did .
in order to un@@ cover the painful parts of your money story and your money history , you can 't be num@@ b .
but what we had in common was our money belief .
are you from California ?
( music ) Inter@@ passion , ( Music ) ( Music ends ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .
OK , you know your pel@@ vis is the center of your body and this is the intersection that makes you really strong , al@@ right ?
so please stand up .
nowadays , a network of t@@ wee@@ ts can unle@@ ash a global awareness campaign .
now , I believe so .
I believe that the rule of thum@@ b is : easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains .
today , it would be so much easier .
now , I want to be clear : the magic is not in the m@@ ime@@ o@@ graph .
and politics and democracy without an effective challenge hob@@ bles , because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial .
so he sat down with the local chiefs , and he listened .
when communities come together with health care workers , work together , that 's when this disease can be stopped .
MS@@ F rapidly set up an Ebola treatment center , as many of you know , in the area .
in that situation , ladies and gent@@ l@@ eman , a virus like Ebola takes advantage .
and they started to ask , how well do we really know this virus ?
we know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus and probably sic@@ k@@ ened by it .
this is a very dangerous , de@@ bil@@ itating , and deadly disease .
it was stopped in Senegal , where it had spread , and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus , in this outbreak .
the first of those is complac@@ ency , the risk that as this disease curve starts to bend , the media look elsewhere , the world looks elsewhere .
in fact , the average man can throw a ball further than about 98 percent of all women .
but let 's have a look at the size of this difference .
ye@@ ah , a few people .
now , it is@@ n 't true per se that left @@@ -@@ @ handed people are more creative than right @@@ -@@ @ handed people .
the idea is that listening to Moz@@ art makes you s@@ mar@@ ter and improves your performance on I@@ Q tests .
and then there are others that are about the supply chain of making to@@ ast that goes all the way back to the store .
most drawings have nodes and links .
now , what 's also really interesting , that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it .
movable cards produce better systems models , because we iter@@ ate much more flu@@ idly .
and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes .
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
and so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the TH@@ E@@ RE@@ MI@@ N the way it is now .
that is the power of single @@@ -@@ @ min@@ de@@ dness .
OK , so first up ...
so we have to do something about the scat@@ ter so we can see the tumor .
it 's amazing .
seems impossible but it is@@ n 't .
but we treat this sk@@ ull with great respect at our lab and here at TED .
Red light is all around us .
a system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost , higher resolution and smaller medical imaging .
( appl@@ ause ) Oh , thanks !
no , literally -- we use sound .
so .
only two beams of exactly the same color can make a hol@@ o@@ gram .
and then we move on to shift the sonic focus to another spot .
we scan fast .
our system may be extraordinary at finding blood .
here 's a be@@ aker of blood .
so with our system , you can imagine detecting can@@ cers early , when intervention is easy , or tracking the size of your tumor as it grows or shr@@ inks .
about two and a half years ago , I watched this movie called " Her . "
her name is A@@ IV@@ A , and she 's an artificial intelligence that has learned the art of music composition by reading over 30,000 scores of history 's greatest .
now of course , humans , we are creative . right ?
we have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases .
now we know that there 's a lot of animals out there that can do it too .
the problem with infectious diseases , as we all know , is that path@@ ogens continue to evolve , and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy .
it shor@@ tens their lifes@@ pan , it reduces their ability to fly , it can even kill them before they 're even adults .
as part of my job , I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants , and the reason for this is that mon@@ archs are extremely pic@@ ky e@@ aters .
and then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime .
these c@@ ater@@ pillars did@@ n 't do anything for their own welfare .
so then we moved on to adult bu@@ tter@@ flies , and we started asking the question whether it 's the mothers that can medic@@ ate their off@@ spring .
so I said , I 'm going to do something else .
and you say , ah , I need some leisure time , and so forth .
it 's a very crowded thing that we do .
so we started this about 30 years ago , and we started dealing with this very issue .
instead of going mountain climbing when you 're 82 , why don 't you do it next week ?
why are we building these headquarters ?
so , come have your interviews .
and so if they don 't have 70 , 80 percent of a grade , they don 't stay , which is probably the reason why I haven 't been CEO for more than 10 years .
what do they need to know ?
we have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17 .
so there 's a place for music and literature , etc . , but also for grammar .
and so the courses are World Cup S@@ occer , or building a bicycle .
one , it freed our five kids from following in our steps , our shadow -- They don 't know what I do .
( la@@ ughter ) The five kids know nothing , which is good .
but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon .
I was aw@@ k@@ ward , insecure , and I h@@ ated it .
that 's huge .
this is a nice building .
on the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new ty@@ polog@@ ies , new solutions for the way that we live today .
and we push and we push and we push until we completely alien@@ ate all of you .
ok@@ ay , 30 years ago we were coming out of the ' 7@@ 0s .
( la@@ ughter ) We 're all hanging out in m@@ alls and we 're all moving to the suburbs , and out there , out in the suburbs , we can create our own architectural fan@@ ta@@ sies .
now , how is it possible that these forms -- they 're wild and radical -- how is it possible that they become so u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous throughout the world ?
we created an emotional reaction to these forms .
it means that a parking garage in Miami Beach , Florida , can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night .
it means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little reindeer pavilion that 's as mus@@ c@@ ly and sin@@ e@@ w@@ y as the animals it 's designed to observe .
it do@@ es@@ n 't matter how we build , it matters what we build .
growing up in a family with three generations , I 've always been very close to my grand@@ father .
when I was four years old , my grand@@ father and I were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost .
motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom .
therefore , I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance .
I 've tested the device on my grand@@ father for about a year now , and it 's had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wan@@ dering .
one thing I 'll never forget is when my device first caught my grand@@ father 's wan@@ dering out of bed at night .
after discussing the case in the room and after a quite di@@ stressing ca@@ th@@ ar@@ sis , I remember my chief resident said to me , " Ok@@ ay , take a deep breath . wash your face .
I would like you to pay attention to something .
this indirect protection that the un@@ vacc@@ inated people within a community receive simply by being surrounded by vacc@@ inated people , is called her@@ d immunity .
even more , it was fraudulent .
when the first cases began to come to light , we , here in Argentina , were entering the winter season .
we knew absolutely nothing .
we arrived at the hospital ; it was crowded .
we all had face masks in our pockets .
a theore@@ m -- that really is forever .
( la@@ ughter ) The Py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theore@@ m is still true even though Py@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as is dead , I assure you it 's true . ( la@@ ughter ) E@@ ven if the world collapsed the Py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theore@@ m would still be true .
who do@@ es@@ n 't have a trun@@ c@@ ated oc@@ ta@@ he@@ dr@@ on at home ? ( la@@ ughter ) E@@ ven a plastic one .
so , if you want to tell someone that you will love them forever you can give them a diamond .
a hostile artificial intelligence called N@@ IM has taken over the world 's computers .
you could continue like this all the way to level 25 .
rural and sub@@ urban areas decay more slowly , but in largely un@@ surprising ways .
a tor@@ oid , for those who don 't know , is the surface of a dou@@ gh@@ nut or , for some of us , a bag@@ el .
the tor@@ o@@ idal geometry made for a very efficient building : every beam in this building is the same radius , all lam@@ inated wood .
( appl@@ ause ) In 1976 , I was asked to design a children 's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in Jerusalem , which you see here the campus .
and so I made a counter @@@ -@@ @ proposal : I said , " No building . " there was a cave on the site ; we tunnel into the hill , des@@ cend through the rock into an underground chamber .
and so , you know , it 's one of those things that you don 't take too seriously .
let 's get back to the town and walk to the site . "
and that was a lot of heat to deal with .
and this is where it is ; it 's sort of evolving .
arrog@@ ance is incompatible with nature .
we all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene , right ?
but what do we know about maintaining our psychological health ?
why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health ?
we missed each other terri@@ bly , but international phone calls were really expensive then , and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week .
we decided to spl@@ urge , and that week , we would talk for 10 minutes .
I knew he would call in the morning , but that night was one of the sadd@@ est and longest nights of my life .
lon@@ eliness won 't just make you mis@@ erable ; it will kill you .
I once worked with this woman who , after 20 years marriage and an extremely ug@@ ly divorce , was finally ready for her first date .
shoc@@ king , right , that a friend could be so cruel ?

the important thing -- ( Appl@@ ause ) The important thing that I remember is st@@ aring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this ap@@ ology .

Ke@@ pl@@ er is a space teles@@ cope that measures the subtle di@@ m@@ ming of stars as planets pass in front of them , blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us .

2014 was the ho@@ tt@@ est year on record .
these planetary @@@ -@@ @ scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly out@@ pac@@ ing our ability to alter their course .
but I 'm not a climate scientist , I 'm an astronom@@ er .
you could say that I look for choice alien real estate .
each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Solar System .
Mars is small and roc@@ ky , and though it 's a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habit@@ able world if found by a mission like Ke@@ pl@@ er .
indeed , it 's possible that Mars was habit@@ able in the past , and in part , this is why we study Mars so much .
our ro@@ vers , like Cu@@ ri@@ osity , cra@@ wl across its surface , scrat@@ ching for clu@@ es as to the origins of life as we know it .

consider the extent to which we have not colon@@ ized the deser@@ ts of our own planet , places that are l@@ ush by comparison with Mars .
even in the dri@@ est , highest places on Earth , the air is sweet and thick with oxygen ex@@ hal@@ ed from thousands of miles away by our rain@@ forests .
it is hu@@ bris to believe that inter@@ planetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves , but planetary preservation and inter@@ planetary exploration can work together .

and it can change people 's perception of each other .
and ultimately , we become more human .
the next group , 14 percent of the wealth , 21 , 22 and 32 .

so what about other outcomes of wealth ?
we asked , what about things like health ?
what about life expectancy of infants ?
we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency -- basically , young kids and babies , because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation .
how do we get people to think differently about what we really want ?
and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life , and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us .

and this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
when I was 27 , hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was about to be sold to a bro@@ the@@ l made me angry .
the whole night , I was angry .
let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself .
so I was very impressed with the leaders of my town who were speaking very highly against the caste system and un@@ tou@@ cha@@ bility and talking of G@@ and@@ hi@@ an ideals .
I said , " Lo@@ ok at these leaders , they are so great , they are against un@@ tou@@ cha@@ bility .
by 8 o 'clock , we kept on waiting , because it 's not very un@@ common that the leaders become late , for an hour or so .
so I thought that the dinner will take place , though not at that large a scale .
I went back to the venue , which was a newly built Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi Park .
it was 10 o 'clock .
then I sat down where the food was lying .
I kept my emotions on hold .
and she told me , " K@@ ail@@ ash , why are you c@@ rying ?
it was total non@@ sense , and I refused to accept that punishment .
I was barred from entering into my own kitchen and my own dining room , my u@@ tensi@@ ls were separated .
and then , later on , I gave a new name to myself : Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , that means , " seeker of truth . "
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 children , and 50 more will join , that 's not done .
( appl@@ ause ) I knew that we needed global policies .
and the concrete result was that the number of child lab@@ ore@@ rs globally has gone down by one third in the last 15 years .
thank you so much .
fortunately , I was good enough that by the time I was 30 , I was able to move into the up@@ stairs world of money management , where I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader .

beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from .

it has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution , but also its habit@@ ability potential .
all together , they are telling us what started as a micro@@ b@@ ial path@@ way , and why what started as a micro@@ b@@ ial path@@ way sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end .
you can catch la@@ ughter from somebody else , and you are more likely to catch la@@ ughter off somebody else if you know them .
in our evolution , we have developed two different ways of voc@@ alizing .
they seem to be different things to us .
for example , I could never pitch my voice that high to sing .
it 's very unambiguous , and it seems to be associated with greater aud@@ itory processing of these novel sounds .
and I think what that means is , even if you 're having your brain scanned , which is completely b@@ oring and not very interesting , when you hear somebody going , " A ha ha ha ha ha , " you 're trying to work out why they 're laugh@@ ing .
the real laugh@@ s are shown in red and the posed laugh@@ s are shown in blue .
so you 've got the two of them in there , and he 'll say to the husband , " T@@ ell me something that your wife does that irrit@@ ates you . "
he 's not laugh@@ ing yet .
and now they 're all off .
it 's not something specific to humans -- it 's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better .
at the same time , the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed .
what makes bl@@ az@@ ars so special is that they 're some of the universe 's most efficient particle acceler@@ ators , transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a gal@@ axy .
some of that material is sl@@ ing@@ sh@@ ot@@ ted around the black hole and accelerated to in@@ san@@ ely high speeds in the jet , shown here in white .
we 'll eventually zoom out of the bl@@ az@@ ar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger gal@@ actic context .
beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out , one of the hot topics in bl@@ az@@ ar astro@@ physics right now is where the highest @@@ -@@ @ energy jet emission comes from .
in this image , I 'm interested in where this white blo@@ b forms and if , as a result , there 's any relationship between the jet and the ac@@ cre@@ tion disc material .
my research shows that in some instances , these bl@@ obs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought .
who knew that ch@@ asing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth .
then again , when do we ever know where love 's first fl@@ utter will truly take us .
and now , a few years later , I 've led several expedi@@ tions to the ultimate far @@@ -@@ @ fl@@ ung corner on this planet , the Sahara .
but that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years .
my fiel@@ d@@ work took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria , a place called the K@@ em K@@ em .
there 's the largest din@@ os@@ au@@ r bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara .
again , this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water , it 's useful for bu@@ oy@@ ancy control in the water .
to be honest , by personality , I 'm just not much of a cri@@ er .
I 'm a civil rights lawyer , and I 've seen some horri@@ ble things in the world .
it turns out that tears just are@@ n 't much help when you 're trying to investigate a genocide .
and the things that I saw and experienced in Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering , it did , in moments , move me to tears .
it 's a cause that probably has involved all of us here .
I don 't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most j@@ ar@@ ring .
she sat down with me for hours , just ushe@@ red me in to the world of poverty .
when that last drop of cooking oil finally ran out .
she had to watch her youngest son , Peter , suffer from malnutrition , as his legs just slowly bow@@ ed into us@@ elessness .
thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years ago , when I would have been graduating from high school , they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty .
moreover , the number of people in our world who are living in extreme poverty , which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day , that has fallen from 50 percent , to only 15 percent .
see , G@@ ris@@ el@@ da had every opportunity to go to school , it just was@@ n 't safe for her to get there .
these transformations are actually possible and they 're happening today .
and I want to urge you , when you get a chance , to give it a closer look at the TED La@@ b down@@ stairs .
the World@@ Wide Tel@@ es@@ cope takes the best images from the world 's greatest teles@@ cop@@ es on Earth and in space , and has wo@@ ven them seam@@ lessly to produce a holistic view of the universe .
I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I , in astronomy and in education , are so excited about the World@@ Wide Tel@@ es@@ cope and why we think it 's truly transformative .
so , what you 're seeing here is a wonderful presentation , but it 's one of the tours .
and the tours are all totally interactive , so that if I were to go somewhere ...
growing up , I did@@ n 't always understand why my parents made me follow the rules that they did .
like , why did I really have to mo@@ w the la@@ wn ?
why cou@@ ld@@ n 't I put j@@ el@@ ly beans in my o@@ at@@ meal ?
and it 's not that they did@@ n 't want me to think critically .
over the course of the past several months , the world has watched as unarmed black men , and women , have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigil@@ ante .
and it 's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it 's simply because they wanted to keep us alive .
now , genetic modification is not new ; virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner .
I went to the greenhouse and I saw that the conventional variety that was floo@@ ded for 18 days had died , but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered , called Sub@@ 1 , was alive .
in the 1950s , this virus nearly wi@@ ped out the entire production of pap@@ aya on the island of O@@ ahu in Hawa@@ ii .
he took a sn@@ ip@@ pet of viral DNA and he inserted it into the pap@@ aya gen@@ ome .
that 's because these insecti@@ cide spra@@ ys are difficult to find , they 're expensive , and they don 't prevent the in@@ sect from getting inside the plants .
in the genetic approach , scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eg@@ g@@ plant gen@@ ome .
will this work to reduce insecti@@ cide spra@@ ys in Bangladesh ?
how do we know that there is@@ n 't a big risk of some unintended consequence ?
it 's making something that 's pure dangerous in some way , and I think you 're saying that that whole model just mis@@ understands how nature is .
PR : thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Is@@ ad@@ ora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue cur@@ tain , and she would stand with her hands over her solar pl@@ exus and she would wait , and she would wait , and then , she would move .
blue cur@@ tain .
( music ) Where are we ?
( la@@ ughter ) This is the normal way for things to be .
another way to look at this is to think of world GDP over the last 10,000 years , I 've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph .
so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we 've achieved , and everything we care about , depends cru@@ cially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind .
so rather than hand@@ cra@@ fting knowledge representations and features , we create algorithms that learn , often from raw percep@@ tual data .
now of course , A.@@ I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful , cross @@@ -@@ @ domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has .
but in computers , signals can travel at the speed of light .
so at one end we have the village idi@@ ot , and then far over at the other side we have E@@ d Wit@@ ten , or Albert E@@ in@@ stein , or whoever your favorite g@@ uru is .
suppose we give an A.@@ I. the goal to make humans smile .
another example , suppose we give A.@@ I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem .
they certainly had reasons .
or maybe you could pre@@ tend to malfunction , and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you , they look at the source code -- B@@ am ! -- the manipulation can take place .
sooner or later , it will out .
making super@@ intelligent A.@@ I. that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that .
and so in order to be able to access the brain , you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuro@@ scientist to get access to these tools .
a few years ago , we started a company called Back@@ yard Bra@@ ins and we make DI@@ Y neuro@@ science equipment and I brought some here tonight , and I want to do some demonstrations .
let 's take a look at it as well .
I want you to move your arm as well .
and I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer .
most of us think of motion as a very visual thing .
( audio ) Mary had a little lam@@ b ! little lam@@ b ! little lam@@ b !
so at this point , a lot of people see this work , and they immediately think about surveillance .
so here 's an object , and in this case , it 's a wire figure in the shape of a human , and we 're going to film that object with just a regular camera .
but all in all , it 's a pretty good path .

today , mon@@ og@@ amy is one person at a time .
( la@@ ughter ) We used to marry , and had sex for the first time .
I 've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference .
( la@@ ughter ) It applies to you .
so because there is no universally agreed @@@ -@@ @ upon definition of what even constitutes an inf@@ idel@@ ity , estimates vary widely , from 26 percent to 75 percent .
and al@@ chem@@ y is the key word here , because the ero@@ tic f@@ ris@@ son is such that the k@@ iss that you only imagine giving , can be as powerful and as enchan@@ ting as hours of actual lov@@ emaking .
as Mar@@ cel Pro@@ ust said , it 's our imagination that is responsible for love , not the other person .
and I am it : I 'm chosen , I 'm unique , I 'm indispensable , I 'm ir@@ replaceable , I 'm the one .
inf@@ idel@@ ity shat@@ ters the grand ambition of love .
but if throughout history , inf@@ idel@@ ity has always been painful , today it is often traumatic , because it threatens our sense of self .
" can I ever trust anyone again ? "
and He@@ ather real@@ izes these are not for her .
she also tells me that her father had affairs , but her mother , she found one little receipt in the pocket , and a little bit of lip@@ stick on the coll@@ ar .
they feel alive .
and they often will tell me stories of recent losses -- of a parent who died , and a friend that went too soon , and bad news at the doctor .
so for the partner who had the affair , for N@@ ick , one thing is to end the affair , but the other is the essential , important act of expressing guilt and re@@ mor@@ se for hur@@ ting his wife .
what were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me ?
what is it about us that you value ?
in other words , the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage .
I am not French .
the main question that I 've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about inf@@ idel@@ ity is , for or against ?
that 's the way it is .

I don 't even know if it 's a real job title , to be honest .

there was this one particularly bum@@ py boat ride up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot , where we ended up watching helpl@@ essly from the water as bears rav@@ aged our camp site .
but to me , that trip was a te@@ stament to the wil@@ dness I traded for those tou@@ ri@@ sty beaches .
we were in this tiny , remote f@@ j@@ ord , just inside the Arctic Cir@@ cle .
it had a greater population of sheep than people , so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found .
you traveled all this way , and this is exactly what you 've been waiting for : freezing cold conditions with perfect waves .
but that was the point that I felt this wind g@@ ush through the valley and hit me , and what started as this light snow@@ fall quickly became a full @@@ -@@ @ on bl@@ iz@@ z@@ ard , and I started to lose perception of where I was .
actually , I was totally f@@ rea@@ king out -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- and I was bor@@ der@@ line hypo@@ ther@@ mic , and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water .
and I don 't know if it was deli@@ ri@@ um setting in or what , but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time .
in 2011 , during the final six months of Kim J@@ ong @@@ -@@ @ Il 's life , I lived under@@ cover in North Korea .

they had never heard of Mark Z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg or Ste@@ ve Jobs .
I started with a game .
we played " Truth and Li@@ e . "
these students , however , were simply told what to think , and they o@@ bey@@ ed .

Mr : correct . I would say in some ways I change my gender about as often as I change my hair@@ style .
I wore down their resistance , and they had no hope this drug would even work , by the way , and they tried to tell me , " You 're just w@@ asting your time .
but finally , for 25,000 dollars and agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get , they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug .
they said , " Oh , Mar@@ tine , there 's no medicine for J@@ ene@@ sis .

we either saw the launches from our back@@ yard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape .
it was a four @@@ -@@ @ minute and 27 @@@ -@@ @ second descent .
ILC D@@ over was the company that made all of the A@@ pol@@ lo suits and all of the extra@@ vehic@@ ular activity suits .
because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system , we could do it with a ballo@@ on that was five times smaller than that , and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger ballo@@ on .
we had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night .
it 's interesting here , because if you look , I 'm right over the airport , and I 'm probably at 50,000 feet , but immediately I 'm about to go into a strat@@ os@@ pheric wind of over 120 miles an hour .
I 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now .
and there you can see a dro@@ gue par@@ ach@@ ute , which I 'll demonstrate in just a second , because that 's really important .
he flew in another air@@ plane , and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me .
A@@ E : hi there !
( la@@ ughter ) So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video , but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release .
it 's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us .
and the highlighted stars are those with known ex@@ o@@ planets .
this is where the Ke@@ pl@@ er Space Tel@@ es@@ cope focused for many years .
so , please don 't email me one of your crazy theories .
well , I em@@ ail@@ ed a Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate in Phy@@ si@@ ology or Medicine and he said , " S@@ ure , come and talk to me . "
and that theory was that life produces all small molecules , so many molecules .
so working on the models and thinking about bio@@ chemistry , it 's all well and good .
how are we going to find these planets ?
and this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the teles@@ cope .
it 's about tens of meters in diameter .
now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
and in this case , I just wanted you to know that that central tr@@ uss has heritage left over from large radio deploy@@ ables in space .
well , in the best case , we will find an image of another ex@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Earth .
here is Earth as a p@@ ale blue do@@ t .
but there 's more .
F@@ red J@@ ans@@ en : you mentioned half@@ way through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an ex@@ o@@ planet like Earth is not there yet .
actually , what we expect is what we call our next @@@ -@@ @ generation Hu@@ b@@ ble teles@@ cope .
you have this immense curi@@ osity , this stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness , this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say .
but I did@@ n 't start out wanting to be a part of somebody 's crime reduction strategy .
I wanted a 15@@ - , 20,000 @@@ -@@ @ member church .
I wanted my own clothing line .
and something needed to be done about that .
you would listen in the neighbor@@ hoods on any given night , and to the un@@ trained ear , it s@@ ounded like fire@@ works , but it was gun@@ fire .
and I was doing fun@@ erals , but not of the v@@ ener@@ ated matri@@ archs and patri@@ archs who 'd lived a long life and there 's a lot to say .
I was doing fun@@ erals of 18 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , 17 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , and 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact .
you all have heard of rap music , right ?
RAP music ?
and he said , " Don 't do that again , Rev@@ . "
( la@@ ughter ) But I pre@@ ached and I built these programs , and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference .
they met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dor@@ chester , and they were killed .
I mean , is@@ n 't this a law enforcement issue ?
and as a result of that , we said to them , " How do you see this church , how do you see this institution helping this situation ? "
the Boston Mir@@ acle was about bringing people together .
we had law enforcement partners .
I believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now .
I 'm not acc@@ using anyone , bias is not an accusation .
what does that tell us ?
and the cool thing about it is that it 's pretty enter@@ taining .
( la@@ ughter ) And I was like , " Than@@ ks , guys . "
now , in 2010 , The Australian National University did an experiment where they sent out 4,000 identical applications to entry level jobs , essentially .
and the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they 've acknowledged it , but I 'm not really sure what they 're doing about it .
but also , I 've been blessed with amazing ment@@ ors who 've opened doors for me that I did@@ n 't even know were there .
how are we going to feed everybody , get water to everybody , provide power to everybody , avoid the worst impacts of climate change ?
how l@@ ame is that ?
you probably think of F@@ BI agents gun@@ ning down bad guys like John D@@ ill@@ inger , or arresting corrupt politicians .
I 've spent years p@@ ouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in the United States , and I 've come to the conclusion that the F@@ BI is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists .
after 9 / 11 , the F@@ BI was given an e@@ dict : never again .
to do this , agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 inform@@ ants nationwide , all looking for anyone who might be dangerous .
the F@@ BI 's inform@@ ant was Robert Chil@@ ds , a convicted rap@@ ist and child mol@@ ester who was paid 9@@ 0,000 dollars for his work on the case .
Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac also had sch@@ iz@@ o@@ affec@@ tive disorder .
but here 's what 's interesting : the lead under@@ cover agent -- you can see him in this picture with his face blur@@ red -- would go back to the T@@ amp@@ a field office with his recording equipment on .
and he got a Hollywood ending .
he 's one of more than 175 so @@@ -@@ @ called terrorists , for whom the F@@ BI has created Hollywood end@@ ings .
it 's really just theater , a national security theater , with mentally ill men like Sami Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac un@@ wit@@ ting actors in a carefully chore@@ ograph@@ ed production brought to you by the F@@ BI .
( appl@@ ause ) Tom Ri@@ el@@ ly : so , those are some pretty strong accusations , pretty strong charges .
how can you back this up ?
T@@ rev@@ or Aar@@ on@@ son : my research began in 2010 when I received a grant from the Investig@@ ative Reporting Program at U.@@ C. Berk@@ ele@@ y , and a research assistant and I put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during the first decade after 9 / 11 .
and we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups , whether an inform@@ ant was used , and whether the inform@@ ant played the role of an agent provoc@@ ateur by providing the means and opportunity .
so my story in The Inter@@ cept , which was just published today , tells the story of how Sami Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac was set up in this F@@ BI sting and goes into much greater detail .
in this talk , I could only highlight the things that they said , such as calling him a " ret@@ arded fo@@ ol . "
but it was much more elaborate , they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Os@@ ma@@ k@@ ac 's hands , which he then used to purchase weapons from the under@@ cover agent .
Ta : well so far , we only know what 's come out in the court file , but they seem to suggest it 's another example of the same .
these types of sting operations have moved from flavor to flavor .
there 's a big family , there 's a very beautiful tree , and I make these pictures with this very large , extremely cumbersome , very aw@@ k@@ ward technical plate film camera .
I 've got the family , spent the better part of a day talking with them .
I 'm setting it up and I 'm setting up , and the light 's just about to go , and I want it to be golden , I want it to be beautiful .
and they start scre@@ aming , and then one of the men turns around and starts scre@@ aming , shou@@ ting , and the whole tree collap@@ ses , not the tree , but the people in the tree .
what 's your story ? who are you ? "
I mean , I have teenage kids . I should know .
it was about a boy@@ friend . the girl on the top , she 'd kis@@ sed the wrong boy , and they 'd started having a fight .
it was@@ n 't just about turning up . it was@@ n 't just about sha@@ king a hand .
it was@@ n 't about just saying , " I 'm J@@ im@@ my , I 'm a photographer . "
I had to get to know every single one of them , right down to whose boy@@ friend is who and who is allowed to k@@ iss who .
I need something for the eye to look at . I need a white go@@ at in the middle . "
I wanted to put these people on a pe@@ de@@ stal .
until , it was quite am@@ using , about a year ago somebody said , " You 've been invited to do a TED Talk . "
he said , " No , a TED Talk . " I said , " But who 's T@@ ed ?
I thought , lessons , ok@@ ay , well , what did I learn ? good question .
( la@@ ughter ) And I thought , three lessons , well , I 'm going to think about it .
I traveled enorm@@ ously as a child .
I was very nomadic . it was actually very exciting .
so I kept running and I kept running , and I sort of got somewhere and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought , well , where do I belong ? where do I fit ?
what am I ? where am I from ? I had no idea .
and it was only until I went on a journey , a journey that was so extreme , I still get shi@@ vers when I think about it .
it 's 13 hours ' flight from Moscow .
when we arrived there , after a month of traveling across the ice , and we 'd got to them , but then I was not allowed to photograph them .
they said , " You CA@@ N@@ NOT photograph us . you have to wait .
and I thought , ok@@ ay , chief dying , right , you know , look up at the stars again , look at the cam@@ p@@ fire .
and somebody said , " You have to show them the picture of the N@@ ene@@ ts . the N@@ ene@@ ts . "
I 'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks .
they see a few rubber duc@@ ks and learn that they float , or a few balls and learn that they b@@ ounce .
let 's find out .
it do@@ es@@ n 't get better than that .
all right , it 's nice that babies will gener@@ alize properties of blue balls to yellow balls , and it 's impressive that babies can learn from im@@ itating us , but we 've known those things about babies for a very long time .
this time , we 're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls , and guess what ?
you [ probably won 't ] randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls .
( video ) H@@ G : two , three . go ! ( music ) LS : one , two , three , go !
of course babies give toys to their m@@ om@@ mies when they can 't make them work .
( video ) H@@ G : two , three , go ! ( music ) Let me try one more time . one , two , three , go !
fol@@ ks , human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data .
human minds generate research and discovery , and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater , and human minds take care of other humans : our old , our young , our sick .
in the years to come , we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even en@@ vision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approxim@@ ating the compu@@ tational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .
it has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you .
LS : I think so . you 'll have some machine learning fol@@ ks up here .
now we 're trying to ask , " Can we regener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
we 're able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthe@@ size a chro@@ mos@@ ome ?
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we 've never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chro@@ mos@@ ome ?
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthe@@ sizing DNA is very difficult .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
( la@@ ughter ) They laugh@@ ed more than you guys are . ( la@@ ughter ) And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
when we first sequ@@ enced this gen@@ ome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 am@@ ino acids , such that there 's a single letter designation for each of the am@@ ino acids .
initially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we knew there 's a mechanism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here 's an example of it : there 's an organism called De@@ ino@@ coc@@ cus radi@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
these organisms can be totally desi@@ cc@@ ated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqu@@ eous environment .
here 's an actual micro@@ graph of the molec@@ ule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together automatically .
these are pictures over about a six @@@ -@@ @ second period .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chro@@ mos@@ ome ? how do we activate this ?
obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple ; it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
with bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ ea , the chro@@ mos@@ ome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete trans@@ plant of a chro@@ mos@@ ome from one cell to another and activate it .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
here 's the pull part .
U@@ ber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too .
we all know what he 's talking about .
well that 's great , we can get in and out of the store quickly .
you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
you just wanted to di@@ ve in .
I simply picked up the piece of fruit , du@@ g at it with my nails , tried to fl@@ ick it off , and then wondered , " W@@ as there another stic@@ ker ? "
your hands cl@@ en@@ ched at 10 and 2 on the wheel , looking at every single object out there -- the cars , the lights , the pedestrians .
so much so , that I cou@@ ld@@ n 't even talk to anyone else in the car and I cou@@ ld@@ n 't even listen to music .
but then something interesting happened .
it started to become fun and second nature .
it was a cold , wet , snow@@ y day and she was warm inside a stree@@ t@@ car .
now probably , most of those passengers just thought , " It 's a fact of life , he 's got to open the window to clean it .
why ?
well , it 's seeing the invisible problem , not just the obvious problem , that 's important , not just for product design , but for everything we do .
he looked at me , pu@@ zz@@ led , and said , " Why do@@ es@@ n 't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail ? " ( la@@ ughter ) I was like , " That 's a pretty good question . "
because she had saved me .
I think this profound dis@@ connect actually symbol@@ izes most of our understanding about human trafficking .
I spent time in j@@ ails and bro@@ th@@ els , interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement , NGO workers .
you probably think about a young girl or woman , who 's been brut@@ ally forced into prostitution by a violent p@@ im@@ p .
that is real suffering , and that is a real story .
we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl .
that story lets us off the ho@@ ok .
forced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking .
and it 's found in cotton fields , and col@@ tan mines , and even car wash@@ es in Norway and England .
it 's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan .
it 's found in Thailand 's fishing industry .
but what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and pl@@ enti@@ ful shri@@ mp ?
Thai military were caught selling Bur@@ m@@ ese and Cambodian migrants onto fishing boats .
the scheme in that case was incredible .
they then located winners of the green card lottery , and they told them , " We 'll help you out .
all you have to do is take this young girl with you , say that she 's your sister or your spouse .
so what have we done about it ?
they 're migrants , people of color .
having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty , leave abuse , or leave prostitution , if that person so desires .
I 'd like to add one more element to that .
but once they were brought over , their passports were confiscated .
they worked so hard they f@@ ain@@ ted in the fields .
they finished one meal with this plate of perfect , long @@@ -@@ @ stemmed stra@@ w@@ berries , and as they handed them to me , they said , " Are@@ n 't these the kind of stra@@ w@@ berries you eat with somebody special in the States ?
and don 't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you ? "
I found multiple layers of pl@@ au@@ sible den@@ i@@ ability between grow@@ er and distributor and processor , and God knows who else .
and all of this had been hidden to me , before I had tried to understand it .
that 's not how it works .
this is the decision to change a system that is broken , and that we have un@@ wit@@ tingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long .
but that is not my experience of them .
these Indian ship@@ yard workers were trafficked to do post @@@ -@@ @ Hur@@ ric@@ ane Kat@@ r@@ ina reconstruction .
the story as I 've told it to you is mess@@ y and unfinished .
a confession : I am an archae@@ ologist and a museum cur@@ ator , but a paradox@@ ical one .
communities around the world don 't want to see their culture in distant institutions which they have no control over .
yet these claims p@@ ale in comparison to those made by Native Americans .
in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s , anthro@@ polog@@ ists began to collect them as evidence of American Indian religion .
they came to be seen as beautiful , the precursor to the stark sculp@@ tures of Pic@@ as@@ so and Paul Kle@@ e , helping to usher in the modern art movement .
for Z@@ un@@ is , the War God is not a piece of art , it is not even a thing .
its nec@@ kl@@ ace had once been stolen .
he said , " We give all of the objects to the world . "
shortly after I walked into my new school , a huge fight broke out among the girls .
after things were quickly under control , I immediately called a meeting in the school 's aud@@ itorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal .
shortly as I approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter , and found the door locked with chains , I could hear Ash@@ ley 's voice in my ears going , " M@@ iss ! miss !
we took the chains off the front doors of the school .
we got the light@@ bul@@ bs replaced , and we cleaned every classroom to its core , recycling every , every textbook that was not needed , and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture .
that brings me to my second slogan : so what ? now what ?
I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too .
I know what it feels like to go to a school that 's not a school .
I insist on it , and because of this , we can accomplish things together .
they are clear about my expectations for them , and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.@@ A. system .
the mystery is this : what is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences , such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of vel@@ vet ?
then we thought that the Earth is the un@@ moving center of the Universe , again because it looks that way .
hence if the living creature were removed , all these qualities would be anni@@ hil@@ ated . "
well , neuro@@ scientists tell us that they are creating , in real time , all the shapes , objects , colors , and motions that we see .
they lose all interest in the real females .
the same is true of the train .
then we thought that the Earth is the un@@ moving center of reality because it looks that way .
thank you very much .
so I think that we 'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it .
right . class , let 's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin .
so class , hopefully you 'll recognize what you just heard me say as the -- ?
very good , the cellular phone announcement .
right ? this was also known as a mobile phone .
( la@@ ughter ) So the format of today 's class is I will be presenting multiple B@@ ER@@ T modules today from that period in history , right , so starting cir@@ ca 2016 .
remember , these early modules in these people 's full identities were protected , and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic , which for many of them was tabo@@ o .
but you see the sign ? you get it ? P @@@ -@@ @ I @@@ -@@ @ E @@@ -@@ @ C @@@ -@@ @ E. No justice , no piece of us .
right . so that , that is the unique part of it for me , right , is that I ended up in both , first in the con@@ vent , and then in the prostitution after . that 's right .
well , surprise , surprise , I fell in love with another f@@ ella much older than me , and I always say I was just so happy because he did@@ n 't drink , I married the ba@@ st@@ ard .
ye@@ ah , this k@@ id , I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points .
we were , like , 10 , I think .
no , I don 't think I said anything , I just finished playing and went home .
I will see you for " S@@ ell / Buy / Date . "
what if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly , just the way an emo@@ tionally intelligent friend would ?
and the val@@ ence is actually quite negative , so you must have been a big fan .
women in their 20@@ s smile a lot more than men the same age , perhaps a necessity for dating .
we are expres@@ sive when we 're em@@ ailing , tex@@ ting , shopping online , or even doing our taxes .
in education , imagine if your learning apps sense that you 're confused and slow down , or that you 're bo@@ red , so it 's sp@@ ed up , just like a great teacher would in a classroom .
thank you .
those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world .
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular bi@@ ologist , I did@@ n 't like that at all .
so I 'd like to draw a little car here -- I 'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him .
if I want to make a little script to do this over and over again , I just drag these guys out and set them going .
so what if I click this down to zero ?
by the time my generation walked the streets , dis@@ investment at the local , state and federal level , eroded infrastructure , and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community .
called me by a name I did not recognize , said " lesbian , " but I was more boy than girl , more K@@ en than Barbie .
my mother fears I have named myself after f@@ ading things .
so what are you g@@ onn@@ a do ? "
" let 's let that big old cloud of blood dissip@@ ate a bit before we have to surface through all of these shar@@ ks . "
so it turned out , I 'd broken off a tip of the ur@@ chin spine in the joint itself , and that 's why it was@@ n 't getting better .
so the orth@@ ope@@ dis@@ t says , " You know , we should get this out .
nothing too urgent , not an emergency . "
we have a wonderful 14 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old daughter , who did all my illustrations .
you don 't need to worry , though : that I am not fully human is one of the things that my family loves the most about me .
they 'll come sing some songs , s@@ prin@@ kle some fairy dust , it 's great .
we get there at 10 o 'clock , the scheduled start time , and we are handed number 59 .
( la@@ ughter ) There were card@@ board cut @@@ -@@ @ out snow@@ fla@@ kes covering the floor , gl@@ it@@ ter on every flat surface , and ic@@ ic@@ les all over the walls .
( la@@ ughter ) I mean , the Scandin@@ avian dec@@ ad@@ ence was mes@@ mer@@ izing .
there is no middle , there is no gray , just pol@@ arity .
pol@@ arity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other ; a diame@@ tr@@ ical opposition .
but if we are pulled in these two directions , but it 's not really where we exist -- pol@@ arity is not our actual reality -- where do we go from there ?
those are the people I know , those are my friends and family , that is the majority of our society , that is you , that is me .
but the question is : can we own our du@@ ality ?
can we have the courage to hold both things ?
her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico .
( la@@ ughter ) That line actually went the other way .
but we were united by our similarities , not separated by our differences .
those were the things that brought us together .
and he said , [ in Spanish ] " A gir@@ l@@ friend ? ! ? "
and his smu@@ g smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect , gra@@ bbed his plate , walked off , went back to work .
she never made eye contact with me .
she left , did the same thing -- it was a 10 @@@ -@@ @ second conversation , such a short interaction .
and a little bit later , they were jo@@ king around in the kitchen in Spanish , that had nothing to do with me , and that is du@@ ality .
it was@@ n 't Jesus or As@@ h .
it 's broadly considered a test for em@@ pa@@ thy , and the groups that scored highly on this did better .
or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective ?
so how does this play out in the real world ?
and the problem the engineer confronted was , what quantity of waste to cater for ?
Aru@@ p believes that the culture of help@@ fulness is central to their success .
now that sounds so obvious , and we think it 'll just happen normally , but it do@@ es@@ n 't .
at I@@ de@@ x@@ x , a company up in Main@@ e , they 've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business can work together and get to know the whole business that way .
what matters is the mortar , not just the bric@@ ks .
now , when you put all of this together , what you get is something called social capital .
not a bad return on social capital , which compounds even as you spend it .
so I went and I sat in on the audi@@ tions at the Royal Academy of Dra@@ matic Art in London .
it 's just , they don 't last very long .
it 's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers , because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves . "
I have passionate opinions about gender equality , but I worry that to freely accept the label of " femin@@ ist , " would not be fair to good fem@@ ini@@ sts .
Oh , so I call myself a B@@ ad F@@ emin@@ ist .
( la@@ ughter ) So , what started as a bit of an inside jo@@ ke with myself and a will@@ ful provocation , has become a thing .
let me take a step back .
there are many ways in which I 'm doing femin@@ ism wrong .
( la@@ ughter ) Th@@ ink about it .
I think of them , and suddenly , the better choice becomes far easier to make .
and in my other , I hold the hum@@ bling reality that I am just one woman .
but when our story begins , he was better known as John@@ ny " Bul@@ l " Wal@@ ker .
he was a he@@ el ; he was a hero .
one night , The Ter@@ ri@@ ble Tur@@ k 's big to@@ e scrat@@ ched a scar like Cap@@ one 's down the side of his face .
it took too long , so he started organizing group meetings over lunch .

the goal was@@ n 't to make patients better ; it was to make patients feel better .
I think most of you do , but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for au@@ tism .
for most of the 20th century , clin@@ icians told one story about what au@@ tism is and how it was discovered , but that story turned out to be wrong , and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health .
K@@ anner knew about this competing paper , but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work .
clarity or mystery ?
the four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system , which has significance within the story .
and then you have the color@@ less subway line inter@@ sec@@ ting with each of the other colors , which basically he does later on in the story .
what does this mean ?
this is using all the same elements .
( la@@ ughter ) And if there 's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk , I hope it 's this : B@@ li@@ h bli@@ h bli@@ h bl@@ ah . bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bli@@ h bli@@ h . [ " ' judge This , ' Chi@@ p K@@ id@@ d " ] B@@ li@@ h bli@@ h bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah . bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah .
and this group was no different .

but then I was immediately cap@@ ti@@ vated by the magnific@@ ence of the energy around me .
and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality .
now , that 's a big number , so let 's put it in perspective .
he do@@ es@@ n 't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around .
now , conventional wisdom would say that we 'll just take these driver assistance systems and we 'll kind of push them and incre@@ mentally improve them , and over time , they 'll turn into self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars .
the better the technology gets , the less reliable the driver is going to get .
now , if we look at the bottom left corner here , this is your classic car .
we just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two .
they 'll happen , but very low frequency .
but let 's look at it from a different direction for a moment .
so if you compare the distance between these two , it 's about 10 to the eighth , right ?
and then once you have that problem solved , the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction .
similarly , the orange box on the side here , it 's a school bus , and we have to treat that differently as well .
and when a police officer stood in the road , our vehicle should understand that this means stop , and when they signal to go , we should continue .
how soon can we bring it out ?
my oldest son is 11 , and that means in four and a half years , he 's going to be able to get his driver 's license .
audience : save it !
Cap@@ t A : I haven 't got a clu@@ e . does it matter ?
Cap@@ t A : listen ... saving that k@@ id is all that matters .
DC : OK , we are not going to learn anything from this guy .
we need to do something .
maybe there 's something we can learn here .
g : you 're my b@@ esti@@ e , we 'll always be together !
I need to deal with thousands and thousands of variables , conditions and possibilities .
as a four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child , it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine .
I made my mind up there and then that one day , somehow , I was going to sa@@ il around the world .
age 10 , it was saving my school dinner money change .
every single day for eight years , I had m@@ ashed potato and ba@@ ked beans , which cost 4@@ p each , and gra@@ vy was free .
I felt like my life depended on that moment , and incredibly , he said yes .
just like in my dreams , there were amazing parts and tough parts .
after three months at sea , age just 24 , I finished in second position .
she was a multi@@ hull .
if we did@@ n 't sa@@ il fast enough , we 'd be eng@@ ul@@ fed by that storm , and either cap@@ sized or sm@@ ashed to pieces .
it 's not too stres@@ s@@ ful . we can concentrate .
take that 50 , 60 , 70 , accelerate through to 80 , 90 , 100 miles an hour .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation , even as a passenger .
you 're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in , and you have to make every single decision on board .
but out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contra@@ sted with the highest of the high@@ s .
it 's hard to explain , but you enter a different mode when you head out there .
no experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word " finite . "
materials would be defined as either technical or biological , waste would be designed out entirely , and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term .
all of this sounds amazing , but these are@@ n 't just ideas , they 're real today , and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy .
so how would you shift from linear to circular ?
well , the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world , with leading businesses within the world , with the biggest convening platforms in the world , and with governments .
I believe yes .
when I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
so what have we taught the machine to see ?
the pick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players , two on offense and two on defense .
so we go to the machine and say , " Good morning , machine .
please find a way to tell the difference . "
it turns out in modern basketball , this pick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ roll is perhaps the most important play .
and knowing how to run it , and knowing how to defend it , is basically a key to winning and losing most games .
the guy guarding the ball can either go over or under .
it would make our lives a lot easier , but it turns out movement is very mess@@ y .
coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations .
and it 's very exciting , it 's much more than the pick @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ roll .
can it know more than person could know ?
and it turns out the answer is yes .
until now .
what are their angles ?
we can look at all their vel@@ o@@ cities and we can build a model that predic@@ ts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances ?
( la@@ ughter ) Those are N@@ BA players .
the size is the size of the player and the color is the position .
on the x @@@ -@@ @ axis , we have the shot probability .
people who are good are at the top , bad at the bottom .
Miami was down by three , there was 20 seconds left .
a gent@@ l@@ eman named Le@@ Br@@ on James came up and he took a three to tie .
and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second , and the likelihood of them getting a re@@ bound at every second can illumin@@ ate this moment in a way that we never could before .
the only difference is , instead of the professional players , it 's us , and instead of a professional announ@@ cer , it 's me .
down three .
[ calculating shot probability ] [ S@@ hot quality ] [ Re@@ bound probability ] W@@ on 't go !
tie game with five seconds left .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's roughly how it happened .
and on this journey , I started to learn who they are , and they began to learn who I am .
and the anchor said to me , " But don 't you think it 's our job as journalists to sens@@ ation@@ alize a story ? "
you know what the women said to me ?
you do not respect the traditions of our society , of our community . "
( appl@@ ause ) In my community , that was the first time a community , they had to call the by@@ laws , the first by@@ law that protected girls in our community .
( appl@@ ause ) So when the bill passed , we tex@@ ted them back , " Than@@ k you for supporting the bill . "
now , in Malawi , 18 is the legal marriage age , from 15 to 18 .
I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation .
and trees ultimately became such a powerful visual met@@ aph@@ or because in many ways , they really embody this human desire for order , for balance , for unity , for sym@@ metry .
we can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain .
we can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people .
this is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Per@@ l developers .
Per@@ l is a famous programming language , and here , you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files , and working together on a given project .
and these are actually 15 different ty@@ polog@@ ies I 've been collecting over time , and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new met@@ aph@@ or .
you probably cou@@ ld@@ n 't find more dispar@@ ate topics , yet they are using the same met@@ aph@@ or , the same visual model , to map the never @@@ -@@ @ ending complexities of its own subject .
but networks are not just a scientific met@@ aph@@ or .
as designers , researchers , and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems , they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields , like painting and sculpture , and influencing many different artists .
Em@@ ma Mc@@ N@@ ally is one of the main leaders of this movement , and she creates these striking , imag@@ inary landscapes , where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visu@@ alization .
this is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement .
and I think the title really says it all -- it 's called : " gal@@ ax@@ ies For@@ ming Al@@ ong Fil@@ aments , Li@@ ke Dro@@ ple@@ ts Al@@ ong the S@@ tran@@ ds of a Spi@@ der 's Web . "
thank you so much .
how would I know what the right decision was ?
coming of age on the beaches of Southern California , I grew up in the middle of our nation 's abortion wars .
I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Ro@@ e vs. W@@ ade .
everyone was pro @@@ -@@ @ life .
and then I did .
it was a step towards the unknown .
abortion is common .
but as much as abortion is ho@@ tly debated , it 's still rare for us , whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people , to talk with one another about the abortions that we have .
between what happens in politics and what happens in real life , and in that gap , a battlefield mentality .
and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life .
the first thing we did was create a talk @@@ -@@ @ line , where women and men could call to get emotional support .
" God . "
and researchers can even make the materials release different signals over time .
I thought that would lead to cultural and social change .
Je@@ an@@ ie , Will and Ad@@ ina are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship .
( la@@ ughter ) The tri@@ o set out on a daily adventure to coffee and dou@@ gh@@ nut shops , bus stops and street corners .
we often think that as we age , we lose the desires held in our youth .
but beyond challenging sociocultural norms about the elderly , the tri@@ o sh@@ eds light on fear of remo@@ teness .
I did@@ n 't do it as well , but we managed to get Y@@ ous@@ so@@ u N '@@ D@@ our , S@@ ting , T@@ racy Cha@@ p@@ man , and Bru@@ ce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en to go ' round the world for Amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
at first , we were safe in the camp .
but later the government soldiers began mi@@ stre@@ ating us a lot .
they kept telling us , " T@@ ell the truth ! " as they beat us .
no , not at all , no problem , take your time .
you can say a person is lying .
well , you have to remember that TV was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diag@@ onal .
OK . so there is the pressure @@@ -@@ @ sensitive display in operation .
so it 's not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it 's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously cou@@ ld@@ n 't be presented before .
and it sort of ni@@ b@@ bles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium .

there 's nowhere where that 's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests -- sex .
so that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive , and females are passive and co@@ y .
but that 's just not the case .
so for example , take k@@ at@@ y@@ di@@ ds , which are relatives of c@@ ric@@ kets and gra@@ s@@ shop@@ pers .
( la@@ ughter ) Ok@@ ay , they would not be able to do that very often .
people have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for mill@@ enn@@ ia .
and the idea is that what 's true for a person will also be true for the white rat .
and females as a kind of variant -- something special that you only study after you get the basics down .
because they assumed that the world 's stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor , walk @@@ -@@ @ on roles .
but when we do that , we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like .
well , the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find un@@ ner@@ ving about them .
now , you know , people write fiction and talk about parallel univers@@ es .
the all@@ ure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to d@@ ab@@ ble in the par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
people would admit sha@@ me@@ ful secrets about themselves , and other people would say , " Oh my God , I 'm exactly the same . "
vo@@ ic@@ eless people realized that they had a voice , and it was powerful and eloqu@@ ent .

when a woman gets sha@@ med , it 's , " I 'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uter@@ us . "
before that , she worked with adults with learning difficulties , and was apparently really good at her job .
J@@ us@@ tine was fired , of course , because social media demanded it .
and of course , that 's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for , like having children out of wedlock .
word got around that she was the daughter the mining bil@@ lion@@ aire Des@@ mond S@@ acco .
what 's true is that we are cle@@ ver and stupid ; what 's true is that we 're grey areas .

these are the " Can I ? " questions : can I work while I have cancer ?
of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
for example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for La Cur@@ a .
in 2012 , when I painted the min@@ aret of J@@ ara Mosque in my home@@ town of Gab@@ Ã©s , in the south of Tunisia , I never thought that gra@@ ff@@ iti would bring so much attention to a city .

you don 't need to know the meaning to feel the piece .
I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets , and I learned that i@@ amb@@ ic Pen@@ ta@@ meter is and why it sounds so good to human ears .

the last thing I want to say to you , the most important thing that I want to say to you , is that the time of sem@@ is@@ yn@@ thetic life is here .
( la@@ ughter ) I remember watching , in 2003 , an interview between Fox News host Tony S@@ now and then @@@ -@@ @ US Defense Secretary , Donald Rum@@ s@@ fel@@ d .
and Rum@@ s@@ fel@@ d 's answer is , " Well , we don 't do body counts on other people . "
I don 't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras , which are recording what I 'm saying .
so now give me this ban@@ ana . "
no ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee will ever believe such a story .
human rights , just like God and heaven , are just a story that we 've invented .
it is actually worth 10 ban@@ anas . "
and if I believe it , and you believe it , and everybody believes it , it actually works .
that can work .
( la@@ ughter ) To conclude , then : we humans control the world because we live in a dual reality .
I also went fishing .
my poker mates may have been bl@@ u@@ ffing about the hands that they drew , but they we@@ ren 't bl@@ u@@ ffing about their social beliefs .
the St. George 's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration , and so what I g@@ lean@@ ed from this Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ia is what a hot debate this would become .

the reality is that many white Americans are aff@@ able and kind .
( la@@ ughter ) And yet , some things haven 't changed .
it 's a devastating ir@@ ony , how we have gone forward as individuals , and back@@ wards as communities .
one of the big contexts anim@@ ating my Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ian journey was the year 20@@ 42 .
as such , will there be more Wh@@ it@@ opi@@ as ?
( la@@ ughter ) I did@@ n 't expect to learn so much about myself .
I don 't expect I 'll be living in a Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ia -- or a Black@@ top@@ ia , for that matter .
I do plan to continue gol@@ fing every chance I get .
I have a few insights to share , but first : a little history .
Or@@ acy , literacy and numer@@ acy were great developments in communication .
nearly 3,000 years later , the first proper writing systems took shape .
shortly after , Charles Min@@ ard char@@ ted Napol@@ eon 's march on Moscow , illustrating how an army of 42@@ 2,000 d@@ wind@@ led to just 10,000 as battles , geography and freezing temperatures took their toll .
( la@@ ughter ) Som@@ e@@ times I produce code to quickly generate graphics from thousands of data points .
a policy that clearly says , the company prohibits sex @@@ -@@ @ buying during work , with company resources or on company time .
my teachers insisted that I would go for an eye test .
and as we 've shown , it do@@ es@@ n 't make just a health and social difference , it creates huge economic benefit .
and for M@@ ama J@@ ane , it was@@ n 't just restoring her sight , it meant the opportunity to restore hope , to restore joy and to restore dignity .
but since its creation in the early 1980s , Hezbollah has also set up a political party , a social @@@ -@@ @ service network , and a military apparatus .
they build schools , they run hospitals , they set up vocational @@@ -@@ @ training programs or micro @@@ -@@ @ loan programs .
and the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated , the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state .
I 'm going to go right into the slides .
I don 't want you to see what I 'm doing up here .
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings I liked or not .
and after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sket@@ ches on n@@ ap@@ kins .
and the client said , " Why no fish ? "
three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings saying we 'd won the competition .
cou@@ ld@@ n 't find it .
and when I got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail .
I said , " If I can 't get the craft that I want , I 'll use the craft I can get . "
it 's copper and galvan@@ ize .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
and I call it , " David and G@@ oli@@ ath . "
I just joined the points .
the reality , with the lake -- the work@@ manship is pretty bad .
it 's kind of like a whole built town .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
you go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there 's another bridge here .
and I struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner .
these are the models for it .
and then this kind of tw@@ ist , with this balcony and the sk@@ irt , kind of like a ball@@ er@@ ina lifting her sk@@ irt to let you into the fo@@ yer .
it 's like a drug addic@@ t .
I say , " I 'm not going to do it anymore -- I don 't want to do it anymore -- I 'm not going to do it . "
we 've had a lot of fun working together .
see , that sky@@ light goes down and becomes that one .
and the plan of this -- it 's a concert hall .
you have to then try and get that back in some way .
that 's the idea .
time goes on .
( la@@ ughter ) I can do things like read and write music .
I am a very visual thin@@ ker .
my personality switched from being sh@@ y and aw@@ k@@ ward to being defi@@ ant and cur@@ sing out a storm .
my family finally rescu@@ ed me , but by that time , I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks , as well as developing severe an@@ emia , and was on the ver@@ ge of suicide .
the app P@@ odi@@ um , released by my company , Au@@ ti@@ sm@@ Se@@ es , has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills .
in addition , we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world , in real time .
we were hungry .
we all feel the same things .
however , engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial .
and that 's when the emails started p@@ ouring in , sometimes as many as a thousand a day .
thank you for giving me a voice . "
in a few early success stories , a leading French hospitality company , Acc@@ or , has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its 18@@ 0,000 employees by 2020 .
in the first two stages , moderate stress can actually help experiences enter your memory .
it would be nice if some stress also helped us remember facts , but unfortunately , the opposite is true .
the reason for this in@@ hibition is so the fight / flight / freeze response can over@@ rule slower , more reasoned thought in a dangerous situation .
during the winter , struggling to get warm , my neighbors would have no choice but to bypass the meter after their heat was shut off , just to keep their family comfortable for one more day .
in the US , the average American spends three percent of their income on energy .
look -- given our rockets to Mars and our pocket @@@ -@@ @ sized AI , we have the tools to address these systemic inequities .
cost of rene@@ wa@@ bles , insulation , micro@@ grids and smart home technology are all decreasing .
our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities , utilities and government agencies alike to provide equitable access to clean energy , energy efficiency and energy technology .
we 're connecting neighbor@@ hoods to community solar and spear@@ heading community @@@ -@@ @ led smart home research and installation programs to help families bring down their energy bills .
and these programs do help millions of people , but they 're only able to help a fraction of those in need .
in fact , there is a 47 @@@ -@@ @ billion @@@ -@@ @ dollar home @@@ -@@ @ energy affordability gap , so assistance alone is not sustainable .
and I know high energy burdens are a tremendous barrier to overcome , but through relationships with communities and technology , we have the paths to overcome them .
thank you .
you sw@@ allow an aspir@@ in .
but for this pill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stomach , intestin@@ es and various other organs first .
now , all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment , which is a life @@@ -@@ @ long treatment that must be sw@@ allowed by patients .
one day , I sat and thought , " Can we deliver anti @@@ -@@ @ HIV directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? "
before you even know it , the induced hole becomes immediately repaired .
but one day , if successful , this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body .
so , after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call -- anytime , anywhere -- you might imagine that government officials are not very happy .
what that means is that if the drug dealers ' telephone calls or the terrorists ' telephone calls can be intercep@@ ted , then so can the rest of ours , too .
and so , my message to you is this : we need to use these tools .
and what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood .
and by and large , factors that we know are required for the development of tissues , for the maintenance of tissues -- they start to decrease as we get older , while factors involved in repair , in injury and in inflammation -- they increase as we get older .
we had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings 20 to 89 years of age , and we measured over 100 of these communication factors , these hormone @@@ -@@ @ like proteins that transport information between tissues .
and what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group , about half the factors changed significantly .
and the way this looks is shown in this graph .
so in our lab , we 're trying to understand these factors better , and many other groups are trying to understand , what are the true aging factors , and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age @@@ -@@ @ related diseases ?
so to summarize , we find the old mouse , and its brain in particular , are m@@ alle@@ able .
young blood factors can reverse aging , and what I did@@ n 't show you -- in this model , the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old .
it 's efficient , it 's fast , it can disappear -- a pro@@ ton can disappear from one place , and re@@ appear on the other .
and those run@@ gs of the lad@@ der are hydrogen bonds -- pro@@ tons , that act as the glue between the two str@@ ands .
zoom in a bit more .
watch the two white balls .
we still don 't know yet how important it is ; this is still an open question .
it 's an object that beha@@ ves like a wave , so that it do@@ es@@ n 't just move in one direction or the other , but can follow multiple pathways at the same time .
two quantum @@@ -@@ @ ent@@ ang@@ led electr@@ ons within a single molec@@ ule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth 's magnetic field .
we don 't know if it 's the correct explanation , but w@@ ow , w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate ?
it 's an extreme form of den@@ gue fever , a mosqu@@ ito @@@ -@@ @ born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine , and kills 2@@ 2,000 people each year .
we fear the certain inev@@ itability that comes with Ebola .
we 've known what it 's capable of .
and in fact , we 've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade .
why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now ?
it 's simply too commercially risky .
well , partially , because it was really difficult -- or thought to be difficult -- to weap@@ on@@ ize the virus , but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it .
it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well @@@ -@@ @ known anti@@ gen and turn it into a viable vaccine .
and I 've been in the business for over 25 years .
I knew there was a way that we could do this , probably , different or better .
a way that preserved dignity and guaranteed justice .
and that we know , in order to have great relationships and relationships built on trust , that we 're going to have to have communication .
so the new way of delivering it is through what we call neighborhood coordinating officers , or N@@ CO@@ s .
at a community meeting , there was a bar , up in Washington Heights , and the neighbors were complain@@ ing about out@@ cry and no@@ ises .
and of course now they have relatively quie@@ ter bar nights .
that 's why the NY@@ PD , along with other departments throughout the United States , are training all of their officers in implicit bias .
this is critical .
that 's another key component .
and we know this because the NY@@ PD 's neighborhood policing philosophy is grounded in the co@@ production of public safety .
Trac@@ ie Ke@@ es@@ ee : now , that 's better , al@@ right .
and number three : we must also make sure that truth and telling facts is painful .
and agree ?
T@@ K : so we do know there is a better way .
these are the UA@@ Vs .
these are two types of UA@@ Vs : a ro@@ tor@@ craft , or hum@@ ming@@ bird ; a fixed @@@ -@@ @ wing , a ha@@ w@@ k .
and they 're used extensively since 2005 -- Hur@@ ric@@ ane Kat@@ r@@ ina .
let me show you how this hum@@ ming@@ bird , this ro@@ tor@@ craft , works .
but it 's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this .
you 've got things like this fixed @@@ -@@ @ wing , this ha@@ w@@ k .
in seven hours , going from Ar@@ l@@ ington , driving from the In@@ cid@@ ent Command Post to the site , flying the UA@@ Vs , processing the data , driving back to Ar@@ l@@ ington command post -- seven hours .
well , why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very , very important ?
and a great example of that is Bu@@ j@@ old .
unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small , so Bu@@ j@@ old -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) S@@ ay hel@@ lo to Bu@@ j@@ old .
the biggest problem is not making the robots smaller , though .
what are the odds that the experts , your chemical engineer , your railroad transportation engineers , have been trained on whatever UA@@ V that particular county happens to have ?
the problem becomes : who gets what data when ?
it 's a little narrative thing .
that 's her hand that she 's sp@@ itting into .
because , basically , I work as a theoretical phy@@ sic@@ ist .
and they we@@ ren 't used to that .
we had some of the students fil@@ med at home before they came to A@@ IMS .
and I 'll just show you one .
and I 'll let her take it from there .
and after A@@ IMS , She@@ hu wanted to do high @@@ -@@ @ energy physics , and he came to Cambridge .
she 's a phy@@ sic@@ ist , and somehow stays smil@@ ing , in spite of everything going on back home .
well , it 's not my TED wish ; it 's our wish , as you 've already gathered .
and our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this .
easy to remember the basic rules we need .
it 's very remote , it 's very dry and it 's very beautiful .
we have an array of existing teles@@ cop@@ es already , in the An@@ des mountains in Chile , and that 's soon to be joined by a really sens@@ ational array of new capability .
and then there will be teles@@ cop@@ es in space .
the cosmic dawn .
and if you can imagine this tiny area , it 's only one @@@ -@@ @ fiftieth of the size of the full moon .
( appl@@ ause ) It also includes a number of institutions across the United States , including Harvard University , the S@@ mi@@ th@@ s@@ onian and the Car@@ ne@@ gie Institutions , and the Universities of Ari@@ z@@ ona , Chicago , Texas @@@ -@@ @ Austin and Texas A & amp ; M University .
this happens under@@ ne@@ ath the football stadium at the University of Ari@@ z@@ ona .
it 's tuc@@ ked away under 5@@ 2,000 seats .
it 's what allows us to have the precision that we will have .
so , what does that precision buy us ?
that 's the extraordinary resolution and power of this teles@@ cope .
we 'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail .
you mentioned different facilities .
the same profile in Japan .
let 's watch the race .
it is the essence of human efforts : how we work together , how each effort contributes to the efforts of others .
and we are quite effective at that -- failing .
what gets measured gets done .
there is no metric on earth that will give us the answer .
this is what is killing productivity , what makes people suffer at work .
did you throw it , or did you pass it effectively ?

the community came up with a solution , called multi @@@ -@@ @ signature es@@ cro@@ w payments .

and I 'd say , " One and 20 . "
JS : we charged the highest fees in the world at one time .
JS : well , it 's not just mathematical .
I don 't think we should worry about it too much .
and in fact , bringing science into the investing world has improved that world .
this is your wife , Mar@@ il@@ yn .
next year , it 'll be 1,000 and that 'll be 10 percent of the math and science teachers in New York [ City ] public schools .
( appl@@ ause ) CA : J@@ im , here 's another project that you 've supported philanthro@@ p@@ ically : research into origins of life , I guess .
JS : well , I 'll save that for a second .
now , every year in our Mil@@ ky Way , which has 100 billion stars , about two new stars are created .
so , in steady state , there are about two million stars in formation at any time .
working with Mar@@ il@@ yn and giving it away has been very enjoyable .
so , we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't work if we did@@ n 't get paid , but that 's not why we do what we do .
workers who do this kind of work , whether they do it in factories , in call centers , or in fulfillment warehouses , do it for pay .
and what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live .
it do@@ es@@ n 't say anything about odd @@@ -@@ @ numbered boxes , so we can just ignore the box marked with a seven .

( appl@@ ause ) So you can have a law , but it 's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it .
so both men and women got a lot out of it , but different things .
now with the Bil@@ lie Jean King Leadership Initiative , you 're taking on an even bigger cause .

( la@@ ughter ) So every week , 11 women and me got together .
all women are similarly situated in patri@@ archy , and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or si@@ ster@@ hood . "
so the black woman says to the white woman , " When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror , what do you see ? "
privilege is invisible to those who have it . "
now remember , I was the only man in this group , so when I witnessed this , I went , " Oh no . "
I had to start thinking about them , and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long .
it was a quote from one of the men , and the quote was , " A Black Woman St@@ ole My Job . "
( la@@ ughter ) So let me be very clear : white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world .
so it is good for business .
we could not figure this out .
no problem . just like that .
they want to be able to balance work and family with their partners .
now , it turns out that the more eg@@ al@@ itarian our relationships , the hap@@ pier both partners are .
their children have lower rates of absen@@ te@@ e@@ ism , higher rates of achievement .
they are less likely to see a therap@@ ist , less likely to be diagnosed with depression , less likely to be taking prescription medication .
the goal was to have a one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one ratio with every one of these students .

it 's right off the library . and there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
so the store actually did really well .
but it brought in so many people -- teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody -- because it was street level . it was open to the public .
so they opened this place . inside , it 's like a Co@@ st@@ co for super@@ heroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form .
personally , I think it 's a problem .
because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .

number 12 : if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability , what would it be ?

so the article was published online on a Friday evening , and by Saturday , this had happened to the traffic on my blog .
I understand that this is part of the deal .
how do you live with the doubt that inevitably cre@@ eps into every relationship , or even harder , how do you live with your partner 's doubt ?
I don 't remember making a single speech on climate change .
that is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's an issue for all of us , and it 's an issue where we need more and more momentum .
and we have to build on that .
and that 's what we have to do .
and I 'd just come back from living in Spain for a while , and I 'd joined this For@@ tune 500 company . I thought , " This is fantastic .
within two weeks , I was out of there , and I left with one intention : to find something that I could screw up . that 's how tough it was .

and then what happened ?

and here 's the day that it finally worked : [ video : ( Mac Stone nar@@ rating ) After setting up the platform , I look off and I see a k@@ ite coming over the cat@@ tails .
in the E@@ ver@@ gl@@ ades , they are the very architects of the E@@ ver@@ gl@@ ades , because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season , they start excav@@ ating these holes called G@@ ator holes .
and now this is@@ n 't just affecting them , other animals also depend on this relationship , so they become a key@@ stone species as well .
we don 't do things like that .
a similar poll taken in the United States in November 2014 found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched be@@ heading videos , and a further 23 percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown .

for 13 long years , that was my reality .
most of us never think twice about talking , about communicating .
the doctors we@@ ren 't sure what it was , but they treated me the best they could .
however , I progressively got worse .
while in hospital , I desper@@ ately wanted to go home .
my parents were told I was as good as not there .
a vegetable , having the intelligence of a three @@@ -@@ @ month @@@ -@@ @ old baby .
my parents , in fact my entire family 's lives , became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how .
I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one .
my personality was ent@@ om@@ bed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a ch@@ ry@@ sal@@ is .
I would never talk to a friend .
no one would ever love me .
I had no dreams , no hope , nothing to look forward to .
well , nothing pleasant .
I was a silent , invisible observer of how people beha@@ ved when they thought no one was watching .
the first time it happened , I was shocked and filled with dis@@ belief .
how could they do this to me ?
hurt , sad@@ ness and anger floo@@ ded through me .
there was no one to comfort me .
all I knew was that I would never be the same .
as I learned how the shad@@ ows moved as the hours of the day passed , I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home .
an arom@@ a@@ therap@@ ist began coming to the care home about once a week .
as simple as this may sound , it was amazing .
I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message .
just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life , I met Jo@@ an .
I started to feel whole again , a man worthy of love .
I began to resha@@ pe my destiny .
over our life@@ times , we 've all contributed to climate change .
it can cause upset , it could cause cost .
there 's a famous story about the great rab@@ bi , Hil@@ le@@ l , the older contemporary of Jesus .
between 1914 and 1945 , 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict .
today we know they 're made from protein molecules .
that 's what we see in the bra@@ ins of Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's patients .
but Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves .
this pattern caused me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons .
I worried that there was something wrong with this , and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything .
I 'll tell you where you learned it : you learned it from the culture .
why ?
all they hear is that they 're going to have to choose .
you might feel like you don 't have a purpose .
it 's a mou@@ thful to say .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's easy to see your multi@@ potenti@@ ality as a limitation or an afflic@@ tion that you need to overcome .
one : idea synthesis .
Sha H@@ wan@@ g and Rac@@ hel B@@ in@@ x drew from their shared interests in carto@@ graphy , data visu@@ alization , travel , mathematics and design , when they founded M@@ esh@@ u .
M@@ esh@@ u is a company that creates custom geographically @@@ -@@ @ inspired jewelry .
he 's even more valuable because he can take on various roles , depending on his clients ' needs .
as a society , we have a vested interest in encouraging multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites to be themselves .
you came out of the wom@@ b knowing you wanted to be a pedi@@ atric neuro@@ surgeon .
( la@@ ughter ) In fact , some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite pa@@ ired together .
so with that said , if there is one thing you take away from this talk , I hope that it is this : embrace your inner wiring , whatever that may be .
you might think this is not much , compared to the billions of ne@@ ur@@ ons we have .
so why are these new ne@@ ur@@ ons important and what are their functions ?
and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new ne@@ ur@@ ons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , then we block certain memory abilities .
and this is especially new and true for spatial recognition -- so like , how you navigate your way in the city .
but moreover , if you just block neuro@@ gene@@ sis , then you block the efficacy of the anti@@ de@@ pres@@ sant .
are we ready ?
yes , stress will decrease the production of new ne@@ ur@@ ons in the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus .
( la@@ ughter ) Yes , you are right , it will increase the production of new ne@@ ur@@ ons .
I will let you judge that one by yourself .
so this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my ment@@ ors , Ru@@ sty G@@ age from the Sal@@ k Institute , showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new ne@@ ur@@ ons .
ST : no , you don 't !

for the first time , IC@@ Os had raised more money for young star@@ tu@@ ps than venture capital had .
it was the first week of the program .
we should do an IC@@ O that combines the value of all of our companies and raise money as a group . "
and we decided to cooperate , rather than compete .
and I believe that 's way more exciting than just trying to invest in the next billion @@@ -@@ @ dollar startup .
thank you .
what 's nice about this scheme , this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than down@@ wards , is that it allows us to think about illness as well in a somewhat different way .
can you build this as an organ outside the body ?
could we impl@@ ant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing ?
how could we impl@@ ant those memories back in ?
so let me end with some thoughts about model building .
but perhaps what 's really at stake are three more intangible M 's : mechanisms , models , met@@ aph@@ ors .
there 's a lot of talk in techn@@ olog@@ yland about the person@@ alization of medicine , that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically , your gen@@ ome , your current context .
it 's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elas@@ ticity .
why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago ?
we live in a very special time in history , a rare time , a time when the confl@@ u@@ ence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we 've never had access to before .
together with my long @@@ -@@ @ term 3D printing collabor@@ ator Str@@ at@@ as@@ ys , we 3D @@@ -@@ @ printed this cape and sk@@ irt with no se@@ ams between the cells , and I 'll show more objects like it .
but is nature ideal ?
the land created a world made of parts .
the second @@@ -@@ @ most abundant bi@@ opol@@ y@@ mer on the planet is called ch@@ iti@@ n , and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shri@@ m@@ ps , cra@@ bs , scor@@ pi@@ ons and bu@@ tter@@ flies .
the first is cy@@ an@@ ob@@ acter@@ ia .
what if we could create personal micro@@ biom@@ es that would scan our sk@@ ins , repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies ?
I call this material ecology .
we placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this 3 @@@ -@@ @ dimensional point cloud and visu@@ alize the complex architecture of the sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m co@@ co@@ on .
we then created holes , or aper@@ tures , that would lock in the rays of light and heat , distributing those sil@@ k@@ wor@@ ms on the structure .
and this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision @@@ -@@ @ free manner .
and in a minute you 'll see it enter our lab , which is recogn@@ izable by the clu@@ tter that you see .
( la@@ ughter ) And I want to show you an example .
but because the robots interact with each other , they sense their neighbors , they essentially follow .
in the next video , you 'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot .
this is easily discer@@ ni@@ ble from imagery , not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery .
the target was to take from a baseline of 1990 , when 36 percent of the world 's population lived in poverty , to get to 18 percent poverty this year .
the highest performing country , Norway , scores 88 .
so there 's our target , 75 out of 100 .
and in there , I 'm now going to put all the countries of the world , each one represented by a do@@ t , and on top of that I 'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship .
so here is the world in 2015 .
( la@@ ughter ) Just 6@@ 2.4 . just a tiny increase .
so what 's going on ?
but as you saw already , there is actually lots of noise around this trend line .
and that 's really important , because it tells us two things .
if we rely on economic growth alone , we 're going to get to 6@@ 2.4 .
so let 's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently under@@ performing on social progress -- the Russia , China , Indi@@ as -- just up to the average .
and now let 's be even b@@ older still .
what if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica in prioritizing human well @@@ -@@ @ being , using its wealth for the well @@@ -@@ @ being of its citizens ?
well then , we get to nearly 73 , very close to the Global Goals .
it grades our performance on the Global Goals on a scale from F to A , where F is humanity at its worst , and A is humanity at its best .
let 's choose the world that we want .
Michael Green : this is a really important point ; it 's a big shift in priorities -- it 's no longer about poor countries and just poverty .
even , I 'm sorry to say , Brun@@ o , Switzerland has got to work to do .
B@@ G : thank you very much .
but the parish cler@@ k is also l@@ usting after the wife , and comes by every night to sing outside her house .

this area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks .
what this is doing is merely telling us that we are scrat@@ ching the surface .
this awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women .
good morning .
and we have so many examples of this : the Py@@ g@@ mies of the Congo tune their instruments to the pit@@ ches of the birds in the forest around them .

and this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played for four minutes and 33 seconds .
he told me that he had just visited what he thought was an abandoned warehouse where the De@@ tro@@ it police department was storing evidence .

Pam@@ ela , 19 years old -- I 'll call her Pam@@ ela , that 's not her real name -- nine@@ teen years old , was walking down the street after she had come from visiting her boy@@ friend .
but not only that .
as we began to study and investigate how this possibly could have happened , we discovered there were other issues besides just financial ones .
and we knew where that rape kit was .
in one city , in one state .
ups was one company , as I said .
prisoners are sent to a CM@@ U because of their race , their religion or their political beliefs .
but the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs .
their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls .
it 's right at the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most tip of Norway .
out of each leg of the we@@ t@@ suit there were stic@@ king two white bones .

disease and infections are widespread .
about half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year , and roughly 4,000 are staying in Cal@@ ais .
this is 22 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Mou@@ az Al Balk@@ hi from Syria .
so we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him , and later on got additional DNA samples from Mou@@ az 's closest relative who now lives in Jordan .
but at some point , he must have given up all hope .
the last night we know he was alive , he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dun@@ k@@ ir@@ k .

B@@ G : are you planning to go back ? and continue the reporting ?
a few years ago , with my colleague , Em@@ manu@@ elle Char@@ p@@ enti@@ er , I invented a new technology for editing gen@@ om@@ es .
( la@@ ughter ) A big mou@@ thful -- you can see why we use the acrony@@ m CR@@ IS@@ PR .
the technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell 's DNA affect either a tissue or , in this case , an entire organism .
so , gen@@ ome @@@ -@@ @ engineered humans are not with us yet , but this is no longer science fiction .
( appl@@ ause ) ( Appl@@ ause ends ) Brun@@ o Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : Jenn@@ if@@ er , this is a technology with huge consequences , as you pointed out .
yes , your happy place , I know you 've got one even if it 's fake .
any plastic tables ?
so let 's start there -- with the idea that good design should feel natural .
and then you might revisit those moments later , and add context to them online .
most of all , we wanted to create an intimate , beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved .
basically , it 's virtual reality cir@@ ca 1955 .
so let 's rec@@ ap .
yet .
T@@ BD , to be decided .
can you please follow along with me ?
and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
one man approached them with a small baby per@@ ched on his shoulder , nine months old -- Mal@@ ek .
it was very frigh@@ tening .
the Academy of Athens , one of Greece 's most prestigious institutions , gave her an award of bra@@ very , and she deserves all that praise , and she deserves a second chance .
she wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice .
but in reality , our gu@@ t is extremely vulnerable to all kinds of w@@ ish@@ ful thinking and bi@@ ases .
but ge@@ ologists have estimated that what is still missing , to be discovered and mapped , is something around 10 million kilometers .
that means that for each meter of a cave that we already know , that we have explored , there are still some tens of kilometers of un@@ discovered passages .
but nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame .
and so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those m@@ assi@@ fs , the Au@@ y@@ Ã¡n @@@ -@@ @ te@@ pu@@ i , which is very famous because it hosts Angel F@@ alls , which is the highest water@@ fall in the world -- about 9@@ 79 meters of vertical drop .
there are strong winds , and there are almost 4,000 mil@@ lime@@ ters of rainfall per year , so it 's really , really difficult to find good conditions .
that means , in the P@@ em@@ Ã³n indigenous language , " The House of the G@@ ods . "
and , really , everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the min@@ er@@ alog@@ ical world .
so they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation .
it 's always dark . they have to do science . they have a lot of tasks .
but when I look at these pictures , I wonder : there is zero light down there , and yet they look incredibly well @@@ -@@ @ exposed .
how do your colleagues , the photographers , take these pictures ?
FS : ye@@ ah . they are working in a dar@@ k@@ room , basically , so you can open the shut@@ ter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment .
we 've collapsed that through technology to mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner .
as they do it , in the upper left is a display that 's yo@@ ked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
but I want to leave with you the big question .
in fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
( la@@ ughter ) And I started won@@ dering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
now , you all know what the post@@ mor@@ tem is .
they we@@ ren 't using smell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , this exquis@@ itely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
for your passport , a particular draw@@ er .
if you designate a spot and you 're scrup@@ ulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
remember , when you 're under stress , the brain releases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l is toxic , and it causes clou@@ dy thinking .
but actually , medical practice do@@ es@@ n 't work that way .
we haven 't fig@@ ured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
but Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed st@@ atin , what do you suppose it is ?
but wait a minute .
now , I 'm not saying whether you should take the st@@ atin or not .
medical ethics requires it , it 's part of the principle of informed consent .
you don 't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
you might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you 're practiced with this kind of thinking .
there 's an evolutionary reason for this .
the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
we cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe that something so hor@@ rific could happen to a human being , and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate , so personal .
so we launched Crisis Text Line , very quietly , in Chicago and El Pas@@ o -- just a few thousand people in each market .
( appl@@ ause ) Text is un@@ beli@@ ev@@ ably private .
no one hears you talking .
we get things like , " I want to die .
I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me . "
and they go back and forth for a while .
I was diagnosed as bi@@ polar , and I think I 'm going to be OK . "
so how do we use the data to make us better ?
( la@@ ughter ) We have the data to know what makes a great counsel@@ or .
we know that if you text in the words " mg " and " rubber band , " there 's a 99 percent match for substance abuse .
on the day that Rob@@ in Williams committed suicide , people floo@@ ded hot@@ lines all over this country .
because I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders , so that they can plan meals and guidance counsel@@ ors to be there on Mon@@ days .
( appl@@ ause ) Data , evidence makes policy , research , journalism , policing , school boards -- everything better .
I don 't think of myself as a mental health activist .
I get really excited about this data , I 'm a little ner@@ dy .
and growing up , I found out that adults make a m@@ ess , and they 're not very good at cleaning up after themselves .
( la@@ ughter ) And so it 's sad to say , but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them .
so with my students , ages six to 15 , we 've been dre@@ aming of inven@@ ting a better way .
so we 've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop .
and so , back to plastic .
so we 're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots , kids get very excited .
and the next thing we do -- we do what we call " rapid proto@@ typing . "
what was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem , and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it .
so they were very shocked , because this is the water they drink , this is the water they ba@@ the in , this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live .
so we built a rough prototype of a spec@@ tro@@ meter , and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectr@@ ums , so that can help you identify what 's in the water .
and today , I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are lea@@ king from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean .
well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
so I 've been going to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima every year since the accident , and I measure independently and with other scientists , on land , in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids .
they showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin , even though they w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be soft with them .
and we 're not the only people with this problem ; this problem touches the whole of the Western world .
lon@@ eliness is like a collective rel@@ ational challenge , and it can 't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response .
I wanted to know what we could do differently .
and this is interesting from an artistic point of view .
the opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order and always subject to a specific regulation .
" N@@ SA Agents , Do the Right Th@@ ing ! blow the whi@@ stle ! "
what interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side .
we have European passports , visas and air tickets .
after dramatic escap@@ es from crisis zones and war zones , men , women and children are detained by Australia without trial , sometimes for years .
on the floor , a styl@@ ized comp@@ ass gave the direction to each immigration detention center , accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility .
emotions ran deep . many we@@ pt .
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants .
my eu@@ re@@ ka moment was to find a bilingual solution for Arabic education , because effective communication and education is the road to more tolerant communities .
yes , both use upward and downward strokes , but have completely different baselines .
the idea is to simply create a fun and engaging way of learning Modern Standard Arabic through LE@@ GO .
but what is it that a conserv@@ ation@@ ist does ?
next , we must disseminate what we learn .
and it 's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tap@@ ir is .
the destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early 1500@@ s , when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil , beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America .
this is the largest continuous freshwater flo@@ od@@ plain in the world , an incredible place and one of the most important str@@ ongh@@ olds for low@@ land tap@@ irs in South America .
this camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it .
I am not alone .
and I 'll keep doing this for T@@ ed , a baby tap@@ ir we captured in December last year also in the P@@ ant@@ an@@ al .
and I will keep doing this for the hundreds of tap@@ irs that I 've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others I know I will encounter in the future .
and the answer to that is yes , we can .
but next I would like to activate the streaming of the video .
so now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way , and in a way that you can 't recognize with your eye , because the changes are too fast to recognize .
but in order to prove the point , I can block the light of the solar cell .
this means , despite the block@@ age , there 's sufficient light coming through the hand@@ ker@@ chief to the solar cell , so that the solar cell is able to dec@@ ode and stream that information , in this case , a high @@@ -@@ @ definition video .
and we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide , and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet .
pretty good indication it 's actually her on there .
and that picture was published all over .
but then , a couple of years go by , and the world 's most @@@ -@@ @ Go@@ og@@ led An@@ ders , An@@ ders Be@@ h@@ ring Bre@@ i@@ vik , did what he did .
he 's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media , on his blog and Facebook .
he told all of his readers the following , " Go out there on the Internet , find pictures of dog po@@ op on side@@ walks -- find pictures of dog po@@ op on side@@ walks -- publish them in your feeds , on your websites , on your blogs .
I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of b@@ oring .

I 've decided that , for me at least , I don 't have a big enough head .
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
and I said , " Well , I 've taught graduate -- I 've had graduate students , I 've taught under@@ graduate classes . "
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .

Lis@@ a D@@ az@@ ols : I had similar notions .

the Air Jordan 3 Black C@@ ement did for s@@ ne@@ akers what the iPhone did for phones .
it 's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down .

( la@@ ughter ) That 's an " I love D@@ ad " T @@@ -@@ @ shirt .
in the case of s@@ ne@@ akers , that someone is Ni@@ ke .
that means that Ni@@ ke 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competi@@ tor .
so it 's really just supply .
they sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars .

and here on Earth , amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch , life that might be very different from the DNA forms we know .
it do@@ es@@ n 't . it 's actually the opposite .
I mean , first of all , the 100 billion gal@@ ax@@ ies within range of our teles@@ cop@@ es are probably a min@@ us@@ cul@@ e fraction of the total .

and that influence affects all of us , every day , regardless of your own belief .
despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today , we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society .
I have eight si@@ bl@@ ings , a stay @@@ -@@ @ at @@@ -@@ @ home mother .
some of the rules we had were strict , but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed .
I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church , including myself .
this was where I felt safe . this is certainty and clarity about life .
I had help raising my little daughter .
and I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets , disciplinary councils , in decision @@@ -@@ @ making capacities , and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it .
until I stopped , and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men .
and I faced this contradiction in myself , and I joined with other activists in my community .
the first thing we did was raise consciousness .
we were attacked in social media and national press .
we received death threats .
most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council , and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better , because we believed that they could be .
" Don 't pay attention to religion . "
for example , during Pro@@ p 8 , my church raised over 22 million dollars to fight same @@@ -@@ @ sex marriage in California .

but not one woman in that line will forget that day , and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day .
before you move on , I encourage you to actually think about a possible answer to this question .

in this phase , roughly 50 percent of those who reach the surf will perish .
it was something that existed , but that we never spoke about .
so , this trauma -- what is it ?
a human being should not have to face the void of death .
they suddenly don 't want to sleep , because when they do , they have the same night@@ mare every night .
for example , a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him .
it can be the voice of a friend calling , and they 're being sla@@ ugh@@ tered and there 's nothing you can do .
you CA@@ N@@ NOT work anymore , you CA@@ N@@ NOT love anymore .
you go home and don 't recognize anyone .
you don 't even recognize yourself .
and no one understands .
we 're just not ready to listen .
no , it 's extremely common .
in 1939 , there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals .
in 1987 , the US government identified 10@@ 2,000 -- twice as many -- 10@@ 2,000 veterans who died from committing suicide .
the only way to heal from this trauma , from this encounter with death that overwhel@@ ms , pe@@ tri@@ fies and kills you is to find a way to express it .
because these people feel excluded from humanity .
they feel dirty , def@@ iled , ashamed .
and then one day , they sent him to a psychi@@ atr@@ ist .
the horror needs to be put into words -- human words , so we can organize it and talk about it again .
and if we can do that , if we can talk about these things , then step by step , by working it out verb@@ ally , we can re@@ claim our place in humanity .
but trauma survivors have lost that feeling of im@@ mortality .

in 20 years ' time , the Emperor V@@ es@@ pa@@ sian 's youngest son , Dom@@ iti@@ an , as em@@ peror , will enact a reign of terror .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you very much , thanks for the warm welcome .
a journey that takes place between two brea@@ ths -- the last one before diving into the water , and the first one , coming back to the surface .
and that 's why I 'm here today , to share my journey with you and to take you along with me .
it ends with a special technique called the car@@ p , which allows me to store one to two extra lit@@ ers of air in my lun@@ gs by com@@ pressing it .
when I leave the surface , I have about 10 lit@@ ers of air in my lun@@ gs .
and what 's extraordinary is that we share this instinc@@ t with marine mammals -- all marine mammals : dol@@ ph@@ ins , wh@@ ales , sea lions , etc .
and , of course , it works much better for them .
my lun@@ gs reach residual volume , below which they 're not supposed to be compressed , in theory .
thanks to this phenomenon , which we also share with marine mammals , I 'm able to continue with my di@@ ve .
we resist , we go against it .
100 meters -- the magic number .
below that , they said , the human body would im@@ plo@@ de .
he 'd use weights to des@@ cend faster and come back up with a ballo@@ on , just like in the movie .
that 's how I feel when I 'm at the bottom , at 123 meters .
nowhere else on Earth you can experience this -- looking all around you , and seeing the same thing .
first , because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom .
I 'm not alone any more .
once at the surface , I have 15 seconds to take off my nose cli@@ p , give this signal and say ( English ) " I am OK . "
but eventually , we realized the mon@@ sters did not lie out there , they reside inside of us .
he had@@ n 't done his home@@ work the night before , and felt more un@@ prepared than the am@@ bus@@ h@@ ed World War II soldiers he was supposed to write about .
a sudden rush of panic swe@@ pt over his body , leaving him with swe@@ at@@ y pal@@ ms , a f@@ og@@ gy mind and a racing heart .
there was a sense of fu@@ tility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning .
( la@@ ughter ) CA : now , a core part of your nation 's identity is fishing .
we don 't have a lot of livestock , so it 's fish that we depend on .
there had been some indications that some of the species , in particular the big@@ eye , was under serious threat .
and so there 's been that significant increase .
and so we 've started doing that , and we have to restructure the industry .
so I am a fisher@@ man , very much , and I used to be able to catch yel@@ low@@ f@@ in .
ca : so here 's a couple of beautiful girls from your country .
I mean , as you think about their future , what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world ?
if you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries , within your borders , we 'd have no question .
on one side were the Sax@@ ons .
but , enough mu@@ tations can bypass the fail @@@ -@@ @ saf@@ es , driving the cell to divide reck@@ lessly .
at the very least , the S@@ cra@@ p@@ per deserves an interview .
piece of cake . I got this . "
I want to show you the one who really changed my life , and this was the performance in Mo@@ MA , which I just recently made .
they are observed by the other people , they 're photograph@@ ed , they 're fil@@ med by the camera , they 're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves .
so you have to be there .
that 's my subjective way .
it 's something so old @@@ -@@ @ fashi@@ oned , but if you don 't respect your own word of honor and you leave before -- that 's not my problem .
but it 's six hours , the experience .
and then after you finish , you get a certificate of accomplishment , so get home and frame it if you want .
so what you do here , first you start slow walking , you start slowing down .
in the long duration chairs , you 're transported to the big place where you 're going to see the work .
right now , I am just making my institute in Brazil , then it 's going to be in Australia , then it 's coming here , to Canada and everywhere .
and this is to experience a kind of simple method , how you go back to simplicity in your own life .
( la@@ ughter ) You know , if you count rice you can make life , too .
how to count rice for six hours ?
and then this un@@ beli@@ evable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished -- or counting sand in the desert .
you do things in life -- it 's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way .
anyway , the mus@@ ke@@ teers were called to action to save the Land of P@@ i from the vor@@ acious dra@@ gon .
paren@@ theses pointed and Ex@@ ponents took the lead .
then , it was Multi@@ plication , Division , Ad@@ dition , and Sub@@ traction , each in turn , always the same order .
Don 't forget , there can be paren@@ theses inside paren@@ theses .
and that tr@@ ick@@ y ex@@ ponent .
Al@@ Haz@@ en 's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek 's cou@@ ld@@ n 't easily explain : why it gets dark sometimes .
but , that do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
they can be seen when two objects distur@@ b the surface of a still pond , and also when two point @@@ -@@ @ like sources of light are placed near each other .
not so fast !
in the 20th century , scientists did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle .
for instance , when you shine light on a metal , the light transfers its energy to the at@@ oms in the metal in discrete pac@@ kets called qu@@ anta .
this result , that light sometimes beha@@ ves like a particle and sometimes beha@@ ves like a wave , led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics .
it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their book@@ shelves .
what do my book@@ shelves say about me ?
well , when I asked myself this question a few years ago , I made an alarming discovery .
and so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel , short story collection or mem@@ o@@ ir from every country in the world .
then it was friends of friends .
and pretty soon , it was str@@ angers .
and when I t@@ wee@@ ted at it about my project , it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Pan@@ am@@ anian author Juan David M@@ organ .
and he said that nothing had been published , but he did have an un@@ published translation of his novel " The Golden Hor@@ se . "
M@@ organ was by no means the only word@@ sm@@ ith to share his work with me in this way .
the books I read that year opened my eyes to many things .
and it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world .
these days , when I look at my book@@ shelves or consider the works on my e @@@ -@@ @ reader , they tell a rather different story .
so we have all this , so why don 't we have the personal robot ?
how do we do that ? well , the first step , before we even start designing and getting our hands dirty , we have to come up with rules , kind of the laws , rules of conduct .
so we have to lay the boundaries , the rules of engagement , before we actually start designing .
and then we have to come up with tools .
so I believe that the way to make robots s@@ mar@@ ter is to m@@ im@@ ic people .
I never thought I 'd have to understand things like child psychology , infant development .
you know , we want to get strong .
and then , lastly , is creativity .
and these are the things that allow us to figure out new things .
and is@@ n 't it so cu@@ te ?
so , I 'm all for robots and smart robots .
basically , Ok@@ C@@ up@@ id 's matching algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date .
a computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paper@@ weight .
if both people in a relationship are saying yes to this , they 're going to have massive problems .
that worked really well .
some questions tell you more about a person than others .
the algorithm c@@ run@@ ches the numbers and gives us a result .
let 's call that set of common questions " s . "
basically , you 're a ne@@ at f@@ rea@@ k .
and let 's say B is a little bit different .
you 've answered " no , " you want someone else to answer " no , " and the question is only a little important to you .
the second question the algorithm looks at is : how much did you satisfy B ?
so your answers were 10 out of 11 equals 91 percent satisfactory to B.
I hope this will help you do that .
this is me rock climbing for the first time .
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident .
it was a revolutionary moment for the blind .
E@@ V : take the two doors to go out . the door is on your right .

the frontier is the real world .
of course , your mat@@ rices have to be the same size , but that 's pretty intuitive anyway .
it 's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it .
now do the next ones : 3 times 3 is 9 .
-@@ 4 plus 0 is -@@ 4 .
not all that bad , is it ?
look at these two mat@@ rices .
3 times wait a minute , there are no more rows in the second matrix .
we ran out of room .
though , why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me .
there are thousands of images like these .
a woman wrote to me to say , " I gave birth to tw@@ ins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks .
emo@@ tionally , I was a wrec@@ k .
so we choose to look at , and believe , this image .
choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies , so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices .
but that stance igno@@ res a fundamental truth , which is that our pro@@ creation on a national scale is not optional .
so now you 're thinking about unpaid leave .
because of the way it 's structured , all kinds of exceptions , half of new mothers are in@@ eligible for it .
I had to return to work before my baby was a month old , working 60 hours a week .
a teacher told me , " I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born .
I was allowed to bring my baby to work .
I thought , there 's just something wrong with me that I can 't swing this . "
all of this is to America 's shame .
if we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first , we might stick with one k@@ id . "
not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work , their needed work and their needed paren@@ thood , is their problem alone .
but all of us have voices .
it should not matter .
when we think about learning , we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall , books open on their desks , listening inten@@ tly to a teacher or professor in the front of the room .
in the 18@@ 90 's , a Russian physi@@ ologist named Ivan Pav@@ lov did some really famous experiments on dogs .
they learned to expect food at the sound of a bell .
so we could have all these possible combinations : round yellow pe@@ as , round green pe@@ as , wr@@ ink@@ led yellow pe@@ as , wr@@ ink@@ led green pe@@ as .
some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads .
to understand the rest of the story , you have to understand that our bra@@ ins are slow .
if you 're moving just at one meter per second , which is fairly slow , then in a tenth of second , you 've moved 10 centi@@ meters .
but let me finish by saying , how exactly does this explain this particular example ?
imagine it 's a cathedral door@@ way , to make it more concrete -- it 'll be helpful in a second .
if I can , I 'll quickly show two .
here are the cu@@ es of motion , the kinds of cu@@ es that you get on your re@@ tina when things are moving .

think back to the most difficult job you ever did .
it all depends on the context of what you 're looking at .
Albert E@@ in@@ stein used non @@@ -@@ @ Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an geometry as well to describe how space @@@ -@@ @ time becomes war@@ ped in the presence of matter , as part of his general theory of rel@@ ativity .
these discoveries could never have been made without gif@@ ted , progressive thin@@ kers able to suspend their pre@@ conceived notions and think outside of what they 've been taught .
over the past century , particle physi@@ ci@@ sts have been studying matter and forces at higher and higher energies .
instead , the universe consisted of a sw@@ ir@@ ling sea of sub@@ atomic matter .
further back still , and the energy was too great even for the quar@@ ks to stick together .
the human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet .
since then , photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science .
mathemati@@ cians have used photos to look at where in the t@@ wi@@ sts and turns of a whi@@ p the crack sound comes when the whi@@ p is breaking the sound barrier .

while we 're doing this , let 's keep track of the areas of the pieces .
great things happen at inter@@ sections .
there 's freedom in that in @@@ -@@ @ between , freedom to create from the inde@@ fin@@ it@@ eness of not @@@ -@@ @ quite @@@ -@@ @ here , not @@@ -@@ @ quite @@@ -@@ @ there , a new self @@@ -@@ @ definition .

once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations , I anticipated a smooth g@@ li@@ de to the PhD .
( la@@ ughter ) It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thr@@ illed to have that degree of lim@@ in@@ ality in their space .
stem itself is an inter@@ sec@@ tional term , such that its true ric@@ hness CA@@ N@@ NOT be appreciated without considering the lim@@ inal space between disciplines .
hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can 't even imagine .
we as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity .
the reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jes@@ sica Matthe@@ ws is because they are fundamentally inter@@ sec@@ tional stories , the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race , gender and innovation .
thus , we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience .
this is not a request born out of a desire to fit in .
they are gor@@ geous in their complexity , delicate in their construction , and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air .
what good is half a wing , fe@@ sto@@ oned with half @@@ -@@ @ fea@@ thers ?
at the same time , the fea@@ thers spread across the bodies of din@@ osa@@ urs , turning from spar@@ se patches of fu@@ z@@ z into dense plum@@ age , which even extended down to their legs .
some din@@ osa@@ urs had high cre@@ sts on their heads , and others had long , dramatic tail fea@@ thers .
a wood@@ coc@@ k uses fea@@ thers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop .
an o@@ str@@ ich stret@@ ches its wings over its nest to sh@@ ade its young .

the next morning , I just took all the pieces , assembled them together in my hotel room , and this is actually the sk@@ irt that I 'm wearing right now .
I loved going to old factories and we@@ ir@@ d stores in search of lef@@ to@@ vers of strange pow@@ ders and we@@ ir@@ d materials , and then bring them home to experiment on .
( la@@ ughter ) So I decided to move on to working with big machines , ones that did@@ n 't fit in my living room .
so you guys , you want to see what it looks like ?

and what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape .
that would be pretty bad .

movies , likewise , can convince us that the sound is coming from the actors ' mou@@ ths rather than surrounding speakers .
the worst part is , when we take a look at some of the numbers , it 's pretty sc@@ ary .
how that actually works is that right now we 've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin , as you see in blue .
and then also , that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate 99.@@ 97 percent of path@@ ogens near the outlets .
I did@@ n 't have the money to go out and buy a plane , so I decided to build a computer instead .
it 's pretty dis@@ g@@ usting .
and when we take a look at that from the side , you 'll also notice those path@@ ogens spreading across the length of the cabin .
the first thing I thought was , " This is no good . "
take a look at that from the side as well , you see a very efficient system .
thanks .
first thing , we need to understand that there really is only one ocean , consisting of five component basins that we call the Pacific , the Atlantic , the Indian , the Arctic , and the Southern .

over the last century , these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe .

the question is , ultimately , why does all this interesting stuff exist ?
this contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics , and in the next few years , we may find out whether we 'll ever be able to solve it .
at the heart of this problem are two numbers , two extremely dangerous numbers .
these are properties of the universe that we can measure , and they 're extremely dangerous because if they were different , even by a tiny bit , then the universe as we know it would not exist .
on July 4 , 2012 , physi@@ ci@@ sts at CER@@ N announced to the world that they 'd spo@@ tted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent colli@@ sions at the L@@ HC : the H@@ ig@@ gs bos@@ on .
if you 've ever held a mag@@ net close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap , then you 've felt the effect of a field .
and the H@@ ig@@ gs field is a little bit like a magnetic field , except it has a constant value everywhere .
it 's all around us right now .
we can 't see it or touch it , but if it was@@ n 't there , we would not exist .
rel@@ ativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings , a bit like a light switch .
and this value is crucial .
the universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious re@@ pul@@ sive force called dark energy .
you find that dark energy should be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy .
well , even that one won 't do here .
E@@ in@@ stein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics , and physi@@ ci@@ sts have kept at it ever since .
now , the idea of the multi@@ verse has been around for a while , but in the last few years , we 've started to get the first solid h@@ ints that this line of reasoning may get born out .
if so , then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert E@@ in@@ stein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature .
so you have to rely on people 's ing@@ en@@ uity , that they will solve the problems , but it may be a decade or more down the line .
( la@@ ughter ) It sounds funny for a particle phy@@ sic@@ ist to say that .
but I mean , seriously , it 's great news .
are you paying attention ?
for example , just now you focused on the for@@ k and did@@ n 't observe the tabl@@ ec@@ lo@@ th or the falling wa@@ iter .
the next time you get dÃ©@@ j@@ Ã  v@@ u , take a moment to think about it .
is your brain just acting slow ?
but this explanation do@@ es@@ n 't cut it .
this must be some kind of optical illusion .
but in fact , pilots and sail@@ ors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion .
the moon appears a certain size .
and the first question is very simple : why has the movement of refugees spi@@ ked so fast in the last six months ?
the World Food Programme was forced , for lack of resources , to cut by 30 percent food support to the Syrian refugees .
and Lebanon ? struggling , of course , but it 's managing .
AG : my country is supposed to receive four thousand .
four thousand in Portugal means nothing .
Turkey has now two million three @@@ -@@ @ hundred thousand or something of the sort , if you count all refugees .
and the idea is that nobody is taking care of it -- this is happening without any kind of management .
B@@ G : but there are villages in Germany with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees .
so , what 's your position ?
the truth is that for Afghans , the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for , at the time , six million Afghans that came .
so I would say that even today , the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open .
now , today this do@@ es@@ n 't make any sense , because they are providing a global public good .
and , of course , if you look at today 's situation of the indicators in these countries , it is clear that , especially their poor groups of the population , are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing .
B@@ G : who should be providing this support ?
we have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying , for instance , that Muslims refugees should not be received .
seriously , though , what is it ?
a universal truth ?
an ideal ?
there 's no shortage of answers .
it conqu@@ ers all .
it 's all you need .
or san@@ ity ?
would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency ?
that 's my point .
but if love is a thing that we can define , then how can it mean opposite things for so many people ?
thus , some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology 's way to make you continue our species .
probably pretty low .
as it turns out , that 's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a min@@ us@@ cul@@ e part of the full spectrum of light .
when we see , it 's because the energy of light stimulates a recep@@ tor in our eye called the re@@ tina .
radio waves have long wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths , while x @@@ -@@ @ rays have short wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths .
to see the universe in its full spectrum , we need to have the right eyes , and that means using special teles@@ cop@@ es that can help us see beyond visible light .
and the cool@@ est thing of all , no matter the wa@@ vel@@ ength or energy , the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth .
in 1977 , the phy@@ sic@@ ist Edward Pur@@ cell calculated that if you push a bacteria and then let go , it will stop in about a mil@@ lion@@ th of a second .

you are@@ n 't especially tired , yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big ya@@ wn comes out .
let 's take a look at a few of the most prevalent ones , beginning with two physiological hypo@@ theses before moving to a psychological one .
our first physiological hypothesis states that contag@@ ious y@@ aw@@ ning is triggered by a specific stimulus , an initial ya@@ wn .
scientists believe that this cha@@ m@@ ele@@ on effect is possible because of a special set of ne@@ ur@@ ons known as mirror ne@@ ur@@ ons .
this study was set up to show that dogs would enact a ya@@ wn ref@@ lex at the mere sound of a human ya@@ wn .
we were calling collectively for actions , and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know .
the e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia faded , we failed to build consensus , and the political struggle led to intense polarization .
and fourth , it became really hard to change our opinions .
fifth -- and in my point of view , this is the most critical -- today , our social media experiences are designed in a way that fav@@ ors broadcasting over engagements , posts over discussions , shallow comments over deep conversations .
this is so important .
for a moment , it sits there inno@@ cu@@ ously .
if your ideal cookie is barely brow@@ ned , like a Nor@@ the@@ aster@@ ner on a beach vacation , you could have set your oven to 310 degrees .
without them , plants would lose a pol@@ lin@@ ator .

so , now let 's talk about what the other 95 % is .
eventually , the universe will run out of gas to form stars , and the stars themselves will run out of fuel and burn out , leaving the universe with only black holes in it .

here are some questions and methods I 've used to help build the worlds in which those books take place .
whether that 's a fantasy world or a fu@@ tur@@ istic setting in the real world , it 's important to know where you are and whether you 're working in the past , present , or future .
what rules are in place here ?
what do people believe in here ?
and what does this society value most ?
where do the inhabitants live and work and go to school ?
what kind of technology exists ?
access to information ?
there 's so much to think about !
some astronom@@ ers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars .
it 's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car 's head@@ light .

I think that there 's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think that 's to open up four new local sources of water that I lik@@ en to f@@ au@@ ce@@ ts .
if we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years , we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we 'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought .
now , if you told me 20 years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water , I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and un@@ informed dre@@ am@@ er .

the ones that are deflec@@ ted by clouds are called diffuse ir@@ radi@@ ance .
these are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun 's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower , kind of like an eager be@@ ach@@ go@@ er .
in solar panels , pho@@ tons from the sun 's rays hit the surface of a panel , and electr@@ ons are released to get an electric current going .
for instance , even a few cum@@ ul@@ us clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays .

but one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan .
but in a larger area , with less ants , where such meetings happen less often , they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground .
other ants will then follow this pher@@ om@@ one trail , renewing it each time they manage to find food and return .
but you can observe these fascin@@ atin@@ g@@ ly simple , yet effective , processes directly through some simple experiments , by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior .
tat@@ to@@ os have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and devi@@ ant or tren@@ dy youth f@@ ads .
but have you ever wondered how tat@@ to@@ oing really works ?
so , how come the tat@@ too do@@ es@@ n 't gradually fla@@ ke off along with them ?
and it is this very process that makes tat@@ to@@ os permanent .
as these cells travel through the lym@@ ph@@ atic system , some of them are carried back with a bel@@ ly full of dy@@ e into the lym@@ ph nodes while others remain in the der@@ m@@ is .
der@@ mal cells , however , remain in place until they die .
but with time , tat@@ to@@ os do f@@ ade naturally as the body re@@ acts to the alien pig@@ ment particles , slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system 's macro@@ ph@@ ages .
but since the der@@ mal cells are relatively stable , much of the ink will remain deep in the skin for a person 's whole life .
technically , yes .
for this reason , removing a tat@@ too is still more difficult than getting one , but not impossible .
so a single tat@@ too may not truly last forever , but tat@@ to@@ os have been around longer than any existing culture .
and their continuing popularity means that the art of tat@@ to@@ oing is here to stay .
you 've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth , but how does it work ?
well , not entirely .
this is where we enter the quantum realm .
every atom and molec@@ ule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electr@@ ons .
to shift its electr@@ ons from the ground state to a higher level , a molec@@ ule needs to gain a certain amount of energy .
no more , no less .
it gets that energy from light , which comes in more energy levels than you could count .
one that do@@ es@@ n 't appear to be emitting light at all : Earth .
if you 're won@@ dering why our planet do@@ es@@ n 't seem to be g@@ lowing , it 's because the Earth do@@ es@@ n 't em@@ it visible light .
it 's the same energy , but at a higher or lower level .
the hot@@ ter an object gets , the higher frequency the light it em@@ its .
when you heat a piece of iron , it will em@@ it more and more frequencies of infrared light , and then , at a temperature of around 450 degrees Cel@@ sius , its light will reach the visible spectrum .
95 % of the light they em@@ it is invisible to our eyes .
just as oxygen gas pref@@ ers the dark red pho@@ tons , carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared pho@@ tons .

this has led me to understand that the human is not a cold , hard fact .
rather , it is something that 's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time .
so my final insight is that the computer , more or less , works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it .
this is an essentially philosophical idea , and it 's one that can 't be answered with software alone , but I think requires a moment of species @@@ -@@ @ wide , exi@@ st@@ ential reflection .

so , why does music rely so heavily on repetition ?
one part of the answer come from what psychologists call the mere @@@ -@@ @ exposure effect .
to investigate , psychologists asked people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition .
in this way , repetition can open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing .
this mode of listening ties in with our suscep@@ tibility to musical ear wor@@ ms , where segments of music bur@@ row into our head , and play again and again , as if stuck on repeat .
critics are often embar@@ ras@@ sed by music 's repeti@@ tiveness , finding it chil@@ dish or regres@@ sive , but repetition , far from an embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment , is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience we think about as musical .
the He@@ isen@@ berg Un@@ certainty Principle is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to expand into general pop culture .
it says that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a met@@ aph@@ or in everything from literary criticism to sports commentary .
the real origin is much deeper and more amazing .
wa@@ vel@@ ength is essential for quantum physics because an object 's wa@@ vel@@ ength is related to its momentum , mass times velocity .
small things , like at@@ oms or electr@@ ons though , can have wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths big enough to measure in physics experiments .
we can know a particles position very well , but it do@@ es@@ n 't have a wa@@ vel@@ ength , so we don 't know its momentum .
by combining waves with different wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths , which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different moment@@ a .
the result has regions where we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all .
both position and momentum are now uncertain , and the uncertainties are connected .
if you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave pac@@ ket , you need to add more waves , which means a bigger momentum uncertainty .
that 's the He@@ isen@@ berg Un@@ certainty Principle , first stated by German phy@@ sic@@ ist W@@ er@@ ner He@@ isen@@ berg back in 19@@ 27 .

( la@@ ughter ) B@@ G : indeed , and possibly we are too , now .
it 's because we have confined , as I was saying in my talk , democracy to the political sphere , while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy @@@ -@@ @ free zone .
in a sense , if I am allowed to be provocative , China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century .
they were simply interested in crush@@ ing our government , just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Euro@@ zone .
and because they did@@ n 't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece .
we are probably the largest economy in the world .
" come on , Your Hon@@ or , we all learned it in school .
" H@@ mm . why is celebrating this Colum@@ bus so important to you , anyway ? "
and his discovery gave our grand@@ parents and great @@@ -@@ @ grand@@ parents the chance to come here and build better lives for their children .
Don 't we deserve a hero to remind everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants ? "
" and what about the struggles of Native Americans who were nearly wi@@ ped out and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from poverty and discrimination ?
how can you make a hero out of a man who caused so much suffering ? "
people back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization across the world was a moral duty . "
" in some Latin American countries , they celebrate the same date under different names , such as D@@ Ã­a de la Raz@@ a .
" so , why not just change the name if it 's such a problem ? "
traditions and holidays are important to all cultures , but a hero in one era may become a vil@@ la@@ in in the next as our historical knowledge expands and our values evolve .
it 's only when the box is opened that we see a single definite state .
until then , the cat is a bl@@ ur of probability , half one thing and half the other .
we don 't see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wa@@ vel@@ ength decreases as the momentum increases .
if we took a single atom and ble@@ w it up to the size of the Solar System , the wa@@ vel@@ ength of a cat running from a phy@@ sic@@ ist would be as small as an atom within that Solar System .
a tiny particle , like an electr@@ on , though , can show dramatic evidence of its dual nature .
block one of the sl@@ its and the stri@@ pes go away .
a single electr@@ on is@@ n 't choosing to go left or right but left and right simultaneously .
as you add more at@@ oms , the electr@@ ons spread out more , shared between vast numbers of at@@ oms at the same time .
understanding how electr@@ ons are shared among at@@ oms allows us to precisely control the properties of sem@@ icon@@ duc@@ tor materials , like silic@@ on .
in standard no@@ tation , rhythm is indicated on a musical bar line , but there are other ways .
remember that tic@@ king clock ?
we can mark the be@@ ats at different positions around the circle using blue do@@ ts for main be@@ ats , orange ones for off be@@ ats , and white do@@ ts for secondary be@@ ats .
or a three beat rhythm with a main beat , an off beat , and a secondary beat .
we can then add an ou@@ ter@@ most layer consisting of an additive rhyth@@ mic component , reinforcing the main beat and increasing accuracy .
now let 's remove everything except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top .
in all of these examples , the underlying rhythm reinforces the basic one @@@ -@@ @ two , but in different ways depending on arrangement and cultural context .
so it turns out that the wheel method is more than just a n@@ if@@ ty way of visu@@ alizing complex rhyth@@ ms .
since ancient times , mankind has ho@@ tly debated whether mathematics was discovered or invented .
are numbers , poly@@ g@@ ons and equations truly real , or merely e@@ there@@ al representations of some theoretical ideal ?
they called the number one , " the mon@@ ad , " the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation .
but while our brain is busy dre@@ aming , it 's letting plenty of signals slip by .
first , li@@ ars reference themselves less , when making dec@@ ep@@ tive statements .
for example , a li@@ ar might say something like , " Sor@@ ry , my stupid phone battery died . I hate that thing . "
judgment and evaluation are complex things for our bra@@ ins to compu@@ te .
the statement is short and direct , calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life .
it 's like an underwater light show .

one ancient theory was an idea called vit@@ alism , which claimed that living things were unique because they were filled with a special substance , or energy , that was the essence of life .
though his experiments were dis@@ credited , much like the rest of vit@@ alism , traces of his theory still come up in popular culture .
and research into cry@@ onics hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people and revi@@ ving them later when newer technology is able to help them .
but when white cap@@ tains came offering manufactured goods , weapons , and r@@ um for slaves , African kings and merchants had little reason to hesitate .

but the chances of being right or left @@@ -@@ @ handed are determined by the han@@ de@@ dness of your parents in surprisingly consistent ratios .

han@@ de@@ dness seems to be determined by a roll of the dic@@ e , but the odds are set by your genes .

in these countries , it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation .
worse than that , countries like India , Russia , South Africa , Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and , in many cases , actually regres@@ sing .
without growth , countries contract and atro@@ phy , not just in the ann@@ als of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived .
economic growth matters power@@ fully for the individual .
there are some people here who will turn around and be quite di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sioned by what 's happened around the world and basically ascri@@ be that to economic growth .
and to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term , we 're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance .
when in practical experience , capitalism is much more of a spectrum .

he works for one of the largest companies in the world , and I 'm already trying to make him feel better .
so we had 50 phrases that we called the " diabetes words . "
and we did first a baseline .
he found several very important interactions , and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug @@@ -@@ @ drug interactions .
however , there 's a couple of things .
but we can 't have a system that closes that data off , because it is too rich of a source of inspiration , innovation and discovery for new things in medicine .
sustained abundance of good food enabled a healthier population to boom economically .
while B@@ MI can be a helpful estimate of healthy weight , actual body fat percentage can only really be determined by also considering information like wa@@ ist circum@@ ference and muscle mass .

now it 's time to free the rest of the world .
and in 17@@ 89 , that disruption came .
no@@ bles could no longer manipulate local units to extract more rent from comm@@ oners , while the government could collect taxes more efficiently .
I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word " writer . "
it is man@@ ning the troops . it is painting a canvas .
the h@@ um is God 's whis@@ per right in my ear .
I just know that I want to tell you I 'm a tit@@ an , and I know that I don 't want to question it .
inside me was silence .
I was the perfect tit@@ an .
now , I know somebody 's out there thinking , " C@@ ry me a river , stupid writer tit@@ an lady . "
when did that happen ?
there 's nothing special about it .
we play , and we 're joined by her sisters , and there 's a lot of laugh@@ ing , and I give a dramatic reading from the book Every@@ body Po@@ ops .
nothing out of the ordinary .
I feel it .
a h@@ um cre@@ eps back .
no magic . no secret . it 's just love .
I don 't like it .
I itch for my cell phone always .
you 're right , but you can still do this .
uninterrupted is the key .
give yourself the 15 minutes .
the very act of not working has made it possible for the h@@ um to return , as if the h@@ um 's engine could only refu@@ el while I was away .
I said yes to less work and more play .
to start with , how familiar are you with the person you 're talking to ?
even in English , some dialec@@ ts use words like " y '@@ all " or " y@@ ouse " the same way .
and a few languages even have a specific form for addressing exactly two people , like Slovenian " vid@@ va . "
but it 's also the rhetoric of activists urging change , such as Martin Lu@@ ther King J@@ r 's dream that his children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin , but by the content of their character .
so the trouble with gra@@ vit@@ ational waves is that they 're very weak ; they 're pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ously weak .

our job is to dream up and build new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories -- on the ground , in space .

and studies show that Americans say that most don 't know a Muslim .
I 'm a mom , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , cream on the side .
I 'm a w@@ ann@@ a@@ be fitness fan@@ atic .
that 's how it feels .
who would do this ?
that same day , we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school .
emotions were so raw , understand@@ ably , and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims , or people who were perceived to be Muslim , being pulled out and beaten in the street .
it 's the accusations that are tough .
when are we going to get rid of them ? "
( appl@@ ause ) Muslims are inven@@ tors and teachers , first respon@@ ders and Olympic athletes .
recently , a prominent im@@ am told me a story that really took me ab@@ ack .

did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home ?
so we decided to go to the mosque .
these people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice .
what will you choose ?
or will you join those who say we are better than that ?
it turns out that this is actually a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination inside your brain .
these ne@@ ur@@ ons en@@ code various characteristics of the object : sp@@ ik@@ y , fruit , brown , green , and yellow .
but this principle do@@ es@@ n 't explain the infinite number of objects that we can con@@ jure up in our imag@@ inations without ever seeing them .
the ne@@ ur@@ onal ensemble for a dol@@ ph@@ in balancing a p@@ ine@@ apple do@@ es@@ n 't exist .
if the ne@@ ur@@ onal ensem@@ bles for the dol@@ ph@@ in and p@@ ine@@ apple are activated at the same time , we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image .
if the ne@@ ur@@ onal ensem@@ bles are turned on at the same time , you experience the composite image just as if you 'd actually seen it .
this conscious purpos@@ eful synchronization of different ne@@ ur@@ onal ensem@@ bles by the pref@@ ron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x is called mental synthesis .
the problem is that some ne@@ ur@@ ons are much far@@ ther away from the pref@@ ron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x than others .
you can 't change the length of the connections , but your brain , especially as it develops in childhood , does have a way to change the conduc@@ tion velocity .

in 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Dra@@ per .
he said , well , why don 't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a j@@ it@@ ney -- that was s@@ lan@@ g for a nickel .
and within one year , by 1915 , there were 50,000 ri@@ des per day in Seattle , 4@@ 5,000 ri@@ des per day in Kansas and 150,000 ri@@ des per day in Los Angeles .
and so these are the trolley guys , the existing transportation monopoly at the time .
and there were all kinds of regulations .
in other cities , they required two j@@ it@@ ney drivers for one j@@ it@@ ney .
( la@@ ughter ) All right . so what happened ?
well , within a year this thing had taken off .
that 's unfortunate ...
we even have sky@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers built for cars .
now , cities have been dealing with this problem for decades .
well , it 's because mass transit h@@ as@@ n 't yet fig@@ ured out how to get to everybody 's door@@ step .
we saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place .
could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it ?
and so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago .
now , in China everything is super@@ sized , and so we 're doing 15 million u@@ ber@@ PO@@ OL trips per month , that 's 500,000 per day .
and when I talk to my team , we don 't talk about , " He@@ y , well , 100,000 people car@@ pooling every week and we 're done . "
how do we get that to a million ?
well , we have something for this that we recently launched called u@@ ber@@ COM@@ MU@@ TE .
how would our cities be different today ?
now , I 'm as excited as anybody else about self @@@ -@@ @ driving cars but do we have to really wait five , 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality ?

and so what we did was almost what I would call an im@@ mature version of a luxury brand that looked like a bad@@ ge on a luxury car .
ca : OK , that 's cool .
I mean -- who are you ?
it 's now in many cities , half the price of a taxi .
and so what that means is more trips per hour , more minutes of the hour where they 're productive and actually , earnings come up .
and we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down .
so I think there 's a lot of good .
but even though she has never seen color , Mary is an expert in color vision and knows everything ever discovered about its physics and biology .

working side by side with brilliant Zimbab@@ we@@ ans -- scientists , doctors , activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement , but to a global progressive public health movement .

in my@@ th@@ ological ancient Greece , so@@ aring above Crete on wings made from wa@@ x and fea@@ thers , I@@ car@@ us , the son of Da@@ ed@@ al@@ us , de@@ fied the laws of both man and nature .
to witnesses on the ground , he looked like a god , and as he pe@@ ered down from above , he felt like one , too .
preceded by his stor@@ ied reputation , Da@@ ed@@ al@@ us was welcomed with open arms by Crete 's King Min@@ os .
as he stra@@ pped the wings to his son I@@ car@@ us , he gave a warning : flying too near the ocean would dam@@ pen the wings and make them too heavy to use .
until then , chocolate only existed in Mes@@ o@@ amer@@ ica in a form quite different from what we know .
beyond dry@@ ness , tar@@ di@@ grades can also tolerate other extreme stresses : being frozen , heated up past the boiling point of water , high levels of radiation , and even the vacuum of outer space .
they live on every continent , including Antarctica .
in the process , tar@@ di@@ grades could even help us answer a critical question : could life survive on planets much less hosp@@ itable than our own ?
diet , too , is emerging as one of the leading influences on the health of our gu@@ ts .
dietary fiber from foods like fruits , vegetables , nuts , leg@@ um@@ es , and whole grains is the best fuel for gu@@ t bacteria .
lower fiber means less fuel for the gu@@ t bacteria , essentially star@@ ving them until they die off .
these foods contain poly@@ phen@@ ols , which are naturally occurring anti@@ oxid@@ ant compounds .
so lightly ste@@ amed , s@@ aut@@ Ã©@@ ed , or raw vegetables are typically more beneficial than fri@@ ed dishes .
there are also ways of preparing food that can actually introduce good bacteria , also known as pro@@ bio@@ tics , into your gu@@ t .
originally used as a way of preserving foods before the invention of refrigeration , fer@@ mentation remains a traditional practice all over the world .
y@@ og@@ urt is another fer@@ mented food that can introduce helpful bacteria into our gu@@ ts .
the lab is a four by four compound of 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner and an exit at the southeast .
pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself .
that 's a route that visits every point within it exactly once .
and one that starts on white will have to end on black .
that return trip gives you four options for a successful route , and a similar set of options if you destroyed this room first .
compare that with the tor@@ to@@ ise , which can age to more than 100 years .
the drivers behind this process are varied and complicated , but aging is ultimately caused by cell death and dysfunction .

now , that 's a natural social bias .
but what 's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix , in this case , with reviews .
now , things have been going pretty well .
now , we know design won 't solve all the world 's problems .

Mat@@ cha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged .
and in the 14th century during the M@@ ing Dy@@ nasty , the Chinese em@@ peror shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea .
this gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world .
that spread began in earnest around the early 16@@ 00@@ s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantities .
all were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits .
this triggered a public health problem within China as people became addic@@ ted to the drug .
the war weakened China 's global standing for over a century .
so they commissioned bo@@ tan@@ ist Robert For@@ tune to steal tea from China in a co@@ vert operation .
what do fans of atmospheric post @@@ -@@ @ pun@@ k music have in common with ancient bar@@ b@@ arians ?
not much .
but the Western Empire would never be united again .
this shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Ab@@ be@@ y of Saint Denis in France in 1@@ 137 .
with the Italian Renaissance 's renewed admiration for An@@ cient Greece and Rome , the more recent style began to seem crude and inferior in comparison .
but time mar@@ ched on , as did what was considered fashionable .
as far back as the 4th century B@@ CE , the An@@ cient Greeks treated lead to make the brilliant white pig@@ ment we know today .
in humans , lead is directly absorbed into the body and distributed to the blood , soft tissues , and min@@ er@@ alized tissues .
yet the practice of using this toxic pig@@ ment continued across time and cultures .
bed bugs were rum@@ ored not to live in green rooms , and it 's even been spec@@ ulated that Napol@@ eon died from slow arsen@@ ic poisoning from sleeping in his green wall@@ pap@@ ered bedroom .

I looked at the elder believers whose sa@@ vi@@ or had not come , who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment , who had believed too much and for too long to start doub@@ ting now .
I had believed .
now what ?
and now , where there was once a mountain of certi@@ tude , there was , running right down to its foundation , a spring of doubt , a spring that promised rivers .
and from that gra@@ ve@@ yard , I began the search once more , not because I was brave , but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die .
under a full @@@ -@@ @ size repl@@ ica of a wh@@ ale , I sat with the tit@@ ans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds .

economic growth is important , but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture or our pris@@ tine environment .
so today , the clean energy that we export off@@ sets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood .
that is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year .
a few years ago , a similar lake breached its dams and w@@ re@@ aked ha@@ vo@@ c in the val@@ leys below .

Christop@@ her 's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such , but I did@@ n 't think bran@@ ding him a fel@@ on for the rest of his life was the right answer .
we stick to an outdated method , counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want , and that 's safer communities .
they have little appreciation for what we can do .
the more contact Christop@@ her had with the criminal justice system , the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again -- all at tremendous social cost to his children , to his family and to his peers .
as an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late te@@ ens , I knew fir@@ s@@ th@@ and the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system .
you deserve it , your children deserve it , the people who are tied up in the system deserve it , but most of all , the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it .
which means that there are a lot of family events .
and then , when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table , it struck me , this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land , how does he climb a stair@@ case ?

that may be why people with a moderate amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence in their abilities .

you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't even know it was there , if not for the red lump that appears , accompanied by a tell@@ tale itch .
our bodies are te@@ em@@ ing with le@@ uk@@ ocy@@ tes : there are between 4,000 and 11,000 in every micro@@ lit@@ er of blood .
as soon as the le@@ uk@@ ocy@@ tes detect them , it takes only minutes for the body 's protective immune response to kick in .
first , ph@@ ag@@ ocy@@ tes trigger the immune response by sending macro@@ ph@@ ages and d@@ end@@ ri@@ tic cells into the blood .
that allows ph@@ ag@@ ocy@@ tes to identify the anti@@ gen on the inv@@ aders they just in@@ ge@@ sted and transmit this information to the second major cell group orchestr@@ ating the defense , the lym@@ ph@@ ocy@@ tes .
b @@@ -@@ @ cells can produce millions of these , which then cycle through the body and attack the inv@@ aders until the worst of the threat is neutr@@ alized .
that 's how you can develop immunity to certain diseases , like chick@@ en@@ po@@ x .
they supported me all the way through it .

if you 're a conservative , be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warri@@ or for the poor .
and this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders .

( la@@ ughter ) There is a difference .
( la@@ ughter ) And to the Mon@@ key , humans are just another animal species .
literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
these are people who were nurses , bankers , pa@@ inters , engineers and lots and lots of PhD students .
these people were writing with intense frustration about what proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this Mon@@ key had done to them .
and when there 's deadlines , the effects of proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ation are contained to the short term because the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster gets involved .
and it 's this long @@@ -@@ @ term kind of proc@@ ra@@ stin@@ ation that 's much less visible and much less talked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , short @@@ -@@ @ term deadline @@@ -@@ @ based kind .

this pre@@ m@@ ie@@ res in Monaco -- it 's in September 2009 . if by any chance you can 't make it , another idea with this project -- here 's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
this is by far the far@@ thest he 's stra@@ yed from Te@@ w@@ k@@ s@@ bury Hospital , I can tell you that , because he 's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music .
so , turned out he 's a fantastic composer , and over the last few years has been a constant collabor@@ ator of ours . he has made many , many pieces .
so , you want to say a little bit about how you guys work ?
but what about expression ? what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ? you know , do our technologies allow us to express ?
and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen .
so , in hearing this piece , as I mentioned before , the most important thing is the music 's great , and it 'll show you who Dan is .

well , I mean , maybe it is if you 're -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) If you want to sell your result then it 's a huge deal -- don 't get me wrong .
but if you 're interested in the technology and you 're interested in the project , the big part was getting the community .
then the community grew gradually .
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
L@@ t : so one of the issues we had , and this took a while to start to appear , is when you ...
there 's a lot of people who make small , small changes .
L@@ t : ye@@ ah , I think I was the proto@@ typical ner@@ d .
I was not a people person back then .
like , before I stepped into the room she would say , " OK . that 's so @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ so ... "
and that 's not the kind of person I am .
was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built ?
shall we say , " my@@ op@@ ic " when it comes to other people 's feelings , and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people .
I 'm not a people person ; it 's not something I 'm particularly proud of , but it 's part of me .
I can 't do U@@ I to save my life .
it 's this idea called taste .
and I 've just got a couple of images here .
what is the difference between these two ?
L@@ t : so this is -- How many people here actually have coded ?
but this is simple code .
good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinc@@ tively knowing what 's the right way to do things .
and I am not a vi@@ sionary .
and I think it 's really -- I mean -- I 'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just st@@ aring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying , " I want to go there . "
I mean , there are people who name their companies after him .
so , what do we do about it ?
it 's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it 's a radical departure from the status quo .
sadly , that 's what often happens .
so within less than three months of our team being on the ground , we were already able to push our first products to production .
this is on us , all of us , together , because government is not an abstract institution or a concept .
and so I decided to study computer programming in college .
as you can see , we can create any world that we want inside the computer .
but we are not be@@ hol@@ den to it .
this guy , WA@@ LL @@@ -@@ @ E , is a great example of that .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , gl@@ assy @@@ -@@ @ e@@ yed is a fundamentally aw@@ ful thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he 's capable of falling in love .
we tried turning them down , we tried blocking them , nothing was working .
now we recognize WA@@ LL @@@ -@@ @ E as having an eye .
maybe because unlike normal , we were basing it on something in real life , or maybe just because we had lost our way .
I came in one morning and checked the previous night 's work .
and then the production designer started cl@@ apping .
imagine -- the cell effectively sp@@ its out the drug .
si@@ R@@ NA are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene .
but if it gets exposed to the enzy@@ mes that reside in our blood@@ stream or our tissues , it degra@@ des within seconds .
first , let 's start with the nan@@ op@@ article core .
the two op@@ pos@@ itely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction , and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the si@@ R@@ NA from degrading in the blood@@ stream .
and guess what ? our nan@@ op@@ article is considered a foreign object .
second , this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell .
planets don 't get much bigger than J@@ up@@ iter .
this means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth .
this is truly remarkable .
and so what was happening had to be astro@@ physical , meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking star@@ light .
there are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky .
I want you to imagine that you get a text from a friend , and it reads , " You will not believe what just happened .
( la@@ ughter ) " People who walk too slowly . " that one 's mine .
we can feel angry at the same time that we 're sca@@ red or sad or feeling a host of other emotions .
the reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry , so there 's got to be something else going on .
there are all these written and un@@ written rules of the road , and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you , usually without consequence .
( la@@ ughter ) So you 're driving somewhere , thus te@@ ed up to be angry , and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit .
five minutes I 'll spend just because it 's interesting . just because it 's fun .
like Wikipedia , like the Open Directory Project , you 're beginning to build platforms , and you see that as a model .
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .
let 's call them On@@ co@@ Search .
every day was about creating something new .
we all know that exploration is risky .
small children , they explore all day .
for example , " How can I both effectively run and re@@ inv@@ ent my company ? "
we discover something , but we don 't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work .
so instead of staying with it , we create something new .
but the same goes for that , then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated .
and any company that 's able to inno@@ vate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future .
riding into Rome on the carriage , they always had a companion whis@@ pering in their ear , " Rem@@ ember , you 're only human . "
how about a few weeks ?
build space elev@@ ators , or impossible miles of transport belts that te@@ ther your planet of choice to our home planet ?
let 's say , hypo@@ the@@ tically , what if mar@@ tian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth @@@ -@@ @ derived nutrients ?
well , it turns out we 've already done things like this .
but then again , what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious ?
OK , so , confession : I 've always been we@@ ir@@ dly obs@@ essed with advertising .
but then , all of that suddenly changed on February 23 , 1997 , when my little brother Mat@@ t was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building .
and that comes down to finding common ground , where what I want overl@@ aps with what you want .
and you might be surprised to learn , when it comes to gun violence , just how much common ground there is .
and that 's exactly what 's happened here .
and a lot of those people are children .
enough .
and yes , Kim Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an has made an un@@ solicited passionate appeal to her 35 million Twitter followers for expanded background checks .
we 're mar@@ ching across the country , state by state , marriage @@@ -@@ @ equality style .
it 's estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion US dollars a year .
so you can freeze sperm , you can freeze eggs , you can freeze fertil@@ ized eggs .
there have been at least 33 versions of hom@@ ini@@ ds that have walked around this Earth .
some people will choose to alter all .
now , Min@@ es@@ we@@ eper is awesome , but it 's not the driver of the effect , because if you play the game first before you learn about the task , there 's no creativity boost .
they just manage it differently .
a lot of people think they will .
why do some of them get more pages in enc@@ ycl@@ op@@ edi@@ as than others and also have their compositions re@@ recorded more times ?
thank you .
think of the planet like a human body that we in@@ habit .
the sk@@ elet@@ on is the transportation system of roads and railways , bridges and tunnels , air and sea@@ ports that enable our mobility across the continents .
this continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nag@@ o@@ ya to O@@ sa@@ ka contains more than 80 million people and most of Japan 's economy .
but in China , meg@@ acity clusters are coming together with populations reaching 100 million people .
in the Middle East , Greater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran 's population .
and in the gul@@ f , a nec@@ kl@@ ace of city @@@ -@@ @ states is forming , from Bahrain and Qatar , through the United Arab Emirates to Mus@@ cat in Oman .
and yet , our global stock of financial assets has never been larger , approaching 300 trillion dollars .
now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies .
China and Japan have an even longer history of rival@@ ry and have been deploying their air forces and navi@@ es to show their strength in island disputes .
but first , a few fascinating facts about where we 're going .
the atmosphere on Mars is really thin -- 100 times th@@ inner than on Earth -- and it 's not breath@@ able , it 's 96 percent carbon dioxide .
it was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans , and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon .
so getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ...
maybe they can .
10 years ago , Sp@@ ace@@ X had not launched anything , or fired a rocket to anywhere .
private companies are le@@ ap@@ ing into space and they will be happy to take you to Mars .
and if you look at Mars , it looks really dry , it looks like the entire planet is a desert .
in fact , if only the water ice at the poles on Mars mel@@ ted , most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water .
next we have to worry about what we will breathe .
I love this thing .
it 's a reverse fuel cell , essentially , that suc@@ ks in the Mar@@ tian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen .
but the secret to this -- and that 's just for testing -- the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get @@@ -@@ @ go to be scal@@ able by a factor of 100 .
at first we can use infl@@ atable , pressuri@@ zed buildings as well as the landers themselves .
so we really have to go underground .
when that happened , people looked at each other and said , " If we can do this , we can do anything . "
and so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more .
we were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila .
we needed a sustainable movement , not one that is susceptible to the fluctu@@ ating mo@@ ods of a politician or the h@@ int of an economic downturn .
indeed , the powerful American politician Ti@@ p O '@@ Ne@@ ill once said , " All politics is local . "
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to ri@@ p off vulnerable investors .
and he 's one of my favor@@ ites , even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause .
and in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man 's impact on global warming .
so , why don 't we hear more about the world ?
far above the world , Planet Earth is blue and there 's nothing I can do . "
if I could find them , I could assemble them into a narrative .
men@@ str@@ uation .
I think you all must be aware of it , but I 'll still list it for the few who don 't .
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member 's bed .
he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon men@@ stru@@ ating girls and women by their own families and their society .
we are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries .
and then came the long ...
the continents dri@@ f@@ ted . the mammals rose .
and then , in East Africa , an un@@ promising species of ap@@ e evolved the odd trick of senti@@ ent thought .
thus , multi@@ t@@ ud@@ inous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of f@@ ossi@@ ls , each one a small miracle , but collectively , inevitable .
but over geological time , impro@@ b@@ able , nearly impossible events do occur .
along the path from our wor@@ my , Cam@@ bri@@ an ancestors to pri@@ mates dressed in suits , in@@ numer@@ able for@@ ks in the road led us to this very particular reality .
those two streams -- they look identical .
that 's not how to think of a TED Talk .
here 's Hal@@ ey .
ideas come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic .
Sir K@@ en Robinson -- creativity is key to our kids ' future .
( video ) Sir K@@ en Robinson : my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
CR@@ IS@@ PR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . "
if the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I 'm sorry to say , it 's probably not worth sharing .
most of us are like my mom .
they are not trusted .
and people are using them the same way that we do .
they 're tex@@ ting their friends , they 're looking up directions , they 're browsing the Internet and they 're even making financial transactions .
J@@ eni@@ ph@@ er answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device .
so for one , we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda .
we could also see that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day , she actually had pretty regular travel patterns , and she was either at home or at her food stall .
we could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network .
our job now is to open the world to J@@ eni@@ ph@@ er and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted .
but there is an art form that 's been around for a very long time that 's really about using information , abstract information , to make emo@@ tionally reson@@ ant pieces .
these things are systems that are designed to un@@ fold over time , to make us feel .
and what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema .
you can think of this as a quantified sel@@ fi@@ e .
sometimes you do this data and this work with real @@@ -@@ @ time data to illumin@@ ate a specific problem in a specific city .
there 's a wire going through to the trigger , and the computer in the box is online .
it 's listening to the 9@@ 11 feed of the New Orleans Police Department , so that anytime there 's a shooting reported in New Orleans , ( gun@@ shot sound ) the gun fires .
now , there 's a blank , so there 's no bullet .
when you do it right , it 's illuminating .
that 's 17,000 a day , and I have them all .
( la@@ ughter ) These are some of them with their eyes centered .
simply , I live in Gaza , there is no airport .
on some days , we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours .
we have par@@ k@@ our dancers who dance in the rub@@ ble of their homes .
I do have terrible night@@ ma@@ res because of all that I witnessed during war times , especially these lif@@ eless bodies of young children .
and the funny thing is they call me Mr. R@@ amb@@ o in Gaza .
( la@@ ughter ) I hope one day , I will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women , all other amazing women I know in my country .
and there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing -- uncontrolled money printing -- leading to hyper@@ inflation .
but here -- here 's the intri@@ gu@@ ing part .
and they remain unused today .
so here 's an idea .
what you end up with is a collective , global action aimed -- and it 's controlled global action -- aimed at a global good .
and , as we 've learned with the money @@@ -@@ @ printing schemes , whatever concerns we have can be al@@ la@@ yed by rules .
that 's important because it would all@@ ay well , let 's say , the ridic@@ ulous concerns that the US might have that the S@@ DR could ever challenge the dollar 's dominant role in international finance .
so what could we do with 300 other pay @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ performance climate projects like that , organized on a global scale ?
and those are the times they 're most productive .
it 's very well known . I 'm not going to spend a lot of time on those .
we currently have three locations in the Caribbean , and we 're planning a fourth one .
Africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to Africa .
what amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human ?
now , after 15 years -- 15 years after we read the first sequence -- this October , we started to see some signals .
we certainly don 't do it for predic@@ ting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood .
that 's a fr@@ actional precision of 0.@@ 0000@@ 0000@@ 4 .
objects of this size hit the Earth every 50 years or so .
I wrote a letter that started out , " De@@ ar Res@@ ear@@ cher . "
we met Ar@@ up@@ a and her staff , and Ar@@ up@@ a said that when I told her not to feel guilty , that it was a relief , and that she had@@ n 't seen it from our perspective .
( la@@ ughter ) But it 's not only about convenience .
thank you .
this was the golden age of piracy , where pirates like T@@ each were terror@@ izing the high seas .
but I picked design , because I believe it 's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life .
and that 's exactly what happened .
an under@@ graduate can do it .
so thank goodness , they can 't be used to engineer viruses or bacteria .
OK , so where does this leave us ?
so when you hear about gene drives in the coming months , and trust me , you will be hearing about them , remember that .
that would be a game @@@ -@@ @ changing technology , right ?
and to explain to you what is ne@@ ural en@@ train@@ ment , let me first explain what is physical en@@ train@@ ment .
so if we take J@@ im O '@@ Gra@@ dy and sc@@ ram@@ ble the words , we 'll get a list of words .
and right on ... pi@@ e man ... potentially ... my stories U@@ H : and you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas , but not more than that .
( audio ) J@@ O : and they recommend against crossing that line .
in this , I start to reveal the hidden ne@@ ural mechanism by which we communicate .
when I showed this work recently in Miami , a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul .
worldwide , over two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today .
I 'd say , " I don 't know ! "
in particular , textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school .
they 're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system .
and I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk is that there 's an impending cut @@@ -@@ @ out @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ middle @@@ -@@ @ man dis@@ inter@@ mediation , that 's going to be happening in the publishing industry .
that was an ess@@ ay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B + . ( la@@ ughter ) What I 'm going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create .
and it was@@ n 't bad , but it was@@ n 't really creative .
and they 're the same ones that I have today .
it was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . and she said , " Save a man from dro@@ w@@ ning , you are responsible to him for life . "
and what I need , in effect , is a focus .
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
do you see me up on the screen ?
audience : yes .
this is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read about relevant theory .
and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential .
if you did , could you please raise your hand ?
and today , I 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made .
but to begin , I 'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Mess@@ ina , who is my friend and an elementary school principal .
the call@@ er says , " Mr. Mess@@ ina , my son John@@ ny will not come to school today because he 's sick . "
we adults can easily detect their lies .
we have been playing gu@@ essing games with children all over the world .
and before we leave the room , we tell them not to pe@@ ek at the cards .
and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age .
as it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
are you ready ?
their performance is around chance .
can they detect children 's lies ?
what about , can parents detect their own children 's lies ?
let me illustrate this with my own son , Nathan .
so in the last five years , we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions .
the lights were too bright .
I kept having panic attacks , but they eventually went away .
they should be going in the same direction , but they 're going in different directions .
everyone understands the situation they 're all in .
race relations are terrible .
and I was working on an article for " For@@ bes , " entitled " W@@ ells Far@@ go and Mill@@ ennial W@@ hi@@ stle @@@ -@@ @ blowing .
and as I was working on this piece and reading about the case , I became outra@@ ged .
with that , I want to leave you with one additional name : Peter Bu@@ x@@ tu@@ n .
how many of us have ever used the term s@@ nit@@ ch , rat t@@ att@@ let@@ ale , sna@@ ke , we@@ as@@ el , leak ?
police and prison guards in Cambodia , for example , have been documented subjec@@ ting sex workers to what can only be described as torture : threats at gun@@ point , beatings , electric shocks , rape and denial of food .
but we 're also vulnerable if we choose to break the law by working together .
you 're working together , this place is illegal . "
can you afford to take the risk ?
and even if it 's possible in principle , getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money .
if prohibition is this harmful , you might ask , why it so popular ?
I don 't think this is an accident .
well , lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking .
the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections , allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest .
that 's true of prostitution , but it 's also true of agricultural work , hospitality work and domestic work .
there 's no call to ban rich people from hiring n@@ ann@@ ies or getting man@@ ic@@ ures , even though most of the people doing that labor are poor , migrant women .
if we get fix@@ ated on the abolition of sex work , we end up worrying more about a particular manifestation of gender inequality , rather than about the underlying causes .
here in the UK , I 'm part of sex worker @@@ -@@ @ led groups like the Sex Wor@@ ker Open University and the English Collective of Pro@@ stitu@@ tes .
but we need more allies .
this distinction between victim and empowered is imag@@ inary .
I 'm just one sex worker on the stage today , but I 'm bringing a message from all over the world .
in it , he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blue@@ prints of a nuclear bomb to Iran .
I 'll tell you .
I was a mis@@ fit .
they we@@ ren 't mainstream women writers , but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories , I like to think , kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon .
see , now most people , especially TED people , would have run to the mailbox , right ?
and I 'm a writer .
the modules can self @@@ -@@ @ assemble into a large 3@@ x@@ 3@@ x@@ 3 cu@@ be , with each individual module placed anywhere in the cu@@ be , and at any orientation .
you 've painted a total of 54 faces red at this point , so you 'll need the same number of faces for the green and purple cu@@ bes , too .
that 's 162 faces , which is precisely how many the cu@@ bes have in total .
it re@@ arran@@ ges itself to be red in deep space , purple as it enters R@@ H @@@ -@@ @ 17@@ 29 " s atmosphere , and green when it flies through the electric storms .
and let me show you what it is that he found .
that is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
he , like E@@ in@@ stein , was in search of what we call a unified theory .
so Kal@@ u@@ za said to himself , E@@ in@@ stein has been able to describe gravity in terms of war@@ ps and curves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more precise .
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it do@@ es@@ n 't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
( la@@ ughter ) But it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
in the remaining time , I 'd like to tell you two features of them .
first is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics , theoretical science .
and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tin@@ i@@ est of scales .
and just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
and we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
my process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change .
I draw with soft pa@@ st@@ el , which is dry like charcoal , but colors .
she and I were in the early stages of planning , as we had intended to go together , when she fell victim to a brain tumor .
so it 's no wonder that some men don 't want to be bo@@ thered and ski@@ p going to the doctor altogether , especially if they feel fine .
but for just a second , my eyes g@@ low white , and I hold this thing for I could speak to the good @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ nothing in a language he maybe understands .
( beat ) And the good @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ no@@ things become good @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ dis@@ appearing into whatever toxic waste , chemical sludge shi@@ th@@ ole they cra@@ w@@ led out of .
and he ain 't looking my way , but I hear him m@@ um@@ ble two words to me : " I 'm sorry . "
if you look up high enough , you could see me .
he dres@@ ses up in old sh@@ ining arm@@ or , moun@@ ts his sk@@ in@@ ny horse , and leaves his village in search of glory .
early on , Don Qu@@ ix@@ ote is joined by a vill@@ ager @@@ -@@ @ turned @@@ -@@ @ squ@@ ire named San@@ cho Pan@@ za .
and aston@@ ish@@ ingly enough , occasionally even people born without a lim@@ b can feel a ph@@ an@@ tom .
ne@@ ural pathways carry this sen@@ sory input through the spinal cord and up to the brain .
the patient places the ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ b into a box behind a mirror and the intact lim@@ b in front of the mirror .
and ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs may in turn help patients conceptu@@ alize pros@@ the@@ tics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intu@@ i@@ tively .
and on his left , my sisters : Mary Catherine , Jud@@ ith An@@ n , The@@ res@@ a Marie .
they 're afraid their baby will die .
how can that be ?
I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better .
they were so weak from the treatment I had given them .
but here 's the thing : we 're already doing this in a limited way , and it 's already starting to make a big difference .
what if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world ?
this is where we need to make our voices heard .
that 's when I heard , maybe not for the first time , " Sti@@ f@@ le yourself , Je@@ an@@ ette , I 'm going . "
and my mother was selling the furniture , because we were leaving -- she did@@ n 't want to stay in that state of shame , in Chel@@ sea , Massachusetts .
NL : benefit in that it gave me that spr@@ ing@@ board .
( la@@ ughter ) So ...
the first time I ran into an understanding that there were people in this world that h@@ ated me because I was born to Jewish parents .
and lots of little par@@ ades .
the truth was my grand@@ father took me to par@@ ades , we had lots of those .
the truth is he would write an occasional letter , and I did pick up those little envelop@@ es .
NL : an impact on him -- I was hes@@ itating over the word , " change . "
eh : I want to talk about -- NL : well , then do it .
NL : here 's where my mind goes when I hear that rec@@ itation of all I accomplished .
which we 're trying to save and it requires saving .
anything I may have accomplished is -- my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in New@@ ington , Connecticut .
how old do you feel ?
( appl@@ ause ) NL : we out of here ?
each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes .
I know it has for me .
I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air , and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day .
and I decided I wanted to see the historical Reg@@ ata , an event that 's actually been taking place since 14@@ 98 .
the fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs .
so this is the photograph I created of Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite .
this is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic .
and I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape .
the best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night .
you can see Michel@@ le waiting with the children , the president now gre@@ ets the crowd , he takes his oath , and now he 's speaking to the people .
( appl@@ ause ) I 've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work .
they would walk up , take a picture , and then walk away .
it keeps on occurring again and again , from many theories and many experiments , as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathemati@@ cians .
( Board sha@@ king ) This is a bit of a sport , because we need to resolve some traffic j@@ ams in there .
at that time , I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Prin@@ ce@@ ton -- for many years , the home of Albert E@@ in@@ stein and argu@@ ably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world .
and together with my former student and main collabor@@ ator Cl@@ Ã©@@ ment Mou@@ hot , in Paris at the time , we had been working for months and months on such a proof .
the world is filled with incredible objects and rich cultural heritage .
what might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage , the beautiful locations and the art in this world ?
but imagine this accessibility for a k@@ id in Bom@@ bay who 's studying architecture , who h@@ as@@ n 't had a chance to go to The Gu@@ g@@ gen@@ heim as yet .
Oh , perfect .
coming back to gold very quickly , I wanted to search for gold and see how the machine tag@@ ged all the gold .
Chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies .
as a Pi@@ g , I need to be careful with a S@@ na@@ ke .
but they just don 't make them like they used to -- which is another sign of the decline in America .
hungry , extreme poverty : these often seem like gig@@ antic , insur@@ moun@@ table problems , too big to solve .
and then at lun@@ ch@@ time , I watched with an increasingly sick feeling as the el@@ dest girl in the family cooked por@@ ri@@ dge as a substitute for lunch .
she has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hard@@ working person on the planet .

Paul 's daughter followed in his foot@@ steps , but with one difference : when she graduated five years ago , it was with a wh@@ op@@ ping debt .
but that 's where the rubber meets the road .
even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013 .
the worst of times can be the best of times , because certain tru@@ ths flash up in ways that you can 't ignore .
your debt f@@ atten@@ s the profit of the student loan industry .
with all that money to be made , are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising , in ba@@ it and switch ...
many years ago my teacher wrote , " When students are treated as consumers , they 're made prisoners of addiction and en@@ vy . "
just as consumers can be sold and res@@ old upgraded versions of an iPhone , so also people can be sold more and more education .
people can be up@@ sold on certif@@ ications and rec@@ erti@@ fications , master 's degrees , doctoral degrees .
so you can be the object of en@@ vy of others .
and it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt .
there is such a thing , by the way .
what if there was an app for that ?
who then , by the way , goes on and ear@@ ns more money .
we know about statistics , right ?
years ago they held a protest .
what if we could re@@ imagine ways to help make your medicine @@@ -@@ @ taking easier ?
and of course , we 're in the age of gen@@ om@@ ics .
so instead of taking six medications , for example , I could integrate them into one .
and when we hit print , you print your combination of medications that might be needed by you on any individual day .
I can now -- The automated process would rotate and cycle through , to make sure the micro@@ me@@ ds are loaded .
and this could evolve , I think , into an incredible way to improve adherence in medications across the globe .
how long is it until , say , that nursing @@@ -@@ @ home patient that you mentioned is able to print their pills in their home ?
these are@@ n 't going to evolve and start with printers on your bathroom counter .

Th@@ ich N@@ hat Han@@ h is an international spokesperson for mind@@ fulness meditation .
and it was the most amazing meeting .
and they sub@@ tract from those positive hours the amount of time people spent on the website , because that 's a cost to people 's lives .
now to do this you also need a new system , because you 're probably thinking , today 's Internet economy -- today 's economy in general -- is measured in time spent .
we solved it with organic , when we said we need to value things a different way .
we solved it with LE@@ ED Certification , where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustainability .
and what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that 's driven and run entirely on time spent , to world that 's driven by time well spent .
so she said to us , " Lo@@ ok , I 've been heading this department for the last two years .
and addressing these non @@@ -@@ @ obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
small things being done by NGOs , being done by foundations .
and hence , it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has .
I 'll give you an example .
how do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers ?
and what 's interesting is , it 's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions .
often with innovative techniques .
in the context of education , it 's very difficult to see results quickly .
but where are we now ?
similar to this early stage of this medium , in V@@ R , we also have to move past the spectac@@ le and into the stor@@ yt@@ elling .
composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you .
so I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see .
let 's hope it works .

now despite this history of distrust , I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research .
my vision is to make genetic research more native , to indi@@ gen@@ ize gen@@ ome sequ@@ encing technology .

as the leader of the NGO there , I spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities .
I saw the potential that it had for the issues I faced , so I decided to go back to school and get my master 's in social design .
this is an O@@ X@@ O potato pe@@ el@@ er .
so without even realizing it , my solution was to take the mu@@ ff@@ led sound I heard , that was the beat , and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read .
all this complexity , all the way to these wonderful things -- human bra@@ ins -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe .
one of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we 've discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
( la@@ ughter ) But what he meant was that what we 've done , really , is stamp collect there .
it 's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
I 'll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
so all the exquis@@ itely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be possible without an extra bit .
well , we had a long time to come up with good analog@@ ies .
H@@ ig@@ gs particles , if you will .
there 's another issue , which is that the forces in nature -- it 's quite beautiful , actually -- seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
but in the last few minutes , I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cos@@ m@@ ology .
and I 'd say that it deserves , in the spirit of W@@ ade Dav@@ is ' talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high An@@ des and the frozen north .
the story goes like this : we know that the universe began 13.@@ 7 billion years ago , in an immen@@ sely hot , dense state , much smaller than a single atom .
gravity separated away from the other forces .
it was big enough to be transparent to light , and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smo@@ ot described as looking at the face of God .
after about 400 million years , the first stars formed , and that hydrogen , that hel@@ ium , then began to cook into the heavier elements .
and built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .

the conscientious people achieve it through stic@@ king to deadlines , to per@@ sever@@ ing , as well as having some passion .
( la@@ ughter ) Those are the ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts .
let me deal in a bit more detail with ex@@ tro@@ version , because it 's consequential and it 's intri@@ gu@@ ing , and it helps us understand what I call our three nat@@ ures .
second , our soci@@ ogenic or second nature , which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives .
they all gather together .
it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation .
but it 's a mis@@ con@@ str@@ ual .
I should say , before getting to this , something about sexual intercourse , although I may not have time .
ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts , when they interact , want to have lots of social encounter punc@@ tu@@ ated by clos@@ eness .
they like to have a lot of eye contact , or mutual gaz@@ e .

Don 't follow me .
it reminds me that the world 's in flux , and we have to respond to those changes .
so these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs .
if hospitals are making people sic@@ ker , where are the architects and designers to help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal ?
I was there to design and build a new type of hospital with Dr. Far@@ mer and his team .
designing it is one thing ; getting it built , we learned , is quite another .
we worked with Bru@@ ce Niz@@ eye , a brilliant engineer , and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school .
and on this job site , 15 years after the Rwandan genocide , Bru@@ ce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds , and that half of them be women .
our two teams have worked together over the last year to design this memorial .
so let 's pre@@ tend that this is just a simple formula , x " x " w = y .
I 'm gl@@ os@@ sing over the very difficult part , of course , which is how on earth do we figure out the w , the brain that can do such a thing ?
and that zero -- let 's think about it as an error .
what if w = 1 ? the error is 4 .

hi . my name is Mar@@ wa , and I 'm an architect .
there were many reasons that had led to the war -- social , political and economic .
our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point .
yet , if you look at the structure by high @@@ -@@ @ resolution electr@@ on micro@@ sc@@ op@@ y , and you ask yourself , what is it made of , surprisingly , it 's made of sugar .
so scientists all over the world believe that nan@@ oc@@ ell@@ ul@@ ose is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry .
the reason : there is a lot of it .
so for everybody , it 's an environmental problem , and for us , it 's a gold mine .
we can do a lot of things with the material .
so this can be used for making amazing things , like super @@@ -@@ @ fabrics for industrial and medical applications .
( la@@ ughter ) Why ? because they are jum@@ py .
( la@@ ughter ) But now , it 's actually enough to catch one .
but sometimes they are too strong , and therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit their surrounding tissues .
the reason is that in nature , there is no one there that actually takes my head and scre@@ ws it onto my neck , or takes my skin and gl@@ ues it onto my body .
they develop into organs , and together bring life .
why coll@@ agen ?
also , the quality .
ye@@ ah , of course , I can take those bric@@ ks and build a new wall .
and many solar system bodies don 't have liquid water , and so we don 't look there .
Ven@@ us and Mars don 't have that .
atmosphere h@@ as@@ n 't been able to escape .
the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
we 're trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way .
but we 're working on it . how are we working on it ?
some of them are or@@ biting now , including the M@@ av@@ en spacecraft which is currently or@@ biting Mars , which I 'm involved with and which is led here , out of the University of Col@@ or@@ ado .
we have similar measurements from Ven@@ us and Earth .
once we have that answer , why should you care ?
we have the observations of those planets , but we just don 't know which ones are habit@@ able yet .
I 'm really glad we 're here .
I have a forest in the back@@ yard of my own house .
it attracts a lot of biodiversity .
( bird call ) I wake up to this every morning , like a Dis@@ ney prin@@ cess .
then we built up our cities on those forests , like SÃ£o Paulo , for@@ getting that we belong to nature as well , as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet .
nature , on the other hand , works in a totally opposite way .
and this was the first time I worked with nature , rather than against it .
we survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since Ali@@ a was six months old .

today , I have two senior women on my team , and I see making them successful as key to my own success .
my company , K@@ agg@@ le , operates on the cutting edge of machine learning .
we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia .
can you imagine how long it took ?
so , we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .
it 's a country of 45 million people . it 's an economy that 's emerging .
it 's beginning to grow tremend@@ ously .
they have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa .
we 're concentrating our attention on four locations .
so what about Mars ?
we now know more than a dozen of them .
so what are we going to do now -- now that we see the water ?
in its past it had perhaps two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of its northern hemisphere -- there was an ocean .
C@@ ass@@ ini was there since 2006 , and after a couple years looked back after it flew by En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us and surprised us all .
now , the only thing that we can think of that does that here on Earth as an analogy ...
another moon that we 're looking at is Titan .
now , let 's just take North America , for example , since that 's where we 're meeting .
every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there .
in a way , I feel like this is the choice that faces us .

but one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information .
that 's friction .

in a digital world , money can reach much far@@ ther and is much faster , but we 're at the mercy of these g@@ ate@@ keeper institutions .

so when I decided to create an art piece in Man@@ shi@@ yat N@@ aser , the neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt , I never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that I would ever live .

( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt .
the calligraphy , actually -- I used a white g@@ low @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ dark paint for the calligraphy so at the end of the project , we rented some black light projec@@ tors and lit up the whole neighborhood , surprising everybody around .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) The goal was to leave something to this community , but I feel that they are the ones who left something in our lives .
maybe some@@ day we could read out a memory .

we need to re@@ establish local involvement in our own forests .
( la@@ ughter ) It 's all I got . ( laugh@@ s ) So , in this subur@@ b , the po@@ o and the pe@@ e and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community .
this approach is called Integrated Water Management , or holistic or closed @@@ -@@ @ loop .
each one of us is po@@ oping and pe@@ eing something that could fertil@@ ize half or maybe all of our food , depending on our diet .
imagine how much energy we could save .
and get this : if we change our approach to sanitation , we can start to slow down climate change .
remember that carbon in the po@@ op ?
their wash water , their shower water , is going underground to a series of mul@@ ch basins , and then water@@ ing that or@@ ch@@ ard down@@ hill .
when they went to get this permitted , it was@@ n 't allowed in Oregon .
that was Rec@@ ode 's -- my organization 's -- first code @@@ -@@ @ change campaign .
well , their wash water is getting re@@ used to fl@@ ush toilets , cool mechanical systems , water the landscape .
this was the first permit of its kind in Oregon .
( la@@ ughter ) " Let 's do it . "
we now have sources of power like the sun that don 't vary with our ear@@ thly dra@@ mas .
we encourage our best and brigh@@ test to work on this issue -- better solar panels , better batteries , everything .
so let 's talk about where our drinking water is coming from , where our po@@ o and pe@@ e are actually going .
if you don 't know , find out .

in doing this , it will save lives .
in an uncertain global environment , commodity prices have fallen .
I never knew that the Brexit could happen and that it could be one of the things that would cause global uncertainty such as we have .
so now we 've got this situation , and I think it 's time to take stock and to say what were the things that the African countries did right ?
the other thing was that conflicts decreased .
we did@@ n 't create jobs for our youth .
youth unemployment on the continent is about 15 percent , and underemployment is a serious problem .
and I think we will need to get a handle on it , particularly how we educate girls .
we also need to be w@@ ary of new conflicts , new types of conflicts , such as we have with Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in my country , Nigeria , and with Al @@@ -@@ @ Shabaab in Kenya .
but that 's had consequences .

and it do@@ es@@ n 't mean we are perfect , and it do@@ es@@ n 't mean we don 't have contradictions .
it shaped the narrative , the narrative of a small country with big ideas , and it was very empowering to grow up with that narrative .
remember , this is the country where electricity comes from water in our rivers , heat from volcan@@ oes , wind turbines , solar panels , bi@@ ow@@ a@@ ste .
that 's what they tell you .
no , we made a very brave choice , and that choice made the whole difference .
we don 't want cities that are built for cars .
it cra@@ ves stories of success in dealing with complex issues , especially in developing countries .
how do we get people to own this ?
these people disagree on almost everything except on renewable energy and clean transportation and clean air .

in the world of scale custom@@ ization , consumer proximity is the new norm .
I 'd also like to talk to you about pal@@ li@@ ative medicine : a paradigm of care for this population , grounded in what they value .

we don 't have backup ; we don 't have all the natural gas .
and while nuclear kind of edges out coal , the thing is , people don 't really fear coal in the same way they fear nuclear , which really operates on our un@@ conscious .
and the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel , there 's always going to be some fuel left over .
so these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kid@@ neys can be removed and trans@@ planted into a very ill stranger that they 've never met and may never meet .
in a 2011 report from the Institute for Women 's Policy Research , the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent .
so you don 't have to make signs for all of your employees to wear around the office .
when I opened Mo@@ t@@ t Hall Brid@@ ges Academy in 2010 , my goal was simple : open a school to close a prison .

when politics becomes just a presidential election , we y@@ ell and we scream at our screens , and then we collapse , exhausted .
voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had .
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined , and can be re@@ imagined .
but I turned to my a@@ unt when I got that letter and said , " You know , I think this just means that for the first time in my life , being poor has paid really well . "
this trauma , this chaos in the home , is our culture 's very worst gift to our children , and it 's a gift that keeps on giving .
things turned up for me .
well , one thing that happened is that my grand@@ parents , the same grand@@ parents of setting someone on fire f@@ ame , they really shaped up by the time I came around .
but she was also this incredibly percep@@ tive woman , despite not even having a middle school education .
it can 't be traced to any one moment .
and when they 're transmitted through the water , unlike the first two modes of transmission , these path@@ ogens don 't rely on a healthy host for transmission .
and the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it 's so harmful .
but there 's another really interesting aspect of this , and this is that if you could control the evolution of vi@@ rul@@ ence , evolution of harm@@ fulness , then you should be able to control antibio@@ tic resistance .
if you 've got a harmful organism , a high proportion of the people are going to be symp@@ tom@@ atic , a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics .
but that 's when you should be fav@@ oring evolution towards mil@@ dness .
but as I said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire , and I 've been able to watch who 's naturally drawn to whom .
but technology is producing one modern trend that I find particularly important .
today 's singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed .
but one of the questions was , " W@@ ould you re @@@ -@@ @ marry the person you 're currently married to ? "
in fact , the greatest change in modern rom@@ ance and family life is not technology .
we are right now in a marriage revolution .
I 'm not a Pol@@ ly@@ anna ; there 's a great deal to cry about .

( appl@@ ause ) Kel@@ ly St@@ o@@ et@@ z@@ el : thank you so much for that , Hel@@ en .
( appl@@ ause ) So Es@@ ther , when you were watching Hel@@ en 's talk , was there any part of it that reson@@ ated with you through the lens of your own work that you 'd like to comment on ?
so we 've created what I call this thing of " stable ambiguity . "
and then comes gh@@ osting .
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h ?
and that temper@@ ament is certainly going to change with changing times and changing beliefs .
and in terms of the parad@@ ox of choice , there 's no question about it that this is a pic@@ kle .
finally , we don 't stand on a peak of intelligence , or anywhere near it , likely .
we would feel a little more urgency than we do .
another reason we 're told not to worry is that these machines can 't help but share our values because they will be literally extensions of ourselves .
I think we need something like a Manhattan Project on the topic of artificial intelligence .
now would be a good time to make sure it 's a god we can live with .
going blind cast them into focus .
well , that 's what I thought .
it was difficult and exhaus@@ ting to see .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is master@@ fully constructed by our brain .
I knew it .
what kind of specific challenges do you have , and how do you overcome them ?
last I heard , there are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English .

suddenly these characters that you 've fallen in love with become hus@@ ks of themselves , they 're shad@@ ows of themselves .

I take some " Dil@@ bert " in various languages every single morning ; it can increase your skills .

I was born in India , the world 's largest democracy , and when I was four , my family moved to Belize , the world 's smallest democracy perhaps .
five months after that election , the newly elected mayor appointed me the first Commissioner of Im@@ migrant Affairs for this newly established office .
and most of us , when we see someone in uniform going through our neighbor@@ hoods feel curi@@ osity , if not concern .
we have fought to be here .
it 's our country , too .
it was April , last year .
we live in an incredibly interconnected world with the proliferation of social media , which is of course a fantastic resource for ign@@ iting social change .
and just like we got back on our tubes , we can 't let our platforms for inter@@ connectivity and community be the places that we settle for defeat .
it was calling them out on the effect they had caused .
everywhere , " People wish to be settled , " R@@ al@@ ph Wal@@ do Emer@@ son reminded us , " but only insofar as we are un@@ settled is there any hope for us . "
but at some point , knowledge gives out .
" when are we ever going to get world peace ? "
we 're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer .
so this is a PE@@ T / CT scan , and what you 'll see in this PE@@ T / CT scan is the CT scan will show you where the bones are , and the PE@@ T scan will show you where tum@@ ors are .
that 's because the bl@@ ad@@ der is the thing that 's clearing the sugar away from our body .
so as mirac@@ ulous as this might seem , unfortunately , well , it 's not that great .
so I 'm going to show you an example now .
and so this tumor is now growing in this mouse 's brain , and then we 've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient , and take out piece by piece out of the tumor .
and I think where medical imaging is heading to is the ability to look into the human body and actually see each and every one of these cells separately .
but at least I am hopeful that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques in the way that is not blind .
if I owned the Internet , N@@ ap@@ ster , Mon@@ ster and Friend@@ ster@@ .com would be one big website .

I have no idea how computer @@@ -@@ @ oriented or three @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sionally @@@ -@@ @ oriented you are , but let 's try something .

these are important and they can be energ@@ izing to leaders , but they tend not to be very moti@@ vating to most people in the organization .

to put that in context , that 's more passengers than the Euro@@ star or J@@ et@@ Blue airlines carry .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I 'll do it with you .
trust became institutional and commission @@@ -@@ @ based .
so that could be a property title .
so as we began to build these types of systems , we began to test them on ourselves in our research group .
what that means is , we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data .
but somewhere along the line I 'd learned about nuclear weapons , and I 'd gotten really concerned with the ethics of science .
we have no such anch@@ ors and benchmarks for decisions in mess@@ y human affairs .
it 's just that the algorithm was@@ n 't showing it to me .
it was a great player .
I began to dare to face the truth , to think , to face the hard questions .
I got in touch with my soul .
when we ignore the realities , we discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection .
and we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cher@@ ish even for a single moment in their lives .
thank you .
three years down the line , we simply must admit we 're seeing limited action to really , really address this as an inclusive , collective , universal package .
nobody has ever tried to really analy@@ tically combine the Sustainable Development Goals with planetary boundaries .
now , how do we do this ?
there was a day , about 10 years ago , when I asked a friend to hold a baby din@@ os@@ au@@ r robot up@@ side down .
it was this to@@ y called a Ple@@ o that I had ordered , and I was really excited about it because I 've always loved robots .
and this one has really cool technical features .
( la@@ ughter ) And we can design robots specifically to ev@@ oke this response , using eyes and faces or movements that people automatically , sub@@ consciously associate with states of mind .
when we behave viol@@ ently towards robots , specifically robots that are designed to m@@ im@@ ic life , is that a healthy outlet for violent behavior or is that training our cruelty muscles ?
and so they wondered if there was anything I could do .
as long as these pre@@ dat@@ or @@@ -@@ @ free circumstances last , the birds thrive , but they are vulnerable to changes in their environment .
for instance , human settlers bring dogs , cats , and st@@ ow@@ away rod@@ ents to islands .
so the stri@@ at@@ um detec@@ ts emotional and sen@@ sory motor conditions and it knows to trigger whatever behavior you have done most often in the past under those same conditions .
so I was really excited when my m@@ ice developed this compul@@ sive behavior , where they were rub@@ bing their faces and they cou@@ ld@@ n 't seem to stop , even when they were wounding themselves .
there are naturally occurring opi@@ oids in your brain that are deeply linked to social processes .
social media do@@ es@@ n 't so much encourage us to share , as it does to compare .
so that 's not quite right either , because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use , which was the word " mu@@ ra@@ q@@ ib " which means " a controller . "
" yes , we understand the definition .
others project an energy that they can hardly contain , like New York or Hong Kong .
so , what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us ?
no , they 're shared .
what if in this train you did@@ n 't have to stop ?
in this train , wagons can det@@ ach dynamically while you 're moving and become express , dri@@ ver@@ less buses that move on a secondary road network .
they 're trying to learn traffic rules , which is relatively simple , and coping with human un@@ predictability , which is more challenging .
so instead of rigid traffic rules , flow will be regulated by a m@@ esh of dynamic and constantly self @@@ -@@ @ improving algorithms .
( la@@ ughter ) And after 10 years of this , my wife said , " You 've got to do this thing you 've been talking about , and build the ven@@ ding machine . "
but the story of the ven@@ ding machine is a little more interesting if you know more about cro@@ ws .
basically , what happens is that we put this out in a field or some@@ place where there 's lots of cro@@ ws .
well , it depends how it 's used in each film .
Ac@@ ous@@ matic sounds -- well , the term " ac@@ ous@@ matic " comes from Py@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as in ancient Greece , who used to teach behind a ve@@ il or cur@@ tain for years , not revealing himself to his disciples .
so thanks for listening .
I was determined not to be excluded from the performance , so I turned to my mother and loud enough for everyone to hear said , " M@@ om , I don 't need a tu@@ tu .

I mean one of the boys has a bottle of liqu@@ or in his hand , he 's 14 years old and it 's a school day .
four in the morning on a school day , we 'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van , and the bottles would break .
how about this ?
" He@@ y , I 'm here for you whenever you 're ready . "
he told us his story .
we refined his story to go from being the story of a victim to being the story of a survi@@ vor that has overcome ad@@ versity .
we placed high value on it .
wealth was never the primary ambition in our house .
all of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wrec@@ k that I was saved from through a bus ride .
and then I want to talk about what we think right here in the United States and in New York .
so what happens going forward ?
look , there are three reasons why the Middle East has had stability such as it is . right ?
no , the Kurds will do better , and Iraq , Israel , Iran over time .
OK , how about this guy ?
let 's turn to Europe .
you see Brexit and you see the concerns of popul@@ ism across all of the European states .
but the periphery , countries like Greece and Turkey and others , will not look that good at all .
those countries can fall off the map .
well , I want our organizations to remain human .
you might not always realize it , but when you cut the unnecessary , you cut everything .
the risk to be ug@@ ly .
they put them on boards , moved them all into one room , which they called " the ug@@ ly room . "
but we 've all been ug@@ ly once .
it 's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens .
and I can actually recommend this book , it 's a very nice book .
it has to be like this . this is a beautiful pattern .
OK , so why am I doing all this ?
this is a square pyramid .
I 'm telling one story in different ways .
( appl@@ ause ) P@@ at M@@ itch@@ ell : I 'm not letting you go yet .
you made a reference to it earlier . I 'd love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill .

I receive this kind of treatment all the time . "
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
( la@@ ughter ) And what 's more interesting are people 's comments .
and having a low floor also means that we 're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project .
but things have changed .
why is that ?
it 's just that the probability of en@@ countering them compared to combat is astronom@@ ically lower .
and when I spoke with him a year after treatment had finished , he told me , " Do@@ c , this is the first time in 43 years that I haven 't had night@@ ma@@ res . "
J@@ H : that 's right .
but I think this is the thing , especially in Europe and for us , too , we need to be looking at .
we 're really , really good at justifying ourselves .
economists have been exploring people 's behavior for hundreds of years : how we make decisions , how we act individually and in groups , how we exchange value .
we had some informal constraints in place , but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions .
it would rule out the rival theories , but not rule out yours .
indeed , Thomas E@@ dis@@ on fam@@ ously said , " I have not failed , I have found 10,000 ways that won 't work . "
read and listen to people you flag@@ ran@@ tly disagree with .
as Ari@@ sto@@ tle said , " The mark of an educated man is the ability to enter@@ tain a thought without necessarily accepting it . "
some banks suffered from group@@ think , where staff were too afraid to challenge management 's lending decisions , contributing to the financial crisis .
but the simplest thing CA@@ N@@ NOT be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already . "
but what they 're also telling me is that they have fears .
if you look at these crises , you realize that they 're urgent and they need to be addressed now .
it 's a tragedy .
every seven minutes , an adolescent boy or girl somewhere in the world is killed by an act of violence .
and sadly , they 're right , too .
six hundred and fifty million .
and maybe you 've never faced violence , or prejudice , or discrimination .
young people themselves have named it .
so with G@@ en @@@ -@@ @ U , they 're going to be in the driver 's seat , steering us all along the way .

in the US , we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient , 250 dollars per MS patient and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient .

and slowly I added five percent here , five percent there , until eventually , on a good day , I was able to leave my home .
I still don 't know if I will ever be able to run again , or walk at any distance , or do any of those k@@ ine@@ tic things that I now only get to do in my dreams .
I think things like , " Oh ! I know -- I must clean the floor .
( la@@ ughter ) So then I had my new idea : why not engage people like me in sport ?
and anyway , I already had a go at changing the world .
here is a picture of me aged four .
by the time they were born , I was already hosting my own shows and working in the public eye .
I don 't think secrets are a good thing .
everybody warned me that I would never work again , but I decided it was absolutely worth the risk .
and in 2014 , on the day that the law was changed , I married my wife , who I love very much , indeed .

the unfortunate thing is that now , as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield , the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear .
it can run on natural gas as a result of the inventions of frac@@ king and sh@@ ale gas , which we have here .
but the impact of all that wealth allowed people to get m@@ assi@@ vely better nutrition .
it allowed water pipes to be placed .
and that 's going to happen unless they have a better alternative .
it had to be first of all viable , meaning that technically , they could implement it in their country , and that it would be accepted by the people in the country .
if you look at the Ch@@ indi@@ a test , we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test .
that 's what the EIA forecast tells us .

if you look at all the alternatives that are out there , there are really two that come near to meeting it .

some activists also like Dor@@ it@@ os , but they definitely want money .
long , drawn @@@ -@@ @ out law@@ suits , public s@@ me@@ ar campaigns -- there is no need for that .
but I must say , there 's a small handful of activists , very small , that go to great lengths to be constructive and collaborative .
and overall , we have to give credit where credit is due .
as a group , they have managed to cataly@@ ze large @@@ -@@ @ scale change in large corporations , and that 's no small fe@@ at .

and herein lies the challenge .
conscious investors care about ES@@ G issues .
and they talk a lot about engaging management on ES@@ G issues .
Argentina owed Paul 600 million dollars and would not pay .
you can 't take money from an O@@ G and not pay it back .

and so my journey as a trans person is about re@@ imag@@ ining mas@@ cul@@ inity .
in the summer of 2001 , we connected with Ca@@ thy Wo@@ ol@@ ard , who was soon elected city council president .
and we built a c@@ ity@@ wide vision around this idea : the Atlanta Bel@@ t@@ Line , a 22 @@@ -@@ @ mile loop of transit and trails and transformation .
I was doing two and three meetings a week for two and a half years , and so was Ca@@ thy and her staff and a handful of volunteers .
and we got all the highways and strip m@@ alls and cu@@ l @@@ -@@ @ de @@@ -@@ @ sac@@ s we wanted .
the Federal Highway Administration , for example , did@@ n 't exist before there were highways .
we 're taking places like this and transforming them into this .
good for us !
if we care , we have to stand up and speak out .
this is hard , and it won 't happen on its own .
we can 't call it a success without them .
these places are@@ n 't inevitable .

so sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time .
and she said , " Why don 't we just stand here and compli@@ ment each other ?

but also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth , and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact .
and what I 'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points .
I 'm going to make it right now in case I forget .
I have a characterization .
this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water .
and as I will point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea .
running along this entire 4@@ 2,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcan@@ oes .
but the only logical [ explanation ] was that there were hot springs .
we 're making huge discoveries of large commercial @@@ -@@ @ grade ore along this mountain range , but it was d@@ war@@ fed by what we discovered .
we 've been discovering these along ancient trade routes , where they 're not supposed to be .
this ship@@ wrec@@ k s@@ ank 100 years before the birth of Christ .
more recently , into the Black Sea , where we 're exploring .
all their organ@@ ics are perfectly preserved . we begin to excav@@ ate them .
so , we 're going to run it like an emergency hospital .
a discovery is made , that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later .
she 's talking to the pilot . she 's 5,000 miles away , but she 's assumed command .
watching exploration live from thousands of miles away , and it 's just da@@ w@@ ning on her what she 's seeing .
everyone in this room is a former baby -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) with a distinctive birth@@ right .
two : when things get difficult or painful , try to stay open .
two years ago , my younger sister came out of re@@ mission from a rare blood cancer , and the only treatment left for her was a bone mar@@ row trans@@ plant .
to wo@@ o my skep@@ tical sister , I turned to my parents ' holy text : the New Yor@@ ker Magazine .
and that illustrates my research approach .
one couple explained their in@@ semination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet in@@ semin@@ ate cows .
it was about how special and how deeply loved their child was .
it 's what they do at that age .
let me explain what I mean like this .
of course there is a bright spot to this story .
so my friend Mel@@ iss@@ a and I sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues .
they were cy@@ n@@ ics and seekers , a@@ the@@ ists and rab@@ bis .
psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what 's broken in our world , the less likely we are to do anything .
because we know that social change only happens -- ( Appl@@ ause ) when we are awa@@ ke enough to see that the house is on fire .
the fourth and final is inter@@ connec@@ tedness .
now , very importantly , all the new thinking that out@@ li@@ ers and exceptions lead us to in medicine does not only apply to the out@@ li@@ ers and exceptions .
we learned about it when doctors Li and Fra@@ u@@ meni were looking at families , and they realized that these families had way too many sar@@ com@@ as .
you 're not talking about mo@@ ons floating around some planet J@@ up@@ iter .
silence can also be rather uncomfortable .
what are the un@@ know@@ ns ?
she came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes .
he said , " I got it all and you 're good to go . "
I said , " Why , you know the right thing to do as well as I do .
what will they tell you ?
we already have AI , and often it works in the background , in the back offices of hospitals , where it 's used to diag@@ nose X @@@ -@@ @ rays better than a human doctor .
it 's in legal offices , where it 's used to go through legal evidence better than a human par@@ al@@ aw@@ yer .
it 's used to fly the plane that you came here with .
but it 's more than that .
that 's artificial s@@ mar@@ tness .
so let me talk about those three different aspects .
we tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension , that it 's kind of like a note that gets lou@@ der and lou@@ der .
and this single I@@ Q intelligence is getting greater and greater .
so your calculator is s@@ mar@@ ter than you are in arithmetic already ; your GPS is s@@ mar@@ ter than you are in spatial navigation ; Google , B@@ ing , are s@@ mar@@ ter than you are in long @@@ -@@ @ term memory .
( la@@ ughter ) Just driving , OK ?
and we actually might even come to advertise these as " consciousness @@@ -@@ @ free . "
we 're going to pop@@ ulate the space of all the different possible types , or species , of thinking .
we may need a two @@@ -@@ @ step program , which is to inv@@ ent new kinds of thinking that we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems , say , like dark energy or quantum gravity .
it 's like a new commodity ; it 's a new utility .
and by the way -- right now , this minute , you can log on to Google and you can purchase AI for six cents , 100 hits .
science is inherently inefficient .
innovation by definition is inefficient , because you make proto@@ types , because you try stuff that fails , that do@@ es@@ n 't work .
so , the future : where does that take us ?
if you 've ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a h@@ ug@@ ely damaging , frigh@@ tening , s@@ op@@ ping m@@ ess .
winds up taking seven hours of her week .
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement , she found seven hours .
and rather than say , " I don 't have time to do x , y or z , " she 'd say , " I don 't do x , y or z because it 's not a priority . "
if you think about it , that 's really more accurate language .
( la@@ ughter ) B@@ it of a w@@ ret@@ ched genre of literature , really , going on about how amazing everyone in the household is , or even more sc@@ in@@ till@@ ating , how busy everyone in the household is .
first , you can read some other family hi@@ stories , get a sense for the style .
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ four times seven is 168 hours .
and some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred creative gen@@ ius .
another medical report describes them as being " in@@ appropriately happy . "
they were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug that they actually just listed it as a side effect , an adverse side effect .
and mental set is another thing . right ?
but it does make you wonder what else we 've missed .
and in science , we try and remove our bias , right , by running double @@@ -@@ @ blin@@ ded experiments or being statistically ag@@ nos@@ tic as to what our results will be .
and then we ran it again in a PT@@ SD model , and we ran it again in a physiological model , where all we did was give stress hormones .
and in depression and PT@@ SD -- here we have your stress exposure -- we only have pal@@ li@@ ative care .
anti@@ de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants only suppress symptoms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the length of your own life .
we tried Pro@@ z@@ ac as well , and that had no effect .
if we had discovered ket@@ am@@ ine as a par@@ av@@ acc@@ ine first , it 'd be pretty easy for us to develop it , but as is , we have to compete with our functional fix@@ ed@@ ness and mental set that kind of interfere .
in one case , one of the bombs , which fell out of an Air Force plane , did@@ n 't deton@@ ate because the nuclear core was stored somewhere else on the plane .
it would take a ren@@ a@@ issance of sorts , the kinds of innovation that , for better or worse , underpinned both the Manhattan Project , which gave rise to nuclear weapons , and the Meg@@ at@@ ons to Meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts program .
now , 20@@ 45 happens to be the 100th anniversary of the birth of nuclear weapons in the New Mexico desert .
but it 's also an important date for another reason .
have inspired a generation of inno@@ v@@ ators .
now , every day , I get to meet people who are real pione@@ ers in the field of nuclear threats .
surely , a century of economic development and the development of military strategy will have given us better ways to manage global conflict .
so now , as I 've been telling you this imagined 2030 story , I have a feeling that I may have put some of you into this sc@@ i @@@ -@@ @ fi frame of reference . right ?
I 'm a stem cell and gene@@ tics researcher and I can see this new CR@@ IS@@ PR technology and its potential impact .
and we may find ourselves in that reality , and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today .
and I think some people are going to run with this technology and try to make designer babies .
now , before I go on , some of you may hold up your hands and say , " Stop , Paul , wait a minute .
it 's really that simple .
I also think it 's not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification .
the engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more fav@@ ors than they got back .
Adam said , " You don 't have to be Mother Te@@ res@@ a or G@@ and@@ hi to be a gi@@ ver .
that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other .
the other combination we forget about is the deadly one -- the agre@@ eable tak@@ er , also known as the f@@ aker .
now , an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up .
sometimes you might put a B@@ and @@@ -@@ @ Aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain .
in 2014 when he came , Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries .
my colleagues and I held our breath and bit our finger@@ nails , and then finally we saw the first pro@@ ton colli@@ sions at this highest energy ever .
what if the stuff that 's bo@@ thered me since I was a little k@@ id is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime ?
I don 't have the answers , and I 'm still searching for them .
which would not be the end of physics , but a novel beginning .
Assembly lines were engineered to replace inconsistent human han@@ di@@ work with machine perfection .
we no longer di@@ g d@@ it@@ ches by hand , pound tools out of w@@ rought iron or do book@@ keeping using actual books .
but those tell@@ ers were doing somewhat different work .
( la@@ ughter ) Here 's the broader point .
the same principle applies if we 're building a building , if we 're diagnos@@ ing and caring for a patient , or if we are teaching a class to a ro@@ om@@ ful of high school@@ ers .
does that mean there 's nothing to worry about ?
Norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility .
the challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs , and many citizens CA@@ N@@ NOT qualify for the good jobs that are being created .
but it is feasible .
right ? is this time different ?
I don 't have the gu@@ ts to take that bet against human ing@@ en@@ uity .
the atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that 's seen here from the International Space Station , a photograph that some astr@@ onau@@ ts took .
and it 's such an amazing phenomenon that the fact that it 's dis@@ appearing should frigh@@ ten you , at least a little bit .
so atmospheric escape is not specific to planet Earth .
it 's part of what it means to be a planet , if you ask me , because planets , not just here on Earth but throughout the universe , can undergo atmospheric escape .
and because there 's all this lightweight gas that 's ready to escape , and all this heating from the star , you have completely catastrophic rates of atmospheric escape .
how can we speak up in a society that too often dis@@ credits or dimin@@ ishes our experiences ?
assume that you 're going to forget .
assume you have to write it down .
you don 't have to talk to a person , there 's no fear of judgment , and you can do it whenever and wherever you need .
we refuse to even acknowledge that women who have sex with women or women who don 't want children even exist .
Cher@@ yl responded , " Well , first , I don 't know what quin@@ oa is . "
( la@@ ughter ) " But I do know that it 's a Monday , and that in my school , at High School in the Community , I always cook pa@@ sta . "
Cher@@ yl talked about how , by the time Monday came , her kids ' hunger pan@@ gs were so intense that they cou@@ ld@@ n 't even begin to think about learning .
food was the only thing on their mind .
well , because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school .
those are pretty good escap@@ es from the dra@@ b weather in Switzerland .
and then finally , the leaf lamp for Her@@ man Miller .
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
these are the dispens@@ ers . there 's this friendly shape .
but what if he worked in the opposite direction ?
and we just don 't have the tools that are small enough to work with them .
we don 't have any disease @@@ -@@ @ fighting nano@@ bo@@ ts , there 's no elev@@ ators to space , and the thing that I 'm most interested in , no new types of computing .
now that last one , that 's a really important one .
and this pace exists because of our ability to pack more and more devices onto a computer chip .
it 's expon@@ ential .
when Fre@@ do betra@@ ys his brother Michael , we all know what needs to be done .
we just said , " What 's the Fre@@ do in our problem ? "
you can go to the beach , you 'll find these simple organisms that use proteins -- basically molecules -- to template what is essentially sand , just pl@@ uc@@ king it from the sea and building these extraordinary architec@@ tures with extreme diversity .
they 're out there forever , and anyone anywhere can pick them up and use them , and help to deliver on the promise of nano@@ technology .
" got me looking , got me looking so crazy in love -- " ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) from the great phil@@ os@@ op@@ her , Bey@@ onc@@ Ã© Know@@ les .
I had no gu@@ idebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
( la@@ ughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love .
and love involves both joy and pain .
I understand that 16th @@@ -@@ @ century Ver@@ ona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Jul@@ ie@@ t 's suffering made sense to me .
I can 't spend the rest of my life being sca@@ red and hiding and that I 'm actually going to have to do something .
she tried to do everything right .
she married some guy that her parents chose for her , even though he beat and raped her constantly .
the same men , or similar men , to the ones that have h@@ ounded me for most of my life .
in fact , I found something , to my horror , that I recognized .
can you understand why they 're so angry and alien@@ ated when you put your honor before their happiness ?
how can we support them in re@@ directing their pain into something more constructive ?
but this is not a self @@@ -@@ @ ag@@ gran@@ di@@ zing enterprise , because in this type of discovery research , if you don 't feel like a complete idi@@ ot most of the time , you 're just not sci@@ encing hard enough .
we Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry .
we , like all other species on this planet , are inextricably wo@@ ven into the history of life on this planet .
well , I first learned to program back in 1966 , when I was 15 -- just a couple months after this photo was taken .
it had to be something the computer knew what to put in .
pretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values you 'd never remember on the screen where things were .
then when you pointed to a cell , the computer could put the row and column in as a name .
Bob worked in the at@@ tic of the apartment he rented in Ar@@ l@@ ington , Massachusetts .
print was@@ n 't working yet , so I had to copy everything down .
and so they make him say sorry .
" if you can 't handle the Internet , f@@ uck off , wh@@ ore . "
I was married to a Sco@@ t for 14 years , so I said , " C@@ unt means many different things in different countries -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) but I 'm pretty sure you ep@@ it@@ om@@ ize the global standard of a dic@@ k . "
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And I did that alone , and I published it alone , because my chief advisor said , " Please don 't , the rain of retali@@ atory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you . "
and I want to say a word about revenge por@@ n .
kids , schools , caregivers , parents : it 's essential .
shall we talk about our friends in tech ?
so apparently , I 've got a pretty bold voice .
I would like for you to reflect it back to me .
it do@@ es@@ n 't so much have a flavor , but it does give your body a really subtle kind of boost of energy .
( in a lowered voice ) It has another quite surprising quality .
the images that more readily come to mind are things like ret@@ re@@ ating gl@@ aci@@ ers and polar bears ad@@ ri@@ ft on ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
here they ped@@ dle their attack software and share information on new attack techniques .
what are they going to do -- sue you if you violate them ?
organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack to themselves .
why ?
about a year ago , my colleagues and I had a radical idea .
so you probably have the sense , as most people do , that polarization is getting worse in our country , that the divide between the left and the right is as bad as it 's been in really any of our life@@ times .
and what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards , we found that liber@@ als , it did@@ n 't matter what ess@@ ay they read .
em@@ pa@@ thy and respect .
so , I had this w@@ ish@@ bone , and I thought , it 's kind of like a co@@ w@@ boy who 's been on his horse for too long .
so I 've invented it in concrete , because it do@@ es@@ n 't really matter .
it 's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes , but it was so important to the concept , we got it done .
you can sit by the fireplace and share stories .
the result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony .
the balconies are mis@@ registered .
but is it rebuilding trust ?
but now , they even have bas@@ ket@@ balls inside the station that kids can borrow .
they self @@@ -@@ @ governed their behavior , and they won the contract over some very powerful companies .
do you think those days are over ?
so I think there is a maturity that is starting to set , especially in that Sil@@ icon Valley area , where people are beginning to say , " We have a role . "
and that 's the key word .
and unless we play into that power table , I think we 'll end up in a bad place .
so , let me thank you for the opportunity to talk about the biggest international story of your professional lifetime , which is also the most important international challenge the world will face for as far as the eye can see .
never before have so many people risen so far so fast , on so many different dimensions .
now , I know his name is a mou@@ thful , and some people have trouble pronoun@@ cing it .
he wrote the first @@@ -@@ @ ever history book .
and I can even pron@@ ounce his name : Th@@ uc@@ y@@ di@@ des . "
" Th@@ uc@@ y@@ di@@ des 's Tra@@ p " is a term I co@@ ined several years ago , to make vivid Th@@ uc@@ y@@ di@@ des 's insight .
finally , last year , it was finished -- three times over budget .
it 's called the S@@ any@@ u@@ an Bridge .
now , for red @@@ -@@ @ blo@@ o@@ ded Americans -- and especially for red @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ked Americans like me ; I 'm from North Carolina -- there 's something wrong with this picture .
so how does this work ?
and just to remind you if you do , this won 't be the first time .
a remarkable group of Americans and Europeans and others , not just from government , but from the world of culture and business , engaged in a collective surge of imagination .
so , a remarkable story .
after World War II , Americans felt exhausted .
they had demobilized 10 million troops , they were focused on an urgent domestic agenda .
now , there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work .
how many of you are augmented cy@@ bor@@ gs ?
I 'll give you an example .
what 's exciting is we 're starting to see this technology out in the real world .
well , every time the owner picked up the le@@ ash , they went for a walk .
in fact , rather than working from pre@@ defined recipes , Wat@@ son had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents .
would you cross this bridge ?
you just sort of knew that bridge was unsafe .
we 're not doing a very good job on our own , we could certainly use all the help we can get .
I think the era of human aug@@ mentation is as much about the physical world as it is about the virtual , intellectual realm .
but I 'm much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together are going to augment each other , and start to in@@ habit a new space .
( la@@ ughter ) So , Bishop 's human partner can tell what to do in plain English and with simple ge@@ stures , kind of like talking to a dog , and then Bishop execu@@ tes on those instructions with perfect precision .
( la@@ ughter ) But what if it turns out that Barbie 's actually really lon@@ ely ?
what 's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design , make and use .
except a human did design this , but it was a human that was augmented by a gener@@ ative @@@ -@@ @ design AI , a digital nervous system and robots that can actually fab@@ ric@@ ate something like this .
I think we 're going to see a world where we 're moving from things that are fabricated to things that are f@@ armed .
where we 're moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown .
you know , I did@@ n 't have access to a sophisticated laboratory .
those emails would begin with something like this : " what 's a R@@ ag@@ head like you doing in our parliament ? "
I just thought that the s@@ enders and I had nothing in common .
and at the time , I actually thought that was a pretty cle@@ ver answer .
it was he who suggested that I should call them up and visit them .
emails that started with words like " terrorist , " " R@@ ag@@ head , " " rat , " " wh@@ ore . "
and then he said , " I have to ask my wife . "
even our prejudices were alike .
when I was young and I waited for the bus and it stopped 10 meters away from me , I was sure that the driver was a racist .
the people who sent hate mails are workers , husbands , wives , parents like you and me .
but when I asked , " What about you ?
I know what I 'm talking about .
if you want to prevent hate and violence , we have to talk to as many people as possible for as long as possible while being as open as possible .
and finally , remember to finish the conversation in a positive way because you are going to meet again .
we hang out only with people who think like us and talk about the others in a category of dis@@ d@@ ain .
we un@@ friend people on Facebook , and when we meet people who are discrimin@@ ating or de@@ human@@ izing people or groups , we don 't insist on speaking with them to challenge their opinions .
I thought if I was going to ask Gre@@ g to spend the rest of this life with me , then I should ask him in front of two people who had pledged to be together for eternity .
they are powerful reminders that our common humanity has not changed .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ologists are the cultural memory preser@@ vers and the spokes@@ people for the billions of people and the thousands of cultures that came before us .
we 're back at the site just south of Cairo .
this recti@@ linear form is an ancient tom@@ b that is previously unknown and un@@ excav@@ ated , and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years .
when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they 're finding , I believe that there are millions of un@@ discovered archaeological sites left to find .
who blows up a temple ?
we know that IS@@ IL is pro@@ fi@@ ting from the looting of sites , but we don 't know the scale .
this means that any object purchased on the market today from the Middle East could potentially be funding terrorism .
we looked at open @@@ -@@ @ source data and mapped the entirety of looting across Egypt from 2002 to 2013 .
and putting that data together -- you can see the looting p@@ its marked here .
of course I agreed , but I did@@ n 't think we 'd find anything .
we started finding engra@@ ved inscri@@ ptions .
you can see it written out here , in hier@@ og@@ ly@@ phs .
this is O@@ mer Far@@ rou@@ k , my brother .
do you see a tom@@ b ? do you see a pyramid ?
do you see any potential site damage or site looting ?
a hundred years ago , archae@@ ology was for the rich .
it might be you .
and the greatest story ever told is the story of our shared human journey .
if you look at the e@@ ty@@ m@@ ology of the word statistics , it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in .
and there are many reasons for this .
so in this case , it 's how well do you know 64 million people ?
if we re@@ frame the questions and say , how well do you know your local area , would your answers be any more accurate ?
so I devised a qu@@ iz : how well do you know your area ?
it 's a simple Web app .
and I was very conscious in designing this .
I wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people , not just the 49 percent who can get the numbers .
so here 's the qu@@ iz .
( la@@ ughter ) Ac@@ tually , in Ex@@ e@@ ter , it 's incredibly young , and I had underestimated the impact of the university in this area .
we 've had online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years .
so in some senses , this was all a little bit old and not necessarily new .
was more than I could have hoped for .
( la@@ ughter ) This URL contains the words " statistics , " " go@@ v " and " UK , " which are three of people 's least favorite words in a URL .
I never expected to be described by my own government in these terms : " l@@ ur@@ king , " " nef@@ arious , " " terrorist . "
I know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated I was because of my race -- and yes , I don 't think I would 've been detained if I were white .
and he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond , and when they came , the man was un@@ conscious .
so I would come in and take the test and I fell asleep in each one .
and between companies like Sp@@ ace@@ X and NASA and all of the international space agencies of the world , we hope to do that in the next few decades .
I have wanted to work at J@@ PL on these missions since I was 14 years old and I am privileged to be a part of it .
rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds , barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers .
I come from a family of civil rights advocates , and I had spent my career until that point working with low @@@ -@@ @ income children and families .
it was@@ n 't until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong .
we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't be designing better cities for children .
after all , shou@@ ld@@ n 't we include end users in the design process ?
adult planners marvel@@ ed at the students ' ideas as they shared a park constructed out of a j@@ el@@ ly brac@@ el@@ et .
and then , public art constructed from animal @@@ -@@ @ shaped plastic be@@ ads .
and separated bi@@ king and walking paths , so speeding bi@@ kers won 't hit young people as they stro@@ ll by the cre@@ ek .
literally .
our adolescents wanted thr@@ ill @@@ -@@ @ seeking opportunities .
they want nature right in their back@@ yards , not four blocks away .
in addition to trees and plants , kids almost always include animals in their designs .
so if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaper food venues , we meet the needs of many other populations , too .
that is@@ n 't to say that I did@@ n 't have my doubts along the way .
but most importantly , the blame transferred from Th@@ ord@@ is to me .
I feel that way . I try my best .
then we concentrate on what we have already ma@@ stered and we try to minimize mistakes .
it very much does .
I mean that every minute of every day , many students in elementary schools through colleges feel that if they make a mistake , others will think less of them .
finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
we 're going to do some open @@@ -@@ @ heart surgery . I was the only B@@ rit , on a team of about nine American cardi@@ ac surge@@ ons , cardi@@ ac nurse , intensive care nurse .
open @@@ -@@ @ heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble .
you look at your X @@@ -@@ @ rays on a screen and you do stuff with them , you email them . but we were still using X @@@ -@@ @ rays , but we did@@ n 't even have a viewing box !
for the past three years , I 've been developing technologies that could ultimately aid clin@@ icians with rapid , early @@@ -@@ @ stage cancer diagnostics .
the idea here is that the separation process for screening could be as simple as processing a sample of urine , blood or sali@@ va , which is a near @@@ -@@ @ term possibility within the next few years .
thirteen innocent people were killed , leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma .
what kind of a mother were you ? "
this is where I 'm going to tell you what I tell every audience I meet , which is to remind you about induced demand .
and here , you know , this street : yes , it will drain within a minute of the hundred @@@ -@@ @ year storm , but this poor woman has to mount the curb every day .
is it one to one ? three to one ?
and then , finally , the interesting walk : signs of humanity .
it was always the people scre@@ aming and running that really got me the most , especially those terri@@ fied @@@ -@@ @ looking children .
they were five and six then , at an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions , and expected real , convincing answers .
the question I had was , could parent training programs be useful for families while they were still in war zones or refugee camps ?
she listened carefully and pati@@ ently , and then to my joy she said , " If that 's what you want to do , and it means so much to you , then let 's do it .
they were making attempts at seeking support from NGO workers , from refugee camp teachers , professional medic@@ s , other parents .
but sadly , these attempts are almost always useless .
but my favorite has got to be , " Than@@ k you for not for@@ getting about us and our children . "
Hal@@ ul is the pet 's name for the Arabic female name , H@@ ala , and is only really used to refer to really young girls .
when they reached the refugee camp and she knew they were finally in some kind of safety , she completely withdrew to acting like her old childhood self .
[ it 's a penis ] ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) I have been studying sex@@ ting since the media attention to it began in 2008 .
people are into all sorts of things that you may not be into , like blue cheese or cil@@ an@@ tro .
what I do think is a serious problem is when people share private images of others without their permission .
the key is consent .
in 1908 , Ford introduced the Model T car .
in the 1950s , seat belts .
and we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas .

everything digital is not just automatically public .
that do@@ es@@ n 't make any sense .

people are still saying all the time to victims of privacy violations , " What were you thinking ?
if we think more about consent , we can see that victims of privacy violations deserve our compassion , not criminalization , sha@@ ming , harassment or punishment .
so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of bl@@ aming them , let 's do this instead : let 's shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let 's respond with compassion .

there 's a growing body of research examining the relationship between chronic stress and illness .
now , let 's imagine for a moment that I was pregnant .
but it turns out that the kind of stress we experience and whether we 're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough to keep our bodies working properly depends a lot on who we are .
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams , the person who pione@@ ered the tools that have proven these linkages , says that the more marginalized groups in our society experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health .
in certain parts of the country , particularly the De@@ ep South , the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in Sub @@@ -@@ @ Saharan African .
even nationally , black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women .
it 's what researchers call " the immigrant parad@@ ox , " and it further illustrates that there 's something in the US environment that is making us sick .
but here 's the thing : this problem , that racism is making people of color , but especially black women and babies , sick , is vast .
I could spend all of my time with you talking about it , but I won 't , because I want to make sure to tell you about one solution .
both are young , African @@@ -@@ @ American and m@@ oms themselves .
their approach is casual and friendly .
Jenn@@ ie says that Tr@@ ina and Alex@@ is are actually the center of her care model , and that her role as a provider is just to support their work .
lastly , when you finally are called back to see the provider , you 've already taken your own weight in the waiting room , and done your own pe@@ e test in the bathroom .
this is a big departure from the traditional medical model , because it places responsibility and information back in the woman 's hands .
and that support provides a crucial buffer to the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day .
well , The J@@ J Way has almost entirely eliminated those problems , starting with what Jenn@@ ie calls " sk@@ in@@ ny babies . "
a similar demographic of women in Jenn@@ ie 's area who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did were three times more likely to give birth to a baby below a healthy weight .
the beauty of Jenn@@ ie 's model is that she actually believes it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting .
they involve elaborate physiological mechanisms meant to protect us , that , when over@@ stimulated , actually make us sick .
thank you .
but there was a crack in the wall , a problem with our industry , that I felt we needed to fix .
Afghanistan had already fallen off the agenda .
there were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008 that went to the war in Afghanistan .
" if I need medications , where will I find them ?
in fact , the Afghan Ministry of Health does things that I wish we would do in America .
we want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions is an integral part of their mission .
" H@@ mm , it 's probably not good . " that 's what I 'd tell you .
her work on human rights really serves as the foundation for all of our international human rights organizations .
they talked about building institutions to protect human security , for their generation and also for ours .
( la@@ ughter ) And you , si@@ r , who laugh@@ ed the lou@@ dest , you probably still are .
H@@ al was also a flawed character , for in the end he chose to value the mission over human life .
now , H@@ AL was a fic@@ tional character , but nonetheless he speaks to our fears , our fears of being sub@@ ju@@ gated by some un@@ feeling , artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity .
actually , it is .
so let 's accept for a moment that it 's possible to build such an artificial intelligence for this kind of mission and others .
do I fear that such an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity ?
the humans we are today are not the humans we will be then .
the principle is you just need those three things -- variation , selection and he@@ red@@ ity .
it do@@ es@@ n 't care about the consequences because it can 't , because it 's just information being copied .
if you copied it from someone else , it 's a mem@@ e .
why ? because the tem@@ es are sel@@ fish repl@@ ic@@ ators and they don 't care about us , or our planet , or anything else .
I have no idea .
now , if you put all of these chemicals , these nit@@ rates , into those kinds of environments , there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that -- algae , for example .
I 'll put this down , and I 'll lift up the fuel cell .
here we 've got a couple of videos , the first thing you 'll see -- hopefully you can see here is the mouth open .
but we can 't force the micro@@ bes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second .
how can we cope with that ?
it looks like the kind of thing we do .
current R@@ ow @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ ts contain things like toxic batteries .
well , yes , we have shown that you can do this .
what 's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these bio@@ degra@@ dable robots .
you throw them out there , and they de@@ grade to nothing .
so , why not make something like this ?
so this changes the way , again , in which we think about robots .
how will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race ?
since 2012 , conservative state legisl@@ atures across the US have ramp@@ ed up attempts to roll back African @@@ -@@ @ American voting rights by passing restrictive voter ID laws and cur@@ tailing early voting opportunities .
those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world @@@ -@@ @ makers who own and master time .
Africans were space @@@ -@@ @ tak@@ ers .
do black people have a future ?
but we can 't get there on colored people 's time or white time or your time or even my time .
they don 't have to worry about maintaining the physical servers .
why would anyone spend thousands of hours on something anyone can freely copy , ren@@ ame , or even sell ?
I fear that the future of our internet is out of our control .
now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger , but she 's not alone .
what if I told you that our definition of " good person " is so narrow , it 's scientifically impossible to meet ?
and what if I told you the path to being better people just begins with letting go of being a good person ?
you 'll have to use a laser @@@ -@@ @ cutting tool to cut up the square ; every other means available to you is@@ n 't precise enough .

for now , on social networks , we see cha@@ otic , individual us@@ ages .
( la@@ ughter ) let 's see what kids could hear Cay@@ la say in the safety of their room .
my team and I decided to investigate this .
and to make matters worse , when we read the terms and conditions , we discovered the following , and I 'm going to need to take out my reading glasses for this one .
Governments must create a safer internet by ensuring enforcement and up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date rules .
so I had to do something .
this was not an appeal for the scripts that would be the next great block@@ bu@@ ster , not an appeal for the scripts that will win the Academy Award , they did@@ n 't need to be scripts that their bos@@ ses loved or that their studio wanted to make .
and then two dozen other people actually em@@ ail@@ ed to participate to this anonymous email address , but I confirmed that they did in fact have the jobs they claimed to have .
the Black List .
everyone was sharing this list of scripts that everyone had said that they loved , reading them and then loving them themselves .
now , that 's not the interesting part .
because this agent then told me , and I quote , " Don 't tell anybody , but I have it on really good authority this is going to be the number one script on next year 's Black List . "
and so I did it again the next year -- and the " LA Times " had ou@@ ted me as the person who had created it -- and the year after that , and the year after that -- I 've done it every year since 2005 .
about 325 have been produced .
what does it mean for how we see ourselves and how we see the world and for how the world sees us ?
public officials ignored it .
think about that .
more underrepresented characters in terms of race and ethnicity , and most importantly , more women working behind the camera in key production roles .
our own economic analyses show that gender of the lead character do@@ es@@ n 't play a role in economic success in the United States .
production costs alone or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country .
why ? because it makes sure that there 's women on set .
if we want to see more films by , for and about women , we have to support them .
and everyone else is somewhere in between .
and we find that Germany and Japan will get there or there@@ abouts .
what on Earth is happening ?
ca : so some , I guess many liber@@ als out there view Trump and his government as kind of ir@@ rede@@ em@@ ably bad , just aw@@ ful in every way .
Y@@ N@@ H : yes , very much so .
ca : and those elites might not even be human elites .
so no wonder more and more authority is shifting from us to the algorithms .
and that should not be impossible , because people can have several layers of loyalty .
one of the things I know as a histor@@ ian is that you should never underes@@ timate human stup@@ idity .
now , how to get there and what would it look like , I don 't know .
ca : that 's your answer , K@@ at . ( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ N@@ H : and I don 't think that they know either .
we look at these other groups which have formed which go outside of national bounds but still represent significant authorities .
and I think , again , history shows that you shou@@ ld@@ n 't necessarily think in such exclusive terms .
and that that 's actually spar@@ ked a lot of the anger .
I kind of found myself hoping that , reading your book .
people often conf@@ use intelligence and consciousness , especially in places like Sil@@ icon Valley , which is understandable , because in humans , they go together .
Y@@ N@@ H : I try not to .
if it can 't suffer , it 's not real .
a nation CA@@ N@@ NOT suffer .
my basic reaction as a histor@@ ian is : if this is the era of post @@@ -@@ @ truth , when the hell was the era of truth ?
it was incorporated into the charter of those organizations that the truth mat@@ tered .
there is nothing that -- I don 't know -- Joseph Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s , did@@ n 't know about all this idea of fake news and post @@@ -@@ @ truth .
ca : well , depending on how things go , we may all be back in the forest soon .
Y@@ N@@ H : I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair , and that we should realize that .
if we don 't have a global governance , and if we suffer from climate change , from technological disruptions , the worst suffering will not be in the US .
you 're pretty worried about it .
you can use the same technology to create very different kinds of societies .
the trains did not tell you what to do with them .
similarly , now , artificial intelligence and bio@@ engineering and all of that -- they don 't pre@@ determine a single outcome .
and many countries basically took out war from their political toolkit .
my two kids go to school right in that bull@@ se@@ ye .
and then they got su@@ ed by big tobacco , who claimed that collecting information with p@@ enc@@ ils and clip@@ boards is neither precise nor pro@@ vable .

before the war , your security policy had been isol@@ ation@@ ist .
partly , they 're pumping money in because commodity prices are high , but it 's not just that . there 's also a range of new discoveries .
so I thought , well , maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion .
at that stage I just wanted to abandon the research , but -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , " Why not try an auction ? it 'll reveal the value . "
I grew up in a culture of self @@@ -@@ @ eff@@ ac@@ ement .
what kind of world would that be ?
so currently in my lab , I 'm research@@ ing questions like , what makes a human smell like a human ?
and it turns out it 's fairly complicated .
can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music ?
you can grab the ring , you can ring that bell , when the ride is over -- over , over , you can never , ever tell .
they said , " OK , you know what ?
and that guy got to make the very difficult decision , but really the life @@@ -@@ @ changing decision about whether to go get help .
sounds a little sket@@ chy to me , but I 'm listening , " you at least know you 're being engaged and respected .
we can resist .
I thought about it a lot over the past few years and I found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible .
each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up .
the last lap took almost 30 .
most of what they said to her when she was outside began with , " Be careful , " " Watch out , " or " No . "
I 'm just pro @@@ -@@ @ bra@@ very .
so notice next time you say , " Watch out , you 're going to get hurt , " or , " Don 't do that , it 's dangerous . "
so practice .
because this is not about the steep hill in front of her .
it cou@@ ld@@ n 't detect my face .
this is a face . this is a face . this is not a face .
but don 't worry -- there 's some good news .
so there 's an opportunity to create full @@@ -@@ @ spectrum training sets that reflect a richer portrait of humanity .
law enforcement is also starting to use machine learning for predic@@ tive policing .
so what can we do about it ?
well , we can start thinking about how we create more inclusive code and employ inclusive coding practices .
so who codes matters .
on the technical side , how we code matters .
who codes matters , how we code matters and why we code matters .
my mother left school when she was 15 .
( appl@@ ause ) So I started a festival called W@@ O@@ W , Women of the World , seven years ago , and it 's now in 20 countries across five continents .
so I traveled there last year , and part of the joy I had in going there was going to these ca@@ ves .
the La@@ as Ge@@ el ca@@ ves .
these paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old .
that 's what art is for .
and I thought , well , who painted this joy@@ ful , you@@ thful figure ?
( la@@ ughter ) And he said , " Women don 't do these things .
men made these marks . women don 't . "
and I turn to Carol@@ ine , and she 's c@@ rying her eyes out .
men feel they have been given the man@@ tle for universal communication , but of course , how could they be ?
the rising pu@@ bic hair removal reminded me of the 19@@ 20@@ s , when women first started regularly sha@@ ving their ar@@ mp@@ its and their legs .
the most sought @@@ -@@ @ after look , incidentally , in which the outer lab@@ ia appear f@@ used like a cl@@ am shell , is called ...

but for all that , it has a lot of holes .
and then I met Yo@@ yo , who is the native Rap@@ a Nu@@ i @@@ -@@ @ an guide , and if you look at Yo@@ yo 's face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
another thing I do is I inv@@ ent stuff .
while I was at Microsoft , I took a leave of absence and went to a ch@@ ef school in France .
I 've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue .
it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extrater@@ re@@ stri@@ als in a very scientific way .
and that means what we see on the screen is in reality extremely tiny .
now , just five years ago , I really had no clu@@ e about ph@@ ages .
after all , albeit invisible , you had something that reliably was killing bacteria .
and that 's what 's happening around the globe .
more than 10 bio@@ tech companies , including our own company , are developing human @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ age applications to treat bacterial infections .
but unfortunately in some children , there 's a block@@ age of this flow pattern , much like a traffic j@@ am .
I could not understand what just happened .
and so I 'm here to deb@@ un@@ k a myth .
so living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together and have a totally different perspective , just like the couple of people I mentioned earlier in my stories .
but we can do something better than that .
my first m@@ all job that I had as a teen@@ ager was at a sporting goods store called Her@@ man 's World of Sports .
let me show you .
( la@@ ughter ) I always think in my head , if I owned a dead m@@ all -- why don 't they embrace their vin@@ tage look ?
Donald J. Trump , the Republic candidate , was hot on her he@@ els with 14 percent , and the remainder of the vote were shared between ab@@ stain@@ ers and G@@ ary Johnson , the Liber@@ tarian candidate .
there is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs .
140 million Americans voted for the next president of the United States , and yet , as all of us knows , in a few weeks time , somebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes to Donald J. Trump .
in fact , I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates .
I send them the same two questions every single time .
some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine .
but I think it may also be a sign that the domestic electorate is still thinking very nationally .
we 've got the ex @@@ -@@ @ prime minister of New Zealand , who would be a wonderful member of the team .
it has some background .
it 's part of a project which I launched back in 2014 , which I call the Good Country .
since the US election and since Brexit it 's become more and more obvious to me that those old distinctions of left wing and right wing no longer make sense .
it 's one the Obama administration even called " the cornerstone to modernizing America 's electrical grid . "
and we have a simple checklist for this .
when the volunteer stood in front of just one door , people would avoid giving by going out the other door .
in the case of the Sal@@ vation Army , eliminating exc@@ uses just means standing in front of both doors , and sure enough , when they did this , donations rose .
people need to take their medication so that they 're cured , and so that they don 't get other people sick .
we 're talking about taking a really strong antibio@@ tic every single day for six months or more .
it will make your pe@@ e turn funny colors .
the company OP@@ ower sends people in their electricity bill a small insert that compares their energy consumption with that of people with similarly sized homes .
I 'd say back to him , " No , it 's not . "
ca : and so take that a bit further , and maybe expand a bit more on your insights into Ste@@ ve Ban@@ non 's world@@ view .
it seemed to be a move to a more moderate position , on the face of it .
so I believe he was listening to her before that speech .
was it here or here or here ?
it 's no@@ stal@@ gic ; it 's for the past .
so I don 't know if that 's the right way to fight .
and there are two phrases you 've heard over and over again , wherever you go in the country .
and I teach at Y@@ ale .
but is there any path whereby we can start to get some kind of consensus , to believe the same things ?
GC : see , I understand how that happened .
that 's another ground@@ s@@ well kind of emo@@ tion that was going on in the middle of America and not being heard , in thinking that the mainstream media was biased .
ca : do you think enough of his supporters have a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ...
( la@@ ughter ) No , I reject the category .
and so there has been a genuine narrowing of what is permissible to say .
GC : I would just start by saying that I really think any change and coming together starts from the top , just like any other organization .
according to a lot of research , one of the best weapons is gratitude .
so knowing this , I started a new tradition in our house a couple of years ago .
then one day , my 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old son said , " You know , D@@ ad , those people are@@ n 't in our apartment .
I decided to call my project " Than@@ ks a Th@@ ous@@ and . "
and while she 's saying this , I 'm realizing I 've done that .
it reminded me that what I take for granted is not available to millions of people around the world .
being aware of the thousands of people involved in every little thing we do .
I 'm not talking about claims like , " 9 out of 10 women recommend this anti @@@ -@@ @ aging cream . "
what makes this claim different is it do@@ es@@ n 't come from a private company , it comes from the government .
among supporters of President Trump it 's even higher ; it 's about 7 out of 10 .
on the one hand , there are those who say these statistics are crucial , that we need them to make sense of society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes and measure progress in an [ objective ] way .
this is a total disaster .
if we don 't have this data , how can we observe discrimination , let alone fix it ?
facts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells that are smaller than the size of an average parking space .
that do@@ es@@ n 't mean every single swimming pool in the country contains exactly 6.@@ 23 tur@@ ds .
one poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support ji@@ had , which is obviously pretty sc@@ ary , and it was reported everywhere in 2015 .
a poll might speak to a couple hundred people , maybe a thousand , or if you 're L '@@ O@@ real , trying to sell skin care products in 2005 , then you spoke to 48 women to claim that they work .
( la@@ ughter ) Private companies don 't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right , they just need the right numbers .
they 're civil servants .
my mom was f@@ rea@@ king out , my d@@ ad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a Sn@@ ap@@ chat video .
( la@@ ughter ) This was just the beginning of my team 's science project .
so the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier , a couple of my team@@ mates took a trip to Central America and saw beaches lit@@ tered with Sty@@ ro@@ foam , or expanded poly@@ sty@@ rene foam .
and when they came back and told us about it , we really started thinking about the ways in which we see Sty@@ ro@@ foam every day .
well , simply put , recycled poly@@ sty@@ rene is too expensive and potentially contaminated , so there is very little market demand for Sty@@ ro@@ foam that has to be recycled .
and now France has become the first country to completely ban all plastic u@@ tensi@@ ls , cups and plates .
so we started out by doing a variety of heating tests , and unfortunately , we had many failures .
so we kept trying and failing and trying and failing .
and we were also honored with the Scientific American Inno@@ vator Award from Google Science Fair .
philosoph@@ ers , dra@@ mati@@ sts , the@@ olog@@ ians have grap@@ pled with this question for centuries : what makes people go wrong ?
and I had friends who were really good kids , who lived out the Dr. Je@@ ky@@ ll Mr. Hy@@ de scenario -- Robert Louis Ste@@ ven@@ son .
good people could be se@@ duc@@ ed across that line , and under good and some rare circumstances , bad kids could recover with help , with reform , with rehabilitation .
if you look at it and focus on the white , what you see is a world full of angels .

evil is the exercise of power .
it 's the few bad apples , the few ro@@ gue soldiers . "

that 's one of the visual illustrations of evil .
this is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
and so we 're interested in what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel ?
and secondly , we know there 's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners .

some mothers do a lot of that , some mothers do very little , and most are in between .
but what 's interesting about it is when he follows these pu@@ ps when they become adults -- like , years in human life , long after their mother died .
so how can this work ?
it evolved during evolution .
is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light ?

how do we teach our kids to be safe online when we don 't have either ?
today , I use it .
the key was to overcome the initial shock and do something new .
what kind of information do you share ?
those kids need to know what the risks of being online are , how to take care of themselves , but also that , fundamentally , as with almost everything else , kids can learn this from any adult .
online safety needs to be a conversation topic in every house and every classroom in the country .
and this number is growing .
gro@@ oming shows us this in the most painful way : by involving our kids .
after Y@@ ale and a law degree from Columbia , C@@ ly@@ de spent the next 30 years as one of America 's top civil rights lawyers .
it 's stunning .
all of these researchers were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting bl@@ acks , but they provided no evidence .
this scale cap@@ tures ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not value is ch@@ ip@@ ped away on a daily basis .
for example , there 's discrimination in medical care .
this was true for all kinds of medical treatment , from the most simple to the most technologically sophisticated .
it is a subtle process , but it 's normal and it occurs even among the most well @@@ -@@ @ inten@@ tioned individuals .
there is institutional discrimination , which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions .
one of America 's best @@@ -@@ @ kept secrets is how residential segregation is the secret source that creates racial inequality in the United States .

short @@@ -@@ @ ter@@ m@@ ism , for many reasons , has per@@ v@@ aded every no@@ ok and cran@@ ny of our reality .

( la@@ ughter ) So before you hit that button , make sure you are clear and everyone else is clear .
( la@@ ughter ) We can also get ar@@ cing if we have an extremely wet chest .
I 'll leave you with one point .
remember , if you do find yourself dealing with a Wo@@ ok@@ ie@@ e , do not s@@ have the entire Wo@@ ok@@ ie@@ e .

we do a great dis@@ service to boys on how we raise them ; we sti@@ f@@ le the humanity of boys .
I know young women who are under so much pressure from family , from friends , even from work to get married , and they 're pushed to make terrible choices .
both men and women in Nigeria will say -- this is an expression I 'm very am@@ used by -- " I did it for peace in my marriage . "
they grow up to be women who silence themselves .
but I sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations .
gender and class are different forms of oppression .
but also , culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people .

two months ago , my kids and I h@@ ud@@ dled around a cell phone watching the live stream of the Game Awards , one of the video game industry 's biggest nights .
when we thought that Jo@@ el could live , I left the game designing to my husband .
I have to think in a totally new way to do it , but I love it .
our video game was our attempt to share that world with people who had@@ n 't experienced it before , because we never could imagine that world until it became ours .
and I drew this sketch , something with two layers , transl@@ uc@@ ent with structure in between capturing light .
you all know this crazy search , letting the process take you , and you live for the surprises .
and it had this quality that we loved , this idea of the embodied light , but on the inside , we wanted something with a soft light , like the inner lining of a jacket .
but it was the third surprise that was most ...
it let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them .
to show you what I mean , let me tell you about another patient .
Rob@@ in was in her early 4@@ 0s when I met her .
we 'll see our function decline , some of us will see our cogn@@ ition decline , we 'll be no longer able to care for ourselves , to do the things that we want to do .
and how do they do it in a way that mainstream medical hospitals and clinics , at least for Rob@@ in , we@@ ren 't able to ?
and what I experienced -- what they experience every day , hundreds of thousands of people like Rob@@ in -- was really amazing .
those waiting rooms really are a hi@@ ve of interaction , advice and support .
these are often small , mom @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ pop operations run by people with no medical training .
that should be ba@@ ked into the way that healthcare is delivered .
you can see there 's a sort of strange dark dust across it .
now , that is local dust that 's obsc@@ uring the light of the stars .
there is a technique .
radio waves have a wa@@ vel@@ ength that 's long , and that makes their resolution poorer .
and I 'm very excited .
it 's al@@ ight with syn@@ chro@@ tr@@ on radiation , and thousands of do@@ ts are in the sky .
it 's been a long @@@ -@@ @ standing mystery to astronom@@ ers where all the super@@ no@@ va remnants are .
it makes it easier to engage with what that person has to say .
and then , of course , they are discussed , picked over , refined , finalized .
it has precedent .
faced with enormous stress , I suffered an anxiety attack .
I have a loving , supportive family and incredibly loyal friends , yet I could not enter@@ tain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain .
the first time I heard " mental health , " I was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from Ghana , at the Ped@@ die School in New Jersey .
according to the World Health Organization , mental health is about being able to cope with the normal stres@@ sors of life ; to work produc@@ tively and fruit@@ fully ; and to be able to make a contribution to your community .
mental health includes our emotional , psychological and social well @@@ -@@ @ being .
globally , 75 percent of all mental illness cases can be found in low @@@ -@@ @ income countries .
I heard the whis@@ pers .
do so with the confidence that you are not alone .
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .
it can be for profit or not profit . it can be large or small .
I 'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples , but always pointing to the broader themes .
right ? how do you capture that ?
and you can see why , from Ball@@ mer 's point of view , that 's a bad idea , right ?
we were on the highway , and I took the wrong exit .

as I fur@@ thered my career in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest , I soon learned that I had to take responsibility for my own actions .

how in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters ?
we 're going to need all the help we can get .

why ?
that 's your reward system saying , " M@@ mm , yes ! "
that 's because when it comes to food , the brain evolved to pay special attention to new or different tastes .
in other words , eating lots of sugar will continue to feel rewarding .
so , think back to all those different kinds of sugar .
the surprising answer is : none of the above !

politics is the work of harnessing that flow in a direction you prefer .

do you want power to benefit everyone or only you ?
ele@@ ph@@ ants know every member in their her@@ d , able to recognize as many as 30 compan@@ ions by sight or smell .

it 's popular because it forces us to think about how to choose when there are no good choices .
the five lives out@@ weigh one , even if achieving that outcome requires condemning someone to death .
the dilemma in its many variations reveal that what we think is right or wrong depends on factors other than a logical weighing of the pro@@ s and cons .
for the many millions experiencing bi@@ polar disorder around the world , life is split between two different realities - el@@ ation and depression .
type 1 has extreme high@@ s alongside the lows , while Type 2 involves brief@@ er , less extreme periods of el@@ ation inter@@ s@@ pers@@ ed with long periods of depression .
type 1 's extreme high@@ s are known as man@@ ic episodes , and they can make a person range from feeling irrit@@ able to inv@@ inci@@ ble .
without treatment , these episodes become more frequent , intense , and take longer to sub@@ side .
some bi@@ polar patients reject treatment because they 're afraid it will di@@ m their emotions and destroy their creativity .

I was like , can I play ?
S@@ W : no , I 've been so fortunate and so I haven 't .
G@@ K : you have a lot of support . you have a lot of love .
on the way over here , somebody was telling me about I@@ lie N@@ ast@@ ase , who said some very un@@ kind , inappropriate , dare I say racial things .

you 've had three life @@@ -@@ @ changing things in a six @@@ -@@ @ month time : pregnant , huge win , fell in love .
but I would never put you with a ner@@ dy ge@@ ek , and you said , you neither .

( la@@ ughter ) No , he 's a very nice guy .
G@@ K : was it a wonderful proposal ?
" if you like it then you ought to put a ring on it " ?
I can 't fly to Rome . "
because he wanted to take me to Rome , and I said , " I can 't . I GO@@ T@@ TA win . "
G@@ K : this is a girl that says , " No , I can 't go to Rome . " OK .
S@@ W : I feel like winning for me is super@@ addic@@ tive .
do you feel joy in that ?
in my life , it still and forever is always going to be Ven@@ us and Se@@ rena .
S@@ W : we were always brought up to be super@@ close , and we are incredibly close .
I have three other sisters as well , and we were always so close .
G@@ K : so before a big match , the two of you don 't get together and say , look , we 're going to go out there and -- there 's nothing ?
I 'm not going to play Australia in -- Well , who knows , I 've been playing forever , but I don 't think I 'll be playing in 50 years , say ?
G@@ K : I don 't know , Se@@ rena . there 's never been anybody like you .
a lot has been made about your body .
so we 're thinking medium size and we 're just thinking -- My personality is a lot of fun . hopefully you can see that today .
G@@ K : do you know if it 's a boy or girl ?
it 's a 50 @@@ -@@ @ 50 chance , but I have a feeling .
( la@@ ughter ) Al@@ right , al@@ right .
and maybe you 're thinking , " Well , it won 't be me . "
part of the fear around Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's stems from the sense that there 's nothing we can do about it .
here 's a picture of two ne@@ ur@@ ons connecting .
and remember .
and when this happens , it bin@@ ds to itself , forming stic@@ ky aggregates called am@@ y@@ lo@@ id pl@@ aqu@@ es .
so what happens when am@@ y@@ lo@@ id pl@@ aqu@@ es accumulate to this ti@@ pping point ?
a crucial ne@@ ural transport protein called " tau " becomes hyper@@ phosph@@ or@@ yl@@ ated and t@@ wi@@ sts itself into something called " t@@ angles , " which cho@@ ke off the ne@@ ur@@ ons from the inside .
we 're going to have to take this pill before we reach that ti@@ pping point , before the casc@@ ade is triggered , before we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator .
think of am@@ y@@ lo@@ id pl@@ aqu@@ es as a lit match .
at the ti@@ pping point , the match sets fire to the forest .
some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it .
a single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in am@@ y@@ lo@@ id beta .
what else ?
cardiovascular health .
so a heart @@@ -@@ @ healthy Mediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter the ti@@ pping of this scale .
the average brain has over a hundred trillion syn@@ ap@@ ses , which is fantastic ; we 've got a lot to work with .
let 's imagine a simplified example .
ideally , we want these new things to be as rich in meaning as possible , recruiting sight and sound and associations and emo@@ tion .
you want to pave new ne@@ ural roads .
and if , despite all of this , you are some@@ day diagnosed with Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's , there are three lessons I 've learned from my grand@@ mother and the dozens of people I 've come to know living with this disease .
you won 't lose your emotional memory .
now , you 'll be familiar of h@@ acking and leaks that happened in 2016 .
the media took the ba@@ it .
they were consumed by how much the D@@ NC h@@ ated Ber@@ ni@@ e .
and there was no shortage of evidence .
AP@@ T@@ 28 loved to prey on the emails and contacts of journalists in Chechnya , the Georgian government , eastern European defense att@@ ach@@ Ã©s -- all targets with an undeniable interest to the Russian government .
before the first iPhone even hit the shelf , the Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and the inter @@@ -@@ @ communication and instant communication it provided us .
this panor@@ ama of information that 's so interesting to you gives a state , or anyone for that matter , a perfect back door into your mind .
take this for another example .
and it creates a f@@ issu@@ red response and a fec@@ k@@ less attitude towards Russia 's land grab in Ukraine .
it 's the ability to think critically : call out fal@@ se@@ hood , press for the facts .

so a couple of key things that are important in having a 3D tunnel network .
and then the car gets on a sk@@ ate .
ca : how much ?
but you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels , any number of levels .
well , they 're right .
so ye@@ ah , it 's quite difficult to di@@ g tunnels normally .
ca : and how could you achieve that ?
em : actually , if you just do two things , you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement , and I think you can go beyond that .
so if you design the machine instead to do continuous tun@@ n@@ eling and reinforcing , that will give you a factor of two improvement .
em : we want to beat G@@ ary .
you save all that tun@@ n@@ eling cost .
em : right . I 'm in favor of flying things .
obviously , I do rockets , so I like things that fly .
is there a tie @@@ -@@ @ in here with Hy@@ per@@ loop ?
so actually , it sort of turns out that automatically , if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table , it is automatically capable of holding vacuum .
em : I think there 's no real length limit .
very nice . very funny .
ca : you 've called it a hob@@ by .
like , it will cost less than a bus ticket .
ca : you started T@@ es@@ la with the goal of persu@@ ading the world that electri@@ fication was the future of cars , and a few years ago , people were laugh@@ ing at you .
em : OK .
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't know . I don 't know .
this is just using passive optical , which is essentially what a person uses .
if you don 't solve vision , it 's not solved .
so that 's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision ne@@ ural net that 's very effective for road conditions .
like , you can probably do it ten times better than humans would , just cameras .
ca : so the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them .
they can 't yet do what that showed .
em : I will show you a te@@ aser shot of the truck .
em : it 's just like , driving this giant truck and making these mad maneu@@ vers .
so you have an even color from the ground level .
you can 't tell from street level .
you 're on a body now giving advice to a guy -- EM : who ?

As@@ pir@@ ation@@ ally , that 's our target .

( appl@@ ause ) CA : people want to position this as an either or , that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to , you know , you pick your issue .

a colleague of mine took a ride in a Ly@@ ft in Atlanta last year , and he started chatting with his driver about libraries , as we do .
she said , " It would be like another credit card that I can 't pay . "
when people are@@ n 't afraid of the fines they might accrue , they line up to access what we have to offer .
but like all of our friends at the library , I am busy , I lose track of things , my house is sometimes mess@@ y , and I have lost a DVD or two under the sofa .
as Michael might have mentioned , I 've been a libr@@ arian for 15 years and my mom h@@ as@@ n 't been in a library in decades , because when she was young , she lost a book .
if we want people to use the library again , we should just get rid of fines altogether .
basically , we fine because we 've always fined .

I learned that a D@@ Ã©@@ ci@@ ma is a type of verse that only exists in Spanish , and that it has 10 lines .
it also has a very concrete date of origin , which is very rare for a style of stan@@ za .

not long ago , we were in Mexico after a concert .
when these amazing musicians finished playing what is for me , something amazing , which is the son j@@ ar@@ och@@ o , they finished playing and were ...
in reality , the D@@ Ã©@@ ci@@ ma is its origin , but at the same time , just like in the mil@@ onga and in the D@@ Ã©@@ ci@@ ma , are the roots of many more cultures from all over the place , like he said .

that represents the total equivalent carbon dioxide reduced from the atmosphere when the solution is implemented globally over a 30 @@@ -@@ @ year period .
this fundamentally shifts traditional thinking on climate solutions .
but let 's go to the top of the list , because I think what 's there may also surprise you .
and we need to re@@ think how we produce our food to make it more regener@@ ative .
moreover , approximately a third of all food produced is not eaten , and wasted food em@@ its an ast@@ ounding eight percent of global greenhouse gases .
food is not wasted by consumers in low @@@ -@@ @ income countries which struggle to feed their population .
the top solutions would take us far along the path@@ way , but there 's no such thing as a small solution .
when we implement these solutions , we shift the way we do business from a system that is inherently explo@@ itative and extractive to a new normal that is by nature restorative and regener@@ ative .

in medicine , people are connected as humans before they 're identified as doctor and patient .

well , the standard explanation was once summed up by the British Prime Minister , Marg@@ aret Th@@ at@@ cher .
now , I 'm sure not many of you would be so bl@@ unt .
and others may argue that we should help them to make better decisions .
but the underlying assumption is the same : there 's something wrong with them .
what they subsequently discovered completely ble@@ w my mind .
and what that thing is do@@ es@@ n 't much matter -- whether it 's not enough time , money or food .
this nar@@ rows your focus to your immediate lack -- to the sand@@ wich you 've got to have now , the meeting that 's starting in five minutes or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow .
so the long @@@ -@@ @ term perspective goes out the window .
but it 's not enough .
we could help the poor with their paper@@ work or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills .
( appl@@ ause ) Because , I mean , the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self @@@ -@@ @ appointed experts think they need .
just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers , like George Or@@ well , are now with@@ ering away in scarcity .
but let 's talk about the ele@@ phant in the room .
( appl@@ ause ) The time for small thoughts and little n@@ ud@@ ges is past .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , don 't get me wrong -- I 'm not talking about the teachers and the gar@@ bag@@ emen and the care workers here .
if they stopped working , we 'd be in trouble .
I believe in a future where an existence without poverty is not a privilege but a right we all deserve .
thank you .

but you are not going to send your kids to school in a self @@@ -@@ @ driving car with 90 percent accuracy , even with 99 percent .
machines have calculations .
we have purpose .
if we fail , it 's because we grew complac@@ ent and limited our ambitions .
our humanity is not defined by any skill , like sw@@ inging a ham@@ mer or even playing chess .

it is an opportunity that we don 't take for granted , and so we thought long and hard about how we would use it .
would we talk to the women we hope to inspire , a million in the next year , or would we talk to you ?
but we 're going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary , and because we need you .

go back to that video that we just showed you .

it was actually doctors in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern Brazil who first noticed , just a year ago , after a Z@@ ika outbreak , that there was a peak in the incidence of micro@@ ce@@ ph@@ aly .
the first human cases of Z@@ ika fever sur@@ faced a few years later in Uganda @@@ -@@ @ Tanzania .
then when they land , the local mosqu@@ it@@ oes begin to b@@ ite them and spread the fever .
and then , in early 2015 , there was an up@@ surge of cases of a den@@ gue @@@ -@@ @ like syndrome in the city of Nat@@ al in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern Brazil .
staying home is@@ n 't a fool@@ proof protection either because we now know that it can be sexually transmitted .
the protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that kill people as well as bugs .
these are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua .

that 's because insecti@@ cides are@@ n 't very effective .
a little British company called Ox@@ ite@@ c genetically modified that mosqu@@ ito so that when it mates with a wild female , its eggs don 't develop to adul@@ thood .
sounds impossible ?
from there it 's pretty simple .
took them another five years going back and forth and back and forth to convince the FDA that this would not harm people , and it would not harm the environment .
so the bottom line is this : biological control of harmful insects can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using insecti@@ cides , which are toxic chemicals .

the challenge , of course , is to answer this question : what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?
we got some of the best mathemati@@ cians in the world from Prin@@ ce@@ ton to work on this problem .
whereas nature tends to be small , and cur@@ ved , and it ben@@ ds and t@@ wi@@ sts , and has legs instead , and ap@@ pend@@ ages , and has many muscles and many , many sensors .
here 's what some of you did this morning , although you did it outside , not on a t@@ read@@ mill .
( la@@ ughter ) S@@ ame principle : it only has six moving parts , six motors , but it has spr@@ ing@@ y , tun@@ ed legs . it moves in the ga@@ it of the in@@ sect .
here 's the animal that we have here , running on a vertical surface .
we were fortunate to work with another group at Stan@@ ford that built us a special manned sensor , that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair .
and so without a referral , and paying out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ pocket , I took Elizabeth to a der@@ mat@@ ologist .
the first one : P@@ at and I have no science background .
we quickly learned that this shared resource was not going to be enough .
we found more than 4,000 people around the world who had P@@ X@@ E , and held patient meetings and did clinical trials and studies .

and I was surprised , but they said I could give a talk , and I said I 'd love to .
I know because I used to be in one of those control rooms .
when we talk about technology , we tend to talk about it as this blue sky opportunity .
so the internet is not evolving at random .
and they invented a feature called Sn@@ ap@@ st@@ rea@@ ks , which shows the number of days in a row that two people have communicated with each other .

she was in the kitchen and she over@@ heard the conversation , and she was mor@@ ti@@ fied .
that was 70 kil@@ os on each arm .
but this is also , if I take a big step back from this , this is also a very personal journey for me .
and I love this picture , too .
she was sent to start a new life in a new country on her own at the age of 12 .
she 's working for the International Rescue Committee to help other refugees , but she has no certainty at all about her future , where it is or what it holds .
I truly believe this , that the biggest question in the 21st century concerns our duty to str@@ angers .
that means they cross a border into a neighboring state .
in Lebanon , one in four people is a refugee , a quarter of the whole population .
it 's called D@@ ad@@ a@@ ab .
and then when I asked the camp management how many of the 3@@ 30,000 people in that camp were born there , they gave me the answer : 100,000 .
I think people do want to make a difference , but they just don 't know whether there are any solutions to this crisis .
the most vulnerable refugees need to be given a new start and a new life in a new country , including in the West .
the numbers are relatively small , hundreds of thousands , not millions , but the symbol@@ ism is huge .
we can 't say we don 't know what 's happening in Juba , South Sudan , or Aleppo , Syria .
and there 's one other thing it reveals about us : whether we have any hum@@ ility for our own mistakes .
and I think that when you are in a position of looking for leadership , you have to look inside and mobilize in your own community to try to create conditions for a different kind of settlement .
but I still wish I could have known what they were thinking or what they were feeling .
you 're seeing my brain activity that was recorded in real time with a simple device that was worn on my head .
to share this information with you , I wore one of the early consumer @@@ -@@ @ based EE@@ G devices like this one , which recorded the electrical activity in my brain in real time .
a US @@@ -@@ @ based company has developed a technology to emb@@ ed these sensors into the head@@ rest of automo@@ bil@@ ies so they can track driver concentration , distr@@ action and cognitive load while driving .
I worry that we will voluntarily or involun@@ tarily give up our last bas@@ tion of freedom , our mental privacy .
and I don 't think people understand that that could change everything .
does it also protect freedom of thought ?
and if so , does that mean that we 're free to alter our thoughts however we want ?
instead , we should be focusing on securing rights and remedies against the misuse of our information .
the time has come for us to call for a cognitive liberty revolution .
are aspirations conver@@ ging all around the world ?

that 's what we need , and we need that from all of you .
this is me with a classroom of 11 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ olds .

you fol@@ ks in this room , work with us .
then we trace those threads of potential out into the future , asking : what might it feel like to live in this future ?
but this work is not about predictions .
its g@@ lar@@ ing presence is so over@@ powering , I can 't help but st@@ are at it .
and we see this all around us .
we treat our future selves as a stranger , and the future as a foreign land .
even when a technology is developed with u@@ top@@ ian ideals , the moment it leaves the laboratory and enters the world , it is subject to forces outside of the creators ' control .
how on earth did Ar@@ n@@ old manage to do that ?
when Ar@@ n@@ old received his health insurance bill , he was shocked and sca@@ red to see that his premiums had gone through the roof , beyond anything he or his family could ever afford .

we want to bring back the aspect of ritual that 's been diluted over the past hundred years as cre@@ mation rates have risen and religious affiliation has declined .

in the past , I was able to reas@@ sure my students that the majority of the world does not hate refugees .

and then one day , she felt something move beneath her .
stor@@ y@@ book D@@ ads began in 2003 , when Sharon Ber@@ ry , a civilian worker in a prison , realized just how much many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children .
is it difficult for prisoners ?

the other sw@@ ans looked at him and thought how beautiful he was .
and one way into it is to see that perhaps the most simple way into a culture and into an age is to ask : what do people worship ?
what do we worship ?
I 'm going to draw a little more blood .
we 're going to take the sample , mount it on Paper@@ fu@@ ge .
so now the sample is completely enclosed .
it goes back and forth , back and forth ...
and now I 'm charging it up , and you see it builds momentum .
the world map for where mosqu@@ it@@ oes are is missing .
that 's a male ch@@ asing a female .
what is that responsibility ?
it is to question and to challenge those in positions of power .
but neutrality won 't necessarily lead me to the truth .
life is much more complicated , and I believe journalism should reflect that very complexity .
that is not true journalism .
to me it seemed like a brilliant idea to expose the president , but to my b@@ oss -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) My b@@ oss did@@ n 't think it was such a great idea .
on June 16 , 2015 , a candidate who would eventually become the president of the United States said that Mexican immigrants were criminals , drug traffickers and ra@@ pi@@ sts .
in comparison , six percent of US citizens have committed a serious crime .
eight weeks after they published my cell number , I obtained a press pass for a press conference for the candidate gaining momentum in the polls .
Donald Trump : who 's next ? yes , please .
J@@ r : it 's not about you -- Man : get out of my country !
neutrality helps only the op@@ pres@@ sor , never the victim . "
August is mon@@ soon season in this region of the world , and anyone that lives near a river is no stranger to flooding and the hazards and in@@ conveni@@ ences at minimum that are associated with that .
what happened is the KO@@ SI River jumped its banks , and for reference , the scale bar here is 40 miles .
so if we zoom in here , you guys can see these nice , cur@@ vy river pathways .
again , they 're really beautiful , but again , they 're not static .
it 's almost like a whi@@ p cracking and sn@@ aps off the path@@ way of the river at a certain spot .
so just for reference , again , in this location , that river changed its course over four miles over the course of a season or two .
so this was a pretty warm time and it happened really ab@@ rup@@ tly .
the yellow blo@@ b here is a fossil river .
and right now , it 's in a very small box .
one thing you can do is ask yourself : what goes on during that time ?
what 's interesting about these -- dating , social networking , gaming , entertainment , news , web browsing -- people spend 27 minutes a day on each of these .
and what they 've done is rig@@ ged the desks to the ceiling .
we don 't know how they 're going to react as the planet he@@ ats up , and hidden in that uncertainty might be hope .
but I 'm going to be honest with you : if I had a time machine , I would not be hanging out at this particular point in history .
they turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us .
if global warming triggers cloud changes that make for a less powerful greenhouse or a more effective sun@@ sh@@ ade , then that would enhance the cooling power of clouds .
but climate models struggle with clouds , and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways .
clouds could help us out with global warming .
I see everybody from the Pacific Nor@@ thwest is like , " I have some suggestions for you . "
( distorted voice ) OK , so what 's going on here ?
( la@@ ughter ) Now I 'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self , the specific experience of being you , is also a controlled hall@@ uc@@ ination generated by the brain .
or " Should our army advance into this territory ? "
well , you know what happened to Nokia ?
but not all systems are as ne@@ at@@ ly contained .

it 's very easy just to slip into silver @@@ -@@ @ bullet thinking , as if some simple solution existed .
so in an extraordinary range of contexts all over the world , this technology is still the dominant , most used , most effective technology to manage governance .
first , they founded political parties .
you know -- all the stuff .
as I mo@@ tioned in the direction I thought she should go , saying , " There are no stores on this side of the street so your best bet is to cross -- " " Oh my goodness , " she interrupted .
around 10 years ago , I was part of the team at John@@ s H@@ op@@ kins that first mapped the mu@@ tations of can@@ cers .
medical procedures are the gold standard ; however , they are highly invasive and require a large infrastructure to implement .
then we use molecular biology methods to be able to enrich this DNA for areas of the gen@@ ome which are known to be associated with cancer , based on the information from the cancer gen@@ om@@ ics projects .
we now know that these recep@@ tors are found all over the body , including in some pretty unexpected places -- in muscle , in kid@@ neys , lun@@ gs and blood vessels .
this is exciting stuff .
over in the Caribbean where I work , we 've already been through the nos@@ edi@@ ve .
so we ended up with a digital landscape that really repres@@ sed creativity , repres@@ sed novel@@ ty , it repres@@ sed what makes us most human .
I mean , where 's the button on the ride ha@@ iling app for the drivers to talk to one another about their working conditions or to uni@@ on@@ ize ?
the idea of public education was for coal miners , who would work in the coal mines all day , then they 'd come home and they should have the dignity to be able to read a novel and understand it .
he kills , I kill . "
of course you would .
we 're interested in scenarios in which this is not possible .
( la@@ ughter ) We 've seen this problem before .
and to understand the social dilemma , we have to go a little bit back in history .
and this is helping us form an early picture of what trade @@@ -@@ @ offs people are comfortable with and what matters to them -- even across cultures .
so it 's time for Spo@@ t to come back out , and we 're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility , de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity and perception .
the robot can walk with a number of different ga@@ its ; it 's got a gy@@ ro , or a solid @@@ -@@ @ state gy@@ ro , an IM@@ U on board .
now , Spo@@ t has a set of cameras here , stere@@ o cameras , and we have a feed up in the center .
in fact , we look identical to the one next door , except that we 're bright yellow .
instead of pursuing the American dream , where we might have been isolated in our single @@@ -@@ @ family homes , we instead chose co@@ housing , so that we can increase our social connections .
it turns out , when you eat together , you start planning more activities together .
when you eat together , you share more things .
we follow up , we check in , we speak our personal tru@@ ths and , when appropriate , we apolog@@ ize .
and in the library , I found the images that really captured the ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist of the Great De@@ pression .
my dog is in fact a mal@@ am@@ ute .
so we 've made amazing strides in image classification , but what happens when we run our classi@@ fier on an image that looks like this ?
and it 's correct , there is a mal@@ am@@ ute in the image , but just given this label , we don 't actually know that much about what 's going on in the image .
I work on a problem called object detection , where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects , put b@@ ounding boxes around them and say what those objects are .
and I knew that the Colombian army wore leather boots .
and at night , we would leave , get in the water , and we would swim and let the current carry us .
but after having lived through that with Lu@@ cho , after having faced fear together , united , not punishment , not violence -- nothing -- could ever again divide us .
( la@@ ughter ) So we got started but we had a delay , because first , pin@@ cho had to learn how to swim .
they made us dismantle the camp , and we started mar@@ ching .
I called the man up@@ stairs , and he sent me the patrol that rescu@@ ed me from the j@@ ung@@ le . "
but faith is , too .
but when they took us , handcu@@ ffed , into the helicopter that finally took us out of the j@@ ung@@ le , everything happened as quickly as when they kidnapped me .
the shri@@ ek that came out of all of us when we reg@@ ained our freedom , continues to vibr@@ ate in me to this day .
the " No " vote on the peace referendum in Colombia ; Brexit ; the idea of a wall between Mexico and the United States ; Islamic terrorism -- they 're all examples of using fear politically to divide and recruit us .
you can survive cra@@ w@@ ling along , fear@@ ful .

so about three years ago , I got a call from the Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n District Attorney .
he asked whether I 'd be interested in designing a program called a " conviction review unit . "
and to put it pol@@ itely : U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t cou@@ ld@@ n 't have run from where she said she was to the other spot .
right ?
the man spent 17 years behind bars .
the last one is a case about two boys , Wil@@ lie St@@ uc@@ key , David Mc@@ Call@@ um .
now this was a case , once again -- first bl@@ ush , it looked open and shut .
but my research showed that juvenile confessions without a parent present are prone to error .
we knew what really happened ; someone told them to say this .
after just about 30 years : " you are free to go . "
I knew my baby did@@ n 't do this . "
if there 's anything that we 've learned , anything that I 've learned , with this conviction integrity work , it 's that justice do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
we make justice happen .
it would have taken someone just a minute to look at the video confession and say , " That CA@@ N@@ NOT be . "
I must suffer if I lose it , give account if I abuse it .
just a tiny little minute , but eternity is in it . "
and he said , " I just want to walk on the side@@ walk without anybody telling me where to go . "
a similar narrative exists all over the world .
but the truth is that the challenges of making this happen have less to do with what we do and more to do with the wealth position in which we are born .
the reason why we should create these trusts is simple .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : Dar@@ ric@@ k .
so , these trusts are different .
the old ad@@ age , " I have to be twice as good as someone else . "

you 're likely even touching the fec@@ al bacteria that spra@@ yed onto you the last time you fl@@ ush@@ ed a toilet , or those bacteria that live in our water pipes and spra@@ yed onto you with your last shower .

( audio ) M@@ Z : so switch , switch , switch , you 're using gl@@ uc@@ ose , gl@@ uc@@ ose , gl@@ uc@@ ose .
( audio ) Dr. G@@ lor@@ ia Mark : so we find that when people are stressed , they tend to shift their attention more rapidly .
but when the data came in , it turned out that we had cut down , on average , just six minutes -- from 120 minutes a day on our phones to 114 .
but if it 's to distr@@ act yourself from doing the hard work that comes with deeper thinking , take a break , st@@ are out the window and know that by doing nothing you are actually being your most productive and creative self .
you inter@@ acted with the company that you work for or that you own .
fraud has become a feature , not a bug , of the financial services industry .
there are whi@@ stle @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ ow@@ ers like Michael Wood@@ ford , who ble@@ w the whi@@ stle on Oly@@ m@@ pus .
these whi@@ stle @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ ow@@ ers risk their careers , their friend@@ ships , to bring out the truth about their companies .
similarly , reputation is a very powerful economic force , right ?
well , I 'm an economist and we conduct so @@@ -@@ @ called experiments to address this issue .
simple , nine @@@ -@@ @ item survey that 's quite predic@@ tive in these experiments .
now , the modern tw@@ ist on this display argument is that the peac@@ ock is also advertising its health to the pe@@ ah@@ en .
in my life , I ain 't met many people that will readily admit when they are afraid .
when I got out to those protests about the fourth or fifth day , it was not out of courage ; it was out of guilt .
it was so amazing in fact , that for the next 100 years , between 1900 and 2000 , humans built just billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure to essentially help artists do two things .
it 's not , like , perfect yet , but it 's really working .
thanks , everybody .
that 's a doubling of the urban environment .
the key attribute is that it isol@@ ates people .
no matter what they do , no matter how many ring roads they build in Beijing , they just can 't overcome complete grid@@ lock .
so I 'm very hopeful .
and we did connect them with food and shelter and services .
I decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated .
and they do the paper@@ work , they do the insurance , they do all of the other forms that I can 't do quickly .
if you live in a city of eight @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ half million people , you can do this .
it can 't work that way . "
S@@ iri is the thing that knows your intent and helps you do it for you , helps you get things done .
those things are changing every day .
and imagine how this could revolu@@ tion@@ ize the way we manage aller@@ gies and chronic disease .
the words they used to ask the question are important , but the intentions behind the question dictate your understanding and ultimately , your response .
it 's a remote , mountainous zone , a blue zone , where super longevity is common to both sexes .
now , a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on .
and these areas become much more engaged when we 're inter@@ acting with a live partner .
now , to return to the beginning , why do women live longer than men ?
that scientists and the public are so far apart on these science issues .
I often say , weather is your mood and climate is your personality .
we have knowledge .
it is not having a vag@@ ina that makes life harder for women .
aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured .
look at how much the position of women has changed in my lifetime or the incredible strides that the gay rights movement has made in just a few decades , right ?
( guitar ) And then there 's you .
we 're being scored with secret formulas that we don 't understand that often don 't have systems of appeal .
the New York Post filed a Freedom of Information Act request , got all the teachers ' names and all their scores and they published them as an act of teacher @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ming .
he found 6@@ 65 teachers from that New York Post data that actually had two scores .
and whereas an air@@ plane that 's designed badly crashes to the earth and everyone sees it , an algorithm designed badly can go on for a long time , sil@@ ently w@@ rea@@ king ha@@ vo@@ c .
second , we should think about the definition of success , audit that .
we should look to the blind orchestra audi@@ tion as an example .
how often are there errors , and for whom does this model fail ?
data scientists : we should not be the arbit@@ ers of truth .
( appl@@ ause ) And the rest of you , the non @@@ -@@ @ data scientists : this is not a math test .
and the answer is going to have to be cooperative economics .
Luc@@ i stands for the Los Angeles Union Cooperative Initiative , and our objective is to create more worker @@@ -@@ @ owned businesses here in Los Angeles .
these are the types of fol@@ ks that want more union businesses to exist , so let 's build them with them .
and that vision is Mon@@ dra@@ gon , Spain .
and on a quiet day , I can hear her breathing . "
they had parents , and the few that were orphaned had other living relatives , like grand@@ parents and a@@ un@@ ties and un@@ cles and other si@@ bl@@ ings .
so why were these children living in an orphan@@ age when they we@@ ren 't orphans ?
these problems are rever@@ sible and preventable , and when we know better , we can do better .
thank you .
and I g@@ lan@@ ced upward , and I was just du@@ mb@@ struck .
and pictures just don 't do it justice .
so there was the sun , and there were the planets , and I could see how the planets revol@@ ve around the sun .
( la@@ ughter ) Because you 're using ammonia , you get h@@ ug@@ ely high pressures if you heated them wrong ; it top@@ ped 400 p@@ si .

what I find remarkable is that these birds would not be able to do that if they all would have to follow one leader .
their alignment enables their autonomy , and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible .
but instead , they used strange drawings with funny names like " squ@@ ads " and " chapters " and " tribes " to explain how they were organized .
if the product guy has an idea , he can just raise it to get input from the engineer who is sitting right next to him .
or should we invest in better videoconferencing ?
it 's about all of us stepping up to take initiative .
now , today , to know how things are going , instead of looking at status reports , he needs to walk down to the team floors to attend one of their sessions .
and instead of telling people what to do , he looks for ways to help them .
that is radical change for someone who used to be a master of milestone @@@ -@@ @ tracking .
now they have releases every few weeks , and without the hand@@ overs and the red tape , the whole organization becomes more efficient .
and finally , if you walk the halls of these companies today , you just feel a new energy .
OK , so now you might understand what I said : modern A@@ Is do not read , do not understand .
but see how it is beyond the volume zone of to @@@ -@@ @ be white @@@ -@@ @ coll@@ ar workers .
I decided to investigate what was going on in the human world .
I took hundreds of sentences from high school textbooks and made easy multiple @@@ -@@ @ choice qu@@ iz@@ zes , and asked thousands of high school students to answer .
[ _ _ _ _ _ _ has spread to Oceania .
and To@@ da@@ i Ro@@ bot chose the correct answer , too .

[ the Way We Work ] My name is Dan , I 'm a partner at a global creative consultancy .

here we see cargo ships and oil tankers waiting outside the entry to the port of Singapore .
those are actually cows at a feed@@ lot in Sum@@ mer@@ field , Texas , in the United States .
over the next three to four months , the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms before they are shipped off to slaughter .
so this facility contains 2,@@ 650 mirrors which are ar@@ ra@@ yed in con@@ centric circles around an 140 @@@ -@@ @ meter @@@ -@@ @ tall tower at its center .
through the incredible technology of these high @@@ -@@ @ flying cameras , we can see , monitor and expose the unprecedented impact that we are having .
it 's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion and natural disasters , but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid .
there is that very statue , as it was top@@ pled over , breaking into pieces .
when we started the project , we started it with the Mosul Museum in mind .
the partial reconstruction of the statue , as well as the Li@@ on of Mosul , the first reconstruction completed by our project .
this is a digital reconstruction from before , and this is actually during the destruction .
we believe 3D printing do@@ es@@ n 't offer a straightforward solution to lost heritage .
for example , I can show you here ...
now , if you look closely , you 'll notice that there are some parts that have been printed in color , and some parts that are in white or gray .
you may be thinking , you did@@ n 't create these 3D models with only tourist photographs , and that 's true .
so we 're already finding photographs to complete a digital reconstruction of this .
but cultural heritage offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people for future generations .
we need your help to re@@ claim the history that is being lost .

so we decided to build the largest smo@@ g vacuum cleaner in the world .
these are smo@@ g @@@ -@@ @ free bicycles which -- I 'm Dutch , yes ? -- I have this " bicycle DNA " inside of me somewhere .

so in 2011 , I altered my name so that I could participate in Far Right youth camp in Hungary .
so a colleague enrolled me , and my last name sounds a little bit too Jewish .
but going to this camp , I was further shocked to realize that it was actually really fun .
and what 's really tragic is that of@@ ten@@ times there 's no one profile .
we saw what they were eating for dinner .
how do we get rid of terrorist content ?
it 's not just recruiting combatants ; it 's trying to build a state .
one is " Ex@@ tre@@ me Dialogue , " and it 's an educational program that we helped develop .
and Africa is a serious place where only serious things happen .
to do this , we 're going to need three technologies to be good enough , and none of them are there yet .
I spent four years trying to analyze it , using standard academic tools , to guess what would happen , and I 'm here to tell you what I found .
now , if you were to spend a lot of time here , you might want a dash@@ board where you could do things like make a phone call , move to a new virtual world , check your bank account .
em world also contains enormous variety .
this is your life : you start and you end , really simple .
they don 't know which way the future 's going .
and that was because the computer could make decisions much faster , it could process a lot more information and it can process decisions much more -- less emo@@ tionally .
naturally , people had different opinions on the matter and how we were approaching the discussion .
the " D@@ ot Collec@@ tor " collects these views .
different people are always going to have different opinions .
I mean , you don 't have to tell somebody that their bal@@ d spot is growing or their baby 's ug@@ ly .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Now , if you 'd waited for one more year , you would have heard this .
( music ) The 10 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old , on every eight notes .
he was the president of a corporation in Ohio .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
the audience gas@@ ped when they heard the difference .
then I got a letter from this gent@@ l@@ eman .
you ad@@ ore classical music . your FM is always on that classical dial .
that 's the second group .
now comes the third group : people who never listen to classical music .
and then there 's a very small group .
you cou@@ ld@@ n 't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome .
but I tell you what .
now , you notice that there is not the s@@ ligh@@ test doubt in my mind that this is going to work , if you look at my face , right ?
it 's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading to realize whatever he 's dre@@ aming .
of course , I 'm not sure they 'll be up to it . "
( la@@ ughter ) All right . so I 'm going to take a piece of Ch@@ op@@ in .
when I started , you thought , " How beautiful that sounds . "
( music ) " I don 't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year . "
then your companion will di@@ g you in the ribs and say , " W@@ ake up ! it 's culture ! " and then you feel even worse .
we have a B. This is a B.
the next note is a C.
( music ) But basically , it 's just a B , with four S@@ ads .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , it goes down to A.
( music ) That might have been a flu@@ ke .
or they say , " Ham@@ let has an O@@ edi@@ pus complex . "
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .

he did not survive .
so what the general straight public saw was this very aw@@ ful thing happening to a group of people who were already on the fr@@ ing@@ es of society .
fear , stigma and shame : these keep those living with HIV in the clos@@ et , so to speak .
but this form was , and it was tremend@@ ously disappointing because it came from such an unlikely source .
you can upload a profile and a picture and it will show you available guys within a radius .
thank you .
but instead of ever feeling fulfilled , I felt anxious and ad@@ ri@@ ft .
but Jonathan insisted on paying , so he went to the store and bought something he did@@ n 't need to make change .
they make them feel invisible and un@@ worthy .
for many people , belonging is the most essential source of meaning , those bonds to family and friends .
of course , for many of us , that happens through work .
of course , you don 't have to find purpose at work , but purpose gives you something to live for , some " why " that drives you forward .
but we don 't always realize that we 're the authors of our stories and can change the way we 're telling them .
that 's what set me on this journey .
of course , the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones .
so , the image of physics -- we 've got an image problem , let 's be honest -- it h@@ as@@ n 't moved on much from this .
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean .
so this is definitely physics happening here -- there 's lots of things -- this is definitely physics .
because I 'm a phy@@ sic@@ ist , there has to be a graph , right ?
that 's allowed .
there 's quantum mechanics down in that corner , it 's very small , it 's very we@@ ir@@ d , it happens very quickly , and it 's a long way down in the general ...
on the scale of anything that matters for everyday life .
and if you go to some places like black holes in the beginning of the universe , we know that these are frontiers in physics , right ?
and the thing about all of these is that they all run on a relatively small number of physical laws , things like New@@ ton 's laws of motion , ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics , some rot@@ ational dynamics .
there 's plenty of physics research going on here .
but because it do@@ es@@ n 't involve pointing at stars , people for some reason think it 's not that .
I want you to tell me which one is which .
and that 's really fundamental in how the universe works .
this is the Hu@@ b@@ ble Space Tel@@ es@@ cope .
the Hu@@ b@@ ble Ul@@ tra De@@ ep Field , which is a very tiny part of the sky .
Hu@@ b@@ ble has been floating in free space for 25 years , not touching anything .
Hu@@ b@@ ble kind of rot@@ ates around them , and so it can orient itself .
so the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use , also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time .
so this is the fun bit of physics , that you learn these patterns and then you can apply them again and again and again .
then I left the stage .
so I think we should play with these patterns .
magne@@ ts that you can play with in your kitchen get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation .
if you 're at a b@@ oring party , fish some rais@@ ins out of the bar snacks , put them in some l@@ em@@ on@@ ade .
you win on all fronts .
there 's these little patterns , and they 're right around us everywhere .
and being familiar with these concepts means we 're not helpl@@ ess .
it 's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions .
and by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life , we gain the confidence to ask the right questions .
all of us can have fun playing with toys , and we shou@@ ld@@ n 't be embar@@ ras@@ sed about it .
and the fundamental physical laws that we can learn that are the way the world around us works , are the tools at the basis of everything ; they 're the foundation .
I 'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are te@@ ac@@ ups around .
the most obvious one is to get a te@@ ac@@ up , get a spo@@ on , tap the te@@ ac@@ up around the rim and listen , and you will hear something strange .
playing with toys is great .
( la@@ ughter ) But of course , I know what they 're really asking , so I say something like , " Well , my grand@@ parents and my m@@ um were born in India , my d@@ ad and I were born in Kenya , and I was brought up in London .
and often the conflict is based on old stories of identity and belonging and origins .
he 's a very high @@@ -@@ @ risk security prisoner in the UK and one of the most important Al Qaeda figures to be arrested in Britain .
what about you , now , listening to this ?
because ib@@ n Rus@@ h@@ d said that something true in religion may conflict with something that your reason finds to be true on earth , but the latter is still true .
there are days when you feel as if you 're floating among the clouds .

these are fragile ecosystems .
now , civil liber@@ tari@@ ans like myself have been trying to draw people 's attention to these things and fighting against them for years .
so please join me , and let 's get to work .
you think about those missile tests , maybe their no@@ torious leader or his good friend , D@@ enn@@ is Rod@@ man .
Mike lost his job to a machine .
so what he 's talking about here is shared production , and efficiency is the name of the game .

it 's that simple .

El@@ iss@@ a 's question to me , back when she first came to my lab , indeed had been a life @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ death question .
can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone ?
people sometimes ask me , how can you be an astro@@ bi@@ ologist if you don 't have your own spac@@ eship ?
to give you an idea of how dry it is , consider here in Vancouver it rains over 1,000 mil@@ lime@@ ters of rain every year .
how do I know this ?
in this place , we reported a new type of micro@@ algae that grew only on top of the spi@@ der@@ web@@ s that covered the cave entrance .
in another cave , we found a different type of micro@@ algae .
when you think of a fish school , or when I think of a flock of star@@ lings , that feels like a really different kind of intelligence .
today I 'm here , actually , to pose you a question .
a lot of things could be studied , but look at that : 30 years ago , we were still poor in China .
I have a very high risk of g@@ out .
I mean , it worked for me .
all those thousands of years of wisdom worked for me .
you have to ask a lot of questions about yourself : " what if ? " -- I 'm being jet @@@ -@@ @ lag@@ ged now here .
these early studies told us , even with the same ban@@ ana , we have totally different gl@@ uc@@ ose @@@ -@@ @ level reactions over different individuals .
I mean , the work is amazing .
giant cl@@ ams are these massive and colorful sh@@ elled marine animals , the largest of its kind .
the biggest recorded individual was four @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half @@@ -@@ @ feet long and weighed about 550 pounds .
street evangel@@ ism is only slightly less u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous than street harassment .
forced evictions are incredibly violent and , of course , unconstitutional .
informal settlements are incorrectly named as the problem .
but there is no reason why their dreams -- or mine , for that matter -- are allowed to come true while those of others are turned to night@@ ma@@ res .
and he said that despite feeling lon@@ ely , he just threw himself at his work , that he built strategies around his g@@ rit and his desire to be successful .

last year , a business partner and I secured a commitment from Whole Fo@@ ods Market , the US 's largest natural food store chain , to carry fon@@ io .
political conversations with our family and friends uncovered a level of polarization that many of us had not previously experienced .
la : and I 'd say I 'm a little to the left , like all the way to the left .
what if , in these heated moments , we chose dialogue over debate ?
but the most significant reason we mar@@ ched as a family is that it was a way for us to honor my parents ' legacy .
it was the boys who wanted to march after they talked about the issues as a family .
but what 's most important about this example is to think about the alternative .
think about it .
and do you know how much it costs for a company to even have an office ?
but that is going to change by the convergence of two technologies : augmented reality and tele@@ presence robots .
well , the robot do@@ es@@ n 't give you any of that .
but today you can do all that online .
a vehicle carrying a squ@@ ad@@ ron of d@@ ron@@ es .
so that 's two .
now , what was the third reason why people move to cities ?
a recent study made in the UK by the Office for National Statistics showed a higher life satisfaction rating among people living in rural areas .
( la@@ ughter ) I just think they will once they realize they can have the same benefits the city has .
and more importantly , do you want to ?
so I brought the dirt to Harvard , ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) precisely 60 tons of dirt right in front of the main facade of the Gradu@@ ate School of Design .
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h .
I had just seen The Green Lady .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
that was very important , and in some sense , we 've lost that .
you want a separate thing , like the AC adap@@ tor .
I did@@ n 't bring one with me , but they really work much better off @@@ -@@ @ board .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
and that 's very important , the user interface .
I 'm willing to suspect some of you had@@ n 't even heard of them before .
and this is the big difference .
so what I want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . I decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it 's not what we 're doing now -- is to go to six countries .
they went to Uruguay , Peru , Mexico .
I 'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me .
I felt a deep sense of dis@@ location and in@@ visibility .
something should stand while Rho@@ des falls , I think that 's what it 's saying . ye@@ ah .
opinions varied , but the media focused on probl@@ em@@ ati@@ zing the removal of stat@@ ues .
and so I started con@@ j@@ uring her mentally , spirit@@ ually and through dress .
on that day , I happened to be having a meeting with my supervisors , and they told me that the statue was going to fall on that day .
this is what I have called " Africa 's knowledge imperative . "
we are content to run our cities and rural dwellings alike on bo@@ re@@ holes .
how does one run me@@ tropol@@ ises on bo@@ re@@ holes and wells ?
it is yet another knowledge crisis regarding Africa 's agricultural resources , what and where they are , and how they can be best managed to make Africans live more lives that are worth living .
they created some of the most original civil@@ iz@@ ational elements for which the United States is now celebrated .
African universities are now all too content to have e @@@ -@@ @ connections with libraries elsewhere , having given up ambitions on building libraries to which the world would come for intellectual edi@@ fication .
take archaeological di@@ gs , for instance , and their impact on tourism .
it 's something that I find immen@@ sely interesting .
so far , over three and a half million people have played it .
so I have a couple of videos .
these are from YouTube .
but what Sil@@ v@@ arre@@ t has done here is that what he wanted to make was not a real city .
this is a fantasy city , even though it looks real .
so what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands .
so the places are really densely populated .
these city designs are what I love the most .
like , it 's not enough to have a hospital .
maybe this is what the future might look like .
so we need the solutions and these people , playing the game , they are trying out different kinds of solutions .
I 've got three boys ; they 're three , nine and 12 .
they 've been more likely to do worse at school , to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money .
so there we have it .
reading to children every day seems to be really important , too .
were the children going to bed at regular times , or did they go to bed at different times during the week ?
so wait , does that actually mean , then , that poverty do@@ es@@ n 't matter after all ?
now that means that poverty leaves a really lasting scar , and it means that if we really want to ensure the success and well @@@ -@@ @ being of the next generation , then tackling child poverty is an incredibly important thing to do .
as a scientist and a journalist , I like to have some science to inform my paren@@ ting ...
now , as you can imagine , the answers are@@ n 't quite as simple as that .
for one thing , this study looks at what happens to thousands and thousands of children on average , but that do@@ es@@ n 't necessarily say what will help my child or your child or any individual child .
of course , I make sure they always have a book to read .
and Nairobi continues to grow in fear @@@ -@@ @ driven ways .
he had an idea .
we were confronted with the hierarchy of decision @@@ -@@ @ making within religious establishments .
I 'm talking about the creature in the box , not my cat .
but it will probably take a lot of time .
but I needed to know . like , I wanted to know .
I don 't have infinite olive branches to extend to people who , like , would not want to see me on this planet . right ?
it is going to happen with or without you .
armed with this information , I made a decision : I was@@ n 't going to be silent anymore .
( la@@ ughter ) Are you ready ?
audience : yes !
I 'm not going to say that you can 't sing that song , but if you are going to sing that song , I do need you to understand the extremely problematic gender construct that it reinforces . "
but , remember -- I came here to play smart , will@@ ful , complicated , interesting complex , confident female characters , right ?
and all of the sudden , I am wrestling with 300 other gor@@ geous , talented women to play ...
( la@@ ughter ) And I said , " Oh . that 's funny .
just so that people will trust you with their money . "
so we make the movie , anyway .
and so you don 't get change by asking them or even y@@ elling at them .
( la@@ ughter ) So , now before I get to my four @@@ -@@ @ point plan for the revolution -- yes , I have a four @@@ -@@ @ point plan -- I have two pieces of very good and important news for you .
but the good news is , we exist , and there is a vast amount of un@@ tapped potential over here .
fact : women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets .
and as you start notic@@ ing this , it 's going to shift your viewing habits .
if we can figure out how to make our movies and deliver them to the audiences that want them , that 's it .
if you can give a female fil@@ m@@ maker 25 dollars in a crow@@ d@@ funding campaign , great , do that .
so now I 'm talking to all of the business@@ people and entrepreneurs .
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption .
come pick it up .
and I definitely want to give a little girl who may not have a real @@@ -@@ @ life role model the chance to watch movies and see women doing everything she dreams of achieving .
looking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact that not much has changed in the education curricula in Africa .
I was in the United States in Washington , DC studying towards my doctorate , and I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region .
and I was intri@@ gu@@ ed . I asked him why .
he said , " Oh , when I go to Africa , it 's so easy .
my bos@@ ses are happy with me . "
and he mentioned a particular country , Asia and some of these countries .
we know our aim . ' and they just keep going through all these things .
" really ? " I thought in my head , " OK . "
I had mostly Euro @@@ -@@ @ Americans , you know , with me from Washington , DC .
that 's a record .
he said that the task ahead of us can never , ever be greater than the power within us .
( appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you . thank you .
" Rob@@ am k@@ b@@ ach Bor@@ an , " or the art of Khmer classical dance , is more than 1,000 years old .
all of these curves create a ser@@ pen@@ tine impression , and this is important because before the introduction of major religions , Kh@@ mers , and people all over the world practiced anim@@ ism .
they t@@ ore families apart and bra@@ in@@ washed children against their own parents .
nearly 40 years later , Khmer classical dance has been revived to new heights .
my name is Pr@@ um@@ so@@ du@@ n O@@ k .
and then they look at it another 50 times during the day .
and if we pre@@ tend that they are@@ n 't , or if we get overwhel@@ med by our fear , kids are never going to learn how and why to use them .
for those few weeks , people got to be creators and inno@@ v@@ ators .
and music has psychological effects on us .
hair up in a bu@@ n that 's the most fun .
top k@@ not turn up , turn up , turn up .
the music pul@@ ls you in via the community aspect of it .
( per@@ cus@@ sion ) Yes .
all my bad habits have got to , got to go .
we were at the border .
it was our last day of fil@@ ming .
and I made it to Chinese soil .
I looked at his eyes .
this time , an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm , because I lost my coat on the frozen river while batt@@ ling with one of these soldiers .
South and North have been under ar@@ mistice for 63 years , since the end of the Korean War .
referring to the cartoon that I just showed you .
every day was like a psychological battle .
and I learned that these girls also grew up watching a similar cartoon , but just propaganda towards South Korea and the US .
his first reaction was , " E@@ una , have you heard of Stockholm Syn@@ drome ? "
there definitely was a wall that we cou@@ ld@@ n 't climb over .
and I 'm in this place where I read and hear about North Korea provo@@ king the US .
I believe we need to ask a different question .
this means at this point supply can no longer keep up with demand despite explo@@ ding prices , unless we can commit to some type of structural change .
but what we care about in food is nutritional value .
India is food self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient and in the past decade has actually been exporting cal@@ ories .
then we add China , the green line .
and even if you have optimistic assumptions around production growth , it will make that slight f@@ lip .
what I just presented to you is a vision of an impossible world .
nothing has happened because those arguments ask the surplus regions to change their behavior on behalf of deficit regions .
this is because , for the first time ever , the most critical tool for success in the industry -- data and knowledge -- is becoming cheaper by the day .
so before I do that , just one warning , which is that this presentation has been rated ' R ' by the Mo@@ tion Pic@@ ture Association of America .
being a gang leader in the inner city was@@ n 't such a bad deal in the mid@@ - ' 8@@ 0s -- the early ' 8@@ 0s , let me say .
it had a huge impact on life .
and for the people who were there running the gang , it was a great way , seemingly , to make a lot of money .
so this is where we enter the picture .
but he hears some voices up in the stair@@ well , so he clim@@ bs up the stair@@ well , comes around the corner , and finds a group of young African @@@ -@@ @ American men playing dic@@ e .
this is a very dangerous job , being in a gang .
it was below the minimum wage . and this is well @@@ -@@ @ documented .
truly , you would be a great success story .
so , with shooting at you , what are the death rates ?
it turns out , the death rates on death row from all causes , including execution : two percent a year .
and then all of my friends said , " May@@ be I should go do that , too . "
and so for instance , one thing the gang would do is -- the gang leaders would have big ent@@ oura@@ ges , and they 'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry .
and really , they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be .
( la@@ ughter ) May@@ be " weak and sh@@ it " is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis .
it 's my science fiction fantasy cure of my own in@@ cu@@ rable disorder .
vision loss has helped to take me away from the things that dis@@ connect me from the world .
I think one of the best parts about this project for me was that I got to hang out with my brother a lot , who lives 2,500 miles away from me .
she reminds me that physical presence is important and that play is not a luxury , but a necessity .
she 's Pi@@ x@@ ie , and she 's our family dog .
workplace rom@@ ance can be a tr@@ ick@@ y topic .
how do we deal with gender imbalances and power dynamics in the workplace ?
in almost all cases , no , you should not date your b@@ oss , because now , you 've got a power dynamic .
the evalu@@ ators were also quick to dismiss their accomplishments .
but you are , and there 's a power dynamic there that 's simply not there for other couples .
people who frequently witness fl@@ ir@@ ting at work -- they actually report feeling less satisfied in their jobs , and they feel less valued by their company .
you certainly need a policy on a sexual harassment , and I think most HR departments recognize that .
but I don 't know if I have it .
I have been propelled by possibility for most of my life .
off the ru@@ gged coast of the pac@@ ific northwest , po@@ ds of kill@@ er wh@@ ales in@@ habit the fri@@ g@@ id waters .
the matri@@ arch shows the younger wh@@ ales where to find the most fertile fishing grounds .
the remaining explo@@ rers hoped for a pre@@ arranged ren@@ de@@ z@@ vous with a team sent from their base , but due to a series of mis@@ haps , mis@@ judgements and mis@@ communications , their rescue never arrived .
today , scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic research stations .
why do I want it ?
but in the pursuit , I became the first black woman to ever become the nom@@ inee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party .
( appl@@ ause ) Our campaign tri@@ pled the number of L@@ ati@@ no@@ s who believed their voices mat@@ tered in the state of Georgia .
but they also let me understand the obstacles are@@ n 't insur@@ moun@@ table .
( la@@ ughter ) And finances are something that holds us back so often , our dreams are b@@ ounded by how much we have in resources .
that 's why God created n@@ aps .
you take an air@@ plane , you fly over the top , you 're weigh@@ tless for 25 seconds .
and my partner By@@ ron L@@ ich@@ ten@@ berg and I carefully suspended him into zero @@@ -@@ @ g .
but it 's so fundamental to everything else in our world .
and so her lawyers and I asked L@@ ily , did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her .
instead , we filed a civil lawsuit , and we eventually won the case , and her case became a r@@ all@@ ying cry for domestic workers everywhere .
and what I thought to myself was : if domestic workers were in charge , this never would have happened .
we live in a time of moral choices everywhere we turn : at the border , at the ballot box , in our workplaces , right in our homes , full of moral choices .
so what does it mean to be a woman ?
they have a mix of chro@@ mos@@ ome types with X , with X@@ Y or with XXX .
if it 's not just about our chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , then what is being a woman about ?
or does it ?
that 's a mou@@ thful , but it 's what 's happening on the micro@@ scale .
to truly understand DNA decision @@@ -@@ @ making , we need to see the process of k@@ not formation in atomic detail .
for that we 'd need a million computers to do that .
that 's exactly what we have at Los Al@@ am@@ os Lab@@ s -- a million computers connected in a giant warehouse .
and the pat@@ chy pattern actually happens in our bra@@ ins and in cancer .
sometimes it raises eye@@ bro@@ ws , but it also raises awareness .
maybe becoming a woman means accepting ourselves for who we really are and acknowledging the same in each other .
all of them use different methods , but they always make sure it 's something that they personally enjoy .
and the same thing happened when I was learning German .
so meeting other poly@@ g@@ lots helped me realize that it is really crucial to find enjoyment in the process of learning languages , but also that joy in itself is not enough .
first of all , you 'll need effective methods .
because that 's really the moment we really know what we 're made of .
as Chris said , I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation -- in the ' 8@@ 0s -- of students who were pro@@ testing a military dictatorship , which has finally ended .
in South Africa , they have a phrase called U@@ buntu .
she was five foot two , very fe@@ i@@ sty and very English .
this is how English my mother is -- or was , she just passed .
D@@ ir@@ ges so mel@@ anch@@ olic that they would scor@@ ch you .
and they would sing them only when they planted the rice , as though they were see@@ ding the hearts of the dead into the rice .
did you also know that after apartheid , when the new government went into the parliament houses , there were no female toilets in the building ?
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women , that 's essentially what it is .
and I was this we@@ ir@@ d , sensitive k@@ id , who cou@@ ld@@ n 't really do it , but I had to do it .
now , when I was growing up , he used to tell me stories about how he used to bay@@ on@@ et people , and their intestin@@ es would fall out , but they would keep running .
anyway , a go@@ at 's eyes are like a child 's eyes .
and then afterwards he said to me , " It will always be difficult , but if you cry like this every time , you will die of heart@@ break .
that 's how I ended up in solitary , because I let my feelings be known .
the Ig@@ bo used to say that they built their own gods .
this is the cover of " Cont@@ ag@@ ious " magazine last year , that was done by using the same ink that we made back in our lab@@ s .
this is a famous painting by the British artist , Christian Fur@@ r , who painted it for the song " P@@ aint It Black " by The Rol@@ ling St@@ ones .
now , there 's more to this pen and this ink than just the popular and pop @@@ -@@ @ culture art@@ works .
it 's made from the same pollution that is inside this pe@@ tr@@ i dish .
suc@@ k it up .
this gr@@ ating cheese was produced in Sic@@ ily and used in dishes all across the Mediterranean .
at the time , they were one of 9@@ 66 counties in the US that had no voting information online .
to K@@ at and Marie , not having and election website was unacceptable , but they did@@ n 't have very many options .
it 's already transformed how we connect with one another and understand the world around us , but our democratic institutions -- they 're being left behind .
so if you 're ready to help millions , if you 're ready to close the gap between the system that we have and the system that we deserve , we need you .
this was my first time there , and as I observed , I saw that there was one person that was responsible for recording the outcome of a conversation .
so here was my opportunity to see exactly how that worked .
nothing really special , but a good pair of hands . "
you CA@@ N@@ NOT have a 100 percent mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic environment when there is a human element involved in the evalu@@ ative equation , because by definition , that makes it subjective .
OK . person can 't be a champion or an advocate , because you don 't necessarily have to spend any currency to be someone 's champion .
it was almost two years later when I realized what this person should be called .
and frankly , why do you need one ? "
so that means it has that measure of subjec@@ tivity .
but here 's where the other currency is now most important .
( la@@ ughter ) And that 's something that could happen .
a nomadic Th@@ rac@@ ian from what is now Bulgaria , he had served in the Roman Army but was imprisoned for deser@@ tion .
as news of the rebellion spread , its ranks s@@ wel@@ led with escaped slaves , deser@@ ting soldiers , and hungry peasants .
the rebels left vic@@ torious , but many lives were lost in the battle , including S@@ part@@ ac@@ us " li@@ eu@@ tenant Cri@@ x@@ us .
after failed attempts to build rafts , and a stin@@ ging betra@@ yal by local pirates , the rebels made a desperate run to break through Cra@@ s@@ sus 's lin@@ es@@ - but it was no use .
of course , I was immediately intri@@ gu@@ ed .
Eu@@ n @@@ -@@ @ So@@ ok was 11 years old .
and this man came to the door and kind of bar@@ ked something in Korean .
and as we started talking , I saw him y@@ ell something , and Eu@@ n @@@ -@@ @ So@@ ok came and brought us some food .
I want him to understand what happens if she stays here .
I don 't pre@@ tend to understand what 's going on here .
and so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Ke@@ ane to find out how the adoption process worked .
this may be one of those myth @@@ -@@ @ bu@@ ster things that we 'll have to clear up here , in a minute .
I 'd been doing this every night I 'd been there .
so the two of us were just like , " Oh my God , oh my God . "
you know what kids are like when they 've been asleep for like an hour , it 's like they took five V@@ ali@@ ums -- they 're all over the place .
his son had the L.@@ L.@@ Be@@ an bo@@ ot@@ l@@ aces , and we 're trying to do up his l@@ aces .
this has got to be a night@@ mare , this can 't be happening .
and the other is un@@ beli@@ evable guilt .
we were both so drunk , I cou@@ ld@@ n 't believe it .
this is saying good@@ b@@ ye to everybody at the orphan@@ age .
I had a wonderful deal with Cath@@ ay Pacific airlines for many years , where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography .
gene and G@@ ay@@ le know everyone in Atlanta -- they 're the most social couple imagin@@ able .
( la@@ ughter ) This is a tense moment in the first football game , I think .
Nat@@ asha : I 've seen pictures millions of times , but today was the first time I 'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .
they vi@@ sibly make a living by asking for donations and by selling pairs of sticks tied with two strings .
this is a single bubble .
this is made from two layers of plastic with four p@@ ins connected to each other .
I am talking about the big ships here , the ones that are used to transport thousands of containers across the ocean .
the bubbles will move to the target areas .
there are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members of their own species , but that happens too .
thirdly , and this hits home .
we want to sw@@ o@@ op in , do our job and leave feeling satisfied that we 've made a difference in somebody 's life .
we leave feeling frustrated and useless .
and you know what ?
at some point , I realized that it is up to us as first respon@@ ders and as a community to solve this problem , to find better ways to deal with those that are suffering .
what makes their situation worse ?
what makes their situation better ?
I began experi@@ menting with my words and paying attention to my own actions and how it affected those of my patients .
the education that I have received and continue to receive on a street level in Hun@@ ting@@ ton has been both eye @@@ -@@ @ opening and life @@@ -@@ @ changing for me .
as a team , they go out and visit people who have over@@ dos@@ ed within 72 hours of that re@@ su@@ sc@@ itation .
they work with them to provide treatment options based on their own needs , individual needs .
this does several things for us .
more and more ...
first respon@@ ders are experiencing compassion fatigue and PT@@ SD .
( la@@ ughter ) And we have some off @@@ -@@ @ duty programs that we 've started , like cooking classes for first respon@@ ders and their significant other and pot@@ tery classes .
and I had@@ n 't seen that in years .
and that relaxed state is tr@@ ick@@ ling down to the community , to the citizens .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old .
talking in a non @@@ -@@ @ judg@@ mental way .
I watched as one of my fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters showed the father and another family member how to provide rescue brea@@ ths , should this happen again .
positive change .
did I happen to mention the two things that fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters dis@@ like the most ?
and I 've seen what crack can do to a community .
but right now , what I know is people are dying .
and we in Hun@@ ting@@ ton deal with people suffering from substance use disorder of every color and every background , on the streets , every day .
the job of a first respon@@ der : prevent unnecessary deaths .
so ...
just by listening and being kind to somebody , you have the ability to make a difference in their lives .
representation matters .
authentic representations of women matter .
exceptional women are inspiring and aspir@@ ational .
there is a movement from within museums themselves to help combat this bias .
museums are did@@ actic .
and there are hard tru@@ ths about being a woman , especially a woman of color in this industry , that prevents us from c@@ entering inclusive examples of women 's lives .
pipelines to leadership for women are bl@@ ea@@ k -- ble@@ ak@@ est for women of color .
or immigrant women , or Asian women , or Native women , or trans women , or undocumented women , or women over 65 , or girls -- the list can go on and on and on .
and after I finished , I went to this area , the Ituri Forest .
and my father was a soldier , and my uncle was a fisher@@ man and also a po@@ ach@@ er .
but finally , I got myself involved .
on their way , they looted everything .
I 've been working with him about 10 years .
he has been attacked by a le@@ op@@ ard and they abandon him in the forest .
we don 't think so .
we started talking with them and I was negotiating .
and I was mad .
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dis@@ sect it , until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander .
everybody is happy , but see what it 's doing , see what is going in Darfur .
and despite everything , I still believe in America .
I was giving a talk at a Christian college a number of years ago , and after my talk , a fellow scientist came up and he said , " I need some help .
because no matter where we live , climate change is already affecting us today .
( la@@ ughter ) But fear is not what is going to motivate us for the long @@@ -@@ @ term , sustained change that we need to fix this thing .
yes .
they also have a pan@@ da @@@ -@@ @ shaped solar farm .
she cou@@ ld@@ n 't work , soci@@ alize , or even concentrate well enough to read the newspaper .
one treatment changed everything .
at first , she talked openly about her life changing treatment .
the only physical indication of the electricity flooding the brain is a t@@ wit@@ ching foot .
the treatment lasts for about a minute , and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an hour after each session .
some have trouble rememb@@ ering what happened right before a session - for example , what they had for dinner the previous evening .
ne@@ ur@@ ons in the brain communicate via electrical signals , which influence our brain chemistry , contributing to mood and behavior .
for example , EC@@ T triggers the release of certain neuro@@ transmit@@ ters , molecules that help carry signals between ne@@ ur@@ ons and influence mental health .
a public , De@@ we@@ y long ago observed , is constituted through discussion and debate .
but the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems .
we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world , in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accoun@@ ta@@ bilities that are truly global in scope .
we have three critical terms : economy , civil society and the state .
the first challenge is to re@@ think , fundamentally , the issue of the time .
the absolute majority of the world 's population are below 20 , and they are growing larger and faster .
you stay away from design for development .
Ash@@ ra@@ f Ghan@@ i : what sca@@ res me most is -- is you , lack of your engagement .
abandonment .
and I told them -- my people , with the Americans here -- separate .
the U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff .
the textile industry is incredibly mobile .
you know , the aid system , at first , was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries , not to generate growth in the poor countries .
and one of the good things about this cure was that it was free , virtually free , and was very easy to use .
and the people were happy . they were satisfied .
but he knew about the cheap and simple one .
and so if we look at recent crashes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years ' worth of data -- you won 't see it in the recent crashes . the new car seats are far , far better . "
but indeed , in recent crashes the lap @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ shoulder se@@ at@@ belts , actually , are doing even better than the car seats .
they say , " Well , that 's impossible , that can 't be . "
but what 's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much .
it really is based on some imp@@ assi@@ oned ple@@ as of parents whose children died after they turned two , which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data .
so they just have these bench seats , and they strap the car seat and the se@@ at@@ belt onto it .
it 's hard to believe , when you look at this , that that k@@ id in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash .
it seems to me that this can 't be a very expensive solution , and it 's got to work better than what we already have .
and I think the answer , perhaps , lies in a story .
I 've made him run into a wall here , over and over again .
they are a graphical visu@@ alization of a character .
so , he or she sits down , anim@@ ates it , and tries to anticipate what 's going to happen , and then these particular anim@@ ations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game .
it 's a very tri@@ vial thing .
and for that , we use the ne@@ ural network , which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans .
we did get it to work eventually , after t@@ we@@ aking a bit here and there .
and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , after five generations of applying evolutionary process , the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better .
and what you see is , it 's going to fall over the obstacle .
now , this might look kind of tri@@ vial , but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further , because obviously this was just a very simple , block@@ y bi@@ ped .
what we really wanted was a full human body .
it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it .
but what it will do -- I 'm going to push it again .
now , it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well .
what you see is it takes steps back@@ wards , it tries to counter @@@ -@@ @ balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land .
because stun@@ ts are obviously very dangerous , they 're very expensive , and there are a lot of st@@ unt scenes that you CA@@ N@@ NOT do , obviously , because you can 't really allow the stun@@ t@@ man to be seriously hurt .
now , here 's another one .
so I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take @@@ -@@ @ a@@ ways , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year .
I 'm very proud because I think I 'm the only person in America to out Bible @@@ -@@ @ talk a Jehovah 's W@@ itness .
they have a pamph@@ let that says , " Here 's what Jesus said about homosexuality , " and you open it up , and there 's nothing in it .
and finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose .
" F@@ lam@@ in ' Red ho@@ ts . "
and I refuse to be an accompl@@ ice to genocide .
next , while E@@ it@@ ri worked a block of gold , the fly bit Bro@@ k@@ k on the neck .
after years of experiments , you 've finally created the pets of the fu@@ tu@@ re@@ - n@@ ano @@@ -@@ @ ra@@ bb@@ its !
that means you don 't actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold all the ra@@ bb@@ its - and the reproduction is already underway !
to make matters worse , your devices and calcul@@ ators are all mal@@ functioning , so you only have a few minutes to work it out by hand .
but how can we know how many tra@@ iling zer@@ os a number has without calculating the number itself ?
so there 's three people in front of the Ro@@ th@@ ko on the left , so you take the third letter , which is a T.
you do that for all 10 of the original artists and put them in the order , and you get the answer , which is " illumin@@ ate . "
( la@@ ughter ) Pu@@ zzles like this are about communicating an idea .
what I did@@ n 't mention before is that the prize for winning is that you get to construct the whole hun@@ t for the following year .
whether you give them stars on a keyboard or play the cel@@ estial music of the cos@@ mos , you 're getting them there , one way or another .
this might be a familiar experience to you , if you 've ever been watching a TED Talk and asked yourself , " Is this a puzzle ? "
it 's really fun , but no more winning . "
whether you 're in a subway , a park , an airport , a restaurant , even at this conference , all of you have a phone in your hands or maybe in your pockets .
I moved into a single large room in a cheap bo@@ hem@@ ian district of Delhi , with a small team .
it 's not an exagg@@ eration to say that a threat to the ozone layer is a threat to human safety .
are there any ? I think there are .
and so ask yourself , did you wear your seat belt because someone told you with a hundred percent [ certainty ] that you would get in a car crash on the way here ?
you CA@@ N@@ NOT build a light bulb by building better and better cand@@ les .
to make this happen , you may remember getting an email ahead of time , from TED , asking you whether you would choose to f@@ lip the coin or not , if you played the game .
( la@@ ughter ) So how did it achieve this amazing winning st@@ rea@@ k ?
and thirdly , my favorite quantum application is tele@@ portation of information from one location to another without physically transmitting the information .
so it 's a lot of fun for me , being a quantum phy@@ sic@@ ist .
we don 't want to continue to try to , like , look at the next 100 years and be granted , gr@@ ud@@ g@@ ingly , small legal rights and accommodations .
I think that women are tired of retro@@ fitting ourselves into institutions and governments that were built by men , for men , and we 'd rather resha@@ pe the future on our own terms .
and so I 've given some thought about how to build this women 's political revolution and that 's what I want to talk to you about today .
and when my grand@@ mother got pregnant , of course she was not going to go to the hospital to deliver , she was going to have that baby at home .
we 're half the medical students , we 're half the law students -- Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
but when it comes to government , it 's another story , and I actually think a picture is worth 1000 words .
and as white women , we have to do more , because racism and sex@@ ism and hom@@ ophobia , these are issues that affect all of us .
when a virus inv@@ ades a bacter@@ ium , C@@ as proteins cut out a segment of the viral DNA to sti@@ tch into the bacter@@ ium 's CR@@ IS@@ PR region , capturing a chemical snap@@ shot of the infection .
those viral codes are then copied into short pieces of R@@ NA .
here 's how it works in the lab : scientists design a " guide " R@@ NA to match the gene they want to edit , and attach it to Cas@@ 9 .
many may not think of cats as servic@@ eable sail@@ ors , or cooperative compan@@ ions of any kind .
the main differences being that ancient Wil@@ d@@ cats were more mus@@ cular , had stri@@ ped co@@ ats , and were less social towards other cats and humans .
the abundance of prey in ro@@ dent @@@ -@@ @ in@@ fe@@ sted gran@@ aries drew in these typically solitary animals .
in other words , cats today are more or less as they 've always been : wild animals .
I knew from the time I was three or four years of age that I was transgender .
I think he liked them .
still , somehow I ended up in ministry .
but I was certain that we were going to see this through to redemption .
but we can look outside , very chea@@ ply and in a simple fashion .
you see the red g@@ low in their eyes , which is the reflection of the flash@@ light .
so as you go further away from the Sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
they look like , maybe like sun@@ flowers .
they pine for love , they live for love , they kill for love , and they die for love .
they 've never found a society that did not have it .
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you .
we found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses .
the question that I 'm working on right this minute -- and I 'm only going to say it for a second , and then end -- is , why do you fall in love with one person , rather than another ?
no , they 've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship .
we swi@@ vel towards each other , we do what we call the " anch@@ oring gaz@@ e " and we talk .
and there 's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding .
most people live as if they 're never going to die .
I 've seen them in those agon@@ izing moments when they were sca@@ red to death .
he was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39 .
they 're attempting to st@@ ow her pos@@ sessions securely into wagons .
her fingers it@@ ched to pr@@ y it open .
we all know that saving is important and is something that we should be doing .
the question is : how do we do it ?
here 's number one : harness the power of pre @@@ -@@ @ commitment .
so take a moment and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self for something that you know today will be a little bit hard .
so right now , put a meeting request on your calendar for the day before your next birthday .
no matter what I 've done , what I 've tried to do , everybody says it can 't be done .
it 's Cal@@ vin@@ o 's idea of the quick@@ est way between two points is the circu@@ itous line , not the straight line .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilome@@ ter , observing every kilome@@ ter a particular object of desire , and then placing that within this .
again , a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated , very large @@@ -@@ @ scale organisms .
architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place .
it 's the clothing , the skin , without the presence of the character .
and now it turned into something much , much broader as a problem , and it has to do with performance .
there it is model@@ ed as it was developing into a piece of work .
it 's an idea that started from my first discussion .
and then of course , this one , our governor at the moment .
here 's a piano no@@ bile , which is a device used in the Renaissance .
thank you so much .
have you ever heard of second sight ?
kt : God .
kt : look at the road -- ( Be@@ ep ) S@@ till got that go@@ d@@ dam@@ n blind@@ fold on .
kt : that is we@@ ir@@ d .
so , I stopped pretty quick , and that was it .
you might want to use the stairs , there .
your name is ? Nic@@ ole : Nic@@ ole .
I want you to be aware of the sens@@ ations , but don 't say anything until I ask you , and don 't open your eyes until I ask you .
has anybody here seen that film ? ye@@ ah .
sometimes the object will slide across the table , sometimes it will not .
we 're going to try an experiment in psycho@@ k@@ ine@@ sis , right now .
Ste@@ ve Jur@@ vet@@ son : MM@@ M , yes .
tell me when I 'm over a cup .
( la@@ ughter ) KB : I told you I 'd have the last laugh .
S@@ J : can we do the left hand ?
KB : OK . do you think it 's here , yes or no ? this is your decision , not mine .
do you think the spi@@ ke is under your left or your right hand ?
S@@ J : Oh !
however , I don 't see it as the noise of the car .
as soon as it moves , it creates this as@@ cending high @@@ -@@ @ frequency pitch sound , which we called " whi@@ st@@ ling " sound .
together with a small team , we create lots of sonic tex@@ tures that are able to transmit emo@@ tion .
[ sound is hy@@ p@@ no@@ tizing . ] And sound has the power to create an unexpected sense of wonder , which Hy@@ p@@ no@@ tiz@@ es .
if I would start to play the viol@@ in , I would generate a sound field which would propag@@ ate in this hall , and at some point , the sound field would hit the side walls and would be scattered all over the place .
and this is how it looked like .

American women said to L@@ en , when he dated them , " You 're no fun . you don 't have positive emo@@ tion . get lost . "
it turned out that -- L@@ en grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football , and played bridge .
and the answer seems to be yes .
when you do something philanthro@@ pic to help another person , it lasts and it lasts .
and our results surprised us ; they were backward of what we thought .
and there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes .
so , Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard , and so this was amazing for me .
so in conclusion , the eleventh reason for optimism , in addition to the space elevator , is that I think with technology , entertainment and design , we can actually increase the amount of tonn@@ age of human happiness on the planet .
and about 40 percent of them would say they 're happy at work .
it 's not about the per@@ ks .
employees want to be treated the same , regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age or their experience or their job category , compared to anyone else .
the one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they 're speaking is to know that what they say matters so much you might actually change your mind .

well , here we are on a re@@ purpos@@ ed Air Force cargo plane operated by NASA flying over the Greenland ice sheet .
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics , which are located in one of the most remote physical environments remaining on earth .
you can see that some areas of the ice sheet mel@@ t or lose ice in the summer .
well , under the ice lies the bedro@@ ck .
we used radar to image the hills , val@@ leys , mountains and de@@ pres@@ sions that the ice flows over .
the reason that radar can reveal the bedro@@ ck is that ice is entirely transparent to radar .
just six years ago , we had no idea this gl@@ ac@@ ier aquifer existed .
does the water stay there forever ?
pressuri@@ zed fluids frac@@ ture rocks .
all it takes is a crack to get started .
to answer these questions , we need something beyond remote sensing data .
that 's about as cold as your kitchen freezer .
so the aquifer water is a part of the three mil@@ lime@@ ters per year of sea level rise that we experience as a global society .
in other places , not so fast .

I 'd had some previous judo training .
according to a National Black Women 's Justice Institute analysis of civil rights data collected by the US Department of Education , black girls are the only group of girls who are over@@ represented along the entire continuum of discipline in schools .

gender and climate are inextricably linked .
we can feel the connections between us .
and we , all of us , we are life force .
too often , the story ends here .

compared with men , women small@@ holders have less access to resources , including land rights , credit and capital , training , tools and technology .
we humans need land to grow food .
but if existing farms produce enough food , forests are less likely to be lost .
education is one side of a coin .
curbing the growth of our human population is a side effect , though a potent one .
( la@@ ughter ) Th@@ ough we probably will .
we have the most to do .
this earth , our home , is calling for us to be bold , reminding us we are all in this together -- women , men , people of all gender identities , all beings .
so when she began to disappear for days at a time , I turned to some magic of my own .
but if my perfect walk could not bring my mother back , I found that this approach had other uses .
does she look back because she wanted to be sure that her people were far enough from danger to breathe a little easy ?
here is the usual version of climate change .
nothing much , just a cro@@ co@@ d@@ ile on the street .
this land has no room for water .

I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
what if she saw the truth after just one year , what would she do for the next 35 years in her life ?

J@@ H : so if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .

it 's very common among highly creative people , both artists and scientists , and I 'd like to give it a name : slow @@@ -@@ @ motion multi@@ t@@ asking .

anger is a human emo@@ tion , neither good nor bad .
what happens too often is that for all of us , indign@@ ity becomes imminent in our notions of femin@@ inity .
if we 're faced with a threatening street har@@ asser , pre@@ datory employer , a sex@@ ist , racist class@@ mate , our bra@@ ins are scre@@ aming , " Are you kid@@ ding me ? "
if you ask women what they fear the most in response to their anger , they don 't say violence .
if you have multiple marginalized identities , it 's not just mo@@ ck@@ ery .
I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired .
there is anger that 's acceptable .
we can take emotions and think in terms of competence and not gender .
most of them are now investing their funds on women 's health , education , skill development and safe drinking water .
we have all had such tests .

to be new at TED -- it 's like being the last high @@@ -@@ @ school vir@@ gin .

I don 't respond to testosterone , so during pu@@ ber@@ ty , I grew brea@@ sts , but I never got ac@@ ne or body hair , body oil .
( la@@ ughter ) But even though I don 't actually have a uter@@ us -- I was born without one , so I don 't men@@ stru@@ ate , I can 't have biological children .
are they kind , generous , funny ?
who do they want to be when they grow up ?
in this society , we love putting people into boxes and lab@@ eling each other .
you have your internal sex organs , your hormone production , your hormone response and your secondary sex characteristics , like breast development , body hair , etc .
those seven areas of biological sex all have so much variation , yet we only get two options : male or female .
did you know that besides XX or X@@ Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , you could have XX and X@@ Y chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es ?
and everyone 's favorite part , gen@@ it@@ alia : you either have one or the other , right ?
you know the one .
just notice .
we 're not new or rare .
we 're just invisible .
we 've existed throughout every culture in history .
a friend of mine found out last year , in his 50s .
I also had doctors lie to me .
they 're not responding to testosterone , they 're not producing sperm .
we often place unrealistic expectations on the things that our bodies do that are outside of our control .
( la@@ ughter ) We constantly change and evolve , the more we understand as a society .
what they do is they cement to each other , and they build these huge , extensive ree@@ f systems .
so they 're really quite influential .
and then another thing is it also helps with reproductive efficiency .
I think of this as like that , except for it 's real , in this case .
and I just think it 's a really cool image , because you can imagine yourself flying in and going back there .
but what we do want to do with this information ?
so imagine you 're at home and you break your favorite fig@@ urine or a mu@@ g or something like that ?
we need to scale this up , ideally maybe train car scale .
and here 's something else that we can do .
so this is a tank of sea@@ water , and then , in that sy@@ rin@@ ge is one of our adhesive formulations , and what we 're doing is we 're dispen@@ sing it completely underwater , on a piece of metal .
and then , we want to make an adhesive bond , or joint , and so we take another piece of metal and we put it on there and just position it .
I 'm always very anxious here .
and it 's stuck .
so we can actually get very strong underwater adhesion .
it 's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce , so for us , it 's pretty exciting . it 's pretty cool .
so think about your cell phone , your laptop , pl@@ y@@ wood in most structures , the interior of your car , shoes , phone books , things like this .
it 's just aw@@ ful . it hur@@ ts .
you 're making sites for infection .
to me , it looks like these were things devised in a medieval torture chamber , but it 's our modern surgical join@@ ery .
you don 't want to hurt the patients .
it 's been done many times . but getting all three h@@ as@@ n 't been done .
so what we 're doing is we 're getting all sorts of bones and skin and soft and hard tissue , and sometimes we 'll wh@@ ack it with a ham@@ mer .
especially through architecture , you 're trying to challenge pre@@ conceptions and push boundaries and inno@@ vate , even if just using what we have around and we overlook all the time .
and we are observing that the results are intri@@ gu@@ ing .
and we are doing it ourselves with our hands in our shop , and we are architects . we 're not professional builders but we want to make sure it 's possible .
and it 's so nice that Ant@@ Ã³n can move it with his hands and J@@ avier can put it in a container , and we can ship it like you would ship your belongings if you were moving abroad ...

so in which corner should you place the diff@@ user to flood the v@@ amp@@ ire la@@ ir with sunlight ?
and indeed , when that precious beam of sunlight enters the hall , it b@@ oun@@ ces between the walls and strikes the Southeast corner , spot on .
and if you take all these things that are impossible , I think one of the things that we 're learning from this era , from this last decade , is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible , because we 're un@@ prepared for it .
and it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we 've ever made .
there 's two million emails per second .
so every second , half of the Library of Congress is sw@@ o@@ osh@@ ing around in this machine . it 's a big machine .
we 're giving it a body . and that 's what we 're going to do in the next 5,000 days -- we 're going to give this machine a body .
but everything , all the cameras , and the micro@@ phones , and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine .
and I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web .
so that the laws of media , such as the fact that copies have no value , the value 's in the un@@ cop@@ i@@ able things , the immedi@@ acy , the authentication , the person@@ alization .
the media wants to be liquid .
and so , giving an example of this thing , I live in Pac@@ ific@@ a , rather than -- right now Pac@@ ific@@ a is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere .
but we can also think about it as kind of a large organism .

how does that compare with the way computers work ?
and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity , just by it flowing through the network .
we 've all experienced the frustration of an old smartphone or tablet grinding slowly to a halt over time under the ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing weight of software updates and new features .
and this process has been dramatically improved over the years to give the electronics performance we have today .

we hit the last gl@@ ac@@ ial maximum around 16,000 years ago , but basically , from 70,000 years on , things were getting really tough , getting very cold . the Northern Hem@@ is@@ phere had massive growing ice sheets .
and the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets , compared to what we have today .
we nearly went extin@@ c@@ t . we were hanging on by our finger@@ nails .
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa , and they allowed us to start to expand around the world .
and it 's basically a meat loc@@ ker .
the grass@@ lands at that time -- this was during the last ice age -- stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea , and the entire continent was open to them .

so what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars , that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside .
when those measurements are made , instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant , as a function of distance .
gal@@ ax@@ ies themselves are not stre@@ wn randomly in space ; they tend to cluster .

we extrapol@@ ate back@@ wards and say the gal@@ axy is up here .

because we talk about it in big terms , and you wonder , you know , so what ?
but it 's damaging .
and you did@@ n 't know about the wind@@ mill , you know ?
he was like , I try and I make .
first of all , Africans , we need to get better at telling our stories .
S@@ wa@@ hil@@ i is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa .
( la@@ ughter ) But the point I 'm trying to make , though , is that it 's not enough for us to criticize .
and we give them business development services , as well as financing loan and equity .
and basically , we started this because we were tired of complain@@ ing about our politicians .
what are they doing ?
they come from us .
people are like , " OK , if you don 't do aid , I 'm a bleeding heart liberal , what can I do ? "
my cous@@ in ran out of school fees , and she 's really smart .
and he said , " Lo@@ ok , you can get into Harvard , you 're that good , OK ?
basically , I want to end with my vision for Africa , you know ?
you know , my vision is that my daughter , and any other African child being born today , can be whoever they want to be here , without having to leave .
I would like to see that change , and the change starts with us .
and there are a lot of people doing this , a lot of synthetic bi@@ ologists doing this , like Cra@@ ig V@@ enter .
you can look in this computer @@@ -@@ @ fabricated arti@@ fact , and he 's got a double @@@ -@@ @ str@@ an@@ ded gen@@ ome -- that 's no good .
you look in his intestin@@ es . there are billions of bacteria .
and here 's how we do it .
now , we can 't actually take a movie of this process , but Sha@@ wn Dou@@ gl@@ as at Harvard has made a nice visu@@ alization for us that begins with a long str@@ and and has some short str@@ ands in it .
that holds the long str@@ and like this .
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye , down the nose , up the nose , around the fore@@ head , back down and end in a little loop like this .
and so , I got this in the mail about a year after I did this , un@@ solicited .
you get a high @@@ -@@ @ level description of the computer program , a high @@@ -@@ @ level description of the orig@@ ami .
the fact is that it does not scale .
so , that answers that sort of first question I was talking about .
you can just change a couple of the DNA str@@ ands in this binary representation and you 'll get 96 rather than 32 .
so , you can ask , how many DNA str@@ ands are required to build a square of a given size ?
that 's really not affordable .
so it 's got some errors , but at least it counts up .
and I think in the next five or 10 years , we 'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self @@@ -@@ @ assembled circuits .
what it 's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light , asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things . thank you .
the doctor looked at her , did@@ n 't shake her hand and said , " Why are you here ? "
these are all my@@ ths and un@@ true .
and what this means is , before , we always thought there was only two , male and female .
now , you may be thinking , " Dr. K@@ ris@@ tie , I have never questioned who I am .
a transgender male is someone who was assigned female at birth , but their sense of self , who they are , how they live their life , is as a male .
three very different identity spectr@@ ums .
now , the average medical student spends about five hours learning about the LGBT health @@@ -@@ @ related needs while they 're in medical school .
so what about the rest of us ?
what will you do ?
and that 's no different from Imperial College in London , by the way , it 's not some sort of anti @@@ -@@ @ American thing going on .
it 's so easy , is@@ n 't it ? of course , you all knew that .
I promise you that most of you will have got that .
what sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system , to show that it 's not really like that ?
S@@ W : ye@@ ah . she would get really , really excited .
E : [ spac@@ eship noise ] S@@ W : even if it do@@ es@@ n 't have a laser ?
because one of her favorite fol@@ ks from back home is here , and she 's pretty nervous to meet him .
E : O@@ i@@ NK , o@@ ink , o@@ ink .
one of the things that we did with the An@@ s@@ ari X PR@@ I@@ Z@@ E was take the challenge on that risk is OK , you know .
we know -- 20 million dollars today , you can go and buy a ticket , but how cheap could it get ?
it 's about 5.7 gig@@ aj@@ ou@@ les of energy .
( la@@ ughter ) But guys , if history has taught us anything , it 's that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
I have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
by ' 08 , sub@@ orbital flights , the price tag for that , you know , on Virgin , is going to be about 200,000 .
you get publicity increase , and when it 's won , publicity sho@@ ots through the roof -- if it 's properly managed -- and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor .
you know , inno@@ v@@ ators , the entrepreneurs out there , you know that when you 're going for a goal , the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself .
we are looking at a number of energy prizes .
yet , I 'd argue that no other continent has nur@@ tured , has fought for , has celebrated its history more concer@@ tedly .
history matters .
history really matters .
they knew that controlling territory and sub@@ ju@@ gating the head of state -- it was@@ n 't enough .
in 18@@ 71 , Kar@@ l Mau@@ ch , a German ge@@ ologist working in Southern Africa , he stum@@ bled across an extraordinary complex , a complex of abandoned stone buildings .

we have to re@@ discover African philosophy , African perspectives , African history .
and like him , I loved everything about it : the show@@ manship , the athle@@ tic skill , the drama .
in fact , I did it so well , I was the only guard to get a close @@@ -@@ @ up on TV that night .
( la@@ ughter ) I mean , it was just the one time , and my daughter was clearly f@@ ou@@ led !
but then I think , " He@@ y , I 've wrest@@ led in less . "
thank you .
and these future mus@@ ings were always presented to me like part of this American dream , but it always felt to me like someone else 's dream .
and as a k@@ id , when I would try to explain this , this dis@@ connect between their roles and my values , they often laugh@@ ed in the way that adults do at the absur@@ di@@ ties of children .
and " my long @@@ -@@ @ term partner has this kind of business , " and " I 've done research on this for months .
( la@@ ughter ) that this supported something integral to who I was .
" how does he or she feel about all of this ? "
my stance on child@@ bearing has always been first date conversation .
the European Commission has dealt with already seven different car parts cartels , and we 're still investigating some .
of course , to some degree , technology can help us to build trust in one another with ratings systems and other systems that enable the sharing economy .
and that can help us build the trust that we need for real innovation to flourish and for societies to develop for citizens .
nobody 's going to want to do the same thing for 60 years .
lesson six : your company needs to live out its values .
here are two images of a house .
however , noise affects our health in many different ways beyond hearing .
so what do we mean when we talk about noise ?
sleep is a very active mechanism that rec@@ uper@@ ates us and prepares us for the next wake period .
also , talk to your children about the health effects of noise and that listening to loud music today will have consequences when they 're older .
use that information .
and we recognized -- and I think every year we 're reminded of this in the world -- that predic@@ ting what 's going to happen is hard .
B@@ F : so what does that mean , and what does that tell us ?
RB : you can 't eat dignity . you need stability first .
because what we need to do from the beginning is understand what is it about work that gives people dignity , so they can live the lives that they want to live .
and then you think about our culture more broadly , and you ask : who do we make into heroes ?
that 's the Net@@ f@@ li@@ x show that I would bin@@ ge .

we come into the era of the do@@ t@@ com , the World Wide Web , and I don 't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together .
and that 's the kind of resolution that you need to begin to image that little spec@@ k of dust as it comes around the sun and see if it has a blue @@@ -@@ @ green signature .
it means that we 're beginning to learn how to read this language .
so this is the world 's first synthetic life form .
it 's just ones and zer@@ oes flying through there .
if you can flow AT@@ C@@ Gs through cells , then this software makes its own hardware , which means it scales very quickly .
DNA is a really powerful information storage device .
and a lot of us think , " Oh no , we never want to re@@ design humans . "
unless , of course , if your child has a Hun@@ ting@@ ton 's gene and is condemned to death .
other people say , " This is one of the things that 's killing millions of people yearly .
he 's had the precursor of the R@@ NA be absorbed by the cell and then he 's had the cells divide .
so we 're getting to the point where we can rebuild most of our body parts , in the same way as if you break a bone or burn your skin , it reg@@ rows .

this is at 17,000 feet .
as a teen@@ ager , he faced the invasion of his country , and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country .
and this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago .
so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior .
as the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals , so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual 's life history .
and young ch@@ imp@@ an@@ ze@@ es spend a lot of time watching what their elders do .
they 're capable of extreme brutality , even a kind of primitive war .
and these decisions affect Africa .
the most important message of Ro@@ ots and Sho@@ ots : every single one of us makes a difference , every single day .
the Ro@@ ots and Sho@@ ots groups all choose three projects .
and just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring .
people like this are the role models we need for young Africans .
and I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things , especially the Ro@@ ots and Sho@@ ots program .
and just a last word on that -- the young woman who 's running this entire conference center , I met her today .
thank you .
people who are high in openness to experience just cra@@ ve novel@@ ty , variety , diversity , new ideas , travel .
you can predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to and what kinds of food they like to eat .
well , let 's see now .
let 's find out .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) So if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blin@@ ded in this way , then my message to you is that you 're trapped in a moral Mat@@ rix , in a particular moral Mat@@ rix .
anyway , let 's go with the red pill , study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
that second foundation under@@ lies the other 30 percent of the moral statements I 've heard here at TED .
and this tribal psychology is so deeply plea@@ su@@ rable that even when we don 't have tribes , we go ahead and make them , because it 's fun .
I mean , we debate over what 's fair , but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter .
suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent @@@ -@@ @ minded and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal .
because liber@@ als like to say , " Fe@@ tch ! please . "
( la@@ ughter ) You might say , OK , there are differences between liber@@ als and conserv@@ atives , but what makes the three other foundations moral ?
are@@ n 't they the foundations of xenophobia , author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism and pur@@ it@@ anism ?
all is ordered , all is beautiful , all the people and animals are doing what they 're supposed to be doing , are where they 're supposed to be .
if you 're high in openness to experience , revolution is good ; it 's change , it 's fun .
you have the markings of V@@ ish@@ nu on the left , so we could think of V@@ ish@@ nu as the conservative god .
thank you .
I wrote a column in People magazine at the time , talking about the importance of names and how names are our identity .
and that 's the name all of us now use .
and to them , call@@ outs for civil@@ ity are really very much like what George Or@@ well wrote in " 1984 " -- he called it " new@@ speak . "
and I took that to heart , it was very -- The audience was very engaged about that online , as you can imagine .
I 'll call it light and flu@@ ff@@ y .
because then , a few months later , he came to my door , my front door , in a rage and tried to break the door down .
they 're incen@@ diary and they do not allow us to find common ground .
when you have a specific word , though , to describe a problem like that , you know you really have a problem .
but therein lies the third rule : Don 't mistake decor@@ um for civil@@ ity .
so I think civil@@ ity , with that understanding , is not a dirty word .
thank you .
most of the earthquakes and volcan@@ oes are in the sea , at the bottom of the sea .
most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this .
because we see it in bits and pieces right now .
not only that , but on top -- the life@@ blood -- that plum@@ bing system turns off every year or so .
is it fragile ? no , it 's not really very fragile .
I 'll end up with saying one thing .
it 's absurd . it 's just absurd .
learn to manage it .
conservation 's tough@@ er , but we can probably get there .
so what made James Bal@@ d@@ win lo@@ om so large in the imag@@ inations of both the public and the authorities ?
by delivering ser@@ mons , he developed his voice as a writer , but also grew conflic@@ ted about the Church 's stance on racial inequality and homosexuality .
set in Har@@ le@@ m , the book explo@@ res the Church as a source of both repression and hope .
they said , " We don 't know , " or , " Our lawyers won 't let us tell you that , " though we did get a lot of information .
these pricing variations existed for all the procedures and all the cities that we surveyed .
a San Francisco contributor saved nearly 1,300 dollars by putting away his insurance card and paying cash .
there are a lot of people who are going to in @@@ -@@ @ network hospitals and getting out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ network bills .
and then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man .
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
somebody once said , Al Qaeda does not have a return address , so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon , what 's the response , and to whom is the response ?
it becomes very portable .
you can 't get an exact number for that kind of probability , but what I 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhel@@ med psych@@ ologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
we can change the survival rates by doing some common@@ sen@@ sical things . "
once you 're out and evacu@@ ating , you want to keep as much of your skin , your mouth and nose covered , as long as that covering do@@ es@@ n 't impede you moving and getting out of there .
and this is a real crisis for them .
now , the end product of that action is up on the board here .

" cam@@ els are like angels , " a Bedouin once said .
it 's kind of an inspiring statement , and I 'll go back at the end of this .
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
and it turns out to not be very hard .
so the idea of -- this technology actually may end up putting books back in people 's hands again .
now let 's go for audio , and I 'm going to go through these .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
and we 've got , now , a lot of these materials .
so books , music , video , software . there 's only 50,000 titles of it .
you still with me ? ( la@@ ughter ) I called her up .
when L@@ exus wants to sell you a car , they 're telling you a story .
we went from Havana , Cuba to Dec@@ at@@ ur , Georgia .
I called my mother , and she said , " Car@@ men , I need you to come , please .
that 's why they call them that .
( la@@ ughter ) This is her ensemble .
" Mom@@ my , I know you have been stopped . "
" I did not get a ticket . "
this is new and fast , just so you -- are you still with us ?
she wi@@ elds great power .
Don 't you want to look ?
this is the US@@ DA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
and why can they serve that much ?
now I don 't know if any of you out there invented chicken n@@ ug@@ gets , but I 'm sure you 're rich if you did .
well , Ty@@ son did , because there 's no chicken in the chicken .
there 's a lot of stuff we can do . there 's a lot of schools doing farm @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ school programs . there 's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools .
this is available on my website in English and Spanish , and it 's a visual way to talk to kids about food .
we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference .
most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child .
and if we 're going to change it , and change how we feed kids , we really have to re@@ think that .
so , public and private partnerships , advocacy groups , working with foundations .
we really need to change it .
these are your children and grand@@ children that are totally melting down when you pick them up , because they haven 't had lunch .
and , you know , I 'm not that better off now .
but we really have to educate .
I think if we 're going to fix this , one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lun@@ ch Program .
instead of the National School Lun@@ ch Program being under the US@@ DA , I think it should be under C@@ DC .
that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools , 80 to 90 cents . in L.@@ A. , it 's 56 cents .
you know what ? we should be ashamed .
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .
but then , they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him , but he never told the son .
and he goes , " Oh , this is great , this is great . "
it was@@ n 't going anywhere toward , you know , saying what the gene was ; it was just nuclear science . and oh , that 's the book , little book .
we rush@@ ed over to the chemistry department and said , " C@@ ould Paul@@ ing be right ? " and Alex H@@ ust said , " No . " so we were happy .
it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an R@@ NA molec@@ ule , and then how do you go from R@@ NA to protein ?
and then you go to these to@@ y companies and there 's some guy across the table , and he goes , " Pass . pass . pass . "
and , you know , I want to make it bl@@ ink and do all that at the same time .
and there 's Fur@@ by on the half shell .
so my wife says , " Well , you may like it , but nobody else will . "
and she does drawings , right ?
and then she started doing these other images .
I actually went to To@@ ys " R " Us , got a little fur@@ ry cat , ri@@ pped it apart and made this .
he 'd -- you can tic@@ kle him . when I put my hand up , " Ha , ha , ha , ha " and that 's how we sold him .
and I started working with Sol@@ id Works and a whole other group to do that .
and then they looked like little Gar@@ fields there .
so full circle -- why do I do this ?
and the picture from the book , so when I -- I told the sculp@@ tor to use this b@@ ump pattern , whatever you can to copy that .
there 's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue .
so you hire artists , and you try to get the look and feel of the character .
and then , four years and 10 million dollars later , we have a little Ple@@ o .
but they have 40 sensors all over their body .
they 're just cu@@ te , right ? that 's the idea , that 's the idea .
so you see -- he@@ y , come on . He@@ y , did you feel that ?
( la@@ ughter ) That 's good , wake up , wake up , wake up .
now these are not robots , they 're kind of lo@@ ve@@ bo@@ ts , you know .
and you let a few million of them out at a time .
and whatever you do , don 't read anything about gene@@ tics that 's published within your lifetime , or something .
you know , there 's about 400 different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions .
let 's see if you can get this one .
you 've got to convey passion .
next : knowledge .
I don 't know who the players are , what the market is like . "
you 've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it , or else you can .
there 's never been a venture @@@ -@@ @ funded company where bad things did@@ n 't happen .
the best way to do this is to look at our bet@@ ters , people who have done this before .
I want to know the size of the market . why is this market worth getting at ?
there 's never been a company with no competition , even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
and when we think of why people do not get involved , why they do not become activists , it 's often that people are so worn down with their own familial responsibilities , and women especially .
just remember that , when we think about what we 're doing .
so , one day , while we were sitting in the office , a farm worker comes in .
so , Le@@ ti@@ cia Pra@@ do is an immigrant from Mexico , only has a sixth @@@ -@@ @ grade education and speaks very limited English .
then she looked into all of the finances of the water district and found there was 250,000 dollars missing from their bank account .
and I want to share this with you . Co@@ ret@@ ta Scot@@ t King said , " We will never have peace in the world until women take power . "
after World War II , when Japan and Germany were devastated after the war , United States of America gave many tax dollars to those two countries , so that they can rebuild their economies and rebuild their corporations .
they 're 11 million citizens .
so , how do we make this happen ?
we had the Women 's March in the United States .
thank you very much .
the au@@ str@@ al@@ opi@@ th@@ ec@@ ines evolved into the gen@@ us Hom@@ o and eventually modern humans -- us .
with these new fossil finds , we realize we now have to make changes to this tree .
I first traveled there in 2003 , and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. P@@ les .
so there was " H@@ and Land , " for the fossil hand people , " Hi@@ p Heaven " for the pel@@ vis ...
and if we had only recovered the sk@@ ull , we might have called it one thing ; if we had only recovered the pel@@ vis , we might have called it another .
as someone who studies teeth , I might argue these are the cool@@ est f@@ ossi@@ ls found at the site .
the deci@@ duous teeth are especially narrow , and the pre@@ mol@@ ars are unique in their outline shape compared to other hom@@ ini@@ ds .
why is there so much morph@@ ological variation in the gen@@ us Hom@@ o ?
and what force is driving that variation ?
who did it evolve from ?
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you .
he studied how our process of perception do@@ es@@ n 't just register sen@@ sory inputs , but trans@@ forms them .
patients suffering from the same mental illnesses also performed similarly , making the test a reliable diagnostic tool .
by the 1960s , it had been officially administered millions of times in the U.S. alone .
employers made prejudic@@ ed hiring decisions based on reduc@@ tive dec@@ o@@ ding charts .
bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns behind our perceptions .
this is what happens in people who share half of their DNA -- fraternal tw@@ ins .
and you can see huge areas of cor@@ te@@ x where there are massive cor@@ relations in the distribution of gray matter .
when I wrote a first draft of the book , I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments , and here are some of the reactions that I got : " better get a security camera for your house . "
but what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80 @@@ -@@ @ odd reviews that The Blan@@ k S@@ late has received .
that 's from Robert Bru@@ stein , the famous drama cri@@ tic and director , in The New Republic about five years ago .
what a puzzle -- I wonder why .
someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflec@@ t ire from discussions of gender and Naz@@ ism and race and so on . I won 't comment on that .
I 'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can in@@ still in them a physical fitness habit so they 'll grow up to be healthy adults .
and he told me that he would go to his work every morning with a paper bag with his lunch and one ci@@ gar .
that one ci@@ gar was the only luxury he could afford for himself .
and after lunch , he would have that one ci@@ gar .
and the professionals know how to do their professional work in a way that it fits in a natural way in the life of our residents .
to do things differently than we always have done in a traditional nursing home .
and I think it 's exactly these kinds of two @@@ -@@ @ sided negotiations that are needed to bring down walls that divide .
it was designed by graphic designer John Ho@@ od , a Native American war veteran working for the California Department of Transportation .
the worst thing that 's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters .
so just take a second to freeze this scene in your mind .
the reason why people have that perception has to do with the way stories are covered about dictator@@ ships .
wherever Rus@@ tin went , he organized and advocated , and was constantly att@@ un@@ ed to the methods , groups , and people who could help further messages of equality .
this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .
I would never have the money to actually pay for the install@@ ment or pay for all the bil@@ l@@ boards or the production of these , so there 's always a client attached to them .
now , based on what I know about the game of Go , I would 've gu@@ essed that it really ought to be on the safe side of that line .
but the fact that it is@@ n 't , and that Google solved this problem , suggests that that line is going to be very dynamic .
that 's something that we should absolutely strive to move toward .
now , basic income is becoming a very important idea .
but also , maybe we can use something from inside the community , something we already had .
" let 's use it and combine it with the rub@@ ble of the demolished houses and make building blocks out of it . "
we also need electricity , we need the energy .
we went to community centers -- those are places , you know for whom ?
now , families are approaching us from all around the Gaza Strip .
now I can control my source of energy .
( la@@ ughter ) Before we understand how this is possible , it 's important to understand the value of this fe@@ at .
aside from running out of space on our phones , we rarely think about our digital footprint .
now , this is very temp@@ ting , but I decided to go back and look at the TED website 's very humble begin@@ nings .
each pix@@ el in a black @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ white photo is simply a zero or a one .
and this is what we got back .
we recover our message by sequ@@ encing the DNA , and every time data is retrieved , we lose the DNA .
it 's really hard to grasp what 's important today , or what will be important for future generations .
instead of asking the current generation -- us -- what might be important in the future , we could store everything in DNA .
I built a school just for girls so that they can be free from FGM and early marriage .
and she also met adults who already believed in her .
so I came to realize once again , as I did when I needed help to go to university , that while I could dream or have a dream , I could not make it come true all by myself .
President Obama visited Kenya in 2015 , and he met with representatives from organizations trying to help improve communities .
can we cure climate change ?
none of us will see that day , but we must start in the hope that future generations will be able to finish the job .
thank you .
you talked about , we need to do an experiment on this .
that lim@@ e is going to get out there .
you can deploy power in a wide range of ways .
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol , for example .
I don 't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to .
some people say that democracy consists basically in elections .
what I want to suggest to you , though , in the next couple of minutes is that there 's also a hopeful response to this .
because they would have done extra@@ ordinarily well .
so had they contested a larger number of the seats , they would have done even better .
what does it mean to say that there 's an Islamic democracy ?
I was running against a two @@@ -@@ @ term incumbent , and my opponent ran the classic partisan play@@ book .
( la@@ ughter ) He ran ads on TV that my kids thought made me look like Vol@@ dem@@ ort , and sent out little g@@ ems in the mail , like this .
( la@@ ughter ) And so when something like this hits you in a campaign , you have to decide how you 're going to respond , and we had a novel idea .
now , why is that story and that approach so novel ?
over 150 programs had their funding reduced because they could not demonstrate success .
lots of us mayors do that .
( la@@ ughter ) He realized that the same approach could be used to all of the problems that his city faced .
so what happens is , when there are lef@@ to@@ vers from dig@@ estion , they 're being delivered to the inner one first .
I thought that was nice .
but really , it 's more that 10 percent of the ner@@ ves that connect brain and gu@@ t deliver information from the brain to the gu@@ t .
the research we have today is creating a new definition of what real clean@@ liness is .
96 percent of all fish species died during the Han@@ gen@@ berg event , 359 million years ago : an interval of fire and ice .
the mighty fell , the mee@@ k inherited the earth , and here we are .
the handful of survivors came from many groups -- all greatly out@@ numbered by their own dead .
as long as a handful of species survive , life will recover .
the versatile and the lucky will not just replace what was lost , but win in new forms .
it just might take several million years .
at the appointed time , you 'll be walking in the yard near the electric fence .
that means that if you lit it from both ends simultaneously , it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds .
but how will you time the last fifteen ?
and this is the highest honor to be best@@ owed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar .
however , the work itself resisted the very nature of a retro@@ spective , and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show .

now , if you 're not an education expert , you may ask , " What 's new and different ?
now , improving current education systems to deliver results is important , but won 't be enough .
F@@ ili@@ pe and a fellow student were the only two attending grade 11 in 2015 .
it 's four and a half times the size of Germany , and it 's fully covered in j@@ ung@@ le and rivers .
you have specialized , trained content teachers in Man@@ a@@ us delivering classroom via li@@ vest@@ re@@ am to over a thousand classrooms in those scattered communities .
now , why is this division between content teacher and tu@@ toring teacher important ?
but secondly also because teachers do too many things they 're either not trained for or not supposed to do .
it teaches us how we can harness technology for learning .
and we know technology is not always perfect .
you 're going to say , " How are we going to implement this all over the world ? "
if you wanted to borrow money to build a bridge or a road , it 's quite easy and straightforward , but not for education .
that 's kind of a longer term commitment .
quality education for all : that 's the freedom fight that we 've got to win .
but wild@@ fire smoke ?
that option is actually not on the table .
you know , that might be something to consider , but that 's a distant threat .
now , artificial intelligence has started bol@@ stering their business as well .
that 's why you see it in every supermarket .
what if the system that we do not understand was picking up that it 's easier to sell Vegas tickets to people who are bi@@ polar and about to enter the man@@ ic phase .
now , the problem is@@ n 't solved if he do@@ es@@ n 't publish it , because there are already companies that are developing this kind of technology , and a lot of the stuff is just off the shelf .
this is not very difficult anymore .
the Pro@@ Publ@@ ica repor@@ ter spent about 30 dollars to target this category .
this simple t@@ weak .
this is@@ n 't " 1984 . "
so Facebook 's market capitalization is approaching half a trillion dollars .
now , don 't get me wrong , we use digital platforms because they provide us with great value .
and that 's the core of the problem .
so what can we do ?
in this context , it means that we are the product that 's being sold .
once on , the trans@@ porter worked best when I did@@ n 't touch it .
it 's all about the question , " What if ? "
everybody saw it , all over the world .

that does not necessarily mean property rights , and I would disagree with Her@@ nan@@ do de So@@ to on that question , because property rights create a lot of complications .
there 's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don 't work in these cases , but they do need security of tenure .
and they need access to politics , and that can mean two things .
look , failure and im@@ perfection are basically the same thing .
nothing and nobody is perfect .
the true illness in our society today is our unwillingness to confront failure .
and when everybody gets a prize , everybody advances , or everybody gets a pay raise despite results , the perfec@@ tionist in all of us is left to wonder , what do I have to do to get better ?
for example : do you have a place to stay tonight ?
( la@@ ughter ) I cou@@ ld@@ n 't pick a career .

the reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it .
you had this same thing in America , it was called the Tim@@ ex Sin@@ cl@@ air@@ 1000 .

he 's a multi @@@ -@@ @ mil@@ lion@@ aire , and I think that 's why he 's smil@@ ing in this photograph .
some of the highlights were things like " The Termin@@ ator , " " Al@@ add@@ in , " the " Te@@ en@@ age M@@ ut@@ ant Her@@ o Tur@@ t@@ les . "
I personally preferred the Spanish version , which was " Tor@@ tu@@ gas Nin@@ ja . "
he did@@ n 't actually buy anything , just some data .
this is happening in your local cities too , you 're probably just not aware of it .
so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
without it , the problems faced in the real world -- poverty , war , disease and genocide -- lack the le@@ vity they should .
a well @@@ -@@ @ designed video game will seam@@ lessly we@@ ave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience .
I know violent video games make my mother worry .

his eyes were open and he was looking at me , and I said , " H@@ i , D@@ ad ! "
so I fell over and I sat there with him because for the first time in a long time he seemed kind of OK .
nobody was productive .
and I think it kind of does , because as you 've heard , as the sea levels come up , it takes weaker and weaker storms to do something like this .

and I thought , well , this is the power of a city .
if they did , it probably was right there at Ground Zero .
so I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well , and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now .

I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours , a tool that you might not expect : abstract mathematics .
and then at the top , we have 30 , which is a product of three prime numbers -- two times three times five .
and each of those arrows shows losing one of your numbers in the set .
here we have white male people .
and there are many things we can learn from this diagram , I think .
the first is that each arrow represents a direct loss of one type of privilege .
we can all use these abstract structures to help us pivo@@ t between situations in which we are more privileged and less privileged .
but I also understand that I am probably among the most privileged of non@@ white people , and this helps me pivo@@ t between those two contexts .

our partnership with our local Nation@@ wide Children 's Hospital afforded us -- they 're building us a health clinic within our school , providing health and mental health resources for our students .
teachers are typically good at planning for and delivering academic instruction , but when you throw in disrup@@ tive behavior , it can feel completely outside the scope of the job .
it was@@ n 't easy , but we felt at heart , it was a positive way to make change , and I 'm in a@@ we at the teachers that took that leap with me .
( la@@ ughter ) I saw teachers say , " What happened to you ? "

when somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone , an anonymous IP number , made an edit to my page .
there 's no reason to have a big argument about it .

so she 's even more gl@@ amor@@ ous if you know that she really was@@ n 't stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
a colleague calls this " serving a life sentence 30 days at a time . "
the other is a letter to the in@@ mate with specific suggestions for how to manage themselves .
for example , if our test result suggests that a prob@@ ation@@ er has a hard time rememb@@ ering the things they hear , that would be an aud@@ itory memory deficit .
and he writes , " Can you tell me what you think of all the head traum@@ as I 've dealt with ?
I just have to work a lot harder at it . " ( laugh@@ s ) And here 's Thomas .
this is my good friend and colleague Judge Bri@@ an B@@ ow@@ en .
( appl@@ ause ) This program shows us the overwhelming prevalence of traumatic brain injuries and cognitive deficits and the accumulation of bro@@ k@@ enness in the criminal justice system .
all told , in this program , these inmates and prob@@ ation@@ ers come to see themselves differently .
and yet , look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold .
and you get all the disease @@@ -@@ @ protective substances .
you find them , for example , in fish oil .
bad f@@ ats are things like trans @@@ -@@ @ fat@@ ty acids in processed food and saturated f@@ ats , which we find in meat .
so , yes , you can lose weight , but your heart is@@ n 't happy .
an optimal diet is low in fat , low in the bad car@@ bs , high in the good car@@ bs and enough of the good f@@ ats .
we all know that in childhood , boys tend to be t@@ all@@ er than girls , but go into any elementary school classroom , and you 'll find some girls who are t@@ all@@ er than some boys .
and it can be labor @@@ -@@ @ intensive , it 's sometimes costly .
but again , just like school @@@ -@@ @ based initiatives , this is hard work .
we spend over a 100 billion dollars -- billion with a " B " -- in this country every year on the treatment of heart disease .
what makes this disease so deadly ?
this leaves the patient with a deficit in the amount of heart muscle that they have .
so when I talk to people about this problem , I often get a sh@@ rug and a statement to the effect of , " Well , you know , Ch@@ uck , we 've got to die of something . "
the first is they can divide like crazy .
so I can take a single cell , and in a month 's time , I can grow this up to billions of cells .
OK , so now we were finally ready to begin animal experiments .
so if we could do eight points in the clinic , I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact on human health .
little do they know it , but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death .
the sun@@ dew 's tiny leaves are equipped with a visc@@ ous sec@@ re@@ tion called m@@ uc@@ il@@ age .
but in that case , if the mat@@ uring brain is to blame , then why are te@@ ens more vulnerable than children , even though their bra@@ ins are more developed than those of children ?
in short , I wanted to conduct a research study to answer one big question : why do te@@ ens keep making ou@@ trage@@ ous choices that are harmful to their health and well @@@ -@@ @ being ?
can positive risk @@@ -@@ @ taking escalate with repeated exposures ?
I turned around to a tall , broad @@@ -@@ @ shoul@@ dered man , pure hate in his eyes .
and I began to think about what I could potentially offer to build safety and power for women .
and we mean those words .
and for that to happen , we need all hands on deck .
so I 've given you my secret recipe , and now it 's up to you .
H@@ all@@ a T@@ Ã³@@ mas@@ d@@ Ã³@@ t@@ ti@@ r : I think it 's a crisis of conformity when we continue to do business and lead in the way we always have , yet the evidence is overwhelming that the world needs us to change our ways .
so let 's look a little bit at that evidence .
in the UK , three percent of people trust their government to solve the Brexit crisis , and that was in December .
so at The B Team , we embrace sustainability , equality and accountability as our principles .
can you talk about that ?
H@@ T : well , yes , I think hu@@ bris is our cancer in leadership .
B@@ F : well , we have a lot of people here who I bet have questions for you , and we have a few minutes for questions , so is there anybody that would like to ask H@@ all@@ a a question ?
H@@ T : well , thank you very much for that fantastic question .
and I want to tell you this story because I think we need to remember that sometimes the stories we tell each other are more than just tales or entertainment or narr@@ atives .
and that 's to say nothing of his idea of a go@@ ose machine that could go to the Moon .
and note , by the way , that word " habit@@ able . "
so , that 's the stage out of all this . I find , for reasons I don 't understand , I really do have a goal .
let me just rush very quickly through things that we 've done .
in 1981 , it flew 163 miles from Paris to England , solely on the power of sun@@ beams , and established a basis for the P@@ ath@@ fin@@ der .
it 's amazing : just on the pun@@ y power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane , you 're able to get it up there .
there he 's the project manager . anything they do is certainly a team effort . he ran this program . here 's ...
Oh , that was only a minute , but I think you 'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight , perhaps .
all right .
OK , here we go .
OK .
every 25 years I do a picture . here 's the one -- tries to show that the world is@@ n 't getting any bigger .
if you look at the other robots in the competition , their movements also still look , well , very robo@@ tic .
H@@ AS@@ EL@@ s are gentle enough to pick up a ra@@ sp@@ berry without damaging it .
and with a large weight , you get a large contraction .
if you put different communication technologies on this log@@ arith@@ mic graph , television , radio , telephone were adopted in decades .
we 'd like to actually turn that program off .
the price performance , bandwidth , capacity of communications measured many different ways ; wired , wireless is growing expon@@ entially .
the most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions .
it turns out that we can understand it .
my main message is that progress in technology is expon@@ ential , not linear .
if you really look at the power of expon@@ ential growth , you 'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand .
so we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems .
the next day , one wr@@ ist signal was flat and the other had the biggest peak I 've ever seen , and I thought , " What 's going on ?
how can you be stressed on one side of your body and not the other ?
He@@ y , do you have any idea what happened to him ? "
we 've had people whose hair stands on end on one arm 20 minutes before a seizure . "
he explained how this could happen in the brain , and he got interested . I showed him the data .
these three seizures you see here are pop@@ ping out of the forest like red@@ wood trees .
I think I turned white reading this email .
the energy used to power the contraction comes from a molec@@ ule called ATP .
many muscles grow with exercise , and larger muscles also have bigger stores of ATP and a higher capacity to clear waste , pushing fatigue even far@@ ther into the future .
let 's imagine a new coffee company that decides to launch on the market .
this see @@@ -@@ @ saw of supply and demand is influenced by many factors .
with the dawn of the Internet , everyday investors can buy stocks in many of the exact same ways a large investor would .
so we use executive function every day in all aspects of our lives .
we 're not going to play the color game anymore .
think of climate change , it can feel so big , that not a single one of us could make a difference .
and once we all recognize that shared vulnerability , that gives us the power to open our eyes , to see what 's in front of us and to act before we get tram@@ pled .
but Tro@@ y 's man@@ ner@@ isms -- they reveal the patterns of someone who is sca@@ red , troubled and unsure of the future .
now , I don 't know if Tro@@ y 's dreams came true .
actress L@@ ena Dun@@ ham may be the media 's representation of this generation , but Tro@@ y and other voices like his are also part of the story .
and honestly , that 's really just the beginning .
this is a really great thing , a really positive step .
she is , like , everything .
mill@@ enn@@ ials make up 27 percent of the world 's population .
but I want to make it clear -- I want to make it really clear to everyone that just because things look more equal than they did in the 20th century , do@@ es@@ n 't mean that things are equitable at all .
and just a few days after my 17th birthday , that mission completely failed .
this is possible if we do the work .
ca : that 's an amazing story , thank you .
KB : thanks for letting me show these .
painted with squ@@ ir@@ rel @@@ -@@ @ hair brush@@ es on vel@@ l@@ um or par@@ chment by monks , n@@ un@@ s , and urban craf@@ ts@@ people , these b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re images pop@@ ulate the margins of the most pri@@ zed books from the Middle A@@ ges .
some artists even painted themselves into the manuscripts .
they appreciate competition , they love effective communication .
more parents were divorced in this generation than any generation prior .
they 're incredibly pragmatic , they 're hopeful and they 're determined .
they might be a little bit ide@@ alistic sometimes , but in just the last several years , we 've seen mill@@ enn@@ ials over@@ take Generation X to be the most represented generation in the workforce .
and " Why baby bo@@ omers have ru@@ ined it for everybody . "
I 've been spending some time thinking about this and research@@ ing this , and fellow researchers and I are@@ n 't exactly sure that these generations are real .
and in fact , if we can agree that these groups even exist , we certainly don 't agree who belongs in them .
at least when it comes to things happening outside of work .
pick a person , just one , and explore their on@@ ly@@ ness .
" CAT . "
these are when .
so , the guy replies , " Y@@ ea@@ h , I know , I know .
hell , pon@@ y@@ tail alone .
the blood moving through your ar@@ teries .
that 's different from being random .
another important characteristic of turbul@@ ence is the different scales of motion that these flows display .
inertia is the tendency of fluids to keep moving , which causes instability .
for example , the motion of the atmosphere is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the earth 's rotation .
other scientists think that the phenomenon is so complex that such a full @@@ -@@ @ fledged theory is@@ n 't ever going to be possible .
Ke@@ ith Sch@@ ach@@ t : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
( la@@ ughter ) Come on up . tell everybody your name .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
( la@@ ughter ) All right , well thanks for coming up .
( appl@@ ause ) So what 's the significance of this dry liquid ?
you can circulate it to draw the heat away .
Z@@ K : for example , you could make a watch that w@@ ra@@ ps around your wr@@ ist , but do@@ es@@ n 't use a buck@@ le .
KS : so that was the six we had for you today , but I hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
in front of Ru@@ f@@ us you are E@@ z@@ ra the co@@ ward .
your girl is here .
thank you .
and I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex @@@ -@@ @ combatants , as they like to be called .
for the roc@@ ke@@ teers in the audience : I love what you 're doing , I admire the gu@@ ts , I admire the courage -- but your rockets are pointed in the wrong go@@ d@@ dam@@ n direction .
well , it 's the relative importance .
this is the envelope , and this is the g@@ ond@@ ola , the pay@@ load .
and this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
he has a spi@@ der B & amp ; B at work ... "
in fact , we have known for a long time that 90 percent of smokers start smoking cigarettes prior to the age of 18 .
te@@ ens who use tobacco products are more likely to use m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety as a teen or as an adult .
blue and purple combine to make red eggs .
the C@@ ud@@ dly that hat@@ ches is sure to make your 6 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old as happy as can be .
the trick lies in a phenomenon known as total internal reflection .
so I 'm going to start with why we should .
so , I say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of reaching this R@@ HR milestone , robust human rejuven@@ ation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuven@@ ation .
the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
so we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : OK . I don 't know if there 's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) Audi@@ ence : species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to pro@@ create .
so , it 's not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags .
you know , as Chris mentioned , I wrote a book called " The Wis@@ dom of Cro@@ w@@ ds . "
and what 's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations .
a network is not just the product of its component parts .
perpetrators ejac@@ ulated on images of me , took photos of their sperm and pen@@ ises on these images and posted them onto por@@ n sites .
I had@@ n 't heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , " God , who 's saying what I 'm thinking ? "
I did@@ n 't .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
so , let 's go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we 've shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
he was a creativity researcher in the ' 6@@ 0s and ' 7@@ 0s , and also led the Stan@@ ford Design Program .
and in fact , my friend and ID@@ EO founder , David Kel@@ ley , who 's out there somewhere , studied under him at Stan@@ ford .
I need you to turn that piece of paper over ; you should find that it 's blank on the other side .
and I want you to pick somebody that 's seated next to you , and when I say , go , you 've got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor , OK ?
he got exactly the same response : lots and lots of sorry 's .
but as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embar@@ ras@@ sed .
and I 'm going to run a little experiment . another little experiment .
now , what I 'm going to do is , I 'm going to see how -- I can 't see out of these , OK .
( la@@ ughter ) There we go .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ k you , thank you , thank you .
( la@@ ughter ) Well , they 're still coming in from the back there ; they 're still coming in .
I 'd better clear these up out of the way ; otherwise , I 'm going to trip over them .
so , ah , that was fun .
but why is it important ?
we think play@@ fulness helps us get to better creative solutions .
helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
now , an adult en@@ countering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categor@@ ize it just as quickly as we can , you know .
life 's complicated ; we want to figure out what 's going on around us very quickly .
I suspect , actually , that the evolutionary bi@@ ologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categor@@ ize new things very , very quickly .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stri@@ py thing : is that a ti@@ ger just about to jump out and kill us ?
we need to figure that out pretty fast .
any parents of young kids in the audience ? there must be some .
so what I 'm going to do is , I 'm going to give you minute , and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form .
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible .
anybody know what this is ? it 's the pe@@ yo@@ te c@@ ac@@ tus .
he gave each of them some m@@ escal@@ ine , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
and somehow that seems wrong .
they were exploring following what was interesting to them .
they went from designing spl@@ ints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War , I think , and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .
now , that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lis@@ a and the Mac@@ int@@ os@@ h .
they were meeting with them ; they were talking to the surge@@ ons about what it was they needed with this device .
the proto@@ typing car@@ ts , filled with colored paper and Play @@@ -@@ @ Do@@ h and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean , they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .
so we do quite a lot of work at ID@@ EO trying to convince our clients of this .
another way for us , as designers , to explore role @@@ -@@ @ play is to put ourselves through an experience which we 're designing for , and project ourselves into an experience .
so when a k@@ id dres@@ ses up as a fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter , you know , he 's beginning to try on that identity .
I will show it to you .
so I put it through a G.@@ C. , a Gas Ch@@ ro@@ mat@@ o@@ graph that I have in my office , and it 's about 400 .
it 's not really true .
these are the five at@@ oms from which just about everything that you 're going to smell in real life , from coffee to fra@@ gr@@ ance , are made of .
why do@@ es@@ n 't it smell of potatoes or viol@@ ets ? well , there are really two theories .
like , at no concentration , even pure , you know , if you smel@@ t pure ethanol , it do@@ es@@ n 't smell of ro@@ tten eggs .
now , I showed this to a phy@@ sic@@ ist friend of mine who has a profound di@@ sta@@ ste for biology , and he says , " That 's easy ! the things are a different color ! "
if you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
the bad news is they 're rocket fuels .
and this is the main objection to the theory .
OK , great , we smell vibrations . how ? all right ?
and then you start c@@ ranking the computer to find other molecules , related or unrelated , that have the same vibrations .
and the prediction is it should smell of cou@@ mar@@ in .
and this is our new baby , called ton@@ k@@ ene .
and people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
this is a new 33 @@@ -@@ @ million @@@ -@@ @ pound college of further education that was mostly funded by the European Union .
and this is the new 77 @@@ -@@ @ million @@@ -@@ @ pound road @@@ -@@ @ improvement scheme , and there 's a new train line , a new railway station , and they 're all being funded by the European Union .
he was fed up with it .
I was like , " What stuff ? "
and this entire referendum took place in darkness , because it took place on Facebook .
and what happens on Facebook stays on Facebook , because only you see your news feed , and then it van@@ ishes , so it 's impossible to research anything .
and he was extra@@ ordinarily brave , because the company is owned by Robert Mer@@ cer , the bil@@ lion@@ aire who bank@@ rolled Trump , and he threatened to sue us multiple times , to stop us from publishing .
( appl@@ ause ) Our parliament has been the first in the world to try to hold you to account , and it 's failed .
democracy is not guaranteed , and it is not inevitable , and we have to fight and we have to win and we CA@@ N@@ NOT let these tech companies have this un@@ checked power .
so , about three years ago I was in London , and somebody called How@@ ard Bur@@ ton came to me and said , I represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
we have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well .
it took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea .
and it 's the first time I 've had a job where I 'm afraid to go away because of everything that 's going to happen in this week when I 'm here .
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
so this is general rel@@ ativity , this is quantum theory .
so it works . but not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a rel@@ ational universe .
now , not only that , but E@@ in@@ stein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being rel@@ ational .
no matter what any one nation @@@ -@@ @ state does , they will not be able to solve the problem alone .
so we want to incenti@@ vi@@ ze healthy contribution back to the network , and what we believe that is is actually participating in conversation that is healthy , as defined by those four indicators I articulated earlier .
ca : you come over to many , I think to me , as this en@@ ig@@ ma .
ca : all right .
it took courage .
Rwanda itself was not seen as news@@ worthy , and amaz@@ ingly , genocide itself was not seen as news@@ worthy .
why no hearings , no den@@ unci@@ ations , no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House ? what 's the deal ?
and yet the politicization of Ne@@ ver Ag@@ ain , the operationalization of Ne@@ ver Ag@@ ain , had never occurred in the 20th century .
so that was the 20th century .
it grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur .
evangel@@ icals have joined it . Jewish groups have joined it .
now because it 's student @@@ -@@ @ driven , there 's some amazing things that the movement has done .
and that 's all the Bush administration 's leadership , and it 's all because of this bottom @@@ -@@ @ up pressure and the fact that the phones haven 't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis .
he 's the vic@@ ero@@ y . he has to decide on tax policy , on currency , on border patrol , on policing . he has to make all these judgments .
let 's not hy@@ pe the threat ; let 's actually see it clearly .
ca : so you started capturing huge amounts of data .
and you did@@ n 't really know what you were going to see coming out of this .
this moment .
but it 's actually more complicated than that .
so tell us more about what we 're actually looking at here .
now , we 're too close to really see all the jet structure , but it 's the base of those j@@ ets that are illuminating the space @@@ -@@ @ time .
ca : and if you were in a spac@@ eship whir@@ ling around that thing somehow , how long would it take to actually go around it ?
there 's something called the -- if I can get won@@ ky for one moment -- the in@@ ner@@ most stable circular orbit , that 's the in@@ ner@@ most orbit at which matter can move around a black hole before it spir@@ als in .
you 're just going to drift right through that event horizon .
( appl@@ ause ) It 's the red circle , that 's terri@@ fying .
and if they survive , the reader is left with no feeling of triumph , only cosmic indiffe@@ ren@@ ce@@ - the terrible sense that we are but insignificant spec@@ ks at the mercy of un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able forces .
today , this shared universe is called the C@@ th@@ ul@@ hu My@@ th@@ os , named after L@@ ov@@ ecraft 's in@@ famous blend of dra@@ gon and oc@@ top@@ us .

I came here to give you a science lesson about animal m@@ ating systems and why defining mon@@ og@@ amy has been a challenge for scientists .
now , " OP@@ P " is a call @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ response song .
audience : ye@@ ah , you know me !
now , in the song , the MC h@@ ints that it 's a five @@@ -@@ @ letter word , but to keep it rated PG , he simply refers to it as " property . "
that was until the late 1980s , when a new laboratory technique came on the scene , which could copy DNA from a small tissue or fluid sample and dec@@ ode the gene@@ tics of individuals .
now , before that technique , we were never ever certain about , 100 percent , who the parents of baby birds were .
we now call this " serial mon@@ og@@ amy . "
( la@@ ughter ) And the mechanism responsible ?
" it 's OP@@ P , time for other people 's what you get it there 's no room for relationship , there 's just room to ... "
you down with E@@ PC ?
you know , but for years , I 've been sitting up , and I think my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of in@@ som@@ nia .
and often , I 'm driving in a taxi , and I see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I 'd never seen happen before .
color is something that moti@@ vates me a lot .
but for the most part , I think , like , how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Nat@@ ali@@ e Wood ?
how can I ever make anything as beautiful as G@@ ret@@ a Gar@@ bo ?
so actually , check this out .
so my mother was a little off@@ ended , and turned to her and said , " Are you kid@@ ding ? they have the greatest life together .
and I kind of try not to look back , you know ?
I work with Tw@@ yl@@ a T@@ har@@ p a lot and I work with Mark Mor@@ ris a lot , who is one of my best friends .
again , I don 't know where inspiration comes from .
there I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
and frankly , I don 't really know what to call myself .
that 's just that .
and I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
R@@ o : no , not me , no .
I want to show you this last cli@@ p because it 's going to be my last good@@ b@@ ye .
IM : ye@@ ah , it is . exactly .
in any day , the cells in your body will collectively accumulate billions of these single @@@ -@@ @ letter sw@@ aps , which are also called " point mu@@ tations . "
base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe .
two companies I co@@ founded , Be@@ am Ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tics and pa@@ ir@@ wise Plants , are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases and to improve agriculture .
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them ?
so , next time you are really depressed , look in the mirror and you can look and say , hi , I 'm looking at a star here .
it 's a planet somewhat similar to Earth . it 's a little bit smaller , but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth , you know , if you don 't take the oceans into account .
this is one very large cr@@ ater . ge@@ ologists love cr@@ aters , because cr@@ aters are like dig@@ ging a big hole in the ground without really working at it , and you can see what 's below the surface .
so , this is called Victoria C@@ r@@ ater , which is about a few football fields in size .
CE : that 's about what happened in the Houston operation room . it 's exactly like this .
so , we wanted to find out , actually , what is that ice made of , and could that have embedded in it some organic , you know , material .
so the plan is to di@@ g in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it .
E@@ B : looks kind of like an ice cream con@@ e , more or less .
we no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry , so we j@@ et@@ ti@@ son the heat shield , exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars .
but that last one percent , as it always seems to be , is the tr@@ ick@@ y part .
it 's a very sc@@ ary moment ; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time .
E@@ B : and then it has to light up its engines , right itself , and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely .
BC : Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth .
so by the time you even hear from the lander that ED@@ L has started it 'll already be over .
it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product .
so we have to study all kinds of different materials , the shape that we want to do .
and that 's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one .
but there was something b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re about it .
and they 're really good at it .
( la@@ ughter ) OK , al@@ right . but enough about me .
this is a natural product that is in all plant roots .
why is now a good time to do a biological solution to this problem ?
those are the three traits we want to change : more sub@@ er@@ in , more roots , and the last one , deep roots .
OK , so I think this is the science behind the whole thing .
and so when we do the experiments , we can 't actually take a loss in yield , because while we are doing these experiments , say , beginning about 10 years from now , the earth 's population will be even more than it is right now .
plants that are making more carbon , those soils become enriched in carbon .
so , OK .
and the gen@@ ius of doing that and a solution that can scale where there 's already scale .
but it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the tough@@ est problems we 're facing .
( la@@ ughter ) I hardly ever gave money to charity , and when I did , I did@@ n 't feel that warm g@@ low I was expecting .
we know that pleasure reinforces adaptive behavi@@ ors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species , and it looked to me like giving might be one of those behavi@@ ors .
the Canadian government allows any five Canad@@ ians to privately sponsor a family of refugees .

but her other leg appears rooted to the spot , locked in the corner of the canvas even as she stret@@ ches to move it .
some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a gh@@ o@@ stly woman reaching out her window .
hundreds of viewers have grap@@ pled with its harsh imagery , shat@@ tering symbol@@ ism and complex political messaging .
( la@@ ughter ) What would they know ?
and I remembered how I cou@@ ld@@ n 't articulate the anxiety and fear that filled me as I tried to car@@ ve my tiny little life into a world that felt far too big for me .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) That was not my point .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , I 'm sure there 's quite a few of you who have already identified three ideas .
that 's a 2,000 @@@ -@@ @ foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
( la@@ ughter ) The weather station 's pretty interesting .
you need to come up the Lin@@ col@@ n Canyon .
you also see there a b@@ igh@@ or@@ n sheep .
you 'd have a pol@@ ished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock .
W@@ at , wait . just hold this for me .
thank you very much .
how did it get into the form that it had before it got resha@@ ped , and so forth ?
if you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago , there 'd be no evidence of humans at all , because we don 't think there were humans yet .
it 's like you can 't see to the center of the Sun ; you have to use other techniques to know what 's going on inside the Sun .
and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular gal@@ ax@@ ies and first stars to these more advanced gal@@ ax@@ ies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
I always think of space @@@ -@@ @ time as being the real substance of space , and the gal@@ ax@@ ies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .
it 's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on .
so here is the Slo@@ an Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million gal@@ ax@@ ies .
what happens is , you take pictures as the Earth rot@@ ates , you get a fan across the sky .
do you see the fan @@@ -@@ @ like scans made across the sky ?
remember , every spot on here is a gal@@ axy , and you see the gal@@ ax@@ ies , you know , sort of in our neighborhood , and you sort of see the structure .
and you see this thing we call the Great Wall , and you see the complicated structure , and you see these vo@@ ids .
there 's another survey which is very similar to this , called the Two @@@ -@@ @ degree Field of View Galaxy red@@ shift Survey .
now we 're going to fly through it at war@@ p a million .
how are you going to put gal@@ ax@@ ies out there in a pattern like that ?
what 's the kind of technique ?
it 's called dark matter .
so the stuff that 's in this picture that 's white , that is the dark matter .
notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern .
there 's a very simple fluid to begin with .
and so from inside , it do@@ es@@ n 't look very complicated , right ?
it 's only when you look at it at a very large scale , and explore it and so forth , you realize it 's a very intr@@ icate , complicated kind of a design , right ?
and so here we are .
you see how the filament -- you see how several fil@@ aments are coming together , therefore making this Super@@ cluster of gal@@ ax@@ ies .
and if you could see invisible matter , too .
it started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations , but expanding at a tremendous rate .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
so I 'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .
and you start seeing these networks , this cosmic web of structure forming .
so there it is .
but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form .
and at that point , the universe myster@@ iously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger @@@ -@@ @ scale structure .
since then we 've had W@@ MAP , which just gives us higher angular resolution .
and on the bottom right is if the satellite had f@@ li@@ pped up@@ side down and mapped the Earth , what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth .
but what we 're hoping when we get to Plan@@ ck , we 'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth .
and what I found was quite surprising .
we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they 'd been improved , and very simple things turned out .
you 'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water , but it 's actually the opposite .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asym@@ metric advantage .
and it was quite an experience to be there .
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the sanitation trucks were par@@ ked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rub@@ ble away .
it was quite a compelling experience , but not really , I suppose , a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books .
now , just imagine what that $ 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education .
so given that we know and should believe -- because Mo@@ ore 's Law 's been , like , a constant , I mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 .
we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
in fact , if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that 's a property of carbon fiber also .
and so we begin to see , and we 've seen business plans already , where the kind of things Lis@@ a R@@ and@@ all 's talking about are in there .
new materials that can make water , new materials that can make fuel cells work better , new materials that cataly@@ ze chemical reactions , that cut pollution and so on .
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .
and we 've dedicated -- we 've just raised a new fund , we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments .
the third area that we 're working on , and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York .
cocktails , more poly@@ val@@ ent vaccines .
we can 't fight at a million @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one disadvantage .
today scientists , techn@@ ologists , businessmen , engineers don 't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions .
our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information .
what I want to do is I want to we@@ ave computing , AI and internet as part of us .
as part of human cogn@@ ition , freeing us to interact with the world around us .
integrate human and machine intelligence right inside our own bodies to augment us , instead of diminishing us or replacing us .
one of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks that we do as human beings .
these sensors pick up on these internal signals sourced deep within the mouth cav@@ ity , right from the surface of the skin .
people don 't want to be read , they want to write .
simply by internally asking that question .
what you see on the screen are the words that Eric is speaking to himself right now .
Ar@@ na@@ v Kap@@ ur : what happened is that the AI sent the answer through audio , through the device , back to Eric .
perhaps a greeting , like , " Hello , how are you ? "
what Dou@@ g said that he wanted to use our system for is to re@@ boot the old system he had , because that old system kept on crashing .
there are millions of people who might be able to communicate in real time like Dou@@ g , with other people , with their friends and with their families .
( la@@ ughter ) Not a lot of people are doing it .
that is until last year , when Edu@@ ardo won the Cou@@ p de Co@@ e@@ ur , the co@@ ve@@ ted French ga@@ str@@ onomic prize .
right up to us , like right up to here .
right along the fence line .
radioactive yellow .
bright yellow .
it 's brilliant , right ?
and I say to you , I might not stick to this , but I don 't think I 'll ever serve fo@@ ie gr@@ as on my menu again because of that taste experience with Edu@@ ardo .
he was right .
and in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes , is this note that says , when asked , what do you think of conventional fo@@ ie gr@@ as ?
the history of fo@@ ie gr@@ as .

let me show you how I work , how I " k@@ ne@@ ad my bread . "
Al@@ ice falls in a bur@@ row and begins an absurd journey through a world of fantasy , remember ?
in this situation , the title of the story is my raw material .
I use another sheet of paper to work more comfortably .
I mark some guidelines , delim@@ iting the framework where the words will be .
I always make several sket@@ ches , where I 'll try different ideas or change elements .
lots of points and lines playing in the background help me convey that in this story , lots of things happen .
and of course , there 's Al@@ ice , looking at her wonder@@ land .
I can say my favorite s@@ wear word in a very flow@@ ery way and be really cor@@ ny when I talk about love .
if I cou@@ ld@@ n 't say it by speaking , this was my way of talking and telling things to the world .
and that 's why I always want them to have shapes that are truly beautiful and exquisite .
telling stories by drawing letters -- that 's my job .
and with that I look for a reaction in the reader , to wake them up somehow , to make them dream , make them feel moved .
currently owned and dominated by two mini dict@@ ators , who rule my life with an iron f@@ ist while wearing their H@@ ug@@ gies di@@ ap@@ ers .
now , my friends who don 't want kids , all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies .
and yet , despite all this chaos , I still think we should have babies .
I believe we can and should fight for the earth and humanity , side by side .
where there was once hope , now there is convenient space , and good mile@@ age , good mile@@ age .
according to the World Health Organization , we need to average about 2.1 children per woman today just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation .
it seems every generation is indeed connected .
let 's stop in China .
check out some good old @@@ -@@ @ fashi@@ oned Chinese propaganda , lovely .
even after ending its one @@@ -@@ @ child policy in 2015 , China 's birth rates have largely declined .
and unlike other countries , it has not been able to replace its population numbers through immigrant workers .
some local governments in Japan have offered couples money to have babies , with the money increasing with each additional child being born .
( la@@ ughter ) Let 's take the Del@@ ore@@ an to Europe , the continent of delicious che@@ eses I love to eat but CA@@ N@@ NOT pron@@ ounce .
he said families where the women have four or more kids will no longer pay income tax .
that 's like buying a brand new Hond@@ a O@@ dys@@ sey mini@@ van , OK ?
so , congratulations , you just had a baby , but the baby 's economic productivity is zero , and guess what ?
the United States is the only industrialized country in the world that does not require employers to offer paid parental leave .
( audience gas@@ ps ) It has been a challenging week .
but that 's not the reason you have babies .
we 're going to be stuck in the screens with our faces not seeing the world around us ?
and to realize this idea , I need to solve three big challenges .
( low notes changing in pitch ) So in this particular example , the or@@ ch@@ id can communicate to you through images and sounds .
so everything can be h@@ acked , and research is important , but the second challenge we have is how can we go from R and D , and proto@@ types , to real products ?
we worked with my collaborators , who were not engineers .
how can we go from one product to many products ?
I 'm not talking about creating another gad@@ get you get bo@@ red with and throw in the back of your draw@@ er and forget about .
now to make this ecosystem possible , we have to avoid fragmentation .
so let me show , for the first time , the real device which we 've built .
that 's what it looks like , and it 's a small device which will be connected to things we want to make smart and connected and interactive .
so when you plug them into different things , like here , the device will recognize where you 're plug@@ ging them and then re@@ configure itself to enable specific functionality for this particular thing .
and what they 're going to make with them is up to them .
thank you .

the experience left him with a far more p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic view of social reform , and his focus shifted toward spiritual concerns .
its legitimacy comes not from the outer frame of constitutional rules , but from the inner work@@ ings of civic spirit .
and that brings me to my second topic : how we can practice civic religion produc@@ tively .
we are never asked to reflect on the content of our citizenship .
in the community of Athens , Tennessee , a fe@@ i@@ sty leader named Wh@@ it@@ ney Kim@@ ball Co@@ e leads h@@ ers in an art and fra@@ ming shop with a youth cho@@ ir and lots of little flags .
binding ourselves this way actually liber@@ ates us .
the " them " is those who don 't .
I know civic religion is not enough to remedy the radical inequities of our age .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT un@@ pollu@@ te our politics if we clean only downstream .
( la@@ ughter ) That means that without slo@@ ths , there might be no av@@ oc@@ ado on to@@ ast today , leaving hi@@ p@@ sters everywhere totally be@@ re@@ ft at breakfast .

I have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk .
well , I think they can tell us something about human time .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
you 've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that 's happening , and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .

are we dre@@ aming ? is this real ?
one is that if you went into space you 'd be able to begin again .
so that 's kind of the idea -- we as humans cra@@ ve the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible .
it was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility .
we 're very sensitive to that as humans .
gener@@ ically , what we use the Web for is to organize , exchange , create and consume information .
you are always there with other people .
you know , mapping in India -- that 's such a great example .
so I think that 's another big point .

this guy is now five generations removed from the General ; this guy is about seven .
and as a matter of fact , then , this is one of the reasons we must exclude them from this country .
for example , there is French Chinese food , where they serve salt and pepper fro@@ g legs .
they looked at " The Young and The Re@@ st@@ less . " it was@@ n 't that , either .

and all these restaurants were serving fortune cookies , which , of course , are@@ n 't even Chinese to begin with .

they want me to know without a doubt that there is a hidden logic to this seem@@ ing chaos .
but what I have learned in living with stage IV cancer is that there is no easy correlation between how hard I try and the length of my life .
( la@@ ughter ) But at the same time , I 've experienced love , so much love , love I find hard to explain .
my name is Saf@@ ia El@@ h@@ illo , and this po@@ em is called " to make use of water . "
but the Danish word for design is " form@@ gi@@ v@@ ning , " which literally means to give form to that which has not yet been given form .
but then we thought , like , what if the 100 @@@ -@@ @ foot minimum distance is really about minimum distance -- once we get 100 feet up in the air , we can grow the building back out .
and finally , we are going to deal with all the waste locally , with com@@ post , recycling , and turning the waste into energy .
and any architecture is supposed to be able to fit on this platform .
I -- you know , when I -- after I had invented P@@ CR , I kind of needed a change .
and when sur@@ fers are out waiting for waves , you probably wonder , if you 've never been out there , what are they doing ?
you know , sometimes there 's a 10@@ - , 15 @@@ -@@ @ minute break out there when you 're waiting for a wave to come in .
people think they 're sort of low@@ bro@@ ws .
they did@@ n 't have TV screens , and they did@@ n 't have any football games to watch .
and like , there was big arguments about it in the -- you know , the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff .
he said , OK , we 're going to start having these meetings .
but the general idea that you could only -- you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis .
but -- all of us own stuff .
not a whole lot of people doing this stuff .
it 's like anything else that 's prohibited : you do it behind the garage .
and then I tried the melting business , and I mel@@ ted it .
and then it mel@@ ted into a little sort of sy@@ rup@@ y liquid , brown .
( la@@ ughter ) So I started developing -- you know , George 's d@@ ad had a lot of help . I just had my brother .
but I was@@ n 't worried , by the way , about , you know , the explosion causing the destruction of the planet .
but if you go to authority , and you always don 't -- you don 't always get the right answer , see .
and then you figure out better and better ways to do it .
and I 'm basically honest .
now , let 's see ...
I 've got another five minutes , right ?
OK . all scientists are@@ n 't like that .
you know -- and there is a lot -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since Isaac New@@ ton and all that stuff happened .
scientists , you know , made World War II as we know it quite possible .
and they we@@ ren 't the curious little boys that liked to put fro@@ gs up in the air .
so the temperature has been , sort of , in@@ ching up .
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
it 's a paper that came out in February , and most of you probably had@@ n 't heard about it .
so you still get heated , but you don 't dissip@@ ate any .
so the planet should get war@@ mer .
these papers should have been called , " The End to the Global W@@ arming Fi@@ as@@ co , " you know .
they had to be very cautious .
it may seem like we 're all standing on solid earth right now , but we 're not .
and these empty spaces are filled with astronomical quantities of micro@@ bes , such as these ones .
this is a good point .
if you only lived for a day .
so when we say that these deep sub@@ surface micro@@ bes are just dor@@ man@@ t , are we like people who die after a day , trying to figure out how trees work ?
these are things that we literally kill each other to get a@@ hold of up at the surface world .
but in the sub@@ surface , of course , there 's no sunlight , so this ecosystem has to solve the problem of who is going to make the food for everybody else .
and they can do this with a ton of different elements .
they can do this with sulphur , iron , man@@ ganese , nitrogen , carbon , some of them can use pure electr@@ ons , straight up .
that lake that we 're standing next to is made of pure battery acid .
but the fact that it erupted illustrates perfectly that if you want to look for where carbon dioxide gas is coming out of this oce@@ anic plate , then you should look no further than the volcan@@ oes themselves .
we discovered that literally tons of carbon dioxide were coming out of this deeply buried oce@@ anic plate .
and it may seem like life buried deep within the earth 's cr@@ ust is so far away from our daily experiences that it 's kind of irrelevant .
everything is interconnected .
if people think they can 't do their work , there 's no chance of getting the local buy @@@ -@@ @ in you need for the area to be successful .
it already has .
Governments , local citizens , fun@@ ders , and most importantly , our oceans .
Don 't forget : a computer came out ; it had no software .
I mean , this was great .
it 's , like , you know , Her@@ bie the Apple II .
and is@@ n 't it that strange moment when you publish your design ?
and so in Japan , I began to experiment with people .
in the end , he drew a house . it was the most b@@ oring thing .
and so I never developed the ability to have a staff .
he was the first digital media producer in Tokyo .
and so , I began to think more carefully about the computer .
so , if you can see here , you know , that program you 're seeing in the corner , if you spread it out , it 's all these things all at once .
it 's real simultan@@ e@@ ity . it 's nothing we 're used to working with .
this I found , where nature had made a picture for me .
and I went after it with passion .
in fact , I think that most of it has to do with body size -- the size you are when you inherit a vacant Eco@@ Space from whatever natural disaster .
din@@ os@@ au@@ r evolution proceeded at a stat@@ ely pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
and that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and inv@@ ade all those habitats .
a pre@@ dat@@ or . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
we are extremely din@@ os@@ au@@ r @@@ -@@ @ like , and unusual in our two @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged approach to life .
but one with an immense chal@@ k@@ board in the middle , with lots of little areas of din@@ os@@ au@@ r rock if you could survive an expedition .
some of them -- the most important -- are mental .
they 're usually students who 've never seen a desert .
narr@@ ator : ... as long as their boat .
man : look at that set of ch@@ op@@ pers ! ye@@ ah , he 's a big one .
it 's really an island continent .
now , I tried to su@@ ture together a din@@ os@@ au@@ r evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution .
I thought , what a great way to get to school .
we flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 , when I really got it started .
we are now installing larger power@@ plants , which will make it possible for me to get back on board .
there 's an old ad@@ age that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s , when every aer@@ on@@ autical company was working on vertical @@@ -@@ @ take@@ off aircraft .
we have four computers . we have two par@@ ach@@ utes .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'd like to show you an animation in this next one , which is one element of the Sky@@ car 's use , but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used .
we don 't know .
what we do know is this : when su@@ ic@@ idal murde@@ rers really go all in , technology is the force multiplier .
here 's an example .
so these researchers edited H@@ 5@@ N1 's gen@@ ome and made it every bit as deadly , but also wil@@ dly contag@@ ious .
and they 're all moving in these head@@ long rates .
and the keys to the kingdom are these tiny , tiny data files .
let 's say it 's 20@@ 26 , to pick an arbitrary year , and a brilliant vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ist , hoping to advance science and better understand pan@@ dem@@ ics , designs a new bug .
so these are just a couple of many great ideas that are out there .
( la@@ ughter ) I was raised by my grand@@ parents , and they were anti@@ ques dealers , so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things .
it 's a lot of hard work , not being yourself .
how many versions of you are there ?
again , another medical example here .
so , the thing that we designed , much less sex@@ y but much more human and practical , was this .
they 're now called k@@ ick@@ start .
and I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large @@@ -@@ @ scale construction .
Red drew me into this little composition , optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service 's mailbox , door service , plum@@ bing .
Red can be com@@ ical : it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydr@@ ant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana .
Havana is a wonderful area .
but they 're real examples in urbanization and the change that 's occurred in the last number of years , and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
you know , so much of the discussion surrounding our future focuses on technology , efficiency and speed .
it was a fact that he did@@ n 't make much of a f@@ uss about , usually .
they handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes .
now , we 've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science , but I think it 's also true in the arts , it 's true in politics , it 's even true in personal endeav@@ ors .
and it 's that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves .
in the series , my stu@@ ffed bear co@@ host and I talk about the LGBT community , activis@@ m , gender and pronoun@@ s , consent and body posi@@ tivity .
lesbian , gay and bisexual te@@ ens are more than three times more likely to attempt suicide than their heter@@ os@@ exual peers , and transgender te@@ ens are almost six times more likely .
so the signature shape of a quar@@ tz crystal is a six @@@ -@@ @ sided column with pointed tips .
while we can 't directly observe growth conditions in the man@@ tle , laboratory experiments have shown some evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cu@@ bes at lower temperatures and oc@@ ta@@ he@@ dr@@ ons at higher temperatures .
this is the school where I met Patrick .
if you don 't come back now , you 'll never come back . "
and he said , " My mother . "
he fix@@ ated on a story Dou@@ glass told of how , over Christmas , masters give slaves gin as a way to prove to them that they can 't handle freedom .
he said that there are people in jail who , like slaves , don 't want to think about their condition , because it 's too painful .
it was this ever@@ lasting thinking of my condition that tor@@ mented me . "
he finished the book before I did , reading it in a concrete stair@@ way with no light .
let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question .
did reading save his life ?
so people say a lot of things about reading that feel exagg@@ erated to me .
reading gave him a language for what he had lost .
how precious are these lines from the poet De@@ rek W@@ alco@@ t@@ t ?
the link between reading and writing is so powerful .
because whole grain -- it 's easy with white flour to make a good @@@ -@@ @ t@@ asting bread . white flour is sweet .
and -- and you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once , but they won 't eat it again if they don 't like it , right ?
O.@@ K. ? radical , not subtle .
I turned on the computer , went on Google and prepared to write my news clips .
and instead of a short answer , Jesus replied with a par@@ able .
the first story , about the neighbor .
a road like in this country has been rooted in things like mis@@ og@@ y@@ ny .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commodi@@ tized .
in politics , the rare candidate who is serious , like Ad@@ la@@ i Ste@@ ven@@ son , is easily overwhel@@ med by one who is solemn , like E@@ isen@@ ho@@ wer .
for one thing , it often happens spontaneously , intu@@ i@@ tively , accid@@ entally or incidentally .
it 's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind .
and first I was praised for it , then criticized for it , but the fact of the matter was , I had become solemn .
there was no format .
a neighborhood has a thing -- it 's got a landmark , it 's got a place , it 's got a restaurant . it do@@ es@@ n 't have a logo . I mean , what would that be ?
it will change every six months , and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pit@@ ts@@ burgh , and it will probably become a landmark in the area .
one of my favor@@ ites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water .
and then a funny thing happened -- they sold .
( la@@ ughter ) S@@ ame color , same message , same words .
this is from my second book .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your in@@ tuition gives you that answer , in a sense .
so , this was the contents page originally .
I hate this stuff . it 's hard to read .
I 've taken one shot ; I cro@@ pped it a few different ways .
got no way of tracking it , so I could be totally wrong .
it was@@ n 't some , you know , we@@ ir@@ d gr@@ un@@ ge type or something ; it looked like they might be real . anyway .

( la@@ ughter ) You could -- you could highlight it ; you could make it Hel@@ ve@@ tica or something : it is the actual article .
how could they send me here ?
a gen@@ ome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism .
we 've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molec@@ ule , that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever , since the beginning of us , of us as creatures .
living in your gen@@ ome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you 're from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that 's now starting to be understood .
a lot of very hand@@ some and pretty people here , sk@@ in@@ ny , ch@@ ub@@ by , different races , cultures . we are all 9@@ 9.9 % genetically equal .

while the second Iraq war , fought by his son , President George W. Bush , failed ?
so a great future lies ahead for humanity .
a trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manip@@ ulates them with l@@ asers .
super@@ conducting circuits , meanwhile , make operations much faster than trapped ions , and it 's easier to scale up the number of circuits in a computer than the number of ions .
moreover , I 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success .
we can save the planet , but we can 't do it alone -- we need each other .
but this is the equivalent of three Li@@ br@@ aries of Congress -- burnt down , forever lost -- each year .
now , why do I say that this is a big problem ?
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second micro@@ b@@ ial age .
this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Per@@ m@@ ian , 250 million years ago , a com@@ et hit us .

so , I 'm swimming along , and it takes off my leg .
I got this email from him two years ago ; he said , " I think I 've got an answer to some of your questions . "
give us a few mill@@ enn@@ ia -- and we humans should last those few mill@@ enn@@ ia -- will it happen again ? if we continue , it 'll happen again .
and this gives me enormous hope .
and , of course , that makes sense , because hope is an abstract phenomenon ; it 's an abstract idea , it 's not a concrete word .
I interrupted , and I said , " D@@ id you say this ? "
and I think that it 's going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we 've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days .
I call this hy@@ person@@ ic sound .
so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people , and there can be a public beach just off to the side , and they don 't even know it 's turned on .

I had not been elected .
I organized the first multi@@ party democratic elections in nearly 30 years .
how could we engage them and make them believe that the answers to transforming our nation was right in their hands ?
let me give you a few examples .
women and girls , who constitute 51 percent of our population , were not given equal opportunity to be educated .
but the only problem is we had no money to start the program .
I argued that for Sierra Leone to produce a highly skilled , innovative and productive workforce fit for the 21st century global economy , we needed to invest heavily in human capital development in Sierra Leone .

why is that ?
AS@@ TR@@ IA@@ Gra@@ ph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe -- government , industry and academia -- and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today .
what could I trust ?
so , why don 't you tell that story ?
that 's all I 'd ever known .
in fact , I 'd never even met another ampu@@ tee until I was 17 .
he 's co@@ ached five Olymp@@ ians , and the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he 's co@@ ached .
and no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a col@@ legi@@ ate level .
like , I almost came out of it , in front of , like , 5,000 people .
and he just sat there like this .

I set new records at the U.S. Nation@@ als -- the Olympic trials -- that May , and was sure that I was coming home with the gold .
I was the gu@@ ine@@ a pig . , I 'm telling you , this was , like -- talk about a tourist attraction .
and I 'm always looking around , like , where is my competition ?
this is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium , and they post the heat sheets . and I go over and look .
then I 'm looking : the next lane , lane two , is 12.@@ 8 .
all this training -- I had transformed my life .
and that was this collective glory -- that there was , you know , 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta .
( la@@ ughter ) No , these are my cosmetic legs , actually , and they 're absolutely beautiful .
and this is just a silic@@ on piece of skin .
so , asking for help is basically the worst , right ?
and so I said , very help@@ fully , that I thought maybe she could go back up@@ stairs and try to find something a little less som@@ ber .
technically , I can 't help you with that last one because I 'm not that kind of doctor , but I could point you in the direction of someone who could .
this is really important : please avoid dis@@ claim@@ ers , ap@@ ologies and bribes .
this is not true .
what is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed , that it had impact , that you were effective .
now , how do I feel about the time and effort I took to do that , when I really have no idea if I helped you , if it actually helped you get the thing that you wanted ?
but you know what else they do ?
they get pictures .
but the reality of modern work and modern life is that nobody does it alone .
a possible economic motivation to treat the patients .
meaning that most of the procedures performed on the chart I 've just shown could have been avoided , even in Sta@@ v@@ anger .
and to turn it the other way around , how often do you think you 'll get a " no " from a doctor if you ask such a question ?
the patient is supposed to get advice from the doctor about what to do .
and if spots light up , we know there 's a certain virus in there .
and Kap@@ osi 's sar@@ com@@ a @@@ -@@ @ associated her@@ pes virus gives a nice signature down here .
all right , I can see a r@@ hin@@ o@@ virus -- and here 's the blow @@@ -@@ @ up of the r@@ hin@@ o@@ virus 's little bar@@ code -- but what about different r@@ hin@@ o@@ viruses ?
you have no idea what someone 's going to c@@ ough into a cup , and it 's probably really complex , right ?
well , it 's pretty simple .
so , let 's start off with the positive control first , where we know the person was healthy .
we put a ton of virus up this guy 's nose . so -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- I mean , we wanted it to work . he really had a cold .
( la@@ ughter ) But by the time you get to block nine , you see that respiratory syn@@ cy@@ tial virus .
this individual has par@@ ain@@ flu@@ enza @@@ -@@ @ 1 , and you can see that there 's a little stri@@ pe over here for S@@ end@@ ai virus : that 's mouse par@@ ain@@ flu@@ enza .
it was " un@@ revealing " : that 's the path@@ ologist 's report .
no one would even consider it , because no one had a clu@@ e that it could cause respiratory failure .
it 's a classic gam@@ ma retro@@ virus , but it 's totally new ; no one 's ever seen it before .
this is a collaboration between myself and Don .
we have a three @@@ -@@ @ year window to cut emissions , three years .
so it 's not here . it 's not now .
this is felt as an inner discomfort .
first , we can f@@ lip distance to social .
we can also re@@ frame climate as being about new tech opportunities , about safety and about new jobs .

we can f@@ lip identity with better stories .
I 'm proud that my home@@ town of Oslo is now embarking on a bold journey of electri@@ fying all transport , whether cars , bikes or buses .

J@@ om@@ ny is an alien who has been sent to earth with a mission to study humans .

I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien .
these developments laid the groundwork for the modern field of antibio@@ tic@@ s@@ - currently home to our most effective TB treatments .
and even when properly identified , traditional treatments can take up to 9 months , requiring multiple drugs and a high potential for side effects .
you don 't know what it does for me to see women in the position that you 're in today .
this is why it 's so wonderful to have a conversation with someone who has such a long view -- LC : a long time .

there was gas ration@@ ing in 1973 .
if we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells , that will become more practical .
they have to track the sun , because they have to point directly at the sun .
we needed to beat solar cells .
James Wat@@ t did@@ n 't actually inv@@ ent the steam engine , he just refined it .
that 's the most fundamental heat engine you could have .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you 're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
the exact con@@ verse is also true .
and is only affects the pay@@ back period , it do@@ es@@ n 't mean that you cou@@ ld@@ n 't use solar energy ; you could use it anywhere on Earth .
the potential to take advantage of solar energy there is un@@ beli@@ evable , and I 'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
and they 'll build a community out of what otherwise would be an isol@@ ating and lon@@ ely experience .

so testing for HP@@ V would yield many , many posi@@ tives , and although most of them won 't be cause for concern , there is still no treatment plan for clearing the body of the virus .
the body 's immune system is able to eradicate most strains of HP@@ V before they cause any harm - and without people even knowing they 've been infected .
in some cases , the affected tissue may be removed .
researchers are also developing an injection for people who are already infected with HP@@ V 16 and 18 , which would target the infected cells to stop them from developing into can@@ cer@@ ous ones .

though Bor@@ ges was not interested in writing long books , he was an avi@@ d reader , recruiting friends to read to him after he went blind in middle age .
the narr@@ ator has spent his entire life wan@@ dering this vast lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th of information in a possibly futile search for meaning .
over the course of the story , he finds out the lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th is not a physical ma@@ ze but a novel .
and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past .
as recently as 1960 , 110 million children were born , and 20 million of those died before the age of five .
and I think that 's do@@ able in well under 20 years .
it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years .
1990 , you 've gotten most of the northern areas .

so we 're going to have these new tools .
it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on , and we 'd understand very well .
we all had a wonderful education .
and even if you graduate from high school , if you 're low @@@ -@@ @ income , you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree .

we should retain those people .
what are the characteristics of this top quar@@ tile ?

it 's an incredible discovery : an ancient , abandoned alien space station filled with precursor technology .
it 's possible to solve this rid@@ dle using as few as two cache points , and there are also valid solutions that use more .
since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5 , we can place these two cache points 5 par@@ sec@@ s apart .
you jump 3 par@@ sec@@ s , drop 9 units off at the cache point , and then jump the 3 units home , arriving with an empty tank .
repeating this process gets you 18 units of fuel at the cache point , and one more jump puts you at the 3 @@@ -@@ @ par@@ sec cache with 30 total units of fuel .
you fill up your tank and jump forward again , arriving with 10 units of fuel in your tank .
the men I 'd written about wanted to teach me a lesson .
Pakistan is home to 200 million people .
and my bar@@ ometer of anger led me , in 2014 , to honor killings .

many of the towns had never seen television or social media , and they were eager for their children to learn .
and in one of the villages that we were screening in , they shut it down and said they did@@ n 't want the women to know about their rights .

we are changing the way people in these villages interact , and we 're taking our lear@@ nings into other places .

that 's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o 'clock in the morning , and I don 't want to go there .

no ?

they 're not concerned with the condition of our souls .
we have set up a society that values shareholder value over everything , and they 're doing what they 're supposed to be doing .
I think they are trying to build something cool , and are probably , in moments of reflection , as horri@@ fied that some of the things that have happened as we might be .
Scot@@ t , thank you so much .
I wanted her to be seen in a clinic that specialized in trauma survivors .
but she took down the address and agreed to go .
if you 're thinking that , it 's probably because you have resources .
and he said , " Well , I have to work in order to pay the rent . "
I 'll sign it and I 'll fax it in for you . "

they were all desper@@ ately trying to save a woman 's life .
we spend more on health care than any other country in the world .
maybe it 's because my d@@ ad was a civil rights attorney and my parents were socially conscious and demanded that we stand up for what we believe in .
for example , if a pregnant woman in labor has really high blood pressure and we treat her with the right anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive medication in a timely fashion , we can prevent stroke .
there are some success stories .
this is true overall in the United States , where about three quarters of all black women deliver in a specific set of hospitals , while less than one @@@ -@@ @ fifth of white women deliver in those same hospitals .
if every pregnant woman in every community received this kind of high @@@ -@@ @ quality care and delivered at facilities that utilized standard care practices , our maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity rates would plum@@ met .
and she said , " What are you talking about ? "
now , it do@@ es@@ n 't look terri@@ bly interesting , but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters .
and here 's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ?
a romantic and a revolutionary , N@@ er@@ uda was one of the most celebrated po@@ ets of the 20th century , but also one of the most accessible and controversial .
although he continued to travel , after returning from exile N@@ er@@ uda lived in Chile for the rest of his life .
in one demonstration , he caused a pig to lose its voice by tying off one of its ner@@ ves .
he was convinced that each organ had a specific function .
introduced by H@@ ip@@ poc@@ rates centuries earlier , this mis@@ guided hypothesis attributed most medical problems to an imbalance in four bodily fluids called hum@@ ours .
O@@ don@@ to@@ ch@@ el@@ ys is an early ance@@ stor of the tur@@ tle .
it 's my role to shepher@@ d it in time , and that feels more meaningful to me than just ow@@ ning it for today .
today , actually , is a very special day for me , because it is my birthday .
well , we thought that , to some degree , our success is determined by the networks we 're part of -- that our networks can push us forward , they can pull us back .
but the way we actually started to explore , we realized that performance and success are very , very different animals when it comes to the mathematics of the problem .
and let me illustrate that .
and not only does he run only one percent faster than the second one , but he do@@ es@@ n 't run 10 times faster than I do -- and I 'm not a good run@@ ner , trust me on that .
so let 's see what were the sales for Nicholas S@@ parks .
why ?
and recently , I published a book that I devoted to that very question .
so what you see here is all the papers that I 've published from my very first paper , in 1989 ; I was still in Romania when I did so , till kind of this year .
I had the first 10 years where I had to work a lot and I don 't achieve much .
( la@@ ughter ) That time , I was doing material science , and then I kind of discovered for myself networks and then started publishing in networks .
and we don 't know , because there h@@ as@@ n 't been enough time passed yet to actually figure out how much impact those papers will get ; it takes time to acquire .
we 're not looking at real age .
it is the productivity that changes .
( appl@@ ause ) So in the end , what is it that we see , actually ?
most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and gra@@ sp@@ ing .
and this is Feli@@ x , actually .
and then , overall effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so I don 't have to plan it out in advance , but I can impro@@ vise , making it longer or shorter as I go .
it became clear to me she , too , was a victim of the policy .
it was printed on matches , playing cards , textbooks , posters .
and when you compare it to what was being done in America -- these are the ty@@ pe@@ faces from the same period in the United States in the 19@@ 20@@ s , bold , bra@@ sh , bra@@ gg@@ ad@@ o@@ ci@@ os .
and you realize that Fu@@ tur@@ a is doing something revolutionary .
and in many ways , there 's nothing wrong with this design .
everything seems centered , everything seems sym@@ metrical .
and it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine .
in this case , illustrations by P@@ abl@@ o Pic@@ as@@ so , moving across the page and breaking the gu@@ tter of the two pages .
when we think about what capital letters den@@ ote , they den@@ ote something important , whether it 's our names , or our titles .
actually , in some ways , America 's the home of capitalization .
and for them , this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America .
so for them to do this was a way in which Fu@@ tur@@ a was using this idea .
or even just new book covers , whether they were from Europe .
so for Americans who wanted to adopt this and make it part of their own system , something they could use in everyday ty@@ po@@ graphy , whether in ads or anything else , they actually had to have metal type .
so being good American capit@@ alists , what did we do ?
so America took this ty@@ pe@@ face in , conqu@@ ered it and made it its own .
but in this case , it was used on some of the most important maps , so this one , an air force map in 1962 , or used for the maps in Vietnam in ' 66 .
now imagine if astr@@ onau@@ ts had to use different ty@@ pe@@ faces and different systems for each component they had in the space shu@@ tt@@ les .
in fact , Fu@@ tur@@ a had authority , had legitimacy and had power because of this choice .
so in some ways , this German ty@@ pe@@ face on an American pl@@ a@@ que perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology .
( la@@ ughter ) In fact , people will ask me , " is@@ n 't it de@@ pressing , working on ob@@ it@@ u@@ aries and thinking about death all the time ? "
Ob@@ its are@@ n 't about death , they 're about life , they 're interesting , they 're rel@@ atable .
that 's the impetus behind a project I created called " Over@@ looked , " which tells the stories of marginalized groups of people who never got an ob@@ it .
perhaps in a generation or two , we 'll start to see more women and people of color in our ob@@ it@@ u@@ aries . "
and I thought , w@@ ow , one of the biggest sports in America was introduced by a woman ?
and it sent me on this deep di@@ ve through the archives .
there was this concern that , you know , the newspaper might look bad because it did@@ n 't get it right the first time .
and once my team saw the value in it , they were all in .
my all @@@ -@@ @ time favorite is Gran@@ d@@ ma G@@ ate@@ wood .
but when the police arrived , they arrested her , not him .
and at the finish , they asked her , " How did you survive so rough a place ? "
something like 25 different publishers have reached out to me with interest in turning " Over@@ looked " into a book .
so next , I worked with a program@@ mer to build this tool , called the diversity analysis tool .
and then I 'm hoping to partner with this program@@ mer again , to build a similar tool to measure people of color in our ob@@ its .
again , it was a really powerful experience .
a lot of them had to make up stories about their past just to get ahead in life .
and there were these patterns of their struggles that came up again and again .
believe it or not , this brilliant man never got an ob@@ it@@ u@@ ary , even though his work dec@@ o@@ ding German messages during World War II helps end the war .
( appl@@ ause continues ) Than@@ k you very much .
( la@@ ughter ) So , I 'll talk about musical composition , even though I don 't know where to start .

real @@@ -@@ @ world problems are often ambiguous and ill @@@ -@@ @ defined and the context is always changing .
there 's a sense in which it 's obvious , and yet , let me tell you a little story .
we know why these scripts are there .
I 'll just give you one example because time is racing .
instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes .
it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality .
yesterday we heard Wil@@ lie S@@ mits talk about re @@@ -@@ @ fo@@ resting in Indonesia .

in Atlanta , we saw that teachers felt desperate enough to have to help their students che@@ at on standardized tests that would impact their funding .
why don 't we try to re@@ claim the promise of public education and remember that it 's our greatest collective responsibility ?
and I 'm saying that as someone who do@@ es@@ n 't have kids yet but wants to worry a little bit less about the future when I do .
all my life I 've dre@@ amed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had .
( la@@ ughter ) Curren@@ tly , I 'm not watching the child .
she 's really focused .
( la@@ ughter ) She was@@ n 't doing anything , right ?
I 'm not watching the child .
coast is clear -- now she 's ready to play .
last but not least , children in study three chose to press a remote significantly more when the experi@@ men@@ ter that expressed a positive value was watching , as opposed to the experi@@ men@@ ter that had expressed a negative value .
( la@@ ughter ) From very early on , children , like adults , are sensitive to the values that we place on objects and behavi@@ ors .
psychologists study behavior to explore the contents of the mind , because our behavior often reflects our beliefs , our values and our desires .
or when we chose to offer can@@ dy , as opposed to nutri@@ tious food , as a reward for good behavior .
and in turn , this ends up shaping their own behavior .

a long time ago , there lived a Gi@@ ant , a Sel@@ fish Gi@@ ant , whose stunning garden was the most beautiful in all the land .
I was raised in a religious family , and I grew up reading both the Bible and the Qur@@ an .
for as long as we 've been communicating , there 's been the lay@@ ering to the narrative , the stories beneath the stories and the ones beneath those .
some , like my grand@@ mother and my si@@ bl@@ ings , seemed to be born reading , as though history stepped out of their way .
so as technology continues to speed ahead , I continue to read slowly , knowing that I am respecting the author 's work and the story 's lasting power .
and I read slowly to remember the Sel@@ fish Gi@@ ant , how he finally t@@ ore that wall down and let the children run free through his garden .

he had only weeks to live and had , in fact , already paid for his funeral .

their bodies had become ver@@ itable bi@@ ore@@ actors for these CAR T cells , producing millions and millions of CAR T cells in the bone mar@@ row , blood and tumor masses .

it 's the " Harry Pot@@ ter " story .
without a restoration story that can tell us where we need to go , nothing is going to change , but with such a restoration story , almost everything can change .
and we might mean slightly different things by them , but at least we start with some language in common .

I think we owe that to this generation .
it 's why experts and forec@@ asters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out .
in an environment that def@@ ies so much forecasting , efficiency won 't just not help us , it specifically undermines and ero@@ des our capacity to adapt and respond .
now , holding more capital looks and is inefficient .
countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions , multiple forms of renewable energy , not just one .
try some experiments .
the nurses h@@ ated it .
so now this form of nursing has prolif@@ erated across the Netherlands and around the world .
of course , not all experiments work .
failed experiments look inefficient , but they 're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works .
experiments like that require creativity and not a little bra@@ very .
this was expensive , it was time @@@ -@@ @ consuming , and it could be a little risky putting a whole bun@@ ch of rug@@ by players on a ski slope , right ?
they are@@ n 't efficient , but they give us lim@@ it@@ less capacity for adaptation , variation and invention .
and they just looked blank .
" they 're too busy . "
anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it , a s@@ pu@@ rious kind of manifest destiny .
the harder , deeper truth is that the future is un@@ char@@ ted , that we can 't map it till we get there .
and everybody is trying really hard to win points , but nobody is keeping track of who is winning games .
and as soon as the former advers@@ aries were gathered around some small green tables , each of them could claim a victory , and the whole world could breathe more easily .

and Eastern Europeans grew so ade@@ pt at hitting back everything that was hit at them that they almost brought the whole sport to a standstill .
but in Japan , I 'm encouraged to believe that , really , the point of a game is to make as many people as possible around you feel that they are winners .
you 're learning how to play with somebody , rather than against her .
I cou@@ ld@@ n 't ex@@ ult after a tremendous upset victory against our strongest players , because six minutes later , with a new partner , I was falling behind again .

and in order to grow and reproduce , all life needs a source of energy .
life forms are divided into two camps : auto@@ tro@@ phs , like plants , that generate their own energy , and heter@@ o@@ tro@@ phs , like animals , that consume other organisms for energy .
so what locations meet these criteria ?

so that 's George Sor@@ os .
a lot of what they do is measure engagement : clic@@ ks , comments , shares , ret@@ wee@@ ts , that kind of thing .
some of them wanted to do away with democracy altogether .
a lot of them , before they went down some internet rab@@ bit hole , they had been liber@@ tarian or they had been socialist or they had been something else entirely .
so the first one is to be a smart skep@@ tic .
and I don 't want to dro@@ wn you in technical epi@@ stem@@ ological information here , but I call them smart and dum@@ b skep@@ ticism .
( appl@@ ause ) So if you 're listening to my voice and you work at a social media company or you invest in one or , I don 't know , own one , this tip is for you .

on the other hand , by talking , a group could exchange knowledge , correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas .
what distinguished the groups that reached a consensus from those that did@@ n 't ?
they 're gray not because they 're unsure , but because they believe that the moral dilemma faces two valid , opposing arguments .
the most intuitive idea is that it 's just the average of all the answers in the group , right ?

we need new deep @@@ -@@ @ diving sub@@ mar@@ ines .
how about some X Pri@@ zes for ocean exploration ?
we need to see deep tren@@ ches , the under@@ sea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea .

natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , water@@ sh@@ eds and wildlife .
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , National Marine San@@ c@@ tuaries .

the good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .

( appl@@ ause ) And there are all these animals , and all these people happy , and there 's this economic value .
this is how it looks like in practice . we have this grass we want to get rid of .
so the idea is : how to integrate these flows in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
but is it really that easy ?
the nursery , in here , is quite different .

what can I , as an ec@@ ologist , do about that ?
well , my thought was that I could learn how to grow mos@@ ses , and that way we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't have to take them out of the wild .
they learned how to distinguish different species of mos@@ ses , which , to tell you the truth , is a lot more than my under@@ graduate students at the E@@ ver@@ green College can do .
because the prison ward@@ ens were very enthusiastic about this as well , I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons .
the " D@@ ir@@ ty Jobs " crew and I were called to a little town in Col@@ or@@ ado , called Cra@@ ig .
the job in question : her@@ ding sheep .
I also call PE@@ TA just for fun , and they don 't like it , but they confirm it .
we 're on in five continents , du@@ de !
I don 't like what I 'm thinking right now . "
and I 've been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one -- that one dr@@ illed something home in a way that I just was@@ n 't prepared for .
as a group , they 're the hap@@ pi@@ est people I know .
Bob Com@@ bs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the un@@ eaten sc@@ ra@@ ps of food from the cas@@ inos and feeds them to his sw@@ ine .
( la@@ ughter ) No , I mean , really .
and he points out there .
how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it 's sort of an analog computer .
Hiro@@ shi I@@ shi@@ i and his group at the MI@@ T Media La@@ b took a ping @@@ -@@ @ pon@@ g table and placed a projector above it , and on the ping @@@ -@@ @ pon@@ g table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it .
and as you play ping @@@ -@@ @ pon@@ g , whenever the ball hits part of the table , the ri@@ p@@ ples spread out and the fish run away .
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it .
that 's what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be -- what 's called depth @@@ -@@ @ first processing -- to focus , not be distr@@ acted .
biology -- we have co @@@ -@@ @ adapted through biology to like bright colors .
and the wa@@ iter can come by and say , " W@@ ould you like more water ? "
it 's that little voice in your head that 's the seat of consciousness .
and what 's so ne@@ at about it is how you accept that story .
and so people follow workplace norms .
because what G@@ el@@ f@@ and has found is that , when things are too loose , people cra@@ ve order and structure .
they 've dealt with massive growth that overwhel@@ med existing communities and the rise of new business models .
for example , they noticed that successful public places generally have three different ways that they structure behavior .
my doctor said , " We know why people get like this .
and one day , he stood on a land mine left over from the war with the United States , and he got his leg blown off .
they explained that they went and sat with him .
but then , in the long journey for my book , all over the world , I kept meeting people who were doing exactly that , from Sydney , to San Francisco , to SÃ£o Paulo .
one day , Sam decided to pioneer a different approach .
and Lis@@ a had been shut away in her home with crip@@ pling depression and anxiety for seven years .
they started to get their fingers in the soil .
the way Lis@@ a put it to me , " As the garden began to blo@@ om , we began to blo@@ om . "
so everyone knows jun@@ k food has taken over our di@@ ets and made us physically sick .
I could see how often in my own life , when I felt down , I tried to remedy it with some kind of show @@@ -@@ @ off@@ y , grand external solution .
and I could see why that did not work well for me .
it 's like a gl@@ itch in a computer program , it 's just a wiring problem in your head . "
this is me talking to Mir@@ ko . Mir@@ ko did@@ n 't want to be in the picture .
( la@@ ughter ) And we just don 't know if some of the pairs got married .
what matters here is that we rele@@ ar@@ n how to have these face @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ face discussions , without anyone else listening , with a stranger .
not only with a stranger we are introduced to by a Tin@@ der for politics , but also with a stranger in a pu@@ b or in a gym or at a conference .
escape is impossible .
over the roughly one @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half mill@@ enn@@ ia of its existence , chess has been known as a tool of military strategy , a met@@ aph@@ or for human affairs , and a benchmark of gen@@ ius .
today , chess software is capable of consistently defe@@ ating the best human players .
since returning to G@@ aul , she has received many offers of marri@@ age@@ - but she has decided to devote herself to her work , at least for now .
so I 'm g@@ onn@@ a take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence .
that fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereo@@ typed and ends up with a meal -- changes .
and that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times , at Virginia Tech .
when that mother and infant lock eyes , and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile , what happens -- spontaneously -- is the erup@@ tion of joy on the part of the mother .
we 're going to look at body play , which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .
and -- they don 't throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being play@@ ful .
the human hand , in manipulation of objects , is the hand in search of a brain ; the brain is in search of a hand ; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
I 'm sorry I don 't have a play@@ ful @@@ -@@ @ looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
nobody mis@@ ses that dog I took a picture of on a Car@@ mel beach a couple of weeks ago .
I think we 've got a lot of learning to do .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
and I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly , " It 's really important to have a lot of data . "
third rule is that when I get back that information it 's not just got somebody 's height and weight and when they were born , it 's got relationships .
I wrote an article entitled " Lin@@ ked Data " a couple of years ago and soon after that , things started to happen .
it 's not just a whole lot of other plants .
let 's start with government data .
that 's important . why is it important ?
well , you take that mou@@ thful and you put it into Google .
at that point , I 'd been working for more than a decade on this seemingly in@@ tractable problem of dating violence .
was pornography to blame for any percentage of dating violence ?
so I could see why , on the one hand , we might be very worried about the messages that pornography is sending , and on the other hand , why we might be really worried about going over@@ board indic@@ ting it .
by the time they 're 18 years old , 93 percent of first year college males and 62 percent of females have seen pornography at least once .
or missing root causes of dating and sexual violence , which are the true public health crises .
that said , even my own research demonstrates that adolescents are turning to pornography for education and information about sex .
so let 's give it a try , let 's rock and roll , let 's flood the world with climate activists .
now , what the scientists are telling us we need to do over the next 80 @@@ -@@ @ odd years to the end of this century , is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by three percent every year , and draw three gig@@ at@@ ons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year .
it does , it 's one of the best options , but there are many , many possibilities .
there are chemical pathways and biological pathways .
the biological pathways are fantastic because the energy source that 's needed to drive them , the sun , is effectively free .
there are also chemical pathways .
direct air capture is a great example of a chemical path@@ way , and people are using that right now to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and manufacture biofuels or manufacture plastics .
you know , it 's a fair question : can we plant our way out of this problem by using trees ?
you know , if we could cover nine percent of the world 's ocean in sea@@ weed farms , we could draw down the equivalent of all of the greenhouse gases we put up in any one year , more than 50 gig@@ at@@ ons .
and how close are we to that at the moment ?
how many ocean @@@ -@@ @ going sea@@ weed farms do we actually have out there ?
there 's no nutrients there that were used up long ago .
and with just a little bit of clean , renewable energy , you can pump that water up and use the nutrients in it to irrig@@ ate your sea@@ weed crop .
so I think this really has so many benefits .
it provides an ideal environment for growing marine protein .
the economics of all of this is going to be challenging .
you know , in the next 30 years , we have to go from being a carbon @@@ -@@ @ emitting economy to a carbon @@@ -@@ @ absorbing economy .
and that do@@ es@@ n 't seem like very long .
now , in 1919 , here in Edinburgh , you might have seen a canvas and wood bi@@ plane .
we can do a lot in a short period of time .
we had nothing that could help them stop this abuse .
and then came the internet , and the market exploded .
and that 's exactly what we 're doing at Thor@@ n .
let 's talk for a minute -- ( Appl@@ ause ) Than@@ k you .
in a sil@@ o , it might work for the one agency that has control over it , but not connecting this data means we don 't know how many are unique .
the first is with law enforcement : helping them identify new victims faster , stopping abuse and stopping those producing this content .
the second is with companies : using it as clu@@ es to identify the hundreds of millions of files in circulation today , pulling it down and then stopping the upload of new material before it ever goes viral .
our dream was an alarm bell on the desks of officers all around the world so that if anyone dare post a new victim online , someone would start looking for them immediately .
so , I told you -- 45 million images and videos in the US alone last year .
these come from those companies that have the money to build the infrastructure that it takes to pull this content down .
this aud@@ acious commitment is part of that will .
it 's a declaration of war against one of humanity 's dar@@ k@@ est ev@@ ils .
and , of course , we are am@@ used by jo@@ kes because they are funny .
if you looked at gl@@ uc@@ ose molecules till you were blind , you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't see why they ta@@ sted sweet .
it 's a ne@@ ural system that 's wired up to reward the brain for doing a g@@ rub@@ by cler@@ ical job .
all of her online accounts were floo@@ ded with screen@@ shots of the video , with graphic rape and death threats and with sl@@ urs about her Muslim faith .
they find an audience pri@@ med to believe them .
and it 's that risk that professor Robert Ch@@ es@@ ney and I call the " li@@ ar 's dividend " : the risk that li@@ ars will invoke deep@@ f@@ akes to escape accountability for their wrongdoing .
yet , when she went to law enforcement in Delhi , she was told nothing could be done .
but of course , that 's just a small piece of the regulatory puzzle .
no way to explo@@ de a star in a lab to figure out why or how it ble@@ w up .
just pictures and movies of the sky .
imagine the cost .
these collabor@@ ations between domain experts and astro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts created transform@@ ational solutions to help improve people 's quality of life .
thank you .
( appl@@ ause and che@@ ers )
A@@ ha , is it in fact a real rock ? "
but when we hear information , this is what happens .
now , there are generally only two emotional states that a neuro@@ diverse brain can tab@@ ulate and keep count of at any given time , thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be emo@@ tionally , sometimes , att@@ un@@ ed to the present situation .
( la@@ ughter ) And I would c@@ run@@ ch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain .
and when I finished hur@@ ting people a little bit , I would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ?
( la@@ ughter ) I kept on doing this for a while .
here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predic@@ tably all the time .
it turns out that because we don 't en@@ code duration in the way that we en@@ code intensity , I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower .
how much do I stand to gain from che@@ ating ?
we call this like a personal f@@ udge factor .
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ?
our subjects doubled their che@@ ating .
when we give people the opportunity to che@@ at , they che@@ at .
but in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
and the experi@@ men@@ ter said , " If you 've finished everything , go home .
so , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
and they clearly che@@ ated in a very , very serious way .
when we get bigger distance from che@@ ating , from the object of money , for example , people che@@ at more .
what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
and the difficulty of testing our in@@ tuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them .
but it was actually more interesting than that , because she said , " I did not think that your in@@ tuition was right .
( la@@ ughter ) So it took me that long to own this thing that was what my purpose was .
and I was like , " You know what ?
so on my birthday , what did I do ?
I went Zi@@ pl@@ ining through the forests of Pun@@ ta Can@@ a .
and I feel like every day that I 'm speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me , I feel like I 'm falling out of that plane .
my integrity is something I hold dear .
assuming it was roughly the size of my wife 's hand , I made some measurements of her thum@@ b , and I scaled them out to the size of the sk@@ ull .

this access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented .
it gave people amazing content around the globe .
instead you 'd go to the local bar and che@@ er along with your fellow sports fans there .
if there is an activity that you really enjoy , you 're probably going to like watching other people do it with skill and pan@@ ache .
instead , what I want you to picture is millions of cam@@ p@@ fires .
let 's try taking a seat by one of those cam@@ p@@ fires right now .
ES : so I 'm here at TED with about 1,000 of my closest friends , and we thought we 'd come and join you guys for a little stream .
Co@@ h@@ h : awesome ! it 's great to hear from you guys .
700 people that way -- but it 's great and really it 's just -- ES : so Co@@ h@@ h , what is going on in chat right now ?
the more people that hear about what you do , the better -- for everyone on here .
( appl@@ ause ) ES : so that was a new way to interact .
and all of this stuff is going to happen around the met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical cam@@ p@@ fire .
today , we know that the heart is not the source of love or the other emotions , per se ; the an@@ ci@@ ents were mistaken .

while it 's true that managing tomorrow 's water risk is going to require better data and more technology , today we 're barely using the little water data that we have .
what you might not be aware of is that the US Department of Defense is the world 's largest consumer of jet fuel .

how many areas could our global community protect through these and other programs ?
why not create opportunities in opportunity zones ?
I quickly took down the number , because it said " flexible hours , " and I needed that to work around my basketball schedule .
and 500 million in East Africa .
the crop is already gone , which results in further poverty and more hunger .
in real life , though , the AI that we actually have is not nearly smart enough for that .
and it turns out that the way AI tends to solve this particular problem is by doing this : it assem@@ bles itself into a tower and then falls over and lands at Point B.
it 's really common .
why would it be looking for human fingers if it 's trying to identify a fish ?
but what it looks like happened is the AI was trained to recognize trucks on highway driving , where you would expect to see trucks from behind .
so in other words , we have to be prepared to work with AI that 's not the super @@@ -@@ @ competent , all @@@ -@@ @ knowing AI of science fiction .

first , we just don 't have a rational relationship to information , we have an emotional one .
and when we 're fear@@ ful , over@@ simplified narr@@ atives , conspir@@ atorial explanations and language that demon@@ izes others is far more effective .
and besides , many of these companies , their business model is attached to attention , which means these algorithms will always be ske@@ wed towards emo@@ tion .
they 're certainly trying .
they could offer insights around difficult content @@@ -@@ @ moderation decisions .

so there and then , and actually with a lot of encouragement from a couple of TE@@ D@@ sters , I declared my own personal war on super@@ bugs .
so let 's talk about super@@ bugs for a moment .
and since then , drug @@@ -@@ @ resistant bacteria have continued to emerge , and so we 've been forced to develop newer and newer drugs to fight these new bacteria .
I 'm sure you 'll recognize at least some of these super@@ bugs .
so it seems pretty clear that we 're not on a good road , and the drugs @@@ -@@ @ based approach to this problem is not working .
we 've actually known this for more than 100 years .
that wa@@ vel@@ ength is called far @@@ -@@ @ U@@ VC light , and it 's just the short @@@ -@@ @ wa@@ vel@@ ength part of the ultra@@ violet spectrum .

what about in practice ?
and we need to do short @@@ -@@ @ term tests , and we need to do long @@@ -@@ @ term tests to make sure you can 't develop mel@@ an@@ oma many years on .

the subsequent power struggle led to a Civil War , which split the country in two .
months after a de@@ bil@@ itating stroke left him unable to govern , key members of his military defec@@ ted to southern forces .

sometimes when you get there , there 's almost a let down .
but I 'd want one that could play , too .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with HIV .
fortunately , I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that 's the only way that this work can really occur .
it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves .
it was our mission to serve people .
being inclusive of our audiences -- it 's always been an important part of the company .
and that was some outreach .
and it da@@ wned on me , as we were there , I 'm going like , " Here we are in the seat of Mother Africa , and we 're trying to teach these people how to dance ? "

OK , it 's not marketing ; there 's a very interesting car concept here , but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here .
now , now I get to the point . I want to talk about cars as art .
to@@ oth@@ brush , cool .
but right now it 's in dealing with our own people , our own teams who are doing the creating . so , to my story .
there 's good times ; there 's interesting times ; and there 's some stress times too .
you 've got to do cars in the rain ; you 've got to do cars in the snow .
this is sick beyond belief .
( la@@ ughter ) But because of this , the intim@@ acy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension , a new meaning .
we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it , that I only had a phone number that connected me to them .
the bathroom was so big , she built the bed over the bathtub -- it 's quite fascinating .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in Ti@@ bur@@ on , which is just up the road from here -- you know Ti@@ bur@@ on ?
and so I had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
so I did@@ n 't know any of this , and we got a presentation that had an agenda , looked like this .
you 're letting me down , you 're my designers , you 're supposed to be the creative ones , what the hell is going on around here ? "
love is not sel@@ fish . " and I thought about this , and I thought , " You know , I 'm not showing love here . I 'm seriously not showing love .
this CA@@ N@@ NOT be . this CA@@ N@@ NOT be that I 'm expecting a certain number of sket@@ ches , and to me that 's my quanti@@ fication method for qualifying a team .
one of those was the idea of a cros@@ so@@ ver cou@@ pes -- you see it down@@ stairs , the X Cou@@ pe -- they had a lot of fun with that .
and so , in conclusion , my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you , was this one here . I 'm also going to steal a little quote out of " Little Prince . "
and The Police 's " Syn@@ chron@@ icity " cas@@ set@@ te had just been released and there was no hel@@ met law in my home@@ town of B@@ reg@@ en@@ z .
and there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstr@@ action .
and , lastly , under " Harmony , " they had this 13th @@@ -@@ @ century man@@ d@@ ala from Tibet .
and I felt a little bit che@@ ated , because the visu@@ alization -- that 's a really easy thing to do .
you know , that 's not a big deal to accomplish .
you don 't see the horizon .
people 's demean@@ or changes when they go in there .
and he took it upon himself to print 5@@ 5,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stic@@ kers , large ones and small ones .
( la@@ ughter ) I think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good .
you know , one is : just working without pressure .
and then I found another list in one of my di@@ aries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far .
" you have mal@@ igned a great woman . "
it 's called " The Neigh@@ b@@ or . "
God knows though , there are worse t@@ wi@@ sts your ob@@ sessions can take .
the girls , to my horror , aver@@ ted their gaz@@ e .
still , to be able to die with no special con@@ trition , not having been sla@@ ugh@@ tered , or ensla@@ ved .
it should be opinion @@@ -@@ @ driven ; less news , more views .
so now , on the following movie you will see that I 'm much better in flying a w@@ ing@@ suit than speaking in English .
enjoy , and thank you very much .
UE : the pu@@ rest and the best feeling would be with only go@@ gg@@ les .
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer , moc@@ ked it up in card@@ board , we 'd come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
( la@@ ughter ) An@@ y@@ way , I went out to Air@@ stream about six times during the process of building this prototype , and it 's called the B@@ amb@@ i prototype .
they did@@ n 't want to go to a compon@@ enti@@ zed system .
that scene sounds like science fiction , but is battlefield reality already .
the soldier in that case was a 42 @@@ -@@ @ pound robot called a Pack@@ Bo@@ t .
we went in with zero unmanned ground systems . we now have 12,000 .
and the tech term " kill@@ er application " takes on new meaning in this space .
that 's where we 're at right now .
the U.S. is currently ahead in military robo@@ tics right now , but we know that in technology there 's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .
and this raises a bigger worry for me .
or another way of thinking about this is , what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India ?
we don 't have a draft . we don 't have declarations of war anymore .
they also record everything that they see .
but we have to remember , these are just the clips .
they lose the strategy .
as anyone who 's played Grand The@@ ft Auto knows , we do things in the video world that we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't do face to face .
are we going to face the reality of 21st century war ?
and now , we 're using our creativity in a certain direction , to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities , maybe even one day an entirely new species .
my story begins when I opened the holy book for the first time ...
and I got to grow up in that environment .
you can -- if you love anything , you can work hard and you can accomplish anything you want .
they cried .
and cried .
I remember as the youngest of these five kids feeling heard for the first time .
so I 'd get this beta software and hardware from places like HP and Sun and Rus@@ sell Brown at Adobe .
and I had no manual , so I 'd figure it out and I fell in love with it even more .
( la@@ ughter ) Al@@ ways listen to your parents .
( la@@ ughter ) I wanted to be Z@@ em@@ ec@@ k@@ is , Luc@@ as and Spi@@ el@@ berg .
the last thing I wanted to talk about was my own cultural identity , my ethnicity .
and then a couple years ago , I felt a little bit lost , cre@@ atively .
I heard from voices from the sky ...
OK , fine , it was Twitter .
and then I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I am Hollywood .
I felt lucky to be here , but at this moment , I realized that I was not just lucky to be here , I had the right to be here .
also , some tech founders out here started to post stuff on social media , write stuff about us in articles in the " LA Times , " in " The Hollywood Re@@ porter " and " Entertainment Week@@ ly . "
what an amazing thing to witness .
it became more physical when I went to the movie theater .
film was a gift given to me , and through the years I 've learned a lot of things .
I got to be who I wanted to be when I needed to be it .
and as I was doing the finishing touches on this talk , I realized that all the powerful connections in my life were through generosity and kindness and love and hope .
so I have a challenge for myself and for anyone here .
in fact , our future depends on it .
turns out , it really is all about location , location , location .
and I 'm here to tell you that nan@@ op@@ articles are the fire trucks .
and they will continue to circulate in the blood , giving them more time to find the tumor .
and here we see the cancer drug , the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters , inside the fire truck , the nan@@ op@@ articles .
there are certain very important but sensitive drugs that are easily degraded by enzy@@ mes in the blood .
and here we see the illustration of blocking the liver .
and that ends with a little cli@@ p of my father , of L@@ ou , talking about something that is very dear to him , which is the accidents of life .
and those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what , to me , is really his greatest building which is a building in Dha@@ ka , Bangladesh .
we were the first film crew in there .
NK : do you know anything about the architect ?
NK : thank you .
he is not a political man , but in this gu@@ ise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
and this is the largest project he has got in here , the poorest country in the world .
but he was also human .
there is no other short@@ cut , no other way to really understand him .
but I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that 's why , he has given love for us .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
despite that , 15 years ago , I left medical school , as I missed mathematics .
since then , I 've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data .
w@@ ow . ( laugh@@ s ) And si@@ gh , and , who@@ o , going to get blown away there .
it would be really nice if there was just one chemical that they detected , but it 's not that simple .
so let 's stay as calm as possible . that would be great .
now three of the s@@ ocks have been worn by children who were un@@ infected , and just one of the s@@ ocks was worn by a child who was infected with malaria .
( la@@ ughter ) But it is really incredible , and when we do this , what we find is that these dogs can correctly tell us when somebody is infected with malaria 81 percent of the time .
( music : Richard Stra@@ uss " Also Spr@@ ach Zar@@ a@@ thu@@ str@@ a " ) Right ?
and if you cou@@ ld@@ n 't predict , you died .
( la@@ ughter ) You 're creating the meaning and projec@@ ting it onto me .
if you 're a conservative , you become more conservative .
and it 's the experience of a@@ we .
and for thousands of years , we 've been thinking and writing and experiencing a@@ we , and we know so little about it .
it 's becoming asym@@ metrical in its activity , biased towards the right , which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world , as opposed to step back .
well , others have demonstrated , for instance , Prof@@ essors Ha@@ id@@ t and Kel@@ t@@ ner , have told us that people feel small but connected to the world .
they actually seek risk , and they are better able at taking it .
they were more likely to give a positive response after the performance than they were [ before ] .
to enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty .
and the results are actually incredibly positive .
so where can we find a@@ we , given how important it is ?
I know what it 's like to have the government say , " We 're going to kill you in the morning . "
it does not work in the long run .
part of the problem from creating us versus them is it 's hard to do .
acc@@ using , attacking , on behalf of we the people .
these are absur@@ di@@ ties .
and we 're looking at a bun@@ ch of statistics , but I want you to understand , this is happening to the house@@ keeper who brought up your kids .
this is happening to the gar@@ den@@ er who took care of your house .
and the danger in this stuff is once you start norm@@ alizing absur@@ di@@ ties and atrocities , people think that those instruments are legitimate .
some of them are immigrants .
this is@@ n 't about kids and borders .
we would have been at that bridge in Sel@@ ma .
in order to predict effectively , we need to use science .
but if you show them that it 's in their interest , then they 're responsive .
S@@ ally 's giving her opinion to them , and they 're giving their opinion to S@@ ally .
but S@@ ally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three , and what they 're saying to Harry .
with five decision @@@ -@@ @ makers there are a lot of linkages -- 120 , as a matter of fact , if you remember your fac@@ tor@@ ials .
five fac@@ torial is 120 .
now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep 120 things straight in their head .
does that mean we 've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know , from 120 to 240 ?
no . how about 10 times ?
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information .
and everybody 's best friend , Ahmad@@ ine@@ jad . how are things going for him ?
you take a look at this , this is not based on statistics .
I want to be very clear here . I 'm not projec@@ ting some past data into the future .
and then the model makes predictions down the road .
that 's not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they 're not put under international pressure , if they 're allowed to pursue their own devices .
but in any event , by the end of this year , beginning of next year , we get to a stable equilibrium outcome .
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today , this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 , early parts of 2011 .
that power dis@@ appears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011 .
these fol@@ ks are the mone@@ yed interests in Iran , the bankers , the oil people , the ba@@ z@@ a@@ aries .
they are growing in political cl@@ out , as the mul@@ la@@ hs are isol@@ ating themselves -- with the exception of one group of mul@@ la@@ hs , who are not well known to Americans .
he is on the way down .
OK , so I 'd like you to take a little away from this .
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable .
I would like to leave you with one thought , which is for me , the dominant theme of this gathering , and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world .
I love that you put it out there .
ca : so you 're kind of trying to say , " People of Iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . "
ca : here 's hoping they hear it that way . thank you very much Bru@@ ce .
B@@ BM : thank you .
I 'm from De@@ tro@@ it .
here 's the thing : because of De@@ tro@@ it 's recent history , it now finds itself with some very unique assets , open land being one of them .
they further go on to say that 40 square miles of the city is vacant .
so De@@ tro@@ it has this -- open land , fertile soil , proximity to water , willing labor and a desperate demand for healthy , fresh food .
and these are@@ n 't plots of land where we 're just growing tomatoes and car@@ ro@@ ts either .
keep G@@ rowing De@@ tro@@ it is a non@@ profit organization that had a lot to do with those farms .
my city is a long way from succeeding .
they never gave up .
when I was little , my sister and I would have contests to see who could spell " M @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ s @@@ -@@ @ i @@@ -@@ @ p @@@ -@@ @ p @@@ -@@ @ i " the fastest .
today , as a physical organic chem@@ ist , I 'm committed to use my training to help protect rivers , like the Mississippi , from excessive salt that can come from human activity .
if we add one te@@ as@@ po@@ on of salt to this Olympic @@@ -@@ @ size swimming pool of ocean water , the ocean water stays ocean water .
so the point here is , because rivers , the volume is so small compared to the oceans , it is especially vulnerable to human activity , and we need to take care to protect them .
the authors of this paper post@@ ulate that this could be due to using salt to de@@ ice roads .
and these membran@@ es are negatively charged , and help to repe@@ l the negatively charged chloride ions that are in that dissolved salt .
even more than that , actually .
now , I 've introduced this to a number of industrial @@@ -@@ @ water users , and the common response is , " Y@@ ea@@ h , but who is going to use my salt ? "
so you can see how circular salt can provide a barrier to our rivers from this excessive sal@@ ty discharge .
for the same reason , big things are not much affected by small parts of themselves , i.e. , by details .
I could tell you story after story , but I haven 't forgotten Fernan@@ do .
children and parents live in family units and clusters of families are housed together .
they keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do .
and what all of them had in common was that as they sle@@ pt , they 'd all been bit@@ ten by the only mam@@ mal that lives exclusively on a diet of blood : the v@@ amp@@ ire bat .
can we stop them ?
but it also means that those jum@@ ps between species , which are so important to understand , but so rare for most viruses , for rab@@ ies , they 're actually happening by the thousands .
" who 's been getting bit@@ ten by a bat lately ? "
and so all we had to do was go to the right house , open up a net and show up at night , and wait until the b@@ ats tried to fly in and feed on human blood .
so my second question was this : could we somehow cut the virus off at its source ?
and from gen@@ ome sequences that we got from the viruses in those cow bra@@ ins , I was able to work out that this is a virus that spreads between 10 and 20 miles each year .
it 's that vacc@@ inating the animal source is the only thing that stops rab@@ ies .
so , can we vacc@@ inate b@@ ats ?
it might sound like a crazy question , but the good news is that we actually already have edi@@ ble rab@@ ies vaccines that are specially designed for b@@ ats .
and what 's even better is that these vaccines can actually spread from bat to bat .
now we have a whole laundry list of questions .
what time of the year do we need to be vacc@@ inating ?
but it was very painful at times and continues to be so .
an im@@ am was present who made it clear that their religion was wrong , and the only good path was to accept Islam and marry a Muslim man .
these women and girls are healing .
in her book , " Woman at Point Zero , " she wrote , " Life is very hard , and the only people who really live are those who are harder than life itself . "
because I share their sorrow , their language and their culture , we connect on the deepest human level .
you are .
and what I 've noticed is that most people 's stories tend to circle around two key themes .
" Oh , ye@@ ah ? when ? "
she asked me what she should do .
so what I want to do is I want to edit this woman 's letter together , right here , as a way to show how we can all revise our stories .
so the guy looks at his ink bl@@ ot and he says , " Well , I definitely don 't see blood . "
I have a confession to make .

and so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do .
that molec@@ ule is there , and they 're making light .
what 's important for today 's talk is we know there are hundreds of behavi@@ ors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashi@@ ons .
it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies .
and we think by studying bacteria , we 're going to be able to have insight about mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ul@@ arity in the human body .
when we del@@ ved deeper , we realized that lack of accountability is at the core of it .
" we assure you that you will get your free drugs each time . "
and finally , we worked with elected representatives to launch these revived P@@ HC@@ s , who shared the citizen promises with the community with a lot of fan@@ fare .
and how do you convince the mothers to actually bring their children for immunization ?
and a great way to trigger the motivation is to increase transparency to the citizen .
understanding this ancient type of biological computation is the critical first step .
and if we can realize this , we would enter in the era of an operating system that runs living software .
but mortal guards and ordinary weapons w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't suffice , so the vi@@ sionary god devised an in@@ dom@@ itable new defender .

none of these cre@@ ations were as famous as TA@@ LOS , who appeared on Greek coins , v@@ ase paintings , public fres@@ co@@ es , and in theat@@ rical performances .
the web , mobile devices , virtual and augmented reality were res@@ crip@@ ting our nervous systems .
to answer this , I had to build a machine .
( la@@ ughter ) I 've been developing an open @@@ -@@ @ source bi@@ ometric lab , an AI system which I call the lim@@ bic La@@ b .
the more im@@ prints added to the database across medi@@ ums from ep@@ is@@ odic television to games , the better the predic@@ tive models become .
this process will also be cataly@@ zed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
and wh@@ ale oil lit practically every building .
both national competitiveness and national security are at risk .
and serious competition from Europe , from Korea , and next is China , which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .
and after that comes India .
will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil , or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars ?
that seems to make more sense .
and we 'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
it 's finan@@ ce@@ able in the private capital market .
and these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
they make a little net money for the treasury .
let me focus a minute on the light vehicles , the cars and light trucks , because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here drives one .
so then of the energy that does get to the wheels , only an eighth of it , half of that , goes to heat the tires on the road , or to heat the air the car push@@ es aside .
so there 's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter .
ours is on the demand side .
so you 're six years old , you 're reading S@@ now White and the Seven D@@ war@@ ves , and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world : D@@ war@@ ves and Prince Char@@ min@@ gs .
I used the word post@@ modern as if it were OK .
( la@@ ughter ) So this whole subject @@@ -@@ @ object thing has relevance to hum@@ or in this way .
I 'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) And you know people , this is the problem with quote , objectivity , un@@ quote .
when you 're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you , or share the same set of assumptions as you , you start to think that that 's reality .
and this is instead of contradiction .
( la@@ ughter ) But here 's how I think I like to make change , and that is in making connections .
and they look quite similar .
it 's different , very different from the surrounding buildings , because other buildings are trying to build a wall around the nature .
but what we 're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature , so we can extend the nature from the park into the city .
that looks very fit into this painting .
it 's nature .
so architecture is no longer a functional machine for living .

that is actually the device .

because without chemistry , what is an information super@@ highway that we love , would just be a really expensive , sh@@ in@@ y paper@@ weight .

when these solar storms are moving in space , some of them will inevitably encounter space pro@@ bes that we humans have sent in order to explore other worlds .
what I mean by other worlds is , for example , planets , such as Ven@@ us or Mercury , but also objects , such as com@@ ets .
and while these space pro@@ bes have been made for different scientific endeav@@ ors , they can also act like tiny cosmic meteorological stations and monitor the evolution of these space storms .
on a random visit to T@@ es@@ la on some afternoon , I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .
you don 't do it as a human being . you do it as a machine .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electr@@ ons , something interesting happens .
just it do@@ es@@ n 't burn . it con@@ sumes itself step after step after step .
in Europe where taxes are in place , that 's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
he said hy@@ bri@@ ds are like mer@@ ma@@ ids .
that 's all the U.S. usage today .
for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on range , not a reduction in range .
we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S.
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
in Denmark , we will drive all the cars in Denmark from wind@@ mills , not from oil .
and we said , " What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? "
and they said , " We tried . there is@@ n 't any . "
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we 'll recover him .
( la@@ ughter ) He actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
200 years ago , in Parliament , in Great Britain , there was a long argument over economy versus morality .
came from a source of energy that was immoral : human slaves .
and what would it do to our economy ?
and the U.@@ K. had 100 years of economic growth .

and you know , I saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
what we 're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .
to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that .
it did@@ n 't happen .
and pretty soon it 's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .
the way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es and extra chro@@ mos@@ om@@ es , so we go from 46 to 47 or 48 .
that is simply not going to happen .
and they depend too much upon history , upon philosophy , upon religion , upon culture , upon politics .
and to lose touch with the basic rhyth@@ ms of our biology and our health .

what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
so much carbon , so every year , roughly five billion tons of carbon from plants go into this network underground .
now this is where you need to understand that , like humans , plants and fun@@ gi are incredibly opportun@@ istic .
there 's also evidence that the fun@@ gi are good at infl@@ ating the price of nutrients .
so rather than pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ sizing , tap into the network , steal the carbon and give nothing in return .
so our group helped pioneer a method , a technology , whereby we could tag nutrients with nan@@ op@@ articles , fluo@@ res@@ cing nan@@ op@@ articles called quantum do@@ ts .
this is important , because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources .
our colleagues in the Center for Qu@@ antum Compu@@ tation and sp@@ intr@@ onics are actually measuring with their l@@ asers dec@@ o@@ he@@ rence in a single electr@@ on spin .

so this life plan shows the steps for us to secure our land , our biodiversity , our culture , our education .
and we have been trying to scream to the world that we need to protect our territory , our nature .
I guess this crisis is teaching humanity that now you need to listen to us and to support indigenous peoples directly , to support their initiatives directly .

and that is , they said , " You should work with Dr. Temple Gran@@ din . "
and she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities .
so I end up meeting her , and she 's the very best type of cri@@ tic , in a sense that she just loves the animals , wants to protect them , but she also understands the reality of the meat business .

I looked a lot like an oran@@ gu@@ tan , our close cou@@ sins , or the Incre@@ di@@ ble H@@ ul@@ k .
she was very p@@ is@@ sed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice .
she came back . she goes , " Come on . I don 't have all day . "
and then I took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
that photo is of the semi @@@ -@@ @ fin@@ als of the Buenos Aires championships , four months later .
it 's pretty simple . there are nine , sort of , rules that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing .
the interesting thing about this climb is it 's not that hard .
but if you 're the leader on it , at the hardest move , you 're looking at about 100 foot fall , onto some low angle s@@ lab@@ s .
so you 've got to focus .
this is a climb in the Ne@@ ed@@ les , again in California .
fear really suc@@ ks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing .
so don 't hang on till the bitter end .
thank you very much .
just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the t@@ all@@ est models are about two or three feet high .
that one on the right is about five feet high .
the work involves hundreds of different cro@@ ch@@ et models .
and if the ble@@ aching do@@ es@@ n 't go away -- if the temperatures don 't go down -- reefs start to die .
and they said they were having an exhibition about artists ' response to global warming , and they 'd like our coral ree@@ f to be part of it .
I 've written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.@@ A. Times .
and I went home , and I told my sister Chris@@ tine .
and she nearly had a fit because Chris@@ tine is a professor at one of L.@@ A. ' s major art colleges , Cal@@ Arts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square @@@ -@@ @ foot gallery .
and to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center 's 3,000 square foot gallery .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
so we went and taught the techniques . we did workshops and lectures .
why not ch@@ is@@ el a coral ree@@ f out of marble ?
and they have different properties .
you all have a sense of what a flat space is , Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an space is .
that 's our definition of a parallel line .
and I have a point outside the line . how many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line ?
they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straight@@ ness , it 's called a geo@@ de@@ sic .
so we ask the question again , " How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? "
but that 's only because I 'm projec@@ ting it onto a flat surface .
how could they see this ?
it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an space .
I can touch it . I can play with it . "
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
it also says a whole lot of things about what mathemati@@ cians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and cou@@ ld@@ n 't do , what they thought it could and cou@@ ld@@ n 't represent .
we started out , Chris@@ sy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathem@@ atically perfect models .
and all of our contributors , who are an amazing collection of people around the world , do their own emb@@ ell@@ ishments .
we have these technologies . we use them .
but you can do it through playing with material objects .
and the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
so it would seem sensible to guess the lowest number possible .
economic game the@@ ori@@ sts have a way of modeling this inter@@ play between ration@@ ality and practic@@ ality called k @@@ -@@ @ level reasoning .
in each case , participants must weigh their own understanding of the best course of action against how well they think other participants understand the situation .
instead , I 'm going to begin with me in graduate school in New Jersey in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , earnestly studying US history , which is what I currently teach as a professor at Van@@ der@@ bil@@ t University in N@@ ash@@ ville , Tennessee .
but I realize now , they were also kind of a problem .
they work hard .
now , these are , of course , arguments that we hear every day .
immigrants and their advocates use them as they confront those who would deny immigrants their rights or even exclude them from society .
how can we use immigrants ?
the n@@ ati@@ vis@@ t answer to this question is no , immigrants have little or nothing to offer .
here , again , the n@@ ati@@ vis@@ t answer is no , immigrants are permanently different from us and inferior to us .
but the distinction itself is at the heart of the way nations define themselves .
it 's reinforced in everyday ways that we talk and act and behave , down to the bor@@ dered maps that we hang up in our school@@ rooms .
the problem with this world@@ view is that it just do@@ es@@ n 't correspond to the way the world actually works , and the way it has worked in the past .
but so have immigrants .
second , we need to ask questions about responsibility .
global inequality is a w@@ ren@@ ching , intensifying problem .
when immigrants send money or goods home to their family , it plays a significant role in narrowing these gaps , if a very incomplete one .
thank you .
( appl@@ ause ) B@@ hak@@ ti Shar@@ ma : imagine , in the scor@@ ching Raj@@ as@@ than heat , on a hot summer afternoon , a two @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old riding on a mop@@ ed behind her mom , not knowing where they were headed .
and so I have given over 25 years of my life to this sport , during which I have sw@@ um in all five oceans of the world , crossed the English Channel -- which is also known as the Mount E@@ ve@@ rest of swimming -- and set a world record in the freezing Antarctic ocean .
when you win a medal or set a world record , this mirror shows the happiness that you and your loved ones feel , but also reflects the tears that you shed all by yourself , alone in the water .
every stroke felt like pulling through oil .
but with that thought , also came a stronger , a more will@@ ful voice from deep within .
" now one more . "
so I took a second and a third stroke .
SR@@ K : but what is your next goal as a sw@@ im@@ mer ?
even the most common type , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ritis , is tr@@ ick@@ ier to prevent than one might think .
it 's a general mis@@ conception that ar@@ th@@ ritis is confined to old age .
this leads to the flood of enzy@@ mes and degradation seen in o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ ritis , but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cy@@ tok@@ ines .
to a technique called micro@@ frac@@ ture , where surge@@ ons create small holes in the bone , allowing bone mar@@ row stem cells to leak out and form new car@@ til@@ age .
but even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition , not the cause .
and the mission and the magic begin .
a typical day in space starts with the perfect comm@@ ute .
so we take our urine , we store it , we filter it and then we drink it .
and it 's actually delicious .
the stark contrast between the poverty and desper@@ ation on one side of the border and the conspic@@ uous wealth on the other always feels j@@ ar@@ ring .
I had a signed authorization to act as Anna 's attorney , so I rush@@ ed over to the port of entry to see if I could speak with my client .
seeing these hor@@ rors day in and day out has changed me .
more than 900 children have been taken from their parents since June of 2018 .
but even those who would be refugees under the international definition are not going to win asylum in the United States .
these refugees , many of whom are families , are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world , where they 're being raped , kidnapped and extor@@ ted by criminal groups .
but those of us in a position to advocate for those changes are too busy su@@ ing our government to keep the me@@ ager legal protections that refugees enjoy under the current law .
we need to call our elected representatives and demand these changes .
and it is our belief that if you want to find disrup@@ tive growth in the market , you have to go to the consumer and take a very ag@@ nos@@ tic view of the consumer .
gender is easy . it 's easy to design advertising based on gender , it 's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender .
this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
this was eight years ago , some people were more Republican back then .
there is a big difference .
and likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , " W@@ ould you not vote for a qualified black president ? "
it 's about who you live with .
especially if we have c@@ ites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethn@@ icities and different income groups .
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
literally there are people who might be in school in Ark@@ ansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country , or of another racial group .
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
but the point is , this is all good news , because when something is predictable , it is what I call design@@ able .
and I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis .

the 30 @@@ -@@ @ foot bil@@ l@@ board is made of three large color neg@@ atives with the message " Water Is Life , " spelled out in Ne@@ stle water bottles by The Si@@ ster Tour .
I also continued to keep it in the public eye by producing coun@@ t@@ down flags that were raised on institutions across the country .
Moses , an officer , R@@ anger , veteran , was very clear about his water rescue mission : bring relief of free , clean water to the people in F@@ lin@@ t .
it mechanically creates conden@@ sation , which produces 2,000 gall@@ ons of water per day .
I 've been at the machine , inter@@ viewing people , asking them , " What does it mean to see Moses and his machine in [ your ] community ? "
and , " What has it been like living without access to clean water ? "
no matter how dark a situation may be , a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive .
it can be something that they love , something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity .
as teachers , we work every day to provide support socially , emo@@ tionally and academ@@ ically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances .
like most teachers , I have students who go home every day , and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy , well @@@ -@@ @ rounded meal for them .
they come to school with trauma , and when I go home every day , that goes home with me .
I think back to my under@@ graduate training at the University of Georgia , where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed .
I had a student who I 'll call " David . "
and it was on the last day of school , I told David to have a great summer .
so I changed almost everything about my teaching .
he started acting out in school because all he wanted was for his family to be together again .
and I needed someone to listen , somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend .
but when it comes to teaching professionals , that urgency is lagging .
they call it " secondary trauma " and " compassion fatigue , " the concept that we absorb the traum@@ as our students share with us each day .
and after a while , our souls become weighed down by the heav@@ iness of it all .
they found that approximately one in 10 reported clin@@ ically significant de@@ pressive symptoms .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
these schools are making space for conversations that matter .
the chain that han@@ gs in my classroom is more than just a decoration .
they remember what they wrote on it .
and they have hope .
somebody to reach out and make sure that we 're OK .
every now and then , we all just need a little help holding the sta@@ pl@@ er .
thank you .
it was a fantastic new pink suit with big buttons and shoulder p@@ ads .
embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ingly enough , I finished up with " If not this , what ?
if not us , who ?
and if not now , when ? "
the problem was that no one knew what they were expected to do .
and most importantly , they did@@ n 't know that I needed them .
now , B Corps are a group of companies who believe in business as a force for good .
and the leaders in this space are doing a few things very differently from traditional heroic leaders .
interdependent leaders , on the other hand , start with a goal that 's really important , but is actually impossible to achieve by one company or one person alone .
they don 't see that their responsibility ends when a customer bu@@ ys their clothes .
until 2014 , there was no protection for these workers .
once you 've seen problems like this , you can 't un@@ see them , so you have to ask others to help you to solve them .
the second big difference for collaborators is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan .
I remember the day really clearly .
heroes like making speeches .
people lean back in their chairs , maybe impressed but not engaged .
they know that meetings are not just min@@ dless calendar f@@ ill@@ ers .
it 's where people collaborate and communicate and share ideas .
so we changed the way we ran our innovation and planning meetings in two important ways .
and I was the foreigner , and I was the b@@ oss and I apparently had that intim@@ idating hero look .
and it 's not compelling and it 's not even interesting .
so , we changed it and we created these full @@@ -@@ @ day market@@ places , kind of like a big ba@@ z@@ aar .
so I 'm immediately in interdependence land .
my dream is that one day , someone will stand on this stage and tell you how radical interdependence saved my beloved r@@ hin@@ os .
it requires us to be open and transparent and vulnerable , and that 's not what traditional leaders have been trained to do .
I thought that in the elev@@ ation and separation that comes from heroic leadership , that I would be un@@ tou@@ cha@@ ble .
this is an illusion .
and if we 're going to solve the challenges that the world is facing today , we have no alternative , so we had better start getting good at it .
thank you .
fifteen years ago , I completely changed both what I worked with and how I worked after a re@@ vel@@ atory collaboration with a bi@@ ologist .
our project gave me a different perspective on life , introducing a whole new world of possibility around how we can design and make things .
literally , fab@@ ric@@ ating with biology .
my own journey in bi@@ of@@ ab@@ rication started with a project called " Bi@@ oc@@ ou@@ ture . "
using a certain species of bacteria in a nutrient @@@ -@@ @ rich liquid , we fer@@ mented threads of cell@@ ul@@ ose that self @@@ -@@ @ organized into a sheet of fabric .
I dried the fabric I had grown and cut and se@@ wed it into a range of garments , shoes and bags .
in fact , there 's a growing global community of inno@@ v@@ ators re@@ thinking materials with biology .
they have higher mel@@ t temperatures than plastics .
the bacteria produce cry@@ st@@ als that form around each grain of sand , locking together all the loose particles to form a solid brick .
we 're just beginning to realize the potential of nature @@@ -@@ @ based technologies .
in the last century , we expected material innovation to come from the likes of Du@@ Pon@@ t , D@@ ow , BAS@@ F .
now , my wife and I agree on a lot of things , but using U@@ ber was definitely not one of them .
if , in any market , you dramatically increase supply , you should expect prices , profitability and growth to go down for existing players .
where online market@@ places , like Go@@ je@@ k in Indonesia or J@@ um@@ ia in Africa , have helped their business ecosystems and the communities around them .
online market@@ places will continue to grow .
as a strategy consultant , I study businesses for a living .
for drivers and passengers , you get U@@ ber , Gra@@ b in Southeast Asia or D@@ idi in China .
for example , if you 're a taxi driver in San Francisco and you decide to work 10 hours per day , then you 're actually having a paying passenger in your car for four hours out of the 10 .
this is the same car becoming 40 percent more productive .
by design , they create more value for the economy .
you can give it to the drivers -- more passengers , more income .
the negative extern@@ ality of U@@ ber cars becoming more productive is taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop by as much as 30 percent in New York , for example .
then , maybe , a motor@@ bike or a traditional taxi that you can order and pay for from within the same app .
and one of the reasons for that is because they have decided to actively invest in African entrepreneurs , to grow them into the digital age .
he wanted to be independent .
some common ideas include Cap@@ tain Ho@@ ok , Harry Pot@@ ter and many well @@@ -@@ @ known characters in Chinese literature .
we are realizing that this is true .
there is so much information ; what do you do ?
how do you decide what is important ?
so what we built of course , U@@ sha@@ h@@ idi , is crow@@ d@@ sourcing this information .
this is the kind of innovation that is , quite frankly -- it 's interesting that it 's coming from Africa .
higher than the likes of Singapore , countries in North America and even countries in Europe .
milk in India is produced by marginal milk farmers , with two or three cows or bu@@ ff@@ alo@@ s , who produce five to ten lit@@ ers of milk a day .
Ra@@ j and I built a simple data intelligence platform that allowed us to map all the recycl@@ ers , giving us a bird 's eye view of every recycl@@ er in Hy@@ der@@ abad .
today , B@@ anyan 's recycled gran@@ ules have undergone stringent quality testing and have been certified by top global FM@@ C@@ G and automotive companies .
when I was young , I used to -- ( s@@ ings in Hind@@ i ) .
so tell me , are you making a lot of money ?
and we 're very fortunate to have signed a really big , multi@@ million @@@ -@@ @ dollar contract with some of the top FM@@ C@@ G companies .
and just to give you some context , 27 percent of women work in India .
if you look at most of Asia , that number is around 48 percent .
so we her@@ al@@ ded a group of mothers @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law and a few mothers into the office , and we took them to our R and D lab@@ s .
do you remember wan@@ dering as a child through those dark wooden sto@@ refront galleries ?
so this leads me to my third question : " what do your elected officials know about nuclear weapons , and what types of decisions are they likely to take on your behalf ? "
ask them , " How would you choose to spend US national treasure ?
on a new nuclear arms race or another national security priority , such as cyber@@ security or climate change ? "
after all , this is " national security . "
and the answer can 't be " Because they 're super rich and they live in your zi@@ p code . "
are those your kids ? they 're so cu@@ te .
Oh , that 's a great school , are you guys very involved there ?
Oh , at Santa Clar@@ a , that 's awesome .
I know this sounds a ta@@ d mercenary .
right ?
you don 't get extra points for knowing how to use Google .
I 'm looking for , like , a thum@@ bs up , thum@@ bs down .
what is the need ? "
once you 've made the ask -- " W@@ ould you consider supporting us at the 10,000 @@@ -@@ @ dollar level ?
let 's explore what these new medicines are made of , how they 're different and what 's causing this incoming ti@@ dal wave of new and exciting medicines .
breast milk is kind of mirac@@ ulous : in addition to containing nutrients for the baby , it seems to contain food for the good micro@@ bes as well .
in the spring , I 'd smell the head@@ y fra@@ gr@@ ance of l@@ il@@ acs .
an enzy@@ me is a protein that 's a catalyst , it speeds up or acceler@@ ates a chemical reaction , just as the ch@@ y@@ mos@@ in over here is accelerating the cur@@ dling of the milk .
those improved ones become our version 1.@@ 0@@ s.
for example , J@@ anu@@ via , which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes , is made partially with enzy@@ mes .
so now I 'm going to get back to the demo -- this is the fun part .
now , we were surprised when we won the New South Wales Entreprene@@ ur of the Year in the young category for entrepreneurs under 40 .
at 65 , he had been running his business for 40 years .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , this was a pretty big light bulb moment for me for two reasons .
and two , I realized it do@@ es@@ n 't go away with any form of success .
in the early days , I was flying back and forth to San Francisco every week for At@@ l@@ assi@@ an , and I rac@@ ked up a lot of frequent fl@@ yer points and got access to the Q@@ ant@@ as business lounge .
and if they don 't freeze , and they 're thank@@ ful , and they work harder and they stretch to be the best partner they can , it 's likely to be a very successful relationship .
so if you have this feeling , don 't freeze .
and in doing so , I managed to kick a very small rock off a very big hill that turned into an av@@ al@@ anch@@ e that I found myself tum@@ bling in the middle of .
they know when the water is way too deep , and they 're not afraid to ask for advice .
but the problem persists .
and I think , as you 'll see , there 's reasons for optimism , because I believe that the best is yet to come .
and by that I mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people .
well let 's take a look . let 's take a look at the Great De@@ pression .
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies .
and so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited , as a consequence , in their language abilities at an older age .
this lifelong capacity for plas@@ ticity , for brain change , is power@@ fully expressed .
it is the basis of our real differentiation , one individual from another .
it 's a very simple experiment where a mon@@ key has been trained in a task that involves it manip@@ ulating a tool that 's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spo@@ on .
and 700 or so tries later the mon@@ key is performing it f@@ law@@ lessly -- never fails .
we can look down in the brain of the mon@@ key .
in other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps in this most organized of cor@@ tical areas of the surface of the skin of the body .
the mon@@ key is getting more detailed information from these surfaces .
now actually we 've looked in several different cor@@ tical areas in the mon@@ key learning this task .
this is constructed by physical change .
think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general .
what it 's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain .
it 's what you pay attention to .
it 's what 's rewarding to you .
it 's what the brain regards , itself , as positive and important to you .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we 're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .
most of them would be intellectual and academic failures .
the child 's native language is such a case is not English .
such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain .
of course they will . because as a receiver of language , they are receiving it and representing it , and in information it 's representing cra@@ p .
and learning mod@@ ulation and control is deteriorating .
this results in declines in memory in cogn@@ ition , and in post@@ ural ability and ag@@ ility .
it means that most people who are at risk for sen@@ ility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position .
I 'm specifically interested in things like au@@ tism , and cere@@ br@@ al pal@@ sy , these great childhood catastro@@ ph@@ es .
and of course , a well @@@ -@@ @ ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key .
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here , I thought to myself that well , it 's TED .
and then I thought no , no . I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because , after all , this is the great unve@@ iling .
Oh my ! there 's so many of you .
( la@@ ughter ) She has me here because she puts me in her show , what she calls her one @@@ -@@ @ woman show .
frankly , I 'm k@@ vel@@ ling just to be here with all the lumin@@ aries you have attending something like this , you know .
really , it 's amazing .
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful gi@@ ants of the industries but the celebrities .
and she was getting a y@@ og@@ urt in the Google cafe .
I noticed it 's very multicultural .
well , I don 't know how else to say it to you , so I 'll just say it my way : the gan@@ ey@@ vis@@ h sch@@ tic@@ kl@@ ich coming from the governments and the , you know , the bankers and the Wall Street . you know it .
congratulations . Maz@@ el tov .
thank you everybody .
I am Dominican @@@ -@@ @ American .
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath .
but then on top of that , you know , Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes .
so then I 'm like , should I be nervous , you know , because maybe it 's better .
and I 'm just trying not to panic and f@@ rea@@ k out . so I like , take a deep breath .
and , like , people would not believe , seriously , where I 'm from , that this even exists .
I like that .
and actually , I can relate to the whole like acrony@@ m thing and everything .
at my school -- actually I was part of co @@@ -@@ @ founding an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
so , basically like DA BO@@ MB -- what Dominican @@@ -@@ @ American Ben@@ evol@@ ent Organization for Mo@@ thers and Bab@@ ies does is , basically , we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me .
I mean , I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different , whatever .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because I 'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that 's my new title .
so , I 'm very happy that you 're , you know , doing this kind of thing , making the talks available online .
for example , a friend of mine .
but then , I decided , just like Governor Ar@@ n@@ old Sch@@ war@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger , I try anyway .
but my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly .
so , I accused my daughter to have like a secret boy@@ friend .
she said , " No M@@ om . I mean , I don 't like boys . I like girls .
so , I always teach my kids to respect American ideas , but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- that she is not gay , she is just confused by this American problem .
I am originally from Jordan .
but I feel a bit like a fish out of water .
so you will get the extra credit I promised you .
sometimes it was a little too fast , sometimes a little too slow .
Bou@@ v@@ ard knew that his predictions were perfect .
the ill effects are suffered by all , rich and poor , city people and village fol@@ ks , those inland and those on the coast .
in 2017 , more than 1.2 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution .
but we 're now up to 55 countries in the world , have had this virus emerge , in either birds , or people or both .
al@@ right , so I 've got you nervous .
so there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher .
but we 're not there . and there h@@ as@@ n 't been the kind of investment to get us there .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than I 'd anticipated .
[ green is the new black ... ] ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) I like that , too .
( la@@ ughter ) There started our 70 percent .
result ?
so I started asking a very simple question : what does it mean to you to be a good woman or a good man today ?
I 'm going to talk only about the middle and upper classes , because we are the ones most in denial .
for example , I do tell my daughter sometimes , " Ya@@ ar T@@ u ha@@ sti hai to mu@@ j@@ he ac@@ cha lag@@ ta hai var@@ na Bur@@ a lag@@ ta hai . "
its job is to recre@@ ate the conditions that were present less than a bil@@ lion@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
this is the machine below Geneva .
it 's moved up again . the groups are more fragmented .
and how people act and react to speed varies by culture and among different people within the same culture .
sometimes , we 'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster .
so as we zoom into the future , let 's consider setting the technologies of speed , the purpose of speed and our expectations of speed to a more human pace .
those very same lights we see all the way from space are sh@@ ining up into the atmosphere , where they b@@ ounce around and create this feat@@ u@@ reless smo@@ g of light .
al@@ right , I want to be clear that there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of this modern technology .
and when these concepts under@@ lie our teaching and what we think about the world , then we have a problem , because we sty@@ mi@@ e support for everything .
the arts and sciences are av@@ at@@ ars of human creativity .
infrastructure , museums , theat@@ ers , movie houses across the country are dis@@ appearing .
we have more television stations with less to watch , we have more money spent on re@@ writes to get old television programs in the movies .
so we have to really stop and think : what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts ?
I just want to tell you quickly what I 'm doing -- ( Appl@@ ause ) I want to tell you what I 've been doing a little bit since ...
my mother always told me , you have to be observ@@ ant , know what 's going on in your mind and your body .
and as a dan@@ cer , I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body , just as I knew how to sense colors .
that 's the work I 've been doing now , as a company called Bio@@ S@@ enti@@ ent Corporation .
the arts and sciences are not separate .
but nothing 's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action .
as you can see the little te@@ ther , that it 's also magne@@ tically le@@ vit@@ ated .
so as you turn around you 're seeing different colors .
and so I placed one more element of each one of them .
it was the idea of isol@@ ating the t@@ acti@@ le component of sculpture , and then putting it into a communication system .
it has Buc@@ k@@ min@@ ster Ful@@ ler 's Dy@@ max@@ ion Map edited here .
and then , this is like projects that are harder to build .
in the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests .
so if we could roll the next film here .
so it could land in a park , for example .
and then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
( la@@ ughter ) Video : actor : clean coal -- you 've heard a lot about it .

for the first time , I identified as somebody living with depression , and I felt good about it -- like I was@@ n 't a bad person for it .
bring some hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er .
I have told people , " He@@ y , call or text any time , but I might not be able to get back to you that same day . "
give us a sense of control .
can I call you every day ?
what works for you ? "
so that 's a lot of dos and don '@@ ts and may@@ bes , and it 's not by any means a definitive list .
and these at@@ oms are extremely durable .
and that 's an incredibly bad day for a star .
that means that as astro@@ physi@@ ci@@ sts , we have to rely on sophisticated computer simul@@ ations in order to understand these complex phenomena .
so thank you , neutr@@ inos .
this implies that somewhere in the universe , there 's a super@@ no@@ va explosion every second or so .
the image that you see there was assembled by the Hu@@ b@@ ble Space Tel@@ es@@ cope over a span of three months .

and as they started t@@ wee@@ ting , they immediately sent the stock market crashing , wi@@ ping out 140 billion dollars in equity value in a single day .
so we checked each one of these in turn .
so to understand people 's perceptions of false news , we looked at the information and the sentiment contained in the replies to true and false t@@ wee@@ ts .
think about it this way : when you go to the gro@@ cery store to buy food to consume , it 's extensively lab@@ eled .
we have none of that information when we are consuming information .
that is a potential avenue , but it comes with its challenges .
is it Facebook ?
for instance , Malaysia just instituted a six @@@ -@@ @ year prison sentence for anyone found spreading mis@@ information .
and that 's potentially incredibly dangerous .
we have to be vigilant in defending the truth against mis@@ information .
and all the complicated paper @@@ -@@ @ based formal procedures are supposed to solve that problem .
this distributed approach also avo@@ ids the problem of the single point of failure .
and this is the real picture of all the connections between public and private sector databases .
but this event put cyber@@ security at the very top of agenda , both in terms of strengthening the platform and backing it up .
and the data into the hands of the rightful owner , the person they refer to .
( la@@ ughter ) So , I decided to inspect the problem from a different angle .
so , consulting with an engineer , I designed a slide system that would ho@@ ok into my left ho@@ ok , and I devised another pick @@@ -@@ @ holder system that would cli@@ p into my right ho@@ ok .
( la@@ ughter ) Not I.
( la@@ ughter ) Now , when we started that club night , I could not D@@ J .
and , at the very least , you can sc@@ are the hell out of kids if you look like a pir@@ ate .
value creation .
we 've stopped actually asking really tough questions about what is the difference between value creation and value extraction , productive and un@@ productive activities .
now , what was interesting 300 years ago is the society was still an agricultural type of society .
and they produced what I think was probably the world 's first spre@@ ad@@ sheet , called the " T@@ abl@@ eau Econom@@ ique , " and this was done by FranÃ§@@ ois Qu@@ es@@ n@@ ay , one of the leaders of this movement .
the farmers , creating value , were called the " productive class . "
femin@@ ist economists and environmental economists have actually written about this quite a bit .
well , mechan@@ ization has for centuries , actually , taken jobs , but as long as profits were being rein@@ vested back into production , then it did@@ n 't matter : new jobs appeared .
and I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form .
as I will show to you , it is actually the main@@ stay of modern life .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre @@@ -@@ @ packaged , which I 'm told is called a Won@@ der@@ bread .
it 's about a traditional way of living .
now you may prefer this lo@@ af of bread .
and this is where I have to query all of you .
let 's go back to traditional farming .
let 's go back to small @@@ -@@ @ scale , to farmers ' markets , small bak@@ eries and all that . " wonderful .
and we do not want to re@@ leg@@ ate the urban poor to starvation .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
can we find a solution to produce more ?
we will not do that through small farmers ' markets because these people have no small farmers ' markets at their disposal .
and let me just do one simple conceptual thing : if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale .
we 've moved towards large @@@ -@@ @ scale and very high control .
we need more science and not less . and we need good science .
we have much cle@@ ve@@ rer irrigation .
you must go back and think about your own food chain .
and above all , to me , food is about respect .
and the kind of simpl@@ istic solutions that we sometimes have , to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution , is really not morally justified .
never before , as I said , has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few .
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
and that , I think , ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily @@@ -@@ @ speaking is unique .
eat it , and feel privileged .
unfortunately I cou@@ ld@@ n 't go .
sometimes they get in trouble , but not often .
and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything .
Nathan left and went to Tom@@ p@@ kins County , New York -- a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States . and he did it again .
and I think about the idea that creating an idea , spreading an idea has a lot behind it .
we started with the factory idea : that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could ch@@ ur@@ n out change .
we then went to the TV idea , that said if you had a big enough mou@@ th@@ piece , if you could get on TV enough times , if you could buy enough ads , you could win .
well with that sort of advantage you can ch@@ ur@@ n out a lot of cars .
that people on the fr@@ ing@@ es can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
they 've got their own flag . they 've got the eye patches .
and he did@@ n 't do it by buying a lot of ads .
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
they merely decided to lead them .
that here@@ tics look at the status quo and say , " This will not stand . I can 't abide this status quo .
you get to tell the story on B@@ lake 's behalf , on behalf of the people who got the shoes .
so I started my life as an architect , or training as an architect , and I was always interested in socially responsible design , and how you can really make an impact .
and I did@@ n 't know what I was doing -- like I said , mid @@@ -@@ @ 20@@ s -- and I 'm the Internet generation , so we started a website .
this was@@ n 't imposing an architecture on a community ; this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and reg@@ row the way they want to .
it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa .

fortunately , we now live in a time when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem .
in addition , academic research has shown that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention .
here , they 're supporting that with qualitative statements .
when we began developing , we started off by asking students what they liked , what they did@@ n 't like and what they found confusing .
eventually we began asking what they wished they could do .
how could we support students in exploring all of their desires with these eye @@@ -@@ @ opening experiences and chances to learn from primary sources ?
extended reality has the potential to change the trajectory of our children 's lives and lead them to careers they never imagined by giving them the chance to see what they can be .
look around . what do you notice ?
and I did@@ n 't know in the beginning if it was going to work or not , but it 's made me very happy to see what 's happening .
J@@ F : well , I realize that not everybody can leave work and go and do what I 'm doing .
my grand@@ kids just got arrested last weekend .
PM : and as you have done so many times in the past , J@@ ane , you are leading these changes .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) PM : and you are in a city that is probably more divided than it has been in a very long time .
J@@ F : ye@@ ah , I am optimistic .
what is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend .
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society , but you are not able to implement those things .
but today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
and that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see .
the final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you did@@ n 't think of India as a market , you did@@ n 't really b@@ other about a single market , because it did@@ n 't really matter .
the other thing that you can do is you can do this -- electro@@ ence@@ ph@@ alo@@ graphy -- you can put these electro@@ des on your head , OK ?
and then you could also ask them about what they were experiencing .
right there .
fossil fuels will one day give way to renewable energy .
it 's actually connected to a suite of automated hardware and software that read in real time and feed back to a design team the growth conditions of the micro@@ be .
so you can start to see how imagin@@ ative and inspiring modes of making exist in nature that we can use to build capacity around new bio @@@ -@@ @ based industries .
what we now have is the technology to design , build , test and scale these capabilities .
and cru@@ cially , how we would like the regulatory and ethical frameworks that govern these technologies to interact with our society .
it is a better business model .
we have to start to think about how do we connect to water .
and I came up with an idea that I would write a cook@@ book .

the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don 't know our preferences that well .

in Denmark , the Danish National Committee for Pi@@ g Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a so@@ w while you arti@@ ficially in@@ semin@@ ate her , you will see a six @@@ -@@ @ percent increase in the far@@ rowing rate , which is the number of pig@@ lets produced .

so I was 18 ; I was very excited .
and I saw the power of the image , and it was incredible .
maybe I will never be able to do it , but I have plans for my children .
and then what hit me was , the night before , there had been some kind of bombing in Basra , and Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era had shown images of the people .
and when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world , we had such incredible reactions .
and I saw this with audiences .
I know where you guys are coming from .
I love to dance .
in the United States there are less than 200 people diagnosed .
the fact that someone who was@@ n 't me was putting limitations on my dreams and ambitions was pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous .

however , it would be another five years until I officially declared my diagnosis to my employer .
and with that fat@@ eful decision began a four @@@ -@@ @ year commitment , tos@@ sing back and forth between fear and courage to undertake a 12 @@@ -@@ @ day expedition .

now , in the New Zealand national accounts -- that 's what the figures are called , that 's where we get the GDP -- in the New Zealand national accounts , the milk of bu@@ ff@@ alo , go@@ ats , sheep and cows is of value but not human breast milk .
all of those activities are on the wrong side of the production boundary .
nothing was ever lost from the national accounting framework because of the loss of lives , the loss of land , the loss of buildings , the loss of special spaces .
to leave our natural environment alone , to sustain it , to protect it , is apparently worth nothing .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) " Rel@@ ying on per capita GDP , relying on these growth figures , " they said , " do@@ es@@ n 't appear to be the best way to proceed to make public policy . "
you see , to measure GDP , you have to assume that some kind of production or service delivery or consumption occurs inside a nation @@@ -@@ @ state , and you know where that is .
we don 't behave in a way that assists GDP .

ok@@ ay , there it goes .
but watch its front legs . can you see what they are doing ?
( la@@ ughter ) So then we wondered , " Can they actually maneu@@ ver with this ? "
so should we force our choices on them , or should we broaden their choices ?
it 's home to 300,000 people living over 650 acres of land .
and that was great .
and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
now we had stuff inside Bi@@ osphere to keep ourselves clean , but nothing with per@@ fume .
I was there because I was actually modeling the man@@ gro@@ ve portion for a carbon credit program , under the U.@@ N.
and those beautiful wis@@ py clouds are , in fact , fires , human @@@ -@@ @ made fires .
and they like to keep everything beautifully ra@@ ked . and they keep all the leaves away .
girls c@@ rying at a J@@ ustin B@@ ie@@ ber concert ?
I , too , had suspected that they were a bit crazy .
( la@@ ughter ) Than@@ ks .
because , according to my research , they are capable of building a shr@@ ine to Harry Sty@@ les 's vom@@ it on the side of a free@@ way within two hours .
it is a hopeful sound .
you ready ? take a deep breath with me .
it 's easy to feel totally overwhel@@ med .
we talked about how we were feeling about the world , openly and honestly , and no one told me at any point to be more positive or more hopeful .
and this is the second concept , which is something called a double bind .
it 's a very intolerable human experience .
and we will do anything we can to get rid of it and just push it away .
and we become cheer@@ leaders for solutions .
but inadver@@ tently , this can back@@ fire and lead to more num@@ bing and inaction , which is very per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ing for a lot of people .
and so , this is because of this , you know , it 's not really touching what 's going on under@@ ne@@ ath .
so imagine that you go see a therap@@ ist , and you 've got a double bind .
what 's it going to take ? "
or you see a therap@@ ist and you 're feeling actually sad and grief .
here 's some simple things you can do .
this is a hard moment to be a human being , we 're wa@@ king up .
but here we are , and we 're all needed .
I 'm sca@@ red , but this is happening . "
so here 's the thing , all of this work exists , we have the tools to create these conditions that can allow us to show up as our brilliant selves .
we need each other .
let 's do this together .
the world is ready for us to do this .
I 'll start here . last November there was a presidential election .
and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression .
what matters here is@@ n 't technical capital , it 's social capital .
these tools don 't get socially interesting until they get technologically b@@ oring .
then , a couple of hundred years ago , there was innovation in two @@@ -@@ @ way communication , convers@@ ational media : first the tele@@ graph , then the telephone .
slow , text @@@ -@@ @ based conversations , then real @@@ -@@ @ time voice based conversations .
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to .
and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
if you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
and within half a day donation sites were up , and donations were p@@ ouring in from all around the world .
and so the protest kept going .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by am@@ ate@@ urs .
now these changes don 't just affect people who want to cen@@ sor messages .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous and cheap .
I understand where you are coming from .
through the cap@@ ill@@ aries , they reach larger blood vessels and exit the bone .
a bone mar@@ row trans@@ plant can also lead to something called gra@@ ft @@@ -@@ @ versus @@@ -@@ @ tumor activity , when new immune cells generated by the donated mar@@ row can wipe out cancer cells the recipient 's original immune system cou@@ ld@@ n 't .
patients may take immun@@ o@@ sup@@ pres@@ sant medications or certain immune cells may be removed from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk of gra@@ ft @@@ -@@ @ versus @@@ -@@ @ host disease .
so it 's crucial to find the best match possible in the first place .
thirteen point eight billion years ago , the universe as we know it began with a big ban@@ g , and everything that we know and are and are made of was created .
the hand of God shows up over and over and over again .
it connected an audience in an unprecedented way .
now we 're not talking about video games or computer @@@ -@@ @ generated actors , which look tremend@@ ously realistic .
somebody reads very fast .
we declared small@@ po@@ x eradicated in 1980 .
this is confl@@ u@@ ent small@@ po@@ x , in which there is@@ n 't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by le@@ sions .
and hem@@ or@@ rh@@ agic small@@ po@@ x , the most cruel of all , which had a pre@@ dil@@ ec@@ tion for pregnant women .
you could vacc@@ inate everybody in India , but one year later there 'd be 21 million new babies , which was then the population of Canada .
we made over one billion house calls .
but small@@ po@@ x was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication .
so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu , we find it and immediately contain it .
when he started G@@ PH@@ IN -- In 1997 , there was an outbreak of bird flu -- H@@ 5@@ N1 .
then a number of years went by , and there were a lot of rum@@ ors about bird flu .
so they started sending in their reports early .
I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can .
that may have saved the writers , but it did@@ n 't really save the surge@@ ons terri@@ bly much .
the question had to be asked , " Well , can we do these same surg@@ eries but through little inci@@ sions ? "
the learning curve was very long .
surge@@ ons had to give up their 3D vision .
you 've got these long instruments , and you 're working off your c@@ enter@@ line .
and the instruments are essentially working back@@ wards .
how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon ?
and as you see it come out , in order to actually be able to do anything useful , it can 't all stay clu@@ stered up like this .
and we can take special cameras , and we can look at it .
now we know where we need to cut , even when it 's below the surface .
we have flexible micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic pro@@ bes that we can bring down into the body .
and the prospect I 'm offering you , of an easier surgery ...
I don 't want anyone to think that I 'm not smart .
that is worth applaud@@ ing or sn@@ apping your fingers about .
what are your fears ? what are your hopes ? what are your dreams ?
so if we break it down , go get a poster board .
[ 5 : it 's not what you make , it 's what you keep . ] It 's not about what you make , it 's about what you keep .
for a lot of us in that hood , there was only one person you could already turn to for food , shelter , warmth , love , discipline : our mothers .
up until then , my mother did@@ n 't even know she existed .
you see , this is co @@@ -@@ @ paren@@ ting , and in an ideal world , my mother would have had a co @@@ -@@ @ parent , too .
L@@ il@@ ah 's mother gets to go rock climbing or study for the L@@ SAT , and I get to stand in a room full of bold , dynamic and powerful women and talk about d@@ ad stuff .
" come on Adam , don 't be so w@@ ish@@ y @@@ -@@ @ wash@@ y . take a b@@ ite . " " I did . "
there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded , in many ways .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT .
they were self @@@ -@@ @ confident and determined . and the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were future @@@ -@@ @ focused rather than present @@@ -@@ @ focused .
so what is time perspective ? that 's what I 'm going to talk about today .
so I want to end by saying : many of life 's pu@@ zzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but I think the consequences are really profound .
and in January of 2018 , I read an article with some of his alleged victims .
so your G@@ mail account , your Twitter account , your In@@ st@@ agra@@ m account , your i@@ Cl@@ oud , your Apple ID , your Net@@ f@@ li@@ x , your T@@ ik@@ T@@ ok -- I had to figure out what a T@@ ik@@ T@@ ok was .
they don 't recognize it as a Tro@@ jan or as any of the other stuff that you would normally find that they would warn you about .
you can do that quite fast .
if the Security Council do@@ es@@ n 't commit to security over the course of a decade , you don 't get the reas@@ surance which produces private investment .
and that is to focus on a few critical objectives .
one is jobs .
one is improvements in basic services -- especially health , which is a disaster during conflict .
there is@@ n 't any construction going on . and so the sector shri@@ vels away .
so we need to encourage the growth of local firms .
on the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandin@@ avia in the 1950s .
is that OK ?
in fact , every time we take a breath , we are inhal@@ ing toxic pollutants , and our poor pink and lovely lun@@ gs are suffering all of that .
we CA@@ N@@ NOT stop breathing and , in addition , we need , every day , around 10,000 lit@@ ers of air .
air pollution is not just affecting our lun@@ gs .
this is the first thing we need to do to protect yourself and to protect our beautiful brain .
the first is mass collaboration , represented here by Wikipedia .
think of it as peer @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ peer philanthro@@ py .
and understand how they help us re @@@ -@@ @ perceive what organized philanthro@@ py is .
the question is , is there a positive social sing@@ ul@@ arity ?
is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
thank you very much .
young people would ask the most amazing questions .
it 's risk . it 's reward . it 's random@@ ness .
so why is that overall ?
or it 's the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , the emotional center of the brain , close to the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , the memory center of the brain .
what mat@@ tered most was that they were in men@@ op@@ ause .
and this is important information to have , because so many women can feel these changes .
but still , it 's quite an insight to associate Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's with men@@ op@@ ause .
and the common example is a hy@@ ste@@ rec@@ tomy and / or an o@@ opho@@ rec@@ tomy , which is the surgical removal of the uter@@ us and / or the ov@@ aries .
meanwhile , there are other things that we can do today to support our hormones and their effects on the brain that do not require medications but do require taking a good look at our lifestyle .
there are many di@@ ets out there , but studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet in particular is supportive of women 's health .
women on this diet have a much lower risk of cognitive decline , of depression , of heart disease , of stroke and of cancer , and they also have fewer hot fl@@ ashes .
some phy@@ to@@ e@@ stro@@ gens have been linked to a possible risk of cancer , but not the ones in this diet , which are safe .
nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
( la@@ ughter ) Dec@@ oration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incub@@ ation .
so again I am a belie@@ ver in the radical architecture .
hand versus the computer .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
and I think that is really the nature of architecture .
it 's political . there is so many parties to this project .
there is so many interests . there 's money . there 's political power .
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others , looking at America from that point of view .
because this is not all about charity .
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon .
in turbul@@ ent times , is@@ n 't it cheaper , and s@@ mar@@ ter , to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later ?
and I did@@ n 't say that . Col@@ in Po@@ well said that .
someone 's put a brick through the window .
never before have we in the west been so scrutin@@ ized .
we can 't fix every problem , but the ones we can , I want to argue , we must .
they 've done incredible stuff , un@@ beli@@ evable stuff .
actually , I come from pun@@ k rock .
but ide@@ alism allied with prag@@ m@@ atism , with rolling up your sle@@ eves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . it 's very real . it 's very strong .
and it 's very present in a crowd like you .
we 're calling it the ON@@ E Campaign .
this year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the G8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching .
you know , there 's lots out there .
video : this is the land .
Charles used to say , " The extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem . "
the " Powers of Ten " is a film they made .
video : your word is N. Carolina .
but here is what 's really great .
and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation .
no Power@@ point is used in two days .
blood types had@@ n 't been discovered by Hal@@ sted 's time , though people had been experi@@ menting with trans@@ fu@@ sions for centuries - mostly un@@ successfully .
we still use he@@ par@@ in today .
with a w@@ ing@@ span of only 180 centi@@ meters , this vul@@ ture migrated to Africa from his family nest in Portugal , using thermal up@@ drafts to stay alo@@ ft for hours at a time .

the Asian and African V@@ ulture Crisis has led to an epidemic of rab@@ ies in India , where infections kill roughly 20,000 people each year .
we replaced that with a web form , and now most veterans find out if they can get access to their health benefits in 10 minutes .
they wanted a letter on official government let@@ ter@@ head .
the government can 't pay huge salary bonuses , so we ended up making our own awards .
but you can make a difference in public service right now .

the communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liber@@ ate their people from the encro@@ aching conflict in Vietnam , and American bombing campaigns .
S@@ oph@@ al E@@ ar : so , notwithstanding the 1970s nar@@ ration , on April 17th 1975 we lived in Phnom Penh .
I 'm happy , actually , today , to present her .
what if I could stick this molec@@ ule , sla@@ p it onto a bacteria that was path@@ ogenic to me , that had just invaded my lun@@ gs ?
it 's like " mission accomplished . "
so , between coal and nuclear , compare their waste products .
that 's where you see some of the source , not from my fellow environ@@ ment@@ alists , but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power .
well the good news is that the developing world , but frankly , the whole world , is busy building , and starting to build , nuclear reactors .
I want to point out one interesting thing , which is that environ@@ ment@@ alists like the thing we call micro@@ power .
it 's supposed to be , I don 't know , local solar and wind and co@@ generation , and good things like that .
but frankly micro @@@ -@@ @ reactors which are just now coming on , might serve even better .
almost all of these are not only small , they are proliferation @@@ -@@ @ proof .
so I think micro@@ reactors is going to be important for the future .
half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia , soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads .
despite their best efforts , genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history .
I should say , it is more practical than people think .
I have a studio in Berlin -- let me cue on here -- which is down there in this snow , just last weekend .
when the circle goes away you will have another color , the complementary color .
I am saying something . and your eyes and your brain are saying something back .
since two years now , with some sti@@ pen@@ ds from the science ministry in Berlin , I 've been working on these films where we produce the film together .
obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative .
who decides what reality is ?
the idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture , and what it means to be in a space . what is the difference ?
and two sum@@ mers ago at the Hy@@ de Park in London , with the Ser@@ pen@@ tine Gallery : a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion .
it is how we touch each other .
and in your dreams , you actually unle@@ ash the potential of this inner voice .
that 's another work we are doing in our lab : trying to access this inner voice in dreams .
and you can even see this inner voice as the missing link between thought and actions .
harvest what you can , throw away what 's left .
Len@@ ie 's other half , I don 't remember much about him except that he had a thing for white sle@@ e@@ vel@@ ess shirts and gold chains around his neck .
in most cultures around the world , gender is this man @@@ -@@ @ woman dic@@ ho@@ tomy .
she had the prerogative to have a baby or not and then decide the baby 's name .
( la@@ ughter ) And while the bab@@ ay@@ lan was a female role , there were also , in fact , male practitioners in the spiritual realm .
in all , he appeared more a woman than a man . "
well , any other ju@@ ic@@ y details in the colonial archives ?
almost all are im@@ potent for the reproductive act , and thus they marry other males and sleep with them as man and wife and have car@@ nal knowledge . "
some countries like Australia , New Zealand , Pakistan , Nepal and Canada have begun introducing non@@ binary options in their legal documents , such as their passports and their permanent resident cards .
in my people 's case , this social construct is an imposition .
they can be reconstructed to respond to communities that are becoming more diverse .
their blood runs through me as they run through so many of us .
we 're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on air@@ planes or closed aud@@ it@@ ori@@ ums .
just on the data collection side , just where we are through the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os , we 're finding that almost every 200 miles , we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean .
and these vary tremend@@ ously from region to region .
so we started doing trans@@ pos@@ on mu@@ tag@@ ene@@ sis .
and we got these overlapping circles . and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms .
this organism is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous on the planet , and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there .

I know this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and , because these laws and systems , well , they broke up my family , and they led my parents to return to Mexico .
and just in case you 're won@@ dering what your answers are to those two questions , I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it .
Musa is a natural artistic guy .
Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I 've ever seen , and over the last one year , Musa 's business has grown .
but by looking inward and finding that what he had was the greatest asset and supporting him to turn it into a business , he 's not just living -- he 's thri@@ ving .
so next time class met , I apolog@@ ized , and I made an announcement .
my black students tell me that when the word is quoted or spoken in class , they feel like a giant spot@@ light is sh@@ ining on them .
and in fact this is probably why mostly men , boys , are psych@@ op@@ ath@@ ic kill@@ ers , or are very aggressive .
ok@@ ay , now this gives one a little pause .
he was raised by very supportive and interested parents .
and the observations that he made on that ep@@ ic journey were to be eventually dis@@ til@@ led into his wonderful book , " On the Orig@@ in of Spec@@ ies , " published 150 years ago .
so what did he make of all this ?
the earliest members of our line@@ age , the gen@@ us Hom@@ o , were dar@@ kly pig@@ mented .
now what happened in our history ?
so if we 're somewhere in the Northern Hem@@ is@@ phere , look at what 's happening to the ultra@@ violet radiation .
so we have , in skin pig@@ mentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
what we see un@@ locks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .
he said , " No , I want to abolish the poor . "
they said , " Let 's march . "
what is a sno@@ b ?
a mer@@ it@@ oc@@ ratic society is one in which , if you 've got talent and energy and skill , you will get to the top , nothing should hold you back .
the idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded , the good at the top , bad at the bottom , exactly done as it should be , is impossible .
in modern English that would mean it 's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to , dependent on their business card .
they 've sle@@ pt with the wrong person , taken the wrong substance , passed the wrong piece of legislation -- whatever it is , and then are fit for ridic@@ ule .
the other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety , is that we have nothing at its center that is non @@@ -@@ @ human .
as he says here , most people answer without any hes@@ itation .
and so I 've been beginning , with a variety of different projects , to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .
so I 'll just add a couple more . bl@@ ink . bl@@ ink .
and what they 're planning to do is to enligh@@ ten us on almost every aspect of Dar@@ win and his life , and how he changed our thinking .
and they seem anxious to sk@@ irt around it and step over it and to talk about something else .
I mean -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) if I 'm a good Dar@@ win@@ ist , I 've got to believe there 's a reason for that .
we 've got to go back to square one and start again . "
I think that Har@@ dy had a lot going for him .
" that crazy woman . she 's off again . she 'll say anything won 't she ? "
do you think that 's significant ?

but in this life , in this world , bu@@ tter@@ flies are in really serious trouble .
sometimes , it 's called community science , which gets at the communal purpose of citizen science , which is to do something for our comm@@ ons together .
so this person showed this to Dar@@ win and said , " This proves that evolution does not come about in a natural way .
Mil@@ k@@ weed is toxic .
you go to a native nursery in your area and find out what 's native to where you live , and you will bring beautiful things to yourself .
when we share data , we can see much bigger pictures of what 's going on .
certainly , we are connected to bu@@ tter@@ flies in deeper ways than we currently know , and the mystery of the bu@@ tter@@ fly will never be revealed if we don 't save them .
thank you .
let 's just pick one -- for example , the one in the green shirt .
and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules , the ways that rules can keep people in the dark , look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night .
in particular check out Asia .
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Den@@ g X@@ ia@@ oping could copy , when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model .
demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy .
and they 're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules .
and we can scale this model .
people can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it .
the final thing we need are choices for leaders .
let 's take a particular leader , R@@ aul Castro , who is the leader of Cuba .
allow many people to come in .
let us have a Hong Kong nearby .
others will hold back . but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country . "
well , Africa . I 've talked with leaders in Africa .
turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth .
if you move the do@@ ts down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth .
so there are many other details like this .
I 'm not a physician . I 'm not a nurse .
my specialty is looking at populations and health systems , what happens when diseases move on the large level .
that 's why it 's novel .
and they 're both called respiratory syn@@ dro@@ mes , because that 's what cor@@ on@@ a@@ viruses do -- they go for your lun@@ gs .
some cor@@ on@@ a@@ viruses , like CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 , also transmit person to person .
CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 most likely skip@@ ped from animals into people at a wild animal market in W@@ u@@ han , China .
part of that is about climate change and the way a warming climate makes the world more hosp@@ itable to viruses and bacteria .
we can get better at qu@@ aran@@ tines and travel restrictions , and we should , but they 're not our only option , and they 're not our best option for dealing with these situations .
China 's taken a lot of criticism for its response to CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 .
but , having identified it , they did@@ n 't have the resources to respond .
first , they kill the poor people when the outbreaks start , and then they kill people all over the world when the outbreaks spread .
if a hospital -- or a country -- runs out of face masks or personal protective equipment , there 's no big warehouse full of boxes that we can go to to get more .
they would have shared honest information with citizens so that we did@@ n 't see these crazy rum@@ ors spreading on social media in China .
and we 'd have real information going out to people everywhere , so we w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't see embar@@ ras@@ sing , sha@@ me@@ ful incidents of xenophobia , like Asian @@@ -@@ @ looking people getting attacked on the street in Philadelphia .
CO@@ V@@ ID @@@ -@@ @ 19 is sc@@ ary stuff , at a time when pretty much all of our news feels like sc@@ ary stuff .
[ question 3 : what are the risks that we need people to think about ? ] It 's not just whose hand you shake , it 's whose hand that person goes on to shake .
but I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people , and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point .

this time , the incenti@@ vi@@ zed group kicked the other group 's but@@ t .
because when the t@@ acks are out of the box , it 's pretty easy is@@ n 't it ?
the solution , if it exists at all , is surprising and not obvious .
in Mad@@ u@@ ra@@ i , a reward that is modest in North American standards , is more meaningful there .
here 's what they said : " we find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance . "
the good news is that the scientists who 've been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
a few times a year they tell their engineers , " Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want , as long as it 's not part of your regular job .
radical amounts of autonomy .
and at Google , as many of you know , about half of the new products in a typical year are birth@@ ed during that 20 % time : things like G@@ mail , Or@@ k@@ ut , Google News .
but were able to light that , and do it very successfully .
so , imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling .
so that when you walk in or you come in from home , if you carry a pur@@ se , it works in your pur@@ se .
and for those of you who can 't read it , it says , " It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . "
the lists go on and on .
that was actually the problem that was asked in Dav@@ os in January .
but of course , there 's a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
and I 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
the reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto -- or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it 's very inefficient .
we could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected every year .
and the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
and especially , it 's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years , because I have my oldest son now working for Google , after Google acquired this software .
so , how could we make better sense about this ?
and this is the number of people .
because it 's so different , what has happened there .
and providing data free of charge on the internet , for the world to use . thank you very much .
it 's similar to the p@@ ell@@ ag@@ ra epidemic in Mississippi in the ' 30s .
that has now disappeared , and they are now in great economic problem .
I love theater .
if An@@ to@@ ine de Saint @@@ -@@ @ Ex@@ uper@@ y , the author of " The Little Prince , " were here , he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside .
when I arrived at one of the schools , I certainly did not expect this : six hundred kids , packed in a gym@@ na@@ sium , waiting .
something happened along the way .
as a street perform@@ er , I have learned that everybody wants to connect .
and that usually , if you 're a bit extraordinary , if you 're not exactly of human appearance , then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .
it 's happening .
I 've been fasc@@ inated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now , ever since I stum@@ bled across a fairly obsc@@ ure academic article by a guy named Jack Har@@ lan .
( la@@ ughter ) I don 't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ...
because I challenge you to think of an effective , efficient , sustainable solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity .
because , quite literally , if agriculture do@@ es@@ n 't adapt to climate change , neither will we .
as Uru@@ k grew , its farmers began ch@@ op@@ ping down trees to make space for more crops .
in An@@ u@@ rad@@ ha@@ pur@@ a , however , trees were sacred .
humanity has been un@@ covering these ar@@ bo@@ real benefits for centuries .

and they 're in fifteen countries . they 're spread around the world .
the technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
I grew up in a family where my father managed all of the money .
we would sit at the kitchen table , and he 'd show me all the bank books .
and every time he would show me something about money , he would end by saying , " And don 't you tell your mother . "
someone is dependent with choice when they hand over their financial power and their participation .
and how many of us know someone that has an elderly parent or a relative that can no longer take care of themselves , and they 're left to rely on others , sometimes handing over their homes , their money and other assets .
financial literacy is having the skills and the knowledge to make informed decisions about your money .
so whatever you think , this is@@ n 't a far@@ away problem happening in China .
let 's all identify counterfe@@ iters , and don 't give them our money .
focus @@@ -@@ @ tun@@ able lenses add a bit of complexity to the equation .
using two of these , we can tri@@ ang@@ ulate your gaz@@ e direction to get a focus estimate .
our participants could see more clearly , they could focus more quickly and they thought it was an easier and better focusing experience than their current correction .
to put it simply , when it comes to vision , auto@@ foc@@ als don 't compromise like static corrections in use today do .
Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan , again , said the two fun@@ ni@@ est sentences in the English language are , " I 'm from the government . and I 'm here to help . "
and , after all this , as the great Chinese s@@ age Lao T@@ z@@ u said , " Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish .
some , I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing .
we know our societies have to radically change .

so let me explain that .
but I put my hands on the le@@ vers of control that I 'd been given and pulled them , and nothing happened .
the truth is that future generations will look back at this precise moment with a@@ we as we stand at the crossroads between a regener@@ ative future and one where we have thrown it all away .
genuine success is possible in this transition , and genuine failure is possible , too , which makes this the most exciting time to be alive .
right now , all of these things are possible .
some sem@@ e@@ sters I used all of those rest days to the fullest .
but it was around this time that I began to realize mental health was much a bigger problem than just for me personally .
this not only will start teaching kids young how to take care of themselves and practice self @@@ -@@ @ care and stress management , but it could also literally save lives .
if you were put in a situation where you had to administer CPR , would you know at least a little bit of what to do ?

thank you very much for your time .
whatever you call them , these rubber @@@ -@@ @ sol@@ ed , casual shoes are worn by billions of people around the world .
the dispersion of factories fuels another problem as well : labor abuse .
most brands don 't own or operate their factories , so the plants they work with are in countries with little to no worker protection laws .
so no matter what your style , we can all take steps towards a sustainable future .
it is built on three major pillars .
over the next five years , we will train an additional 1,000 health workers to use Sen@@ tin@@ el detection tools and empower them to train their colleagues .
so you two have been working together forever , and you really came together pretty aggres@@ sively with the Ebola crisis back in 2014 .
we are basically committed for 24 hours ' turn@@ around time in order to give results , and that requires for us to work around the clock non@@ stop .
so it 's a pretty challenging moment .
at least I have the privilege to see family today , and then I 'm sure tomorrow I 'm heading back in the tren@@ ches .
I believe that with technologies and knowledge and then sharing information , we can do better and then we can overcome .
so how are we going to do it ?
well , we 're creating a compound training library and with collaborators applying these molecules to SA@@ RS @@@ -@@ @ Co@@ V @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ infected cells to see which of them exhibit effective activity .
we tested the ability of bacteria to evolve resistance against hal@@ ic@@ in as well as Ci@@ pro in the lab .
and that 's not all .
science and technology can give us an important advantage in the battle of human wit@@ s versus the genes of super@@ bugs , a battle we can win .
there is great confusion when the two look at each other .
science tends to look at the world through the rational , the quantitative -- things that can be measured and described -- but it gives art a ter@@ rific context of understanding .
95 percent of the gl@@ aci@@ ers in the world are ret@@ re@@ ating or shrinking .
it 's been observed , it 's measured , it 's bomb @@@ -@@ @ proof information .
initially , I was working on a National Geographic assignment -- conventional , single frame , still photography .
actually , there 's still a camera out there right now .
there 's a lot of people working on this right now .
now , one bit of science before we get into the visu@@ als .
but 280 is the peak .
Earth is having a fever .
that 's the cru@@ x , and some@@ day I hope to embl@@ az@@ on that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places .
but anyway , off to the world of ice .
we 're now at the Columbia Gl@@ ac@@ ier in Alas@@ ka .
this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months .
the cal@@ ving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off , but in fact , it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet .
a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these val@@ leys as it 's ret@@ re@@ ated and defl@@ ated , gone back up valley .
on up to Iceland .
you can see it defl@@ ating .
this is a ter@@ rific , ter@@ rific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future .
and actually , this is one I made earlier .
the temperature difference on a Moon base could be anything up to 200 degrees .
and if they came across an obstacle , like a rock , they had to sort it out themselves .
to make matters worse , 16@@ 92 brought one of the col@@ dest w@@ inters on record .

the evil wizard Mol@@ de@@ V@@ ort has been trying to kill you for years , and today it looks like he 's going to succeed .
let 's start by trying 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to see what happens .
Mol@@ dev@@ ort could escape those numbers in just three moves .
how is that even possible ?
there are , in fact , points that are distance 5 from each other , which we know thanks to the Py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an The@@ ore@@ m .
but the four other smallest numbers , 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , might work .
so these four numbers work !
J@@ a : I was really young then .
and I have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice .
and the message was very clear : climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
and I remember standing under@@ ne@@ ath the hot shower and trying to de@@ frost my fingers .
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out .
at the very best , I 'm going to end up losing some fingers .

( la@@ ughter ) During m@@ ating season , female lob@@ sters want to mate with the biggest , b@@ add@@ est males , but these guys are really aggressive , and they 'll attack any lob@@ ster that approaches , male or female .
but if we don 't know that these kinds of strategies exist or how they work , we can 't know what kind of impacts we may be having , even in the deep sea .
these are animals like oy@@ sters , cl@@ ams , mus@@ sels , small fish like mac@@ ke@@ rel .
build creative clusters in cities ; create more R & amp ; D parks , so on and so forth .
I think it 's always been wrong , because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative , and it 's probably been largely interactive .
had to start -- this is the third point -- with these pro @@@ -@@ @ ams .
consumption , in that sense , is an expression of their productive potential .
and it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
the first is : imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying , " I 've got a fantastic idea .
those were the two places .
they want to be part of that flow of information .
if this is so critical , do we not need it funded , organized , supported in much more structured ways ?
what 's the role of the BBC , for instance , in that world ?
it won 't be so clear @@@ -@@ @ cut ; it won 't be Microsoft versus Linux -- there 'll be all sorts of things in between .

grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder , which is sugar .
and we can compare that to another case , where everything in the real world is the same .
some people think she should deserve more blame , and other people less .
and the first thing is , people can still do this task overall .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : so , I have a question . when you start talking about using magnetic pul@@ ses to change people 's moral judgments , that sounds alarming .
why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate ?
this is@@ n 't just a nice way to get your to @@@ -@@ @ do list done .

recently , Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work .
so just like with a bike , we don 't talk about it .

it was like his " Go@@ t@@ cha " moment , and it was my super@@ confused moment .
he got more angry at my explanations , looked me in my face , and said , " You people always lie .
( la@@ ughter ) Right ?
and then he started to get very nervous .
so not only do I believe that we 've mis@@ diagnosed the problem , I also think we have the wrong cure to it .
doing so does not mean that we necessarily dis@@ lodge education , but it means that if racism and white supremacy are a rock fortress , we assemble greater arsenal weapons to break the dam@@ n thing down .
in order to wage this big campaign against racial violence , the NA@@ ACP organized mass demonstrations in the streets .

why are they engaging with cyber@@ space ?
so what happened is that a 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old man , a Chinese man , died in prison custody .

because they brought the cost down from $ 200 a pair , down to just $ 4 a pair .
they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today ?
so they developed and iter@@ ated these ideas .
and if you 've got any ideas then feel free , you can post them to Twitter .
so I 'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest High Street products .
that is the Tor@@ ah and everything else is only commentary . "
and we need to revive that spirit .

I think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sab@@ b@@ atic@@ al .
if I look at my cycle , seven years , one year sab@@ b@@ atic@@ al , it 's 12.5 percent of my time .

this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few str@@ and of companies , and not for everybody else .
and mostly also because I realized out of a R@@ em Ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as presentation to the city of Porto , where he talked about a con@@ gl@@ om@@ eration of various layers of meaning .

you know , I had my camera , and I knew I needed to prove to myself that I would make a difference in photography .
but I thought about also that black photographers were missing from the history books of photography , and I was looking for ways to tell a story .
I grew up in a house full of photographs .
( la@@ ughter ) D@@ id you see her po@@ ke me ?

and then I found and I discovered black photographers like Au@@ gu@@ st@@ us Washington , who made these beautiful d@@ agu@@ er@@ re@@ o@@ types of the Mc@@ G@@ ill family in the early 18@@ 4@@ 0s and ' 50s .
it was the first time I had ever been on an air@@ plane and the first time that I had left my country , Rwanda .
how are we going to build all of this ?
are we going to follow a model of unsustainable building and construction similar to what I witnessed in China ?
it 's a floating prototype structure that can be adapted to clinics , to housing , to markets and other vital infrastructure this community needs .
K@@ Ã©r@@ Ã© and his team working in the communities have developed prototype schools that the whole community , similar to every project in the villages of this country , comes together to build .
and one out of 36 of these mothers dies during childbirth .
however , the approach I built here is actually high @@@ -@@ @ resolution , low @@@ -@@ @ cost , and probably most importantly , very scal@@ able .
now , you can see , I can use both of my hands to kind of squee@@ ze and put the bl@@ obs together .
you can imagine a new kind of sculp@@ ting tool , where I 'm kind of warming something up , making it m@@ alle@@ able , and then letting it cool down and sol@@ idi@@ fying in a certain state .
these hy@@ per @@@ -@@ @ spectr@@ al images are false @@@ -@@ @ colored so you can -- it 's really good for determining vege@@ tative use .
and you notice what it does .
it was released at S@@ IG@@ GRA@@ P@@ H last year .
how do you feed a city ?
so how did we get here ?
this is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . they need each other .
and in fact , that 's true of every ancient city .
and the food obviously went off very quickly .
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre @@@ -@@ @ industrial world .
and the same of course was true for fish .
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this . anyway , and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes .
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .
and this changes everything .
it 's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
now it 's anonymous .
by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they 've actually di@@ stan@@ ced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature .
and also they 've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we 've seen , are unsustainable .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
by the way , these can be men as well .
and I want us to ask now , what would Am@@ bro@@ gio Lo@@ ren@@ ze@@ tti paint if he painted this image today ?
what would an alleg@@ ory of good government look like today ?
it will be des@@ pa@@ iring hostility .
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens .
I really don 't want to just say " I 'm great , " because that kind of sounds nar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ stic , and then I won 't have any friends .
I mean , surely these were just people who pre@@ ached , " Life is great , " right ?
and we have to du@@ ke it out every day , so we resort to politics .
I don 't know anybody .
so it 's Stage Four . we 're great . who is not great ?
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
but the question on the table is this : what kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making ?
I had never been outside Nigeria .
and so we had , as was the norm , live @@@ -@@ @ in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
she asked where I had learned to speak English so well , and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language .
I 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
he felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
or about the millions of other Nig@@ er@@ ians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
the American writer Al@@ ice Wal@@ ker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North .
show of hands : how many people think it 's the gray one ?
let me show you what I mean .
there 's no inherent meaning in information .
because in the statistics of your past experience , it would have been useful to do so .
I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same .
now I want you to look at that do@@ t between the green and the red .
and what I 'm going to do is , I 'm going to hold it here , and I 'm going to spin it .
you 'll see one of the be@@ es come out here .
so , illu@@ sions are often used , especially in art , in the words of a more contemporary artist , " to demonstrate the fragility of our senses . "
well , one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound , and we enable people to hear their visual world .
and then we just simply translate that into sound .
we can also make music with color .
because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
so , if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain , I 'd like to do this one .
because now the light is going through a yel@@ low@@ ish filter and then a pur@@ pl@@ ish filter .
I 'm going to put the middle nine under a pur@@ pl@@ ish light .
do they look the same ?
here 's another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
and there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging @@@ -@@ @ out space inside .
there were definitely hang @@@ -@@ @ out spots .
and they were very passionate about their collections and their ho@@ bb@@ ies .
and I 'd like to tell you the story in three acts , and if I have time still , an ep@@ il@@ o@@ gue .
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the mead@@ ow and the forest and the cli@@ ffs make habitats for plants and animals .
so , the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan , places that are close to water , places that are near the harb@@ or to fish , places protected from the winter winds .
and we might think of these as abandoned .
where do they get their water ? where do they get their shelter ?
and you can look at what a wet mead@@ ow needs .
and that you can put these on a grid that 's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way .
they are the connections that actually make nature resilient .
and the structure of this is what makes nature work , seen with all its parts .
so then we took the Mu@@ ir web@@ s and we took them back to the maps .
and we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III .
the next day , the farmer 's son ri@@ des one of the wild horses , is thrown off and breaks his leg .
they did@@ n 't focus on all that was wrong with my k@@ id .
and sometimes our medical institutions decide what lives are not worth living .
you have heard this abl@@ e@@ ist tro@@ pe before : the boy with D@@ own syndrome who 's one of God 's special children , or the girl with the wal@@ ker and the communication device who is a precious little angel .
and there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
character robo@@ tics could plant the seed for robots that actually have em@@ pa@@ thy .
and I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim J@@ ong Il on how to get te@@ ens smoking again .
every country has a contex@@ tual alcoholic drink . in France it 's Per@@ no@@ d .
it tastes great within the borders of that country , but absolute sh@@ ite if you take it anywhere else .
the second reason is , we CA@@ N@@ NOT keep doing animal experi@@ mentation forever , and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model .
and the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder , and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical .
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders .
now , this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries .
" can the brain build such a perception ? "
they are highly reactive , and they are super @@@ -@@ @ plastic , and so the au@@ ti@@ sts are probably capable of building and learning a sym@@ phony which is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able for us .
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they positioned ?
but as you do this , what you see is that the branches inter@@ sect actually in millions of locations , and at each of these inter@@ sections they can form a syn@@ ap@@ se .
so it 's very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circu@@ itry .
I started off in Uganda .
( la@@ ughter ) How anno@@ ying would that be ?
( la@@ ughter ) " And stop speaking like that . "
it 's a process of academic inflation .
( la@@ ughter ) Ac@@ tually , do you know that old philosophical thing , " If a tree falls in a forest , and nobody hears it , did it happen ? "
she did " C@@ ats " and " P@@ han@@ tom of the Opera . "
it was@@ n 't an available condition .
and when they got out of the room , he said to her mother , " Just stand and watch her . "
and they watched for a few minutes , and he turned to her mother and said , " Mrs. Lyn@@ ne , Gil@@ li@@ an is@@ n 't sick .
our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip @@@ -@@ @ mine the earth for a particular commodity .
if all human beings disappeared from the Earth , within 50 years , all forms of life would flourish . "
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely , and that we avert some of the scenarios that we 've talked about .
with all that other stuff going on , it would be amazing if our behavior did@@ n 't change .
( jack@@ ham@@ mer ) for more than a few seconds , you 'd feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you 'd be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
just a word on music .
music is very powerful , and unfortunately , it 's ven@@ e@@ ering commercial spaces , often in@@ appropriately .
in these communities , the fishermen developed a kind of social contract that told each one of them to hold back a bit to prevent over@@ fishing .
we find the same story around the world .
this is a story of the comm@@ ons , and also how to avoid the so @@@ -@@ @ called tragedy of the comm@@ ons .
so today , we pump millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the air , we dump plastics , fertilizers and industrial waste into the rivers and oceans , and we cut down forests that absorb CO2 .
we need to recre@@ ate the social contract of the fishing villages on the global scale .
but what does it mean in practice ?
this deforestation drives extinction .
I met global food companies , financial institutions and local government officials .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households .
and you 've got to admit , over the last year and a half , consumers have been doing some we@@ ir@@ d things .
what I mean by that is we can move from min@@ dless consumption to mindful consumption .
so we see with em@@ pa@@ thy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession .
everything is focused on bet@@ ter@@ ment , training , development and moving forward .
then we look at the High Line in New York City , an excellent use of re@@ imag@@ ining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand @@@ -@@ @ new park in New York City .
in addition to this kind of high @@@ -@@ @ resolution geometry , since it 's all captured with cameras , we 've got a great texture map to use for the face .
and I go on the podium .
so that was a sort of a success .
I mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the Vienna Phil@@ harmon@@ ic Or@@ chestr@@ a .
you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body .
Ric@@ car@@ do M@@ ut@@ i , please .
but -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger .
now what does Ric@@ car@@ do M@@ ut@@ i do ? he does something like this ...
( la@@ ughter ) " Why ? because you don 't let us develop .
well , can you do it with less control , or with a different kind of control ?
it 's not true . when he was a young man of about 30 , he wrote what he called " The Ten Comm@@ and@@ ments for Conduc@@ tors . "
so it 's not about my story . it 's not about your story .
let 's see another super @@@ -@@ @ conductor , a German super @@@ -@@ @ conductor . Her@@ bert von Kar@@ a@@ jan , please .
once like a M@@ ut@@ i , and you 'll -- ( cl@@ aps ) -- cla@@ p , just once .
when he does this , it 's not , " Take your St@@ radi@@ vari@@ us and like J@@ im@@ i H@@ end@@ rix , sm@@ ash it on the floor . " it 's not that .
he says , " This is the gesture of the music .
that is another story .
when Kle@@ i@@ ber does -- did you see the eyes , going from here ? ( singing ) You know what happens ? gra@@ v@@ itation is no more .
( music ) Do you remember the face of M@@ ut@@ i , at the beginning ?
it 's suffering , like , enjoying himself in a Jewish way , as they say .
now it 's a reversed thing . you 're telling the story . and you 're telling the story .
and for the last video , I think this is simply the best title .
it was my daughter who reminded me of how much I used to feel .
I turned off my cell phone , put in the calendar , " Day at the beach with the girls . "
so I cur@@ led up next to her and I dri@@ zz@@ led sand on her other arm and then her legs .
and you can understand , obviously , the transmission problem between people in high @@@ -@@ @ virus areas .
and they are having great fun .
this is in technology . this is in the area of politics , where p@@ und@@ its , the CIA , MI@@ 6 always get it wrong .
forget about pensions . think about life and where it 's going to be going .
and of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they 've been left out in one way or another .
we know , and I know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
nothing new was learned .
the first clu@@ e to the origin of star@@ light happened as recently as 18@@ 99 : radio@@ activity .
again : do@@ ts there rather than there , on a screen .
you have your interpretation . we have ours .
consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons .
H@@ w@@ ami has fantastic takes on what it means to be an African and an African life .
it is able to move around its environment .
and I was on death row at that time .
the basic thing I got to learn was that if I thought , and if you think , you can , you will .
so , first of all , before we start , how many of you in the audience have been in the past a victim of this bug here ?
we rolled up our tro@@ users , and waited for mosqu@@ it@@ oes that were coming to b@@ ite us so we could collect them to check if they were carrying malaria .
but I do this mostly to improve people 's lives and well @@@ -@@ @ being .
it turns out we actually know very little .
and that 's part of our duty .
new ways to try and get new options that we can use together with things such as bed@@ nets to be able to get to zero .
the males go there for a dance , the females fly into that dance and select a male mosqu@@ ito of their choice , usually the best @@@ -@@ @ looking male in their view .
what does this tell us ?
and we 've put together a co@@ hor@@ t of young scientists , male and female , who are champions , who are interested in coming together to make this vision come true .
I 've cam@@ ped my whole life . and I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long cam@@ ping trip .
one : that society equ@@ ates living in a permanent structure , even a sh@@ ack , with having value as a person .
three : I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
at first , living in the van was great .
and when several of the homeless men realized that , including a former university professor , they said , " You are@@ n 't homeless . why are you really here ? "
by the summer of the following year I was a working journalist .
I was no longer homeless .
( la@@ ughter ) Well , except they 've been pre @@@ -@@ @ warned now , and they 'll know you 're making it up .
Sarah thought quite hard about the things I 'd explained -- and she concentrated , in those days , on listening .
either they 're the same , or this one 's bigger than this one , or this one 's bigger than that one .
there is . head @@@ -@@ @ tail @@@ -@@ @ head overl@@ aps itself .
on this side , there 's a different experience .
and that 's an informal way of presenting it -- that 's why there 's a difference .
it 's another way of getting the in@@ tuition .
and I will give you two little sn@@ ip@@ pets -- two examples -- of projects we 're involved in in my group in Oxford , both of which I think are rather exciting .
you know about the Human Gen@@ ome Project .
why do we care about that ?
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
and in fact , if this is the prevalence of the disease , about 100 will have the disease and the rest won 't .
and it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horri@@ bly wrong , in two different ways .
he looked at some research , which said the chance of one cot death in a family like S@@ ally Clar@@ k 's is about one in 8,@@ 500 .
when you multiply 8,@@ 500 together twice , you get about 73 million . "
and to argue , then , that the chance of a second death is as if you did@@ n 't know that information is really sil@@ ly .
that 's the first problem .
in the disease example , we had to bear in mind two things , one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not .
the other explanation is that she was guilty .
now , we probably think a pri@@ ori that 's unlikely .
it 's also true -- and , although , you , as a collective , are very special in many ways , you 're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right .
it 's very well documented that people get things wrong .
even if you believe the number , just like the 73 million to one , that 's not what it meant .
and there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that .
in the case of uncertainty , we get it wrong all the time -- and at the very least , we should be aware of that , and ideally , we might try and do something about it .
the young man 's name was E@@ vari@@ ste G@@ alo@@ is .
it was@@ n 't , in fact , revolutionary politics for which G@@ alo@@ is was famous .
and he wrote to the academ@@ icians in Paris , trying to explain his theory .
sym@@ metry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the Large Had@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der in CER@@ N .
here is Thomas Man@@ n talking about sym@@ metry in " The Magic Mountain . "
and I said to Professor K@@ uro@@ k@@ awa , " W@@ ow , the architects must have really been kic@@ king themselves when they realized that they 'd made a mistake and put this one up@@ side down . "
b , for example , rot@@ ates the little yellow do@@ t to the B on the star@@ fish . and so on .
so what if I do B , which is a sixth of a turn , followed by C , which is a third of a turn ?
well , the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with .
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six sym@@ me@@ tries .
so rotate along half@@ way along the edge , and they all match up .
so , there was a sixth of a turn . a third of a turn where the Z pieces meet .
so I think it 's a great example of things un@@ seen , which the power of mathematical language allows you to create .
18 . so it goes to this lady here .
if you look at all the world religions , all the main world religions , you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion .
therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
so , God thought , " N@@ ope , I 'm going to create the world just with compassion . "
the idea of justice , which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what 's right about life , what 's right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
you have to act comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately .
and , like Chief Seattle said , " We did not spin the web of life .
just a photograph .
the question was : " what is the greatest commandment ? "
but now , to be a Good Samar@@ itan -- and I always say , and to be a good American -- for me , is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Blood@@ worth Street must be done around tables and rit@@ uals of faith until we become that family , that family together that understands the nature of our unity .
after many years of training , of discipl@@ ining , of search and struggle , he comes back .
it is this merging of our self with di@@ vin@@ ity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions .
we know it all .
and he said , " That 's ridic@@ ulous . you can 't make a needle by rub@@ bing a lump of iron with a cloth . "
he thinks , " What can I do to fix up this dog ?
so he says , " Well , I 'll put my tongue on the dog 's flesh .
and he had to close his eyes , it 's so dis@@ g@@ usting , and the smell and everything .
and then , suddenly , there 's a p@@ ff@@ t , a noise like that .
and he said , " You did@@ n 't have , until this moment , real compassion .
and then , among them , you think of your friends and loved ones , the circle at the table .
and then you try to say , " Well , the loved ones I love .
and then the Budd@@ hi@@ sts , of course , think that , because we 've all had infinite previous lives , we 've all been each other 's relatives , actually .
I 've been female , and I 've been every single one of yours ' mother in a previous life , the way the Budd@@ hi@@ sts reflect .
a the@@ ist Christian can think that all beings , even my enemies , are God 's children .
you reduce the feeling of other@@ ness about beings .
but anyway , that 's the " lovely love . " and then finally , the fifth step is compassion , " universal compassion . "
and you then feel you must act .
and in Buddhism , they catch it in the future life .
so , practice compassion , read the charter , disseminate it and develop it within yourself .
OK so , a quick natural history , first of compassion .
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fu@@ zz@@ y .
the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family .
I mean , for example , none of us , probably , want to go to prison , but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison . right ?
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison .
good , because before I tell you about that good news , I 'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain .
it 's why social organization has grown from the hun@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ ga@@ there@@ r village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a globalized world .
and I 'm afraid we have another good news / bad news story , which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature .
I think it 's worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand .
it was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election , el@@ ici@@ ting various counter @@@ -@@ @ measures by Israel .
now , in one sense , the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial .
if you 're just talking about social structure , OK , clearly that 's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels .
but then at some point , one of these mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff , which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution : cultural evolution .
by cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas .
a lot of you have heard the term " mem@@ es . " the evolution of technology , I pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand ax@@ e .
now , back to the unfolding ap@@ oc@@ aly@@ pse .
and I would say the non @@@ -@@ @ zero @@@ -@@ @ sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
so , what do we do ? well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control , the international regulation of dangerous technologies .
I think we 're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world .
and something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of " democratization of intim@@ acy . "
and I would actually , I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they 're doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
and this is exactly what we 've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and tex@@ ting under the table to their friends .
100 percent are using text .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intim@@ acy .
conte@@ stants also put themselves forward .
or is this research forever , or what ?
but recent advances in brain imaging technology have given neuro@@ lingu@@ ists a g@@ lim@@ pse into how specific aspects of language learning affect the bilingual brain .
the heightened workout a bilingual brain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases , like Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's and de@@ men@@ tia by as much as five years .
and I would see the ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation between my American and European colleagues , when they were dealing with India .
may he be called to wash away his sins . "
look around you , look at your own countries .
there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes .
if you 're in the U.S. , it 's mostly the bl@@ acks .
we had somebody from public health . and Dev@@ du@@ t@@ t also mentioned public health .
and it was a simple idea . it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field .
because there is no profit in it .

and there are stand @@@ -@@ @ up com@@ ics who are talking about racial issues , about ethnic issues .
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they 're seen .
currently there are 509 million cell@@ phones in Indian hands , in India .
in fact , those 15 million cell@@ phones are the most connections that any country , including the U.S. and China , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
you know , when I grew up in India , telephones were a r@@ arity .
what 's interesting is the met@@ aph@@ or that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
now , you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
( la@@ ughter ) Defin@@ itely not perfect . so you would probably shut it , at this point .
indeed in my studies I was a gu@@ ine@@ a pig for a pharmaceutical industry .
and the concept is to create a kind of on@@ ion , a kind of structure in layers .
I guess you won 't be surprised if I tell you that Pin@@ oc@@ ch@@ io is one of my great influences .
and I tried to design a kind of can@@ ary .
it will be launched next September .
( la@@ ughter ) Just for my workshop .
I 'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .
they 're discoveries of people and the way people are , and new leadership .
Ben@@ ki knew this .
and at that young age , 10 years old , Ben@@ ki became the pa@@ je of his community .
Ben@@ ki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
and what am I doing ? "
we know climate change is going to affect all of us .
we need new models of being a leader and a human in the world .
not an obvious path , she said to me , " It 's all connected .
Mur@@ ali Krishna comes from one of those villages .
S@@ ang@@ ha@@ mit@@ ra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages , and she had a real breakthrough .
and the young women in the village spoke up and said , " We 've changed our dream .
if you are lucky enough to meet S@@ ang@@ ha@@ mit@@ ra and ask her why and how , how have you achieved so much ?
but he do@@ es@@ n 't want his nation ever to forget .
but they have qualities we 'd all recognize .
they 've tried to connect worlds they did@@ n 't know existed before .
they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it .
they know people have come before them and will follow them .
and they know that they 're part of a whole , that they depend on other people .
and they have hum@@ ility .
it just happens .
we can change the way we see ourselves in the world .
but , at the time , in the 13th century , it was the gad@@ get of the day .
and the mat@@ er has some scales and puts it all together .
that 's the movable part of the sky .
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time .
the way little Le@@ wis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky .
and they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in Tokyo harb@@ or over the last year .
and I will start the world like this .
and what happened ?
you can see that the health started to improve .
it was central planning by Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ ung .
and the market re@@ former was successful there .
and it 's healthier than the United States .
and I can understand him , because Washington , D.C.
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
but what I 'm really worried about is war .
and it 's something so ast@@ ounding and so aston@@ ishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gas@@ p of amaz@@ ement might be appropriate .
and it 's increasingly clear that we are@@ n 't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever .
for every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
but of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
there is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that underp@@ ins this transition approach .
actually , if current trends continue , it could all be gone in five or 10 years ' time .
and we have the el@@ ves in the form of China .
and what are the stories that we tell ourselves now , as we look forward about where we 're going to go .
we can be aston@@ ish@@ ingly inven@@ tive and creative .
it 's viral . it seems to spread under the radar very , very quickly .
it 's open source . it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
transition groups in Chile , transition groups in the U.S. , transition groups here , what they 're doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
because if we cl@@ ing to it , and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices , the future that it presents to us is one which is really un@@ manageable .
but , how far away is it ?
here I am -- I 'm the second person on the left -- ( L@@ augh@@ ter ) with the elders in G@@ idan @@@ -@@ @ Kar@@ a , a tiny village outside of So@@ k@@ oto .
it took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that d@@ une , which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location .
I 'm still on hold .
in the hardware world , it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller , smaller , smaller .
they don 't need the database and the website , but they 're like , " Well , I 'll upgrade , because , I might , you know , I might need that some@@ day . "
we like to think of the Internet as a global village .
now , it would be inconsistent to put " United States " first , but it would be intelligent .
it 's like a 7@@ 47 shuttle cock@@ pit .
he says , " Nice talk . " and I said , " Than@@ k you . what do you do here ? "
Chris An@@ derson : Oh ye@@ ah . DP : hold that and don 't let go .
did he say fun ? Ru@@ per@@ t ? yes !
( la@@ ughter ) Or failing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
ca : I still just want to draw out on this issue .
all these things have happened .
but today , the way I want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
an ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star 's life .
now , this is wonderful , because the campaign promise of large teles@@ cop@@ es is that is that the bigger the teles@@ cope , the smaller the detail that we can see .
with this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
so , we 're cra@@ m@@ ming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Sch@@ war@@ z@@ child radius .
and the truth is , I 'm not quite there .
but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shou@@ ld@@ n 't proceed in that environment .
and on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger teles@@ cop@@ es , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy .
and last but not least , none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that 's been made on the technology front .
and we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast , and holds a lot in store for the future .
if you are well @@@ -@@ @ ver@@ sed with inches , nine inches , centi@@ meters , 16 [ centi@@ meters ] .

whether water level goes up or down , the beauty is there throughout .
but perhaps they knew that on sixth , November , 2009 , there will be a TED green and blue session , so they painted it like this .
I 'm talking to you about modern @@@ -@@ @ day slavery .
Sha@@ he@@ en 's background I don 't even know .
An@@ j@@ ali 's father , a drun@@ k@@ ard , sold his child for pornography .
yes , there were eight men who def@@ iled me , raped me , but that did@@ n 't go into my consciousness .
it 's in that context that I rescue children .
can you just encompass these people too ?
now , I should pause and say , what do I mean by puzzle ?
so here we have Pen@@ n and T@@ eller , same up@@ side @@@ -@@ @ down .
ok@@ ay , let 's go back to the slides .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
it 's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece , a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically .
" Be@@ jewel@@ ed " is a big hit . it was the game that really broke open what 's called casual games .
where is that ?
and she 's desperate to find more evidence for the link .
and somebody was talking about met@@ aph@@ ors on Monday .
( la@@ ughter ) But , you know , he 's gone . now he 's gone .
he says , " We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan . "
5,000 maximum , and no rockets . no , no , not going to do it . "
but he says , " We want a nuclear @@@ -@@ @ free world . "
( la@@ ughter ) ... " who said , reach out and touch ... "
and I quickly found I was really quite useless , because there was@@ n 't all the equipment that I had become accustomed to available .
and I heard about a concept out of MI@@ T , called the Fa@@ b Lab@@ s .
these are digital fab@@ rication lab@@ s that allow , in a rather small space with not very expensive equipment , people to have access to these tools to be able to make almost anything , as the slogan goes .
and immediately , we had wonderful results .
so you can imagine my surprise when one day the dean of engineering came and said to me , " K@@ ama@@ u , the students who spend most of the time in the Fa@@ b La@@ b are failing their exams . "
and some of these places are really quite famous .
they just need a space at a desk , and so we provide that at a fee , and others take up bigger spaces and are able to set up their offices .
I 'm pretty sure he passed his exams .
so we 're really proud to be able to say that we have an original equipment manufacturer in Nairobi that 's provided what 's effectively an industrial robot to supply parts for General Mo@@ tors .
and what you 're seeing in the image at the top left over there is very typical of semi @@@ -@@ @ skilled arti@@ s@@ ans who are making products for the marketplace that are really crude .
we have lots of discussions in our space around who we were as Africans , who we are today , and who we want to be vis @@@ -@@ @ Ã  @@@ -@@ @ vis things like consum@@ erism and ethnicity and corruption and so on .
that 's just because , in the nature of the National Por@@ tra@@ it Gallery , it 's created to look at American lives .
well , for one thing , we 're a youth @@@ -@@ @ obs@@ essed culture .
I did@@ n 't know what was going on , but I was so part of the process of getting that out .
he subsequently got married again at 102 , so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him .
I did@@ n 't know who she was , and she said , " D@@ id you get George Ab@@ bot@@ t to talk ? "
it was all part of Cl@@ are Bo@@ o@@ the Lu@@ ce 's look .
I don 't own a gu@@ esthouse .
I have a church full of CE@@ Os and scientists .
now , I 'm reading this thing , and I 'm going , what is that all about ?
what are you doing with what you 've been given ?
if you 're wired to paint , you paint .
and I just watched their little bodies rise and lower , rise and lower .
Hello , everyone . because this is my first time at TED , I 've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit .
where I work , in the Arab region , people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conven@@ tionally Western , nor are they traditionally Islamic .
the USA .
its videos are intended to show a kin@@ der , gent@@ ler face of Islam , for young people to deal with life 's challenges .
" the 99 . " the characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah : justice , wisdom , mercy , among others .
" the 99 " and 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural hy@@ bri@@ di@@ zation .
as part of their strategy the Red Brig@@ ades never spoke with anybody , not even with their lawyers .
and I was one of those people .
in particular , one person had put it forward .
in fact , I read it in the newspaper .
at the same time , while I was inter@@ viewing the Red Brig@@ ades , I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
they were constantly short of cash .
it was a psychi@@ atr@@ ist . he loved sailing .
he was a really keen sail@@ or . and he had this beautiful boat .
you know , that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money , thinking about the economics of terrorism .
the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism .
and the third , of course , is the globalization of terrorism .
then comes the late 1970s , early ' 8@@ 0s , and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism .
it has happened with Industrial Revolution .
now , I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime , terror , and illegal economy , before 9 @@@ -@@ @ 11 .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , until 9 @@@ -@@ @ 11 , the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States .
the entry point , of course , of most of this money were the off @@@ -@@ @ shore facilities .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
all the other countries , for example the United Kingdom , can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders .
and believe me , it 's going to be sc@@ ary .
and at the end of a shoot , I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes @@@ -@@ @ sens@@ ational documentary .
and over there I experienced other people 's suffering , up close and personal , immer@@ sed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories , and at times I experienced great fear for my own life .
( la@@ ughter ) I basically decided that it was I , not the camera or the network , or anything that lay outside myself , that was the only instrument in stor@@ yt@@ elling truly worth tuning .
and he is probably the most prolif@@ ic mass murde@@ rer alive on Earth today .
they use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response .
and that they were definitely capable of diff@@ using it non @@@ -@@ @ aggres@@ sively .
and then there was this : " Mi@@ ster Spl@@ ash@@ y P@@ ants . "
and it was@@ n 't long before other sites like Far@@ k and Bo@@ ing Bo@@ ing and the rest of the Internet started saying , " We love Spl@@ ash@@ y P@@ ants ! "
they said , " No , just kid@@ ding . we 'll give it another week of voting . "
but even more important was that they accomplished their mission .
and the cost of iter@@ ation is so cheap , you might as well .
so it comes from the southwest . it 's a southwest mon@@ soon .
keep that in mind .
you 're too keen . you 're too keen . no . hang on . hang on .
it 's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia , including the Maldives .
but wind is , invariably , every time , is from the west .
are they coming from India against the wind ?
and there is a front between them , and the front moves .
but they are incredibly good f@@ li@@ ers . this particular species , it can fly for thousands of kilometers .
what 's happening is they are breeding in the mon@@ soon rains here .
the sun is overhead there . summer rains in southern Africa .
it 's now back there . they come out , it 's time to come back .
so , now they don 't stop here , or even down here .
they have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from India to Africa . includes this one , the hob@@ by .
he was flying off the coast of Go@@ a , 21 years ago , 1988 . October , 1988 .
but met@@ aph@@ or is a way of thought before it is a way with words .
we all have syn@@ esthe@@ tic abilities .
sadly , it 's met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically true .
when life brought about a series of death and near @@@ -@@ @ death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India , similar to 9@@ 11 in USA .
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right .
most definitely you don 't want to pay the bri@@ be .
we 've been trying for 50 years .
you have to make it from something else .
and the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
we have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
seven nations are involved in building this .
we have to get to this .
I wish this were different . we really need it now .
I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stra@@ y cats and dogs who w@@ ander around the streets of the village that I live near Gil@@ g@@ it , northern Pakistan .
my name is Z@@ amin .
or can you move beyond my ve@@ il and see me for who I truly am inside ?
my name is Pap@@ us@@ ay .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that 's based on technology trends .
and these are the in@@ flec@@ tion points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be , and maybe how you can do something about it .
you can see around 2001 it finally out @@@ -@@ @ sold the V@@ CR .
( la@@ ughter ) Now they 've introduced these four ways of looking at technology , these four stages of technology 's life .
as you probably know , gene sequ@@ encing -- in a large part , because it 's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Mo@@ ore 's Law @@@ -@@ @ like level .
that 's as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
and you 've seen the numbers .
and the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to India , is the p@@ is@@ sed @@@ -@@ @ off program@@ mer , is the outsourcing .
and on the other side there was a rising sun .
and in that sense , ballo@@ oning is a beautiful met@@ aph@@ or .
because in the ballo@@ on , like in life , we go very well in unforeseen directions .
and when we drop the ballast over@@ board we climb .
of course not just like the atmosphere in the ballo@@ on , but in life itself .
but sometimes it 's very paradox@@ ical .
when Bri@@ an Jones and I were flying around the world , the weather man asked us , one day , to fly quite low , and very slow .
( la@@ ughter ) And then he asked me -- and this is something I will never forget in my life -- he just asked me , " You 're the good pilot up there .
we are burning , as you heard , so much energy , not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life CA@@ N@@ NOT last for long .
so , we went down actually .
that 's when you throw out all the ballast , all the certain@@ ties , in order to adapt to the new situation .
I had no idea how it was possible .
that has been achieved after two years of work .
it 's not designed by an artist , but it could be .
this is not an air@@ plane .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
but much more , to get ad@@ vices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air , of course it 's possible in the ground .
I 'd like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the University of California .
and each ne@@ ur@@ on makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other ne@@ ur@@ ons in the brain .
so , here is a ne@@ ur@@ on that fires when I reach and grab something , but it also fires when I watch Jo@@ e reaching and gra@@ b@@ bing something .
but a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
so , here again you have ne@@ ur@@ ons which are enrolled in em@@ pa@@ thy .
so , to avoid that -- I have to avoid it somehow -- is I use dead people .
it reminds me of my college days .
if you 're a mam@@ mal , if you 're a rat or an ele@@ phant , or a human , in between , it 's the same story .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
we found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles off the coast of Italy , on the island of S@@ ard@@ inia .
and one of the most salient elements of the S@@ ard@@ ini@@ an society is how they treat older people .
you go into the bars in S@@ ard@@ inia , instead of seeing the Sports Il@@ lu@@ str@@ ated sw@@ im@@ suit calendar , you see the cen@@ ten@@ arian of the month calendar .
that 's called the grand@@ mother effect .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
it 's a place where people have the longest disability @@@ -@@ @ free life expectancy in the world .
five times as many cen@@ ten@@ arians as we have in America .
once again , a plant @@@ -@@ @ based diet , full of vegetables with lots of color in them .
and they eat about eight times as much to@@ fu as Americans do .
and that diet is known as the Har@@ a , Hat@@ chi , B@@ u diet .
and one of the questions , they were very culturally a@@ stu@@ te , the people who put the questionnaire .
they instantly knew why they wo@@ ke up in the morning .
my editor at Geographic wanted me to find America 's Blue Zone .
( la@@ ughter ) So , we turned to the data again .
and we found America 's longest @@@ -@@ @ lived population among the Seventh @@@ -@@ @ Day Ad@@ ven@@ ti@@ sts concentrated in and around L@@ oma Lin@@ da , California .
but for an Ad@@ ven@@ tist woman , their life expectancy is 89 .
El@@ ls@@ worth W@@ ha@@ re@@ ham is 97 years old .
and predic@@ tably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
ed R@@ aw@@ lings , 103 years old now , an active co@@ w@@ boy , starts his morning with a swim .
her grand@@ son actually lives in the Twin Cities here .
she ri@@ des her bicycle .
they don 't have any conveni@@ ences .
when you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti @@@ -@@ @ inflammatory state .
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
this is an average size king co@@ bra , about 12 feet long .
what 's the point of all this ?
but complac@@ ency does have a tendency to breed contempt .
this was actually just taken last year .
people sco@@ op water out of the Cha@@ mb@@ al and drink it , something you w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't do in most north Indian rivers .
and now [ these ] new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gh@@ arial means that if they don 't dro@@ wn in the net , then they simply cut their be@@ aks off .
whenever he e@@ ats the pit vi@@ per he gets this little ven@@ om rush .
you think of , you know , urbanization , consum@@ erism , the workplace , technology .
they want to get back to slower rhyth@@ ms .
in medicine , I think a lot of people are deeply di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sioned with the kind of quick @@@ -@@ @ fix mentality you find in conventional medicine .
and if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway , you 'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going .
thank you very much .
now , when we started working deeper and dig@@ ging deeper , we found that it 's an illegal act .
we we@@ ren 't sure at all . and we managed to convince him .
and we said , " Ok@@ ay , here is some seed fund .
it transformed them . what you will see is their journey , and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world .
( music ) A@@ tu@@ l Kar@@ w@@ al : a@@ Pro@@ C@@ h is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .
and we plan to extend this to other parts of the city .
so , on August 15th , again , Independence Day , 2009 , empowered with the same process , we empowered 100,000 children to say , " I can . "
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .
right from lon@@ eliness to filling po@@ th@@ ol@@ es in the street to alcohol@@ ism , and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Raj@@ as@@ than .
child : our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
girl : are you ready ? audience : yes !
it was incredible .
70 years ago , it took one man to infec@@ t an entire nation with the power of " We can . "
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India ?
Google Map@@ Mak@@ er is a technology that em@@ powers each of us to map what we know locally .
( la@@ ughter ) Yes . I 'm sure ! just change it !
this , of course , is a map of the moon .
there 're some very del@@ ight@@ ful names .
( la@@ ughter ) Dj@@ ab@@ ran Fl@@ uc@@ tus .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , we 're going to be going to Mars one day . and when we do , it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridic@@ ulous names .
( la@@ ughter ) Y@@ ea@@ h , I 'm at the De@@ pres@@ si@@ o , and I want to get over to Amaz@@ on@@ is so I plug it into the Mars map , and click the button and there 's my directions .
( la@@ ughter ) Left to the Th@@ y@@ mi@@ am@@ ata .
and you know they 're international because they put it " en Fran@@ ca@@ is " as well .
and I think that Dj@@ ab@@ ran Fl@@ uc@@ tus , that fits that mode .
" ye@@ ah , that 's the go@@ at go@@ dd@@ ess right ? the Ab@@ ac@@ az@@ anian ?
( la@@ ughter ) Also , from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest .
we 've got to change this stuff up fast .
" ye@@ ah , go to your room . "
you see the ic@@ osa@@ he@@ dr@@ on again .
October 9th , in France , Jean @@@ -@@ @ Pierre L@@ umin@@ et said that the universe is probably shaped like a do@@ dec@@ a@@ he@@ dr@@ on , based on information that they got from this probe .
( la@@ ughter ) Ren@@ Ã© Des@@ car@@ tes , of course . once again these Grenada people , this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination .
He@@ y , you can 't make this up .
I actually go to bed every night thinking about what I 'm going to wear the next day .
clothing trans@@ forms me , defines me , gives me confidence .
MD affects his muscle strength , his pul@@ mon@@ ary system , distor@@ ts his body and makes everyday life more challenging than most .
he came home from school one day and said very defini@@ tively that he was going to wear je@@ ans to school like everybody else gets to wear .
in 2013 , I founded an organization called Run@@ way of Dre@@ ams .
I met a young man who was 18 who has cere@@ br@@ al pal@@ sy .
he was going to Harvard University .
I knew that if I was going to make a change in the industry , I had to use my background and really figure out how to make these clothes modified .
the first were closures .
in O@@ ax@@ aca , in Mexico , the teachers ' movement organized a protest after the president pushed down very un@@ democratic reforms .
the woman who fil@@ med this was a very , very courageous eye@@ witness , and she had to go into hiding after she posted her video for fear of her life .
this is the story of Chris@@ sy .
ten billion video views on Sn@@ ap@@ chat , per day .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
and all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet .
so , I don 't know , just stick with me . right ?
so , first of all , what are we looking for ? bright Green city .
we 're already an urban planet ; that 's especially true in the developed world .
here , for example , is Vancouver , which if you haven 't been there , you ought to go for a visit . it 's a fab@@ ulous city .
they 're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars , which is a pretty great thing .
you can start doing things like , you know , transit systems that actually work to transport people , in effective and reasonably comfortable man@@ ners .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start fig@@ uring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we 're actually using .
so we have a model in potential , an emerging model that we 're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in , and turn them into B@@ right Green cities .
it 's every seven days .
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
so what we have , increasingly , is cell phones just perme@@ ating out through society .
the second thing is tools for collaboration , be they systems of collaboration , or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration . right ?
it 's doing something new . there 's new things happening .
and as we heard last night , as we 've heard earlier this week , are absolutely , fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions , is we 've got to craft new political realities .
basically you can suc@@ k any water through this and it will become dr@@ ink@@ able by the time it hits your lips .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
his core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees .
( la@@ ughter ) To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead .
by 7 : 08 , I started to black out .
so , I started to really get really par@@ ano@@ id .
and I started having is@@ chem@@ ia to the heart .
the central moti@@ f of B@@ har@@ ti 's practice is the ready @@@ -@@ @ made store @@@ -@@ @ bought B@@ ind@@ i that un@@ told millions of Indian women apply to their fore@@ heads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
to the naked eye they look like a piece of your bl@@ ouse , or your shirt , but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to de@@ grade once inside the body .
you place the v@@ ascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
they are not nearly as complex as hol@@ low organs .
( la@@ ughter ) I 'm a surgeon so that 's not that funny .
while I 'm talking I 'd like you to also be thinking about : how many places have you lived ?
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
ok@@ ay , I spent 25 years , in my middle @@@ -@@ @ age lun@@ gs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
very nice , and there my older , senior lun@@ gs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
but none of that 's in my medical record .
he 's a colleague . he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . right ?
I 'd suggest that that 's a bad idea Bill , because of this report . "
so with that , I 'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
so they 're deprived of understanding their reality .
so I can go back to my story .
we were actually recording history .
so I prepared two plans for that meeting , two strategic plans : the small one and the big one .
and what these guys need , actually , is access to capital .
and I can , but I 'll give you just , maybe one , and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with .
I have no interest in being in media business .
and those can be environmental bonds .
once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix .
and so we re@@ defined this marginalized position as the place of architecture .
and that 's that the company and the building was multi@@ form .
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dum@@ b .
now , in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .
A@@ gn@@ es was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was female gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ til@@ ated .
I had the privilege of being in the hu@@ t when she was re@@ united with her father and reconciled .
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down c@@ rying .
we will not cut you .
and I want to do it for S@@ uni@@ tha .
I am connected to everything and everyone . I was born like that .
Don 't tell me not to cry , to calm it down , not to be so extreme , to be reasonable .
I love , I love , love , love being a girl !
and we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Em@@ br@@ ace .
he leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
as a researcher , every once in a while you encounter something a little dis@@ concer@@ ting .
so , this incident that I 'm going to describe really began with some diar@@ rhe@@ a .
you get it , either in pill form or you get it as an injection ; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels .
adherence rates . how many people are taking their insul@@ in every day ?
it 's not just medicine .
you see , what 's going on here , and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of inter@@ acting with the world , some models that you use to understand the world .
one person walks into a car lot , and they 're thinking about buying this Toy@@ ota Yar@@ is .
I 'm going to take off some of that weight , and I 'm going to buy a Hum@@ mer that 's 11 miles per gall@@ on . "
this is a typical insul@@ in injection .
so , the patients print it out , because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network .
but the short story is : if you 're a patient , you want to be on the blue line .
and you take those data , and we find the patients like him , and we bring their data together . and we bring their hi@@ stories into it .
and he took lithium , and he went down the line .
and it works almost every time .
happiness is supposed to make us better workers and parents and partners ; it 's supposed to make us live longer .
I think we could learn from this today .
it ev@@ o@@ kes the g@@ id@@ dy dis@@ orientation that you feel in an un@@ familiar place .
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
one discovery was that wild Bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s often walk bid@@ ped@@ ally .
SS : so Kan@@ zi is very interested in fire .
he 's learning the uses for a fire , just by watching what we do with fire .
( la@@ ughter ) This is a smile on the face of a Bon@@ ob@@ o .

subtle maneu@@ vering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this .
Ny@@ ota tries to im@@ itate Pan@@ ban@@ isha by using the sc@@ iss@@ ors himself .
what is she writing ?
" a frame " represents a hu@@ t in the woods .
compare the chal@@ k writing with the l@@ ex@@ igra@@ m on the keyboard .
do that real fast part that you did . ye@@ ah , that part .
and so I regard that as done .
and the thing you 'd most like to analyze , we 're a fair distance from .
it 's what 's called " fever of un@@ diagnosed origin . "
but even that 's complicated , because to me , colors might indicate " normal , " but after all , we 're all suffering from probably an excess of education .
how do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with ?
what you see here is another centi@@ meter @@@ -@@ @ sized device , and the different colors are different colors of dy@@ e .
and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting , which is , the yellow seems to disappear , get through the blue , and then get through the red .
now , I have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business .
it works really , really well .
if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease , we can take it enorm@@ ously the other direction , and obviously , that 's where we need to go , going forward .
so , the website of the National Can@@ cer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease .
and I think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
people got upset , but this is the only way we 're going to go forward .
we have designed , and we have worked on the modeling -- and much of these ideas came from D@@ anny and from his team -- the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system .
you know , I 've been using it for two and a half months .
it 's really unsatisfactory having plug @@@ -@@ @ in art .
the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun .
TS : no . ( J@@ H : no . ) TS : the first one I did was in the late 70 's , and I just had a simple con@@ e with a sp@@ ig@@ ot at the bottom of it .
but then I started dre@@ aming of having six colors .
TS : so something like this .
you think of yourself as the servant .
TS : nature is -- well , it 's a go@@ d@@ send .
because there is this asym@@ metry , which creates , basically , failing governance .
no wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany , but also in France and the UK and Scandin@@ avia , everywhere , systematically bri@@ bed .
and that 's why the law has changed .
thank you .
I 'm not a doctor ; I 'm a ch@@ ef , I don 't have expensive equipment or medicine .
this is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world .
can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today ?
look at homicide at the bottom , for God 's sake .
I wanted to put heart and soul and people , your public , around the statistics that we 've become so used to .
she has six years to live .
St@@ acy does her best , but she 's third @@@ -@@ @ generation as well ; she was never taught to cook at home or at school .
J@@ ustin here , 12 years old , he 's 350 pounds .
he has to bury the people , OK ?
this is preventable disease . waste of life .
and the way I look at it is : if you don 't have k@@ ni@@ ves and for@@ ks in your school , you 're purely endorsing , from a state level , fast food , because it 's hand@@ held .
( sigh@@ s ) Ten percent of what we spend on health care , as I said earlier , is on obesity , and it 's going to double .
( video ) Who knows what this is ?
child : on@@ ion . J@@ o : on@@ ion ? no .
the big brands , you know , the food brands , need to put food education at the heart of their businesses .
definitely they shou@@ ld@@ n 't be left out .
OK , notice there 's now a roof above us .
so here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
also , these are intermit@@ tent sources .
now , this shows up when you try to get the intermit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you 're using .
innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there 's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
the main problem we have here -- it 's kind of like with AIDS : you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
if the trade @@@ -@@ @ off you get into is , " Let 's make energy super expensive , " then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
and even Lom@@ borg has changed .
we have vast budget deficits .
that 's the argument I want to make tonight .
local power , central power , now , people power .
you we@@ ren 't in charge of policing , justice , education , health , welfare .
we have only , in government and in politics , started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution .
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , se@@ archa@@ ble for anyone to see .
so those three ways -- transparency , accountability and choice -- will make a huge difference .
we 're being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book .
how do you do it ?
that sort of behavi@@ oral economics can transform people 's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the bad@@ g@@ ering from a government CA@@ N@@ NOT possibly achieve .
so , it 's not just about the words .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emo@@ tionally or both .
it 's part of our life .
and , perhaps , until we 're tested , we don 't know what we 're made of .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ a@@ stern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bus@@ hel of tomatoes .
and that 's what happened at the end of that three @@@ -@@ @ month period .
the teachers did@@ n 't know a switch had been made .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
and what he showed in man@@ tis shri@@ mp is that they use what 's called a " catch mechanism , " or " click mechanism . "
but that was not the end of the story .
and so , I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out .
and actually , in a certain sense , technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas , if you can think about it that way .
you might have noticed that law has grown progressively den@@ ser in your lives over the last decade or two .
the principal did@@ n 't want to stand up to the parent because he did@@ n 't want to get dra@@ gged into some legal proceedings .
you have to go in a school bus . "
the case went on for two years ; I think he 's still appealing the case .
I grew up in the South and wh@@ iled away the sum@@ mers fishing .
because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else 's freedom .
this is the hardest hur@@ dle .
the problem is , we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values .
( appl@@ ause ) So , what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .
I did@@ n 't have one of those , but I got the F@@ it@@ bit .
now , I had this brain scan done several years ago , and I used to jo@@ ke around about having a gig@@ antic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cor@@ te@@ x .
and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals .
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
people have a hard time fig@@ uring that out .
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle .
he studied Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er 's patients that had fron@@ tal temporal lo@@ be de@@ men@@ tia .
and the de@@ men@@ tia ate out the language parts of the brain .
and then this art@@ work came out of somebody who used to install stere@@ os in cars .
but you know what ? I was getting work experience .
let 's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance .
they can do graphic design , all kinds of stuff with computers , photography , industrial design .
I CA@@ N@@ NOT emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .
well , that 's the end of my talk .
( appl@@ ause ) Chris An@@ derson : thank you so much for that .
the thing is , au@@ tism comes in different degrees .
but then you get these smart , ge@@ e@@ ky kids with a touch of au@@ tism , and that 's where you 've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things .
you know , the slaughter plants I worked with in the ' 8@@ 0s ; they were absolutely aw@@ ful .
how many cattle are MO@@ O@@ ing their heads off ?
you directly observe a few simple things .
patient : their shapes ...
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin par@@ sing the world is dynamic information .
but for a long time we cou@@ ld@@ n 't quite figure out : w@@ ow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?
( la@@ ughter ) I had to have long conversations with my wife .
so , it 's an important demonstration of the power of motion .
so what I did was I quickly put together a coll@@ age of all the teachers I had drawn , glor@@ ified my school principal , put him right on top , and gif@@ ted it to him .
the rest of my family are b@@ oring academics , busy collecting I@@ vy League dec@@ als for our classic Ambassador car .
so , I tried going to the art store .
so I decided , I 'm going to learn to paint by myself .
and I talked about the weakness of male sexuality .
I met Bel@@ in@@ da when she was 16 .
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride , and touch children and be honest .
so we have the rememb@@ ering self and the experiencing self , and they 're really quite distinct .
that 's not the way it works at all for the rememb@@ ering self .
you have that much uncertainty .
D@@ K : you know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
again , this is not an optical trick . this is what you would see . in other words , it 's not a camera cut . it 's a percep@@ tual trick .
we can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents . what do you see here ?
do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? it 's completely static .
it 's a static image . how many people see this illusion ? it 's completely static .
and it was such a good tro@@ m@@ pe l '@@ o@@ e@@ il that people got irrit@@ ated when they tried to talk to the woman and she w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't respond .
well , there 's analog and digital . thought that was appropriate here .
and that 's exactly what c@@ ric@@ ket has done .
another half an hour and we would have won . "
princes patron@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ing@@ rati@@ ating themselves to the British rulers .
England invented 20 overs c@@ ric@@ ket , and said , " The world must play 20 overs c@@ ric@@ ket . "
and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
it was not like re@@ engineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
the other was Indian c@@ ric@@ ket .
and look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
but what this also did was it started mar@@ rying the two most important things in Indian c@@ ric@@ ket , which is c@@ ric@@ ket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
they started going to the c@@ ric@@ ket to watch Sha@@ h Ru@@ kh Khan .
and so it started resem@@ bling the Indian movies more and more .
the best Indian players who played every test match -- every one of the inter@@ nationals , the top of the line players -- standard contracts are 2@@ 20,000 dollars in a whole year .
there 's no fil@@ th , there 's no beg@@ g@@ ars , all the sna@@ ke char@@ mers have van@@ ished , everybody 's gone . this tells you how the capitalist world rules .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info @@@ -@@ @ graphic .
( appl@@ ause ) Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , I might think , " Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? "
so I can step back , and expand on that .
so the summary consists of just a little syn@@ op@@ sis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
I 'm going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
and so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wisdom to be found .
so with that , I thank you .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hips , all that stuff .
I was end@@ lessly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the textbook .
I pe@@ stered my father until he finally found a s@@ cu@@ ba class in Bu@@ ff@@ alo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I did@@ n 't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
and I 've learned that that deep @@@ -@@ @ ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
you know , it 's Arthur Clar@@ ke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is in@@ distingu@@ ishable from magic .
so , with " Termin@@ ator 2 , " which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two do@@ ts of experience came to , " This is going to be a whole new world , " this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . "
because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian subm@@ er@@ sible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Tit@@ anic through a view port .
and it was an experience that Hollywood cou@@ ld@@ n 't give me .
after the success of " Tit@@ anic , " I said , " OK , I 'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I 'm going to go be a full @@@ -@@ @ time explo@@ rer for a while . "
they don 't survive on sunlight @@@ -@@ @ based system the way we do .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , " What am I doing out here ?
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? "
and we became a family , over a four @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ half year period .
and it completely changed how I do movies .
so , what can we synthe@@ size out of all this ?
well , I think number one is curi@@ osity .
let me repeat that : there is nothing that you have to get , do or be in order to be happy .
we define our life in the following way : here I am , here is where I want to go , these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go , and if I succeed , life is wonderful .
she 's investing in the process , not in the outcome .
so , today I 'm back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement a@@ foot , now , around the world .
I also talked about community @@@ -@@ @ generated data -- in fact I edited some .
but they are not applicable in all situations .
and so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
well , at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars , that 's 8.3 hours per day . the average wage in the U.S.
so , it 's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign .
the question was , how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh ?
and if we are neighbors , I could just walk over to his house .
and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day , which is like 700 dollars per year .
and again , here are some of the lessons .
so you could feel good about selling it .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us ch@@ efs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear @@@ -@@ @ cut forests .
it 's hard to over@@ state the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mons , s@@ word@@ fish -- they 've collapsed .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it do@@ es@@ n 't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
" that 's right , " he said . " we 're so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . "
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , " he said .
" sustainable proteins , " he said .
( la@@ ughter ) So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
he said he did@@ n 't know . he would ask around .
let 's call him Don too .
( la@@ ughter ) I fell out of love with this fish .
I actually am .
it 's the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
it 's a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of Spain .
you st@@ are out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are floo@@ ded can@@ als and this thick , rich marsh@@ land .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanz@@ anian Gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
and then he 's off , launching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aquatic plants .
what 's the feed conversion ratio ? "
well , he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
they 're fe@@ asting . "
Oh , and by the way , those flam@@ ing@@ os , they shou@@ ld@@ n 't even be there in the first place .
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I 'll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instruc@@ tive .
you might say it 's a recipe for the future of good food , whether we 're talking about bass or beef cattle .
how are you going to feed the world ?
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
now , I don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
that 's been the motivation , it 's been the justification : it 's been the business plan of American agriculture .
instead , let 's look to the ecological model .
and if I 'm going to be really honest , they 're a better ch@@ ef than I 'll ever be .
you know , I 'm ok@@ ay with that , because if that 's the future of good food , it 's going to be delicious .
OK . we 've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .
so I 'll take you through that and we 'll see what it 's like when someone really sum@@ mons the will to survive .
OK , this is Mount E@@ ve@@ rest .
camp Two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what 's called the Western c@@ w@@ m .
and , after actually two months of preparation , we built our camps all the way up the mountain .
these are some clim@@ bers reaching the top of the ic@@ ef@@ all just at sun @@@ -@@ @ up .
that 's another cre@@ v@@ asse .
and this is at Camp Four .
you can barely stand outside the tent .
you can see his hand is completely white ; his face , his nose , is burned .
he 's collapsed in the snow here . everything is quiet , there 's very little red anywhere .
this is the po@@ ster@@ ior part , where his muscles are going to be moving , and he 's going to be pac@@ ing himself .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the needle .
bacterial spo@@ res are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive , but in suspended animation for as long as 250 million years .
the next day , she was doing so well , they wanted to run tests on her .
yet , it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
I 'd like to buy some concentrated , compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas , see , about wanting to suspend people .
so that 's kind of a tough day , but I said , " There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this . "
I mean , who knows ?
it stopped moving .
and with money we got from DA@@ RPA , we could show just that .
waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of de@@ men@@ tia than anything that shows up clin@@ ically today .
w@@ ow , what a great day that will be once we 're allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
and it 's the whole field that we 've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel .
I was like , " Ac@@ tually it was your idea . you said it in a For@@ tune Magazine article .
the first word that comes up is " doctor . "
our entire health reform discussion right now , health I.@@ T. , when we talk with policy makers , equals " How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the main@@ frame ? "
I can 't stop this from happening .
here 's why .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ ances here : the cr@@ ink@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
it might sound like it 's a bad thing .
this super@@ computer was called the Global Ex@@ tin@@ ction Awareness System , of course .
J@@ a : if you think about it , Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America .
J@@ a : the ram@@ ps are made of simple material -- the kind of pl@@ y@@ wood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point .
where it overl@@ aps with thoughts about our work in general is , number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done .
and in fact , there 's a proposal on the table now for building number seven .
not so in human beings : you cut off an arm , you cut off a leg -- it do@@ es@@ n 't reg@@ row .
the greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing , and it turns out that this is not so important any more .
except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in Gen@@ Bank , Mo@@ ore 's Law is right here : it 's the blue line .
this is on a log scale , and that 's what su@@ pere@@ x@@ pon@@ ential growth means .
this is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School .
( la@@ ughter ) So , you want to know where life is happening ?
and that 's the triangle between Sal@@ k , Scrip@@ ps , U@@ CSD , and it 's called Tor@@ rey P@@ ines Road .
so , if there is something you should fear , it 's that you 're not keeping your eye on the ball .
it 's got nothing to do with inflation .
Oh , ye@@ ah , and it takes about 5.6 million Indians .
and I said , " I think she 's dancing . "
and the third said , " Let 's find another director . "
so I re@@ thought the whole thing , and then we all came to a consensus .
and here was the introduction of this great British icon called " Elizabeth . "
I 'm doing it right now ; you can watch me . I 'm getting nervous , I don 't know what to say , I don 't know what I 'm doing , I don 't want to go there .
and as I go there , of course , my A.@@ D. says , " You know what you 're going to do , si@@ r . " I say , " Of course I do . "
you remember how India was . there was no pollution .
my father was a doctor .
what does forever mean ?
and I would lie there c@@ rying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity .
we all , everybody , has a story that they follow .
but that puts some kind of burden on me .
find that which is not .
and the mortal self was the girl that Walter R@@ ale@@ igh was sent , and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine .
of course , all the British press got really upset .
I was trying to find a my@@ thic reason to make the film .
are you with child ?
and how we tell stories visually , with music , with actors , and at each level it 's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other .
so the design has a story .
but you get up at 4 a.m.
that first bl@@ ush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other .
there may come a time when we med@@ dle with our gen@@ om@@ es in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ athon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals .
there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate .
very , very interesting planet .
( la@@ ughter ) This is Oly@@ m@@ pus M@@ ons .
water is the key ingredient in the evolution , the origin of life on a planet .
sixteen percent , by weight , of the interior contains frozen water , or ice .
a lot of heating , fric@@ tional heating . it 's going 18 thousand miles an hour .
the rocket engine begins .
I have a scale model here .
well , that is precisely what has happened around the world .
there 's no need to play the market .
here 's the reality .
now , everything I 've been telling you , I admit , is pretty dis@@ hear@@ tening .
slavery , illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society .
it 's about helping people to build lives of dignity , stability , economic autonomy , citizenship .
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dump@@ ed .
we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch , and end up as second class citizens .
and that roof@@ top did not have any ceiling , only half a tin sheet .
but they know there is this myth that children from the slums CA@@ N@@ NOT speak English well .
even if it takes me four and a half hours , or three and half hours to finish my book , I do it .
fathers have started to attend .
now they have started writing their signature .
we had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study .
it seems that with or without us , life will go on .
now , there he is calling to his friends .
now we 've got a movement .
and what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
for kids like me , being called chil@@ dish can be a frequent occurrence .
which really bo@@ thers me .
kids already do a lot of learning from adults , and we have a lot to share .
( la@@ ughter ) Or just like you ? really ?
now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
now , the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well @@@ -@@ @ known , bleeding heart liberal Marg@@ aret Th@@ at@@ cher .
( la@@ ughter ) There is nothing on the other side .
so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this .
and they are heter@@ os@@ ex@@ uals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .
and , again , it 's because of an alignment of the incentives .
not for nothing do we call it the Laz@@ ar@@ us Effect .
let 's just stop treating people . "
no , and I call it the " compassion con@@ und@@ r@@ um . "
it 's all politics .
from the point of view of a public health ner@@ d , jun@@ k@@ ies are doing dum@@ b things .
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
we 're not all of them , of course , but TED is a community of opinion leaders .
a few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DA@@ RPA , the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't take the risk of doing .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
and then the surgeon pointed out , with a lot of anger , he said , " Why is it ? at the end of the Civil War , they were shooting each other with mus@@ kets . if somebody lost an arm , we gave them a wooden stick with a ho@@ ok on it .
you 're going to give us an arm . "
and it was ast@@ ounding how positive they are .
but I was saying to him , " You know , the first air@@ plane went 100 feet in 19@@ 03 .
we 've got some pretty amazing neuro@@ logy and other people . "
so with this , now the top body is ligh@@ ted up ; it 's walking in our lab .
we do something to something , and just like magic , it moves .
instead of using electrical motors , electro@@ mechanical actu@@ ators , we 're using compressed air .
let 's see how it does .
it 's very impressive .
we have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .
nobody critici@@ zes any opinion .
there was a great TED moment -- I think it was Sir K@@ en Robinson , was it ?
" the Sle@@ ep@@ y Gi@@ ant , " which is the song that I just san@@ g , is one of his po@@ ems .
this is Rac@@ hel Field , Robert Gra@@ ves -- a very young Robert Gra@@ ves -- Chris@@ tina Ros@@ sett@@ i .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
â« Well , you 've been so ... â« That 's innovative , don 't you think ?
there 's never been a time like this .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
thank you .
the horri@@ fying images from Abu G@@ hra@@ ib as well as the images from Guant@@ an@@ amo had a profound impact .
in the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
but images don 't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and I 'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we 're doing on the bottom .
so I marvel@@ ed for a moment , and then decided it was time to release him , so I put him down .
and I remember that pro@@ verb@@ ial light going off in my head , thinking , " Wa@@ it a minute .
and after the first week , they ignored us .
and they would see a coral head , maybe 10 feet away , and start moving over toward that coral head .
and I always wondered what happened under that web .
but we 're just going to zi@@ p right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid @@@ -@@ @ ocean ri@@ dge , which I think is even more extraordinary .
there 's no coral , algae growing on it , and the water 's pe@@ a sou@@ p .
I think Marg@@ aret Me@@ ad said it best .
my answer to that is don 't look at the big , overwhelming issues of the world .
and do that , and spread the word .
Jean @@@ -@@ @ Michel Bas@@ qu@@ i@@ at , important to me because [ he was ] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into .
my interest is in artists who understand and re@@ write history , who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art , but who have created new places for us to see and understand .
it looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art .
I 'm showing you two works , one on the right by Le@@ on G@@ olu@@ b , one on the left by Robert Col@@ es@@ cott .
and she pointed to the image on the right as an example , to me , of the kind of dignity that needed to be portra@@ yed to work against those images in the media .
this is Har@@ le@@ m , actually , on January 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way .
and I bring this up because it 's important to locate this practice in history .
after his lecture , a student got up and said to him , " Give us a po@@ em . "
it is why I make exhibitions .
now , where , perhaps , does this end up right now ?
what do I think about when I think about art ?
that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world .
in the spirit of Jacques Cou@@ ste@@ au , who said , " People protect what they love , " I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean , and that 's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light .
my addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called W@@ asp ; that 's not an acrony@@ m -- just somebody thought it looked like the in@@ sect .
we trained in a tank in Port Hu@@ enem@@ e , and then my first open ocean di@@ ve was in Santa Bar@@ bara Channel .
it was an evening di@@ ve .
and the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence .
in the ocean , it 's the rule rather than the exception .
well , that was the question that 19th century French physi@@ ologist Rap@@ hael Du@@ bo@@ is , asked about this bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ es@@ cent cl@@ am .
so , for example , this fish has a built @@@ -@@ @ in head@@ light behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate .
and I have no idea why there 's two , and that 's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light , but it can see red light .
this is a vi@@ per@@ fish , and it 's got a l@@ ure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arch@@ es in front of the to@@ oth@@ y ja@@ w that gives the vi@@ per@@ fish its name .
and we know a little bit more about bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence thanks to Pi@@ x@@ ar , and I 'm very grateful to Pi@@ x@@ ar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people .
I do wish , with their budget , that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor , star@@ ving graduate student , who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that 's been preserved in form@@ al@@ in .
and this one has a l@@ ure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it .
for this fish , it 's actually whole cells with nuc@@ lei and membran@@ es .
the other primary way is we go down with subm@@ er@@ si@@ bles and remote @@@ -@@ @ operated vehicles .
so , I 've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .
and I had my window into the deep sea .
for example , when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on , you assumed this was a microphone , which it is not .
but I 'm going to take some medication .

so what do you think happened to these design students ?
at the same time in South Africa , after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison , the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid .
hundreds of thousands of people were ex@@ terminated , slowly and pain@@ fully .
it exemplified the best that humanity has to offer .

we used to fill ballo@@ ons with flour instead of water when we played .
if it saved water , they replaced it , eventually reducing their employees ' water consumption by half .
taking me to lesson three : look below the surface .
this is my favorite part . are you ready to be cured ?
( gas@@ ps ) All right .
so if you change those ingredients today , you 're basically teaching your brain how to predict differently tomorrow , and this is what I call being the architect of your experience .
( la@@ ughter ) That mind racing is prediction .
maybe you 're tired .
is it possible that you can transform emotional suffering into just mere physical discomfort ?
what intri@@ gues me most is how women are doing this , despite a set of parad@@ o@@ xes that are both frustr@@ ating and fascinating .

embrace cur@@ ators ; we are alternative voices to the mainstream music channels , digital or otherwise .
go beyond the algorithm .
your job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects as you can think of .
well , even starting from Mathematic@@ a , this is still a huge amount of work .
you can expect to see Wol@@ fra@@ m Alpha technology showing up in more and more places , working both with this kind of public data , like on the website , and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on .
let me show you a couple of examples here .
if you go on , that 's a slightly more complicated program that 's now doing all sorts of algorith@@ mic things and creating user interface and so on .
I think it 's actually rather wonderful .
does your work relate to his ?
you 'll notice , they 've all got something that I don 't .
I thought there were them and there were us , and I was not one of them .

then , when that gave out , I sa@@ wed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those .
and finally : am I crazy ?

whereas if you look in Google Earth , this is how the Pacific looks .
I eventually made it to Hawa@@ ii still alive .
now wall switches , we all know , fail .
now , one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it 's going to do , in general .
I mean , with the health system , you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side , but in terms of the system itself ?
I 'll give you three examples .
the technology is there , the infrastructure is there , and yet it do@@ es@@ n 't happen .
in fact , that is the leading cause of under @@@ -@@ @ five mortality .
" not so fast , " say other people .
we made it easy -- I 'll tell you how in a moment .

you know how to immun@@ ize kids , you know how to give bed nets . "
so let 's go back to Haiti for a moment .
this is where gu@@ t decisions come from .

over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal paras@@ ites and diar@@ rhe@@ a from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- all entirely preventable and treat@@ able .
that 's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area .
we 're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho .
these people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me , helped them when they were on the ver@@ ge of destroying each other .
we 're un@@ doing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future .
and it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
and I ended up in Jamaica , in the West In@@ dies , where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary , struc@@ turally , that I ever saw in my life .

and then the next line over says if your friend 's friend 's friend , someone you probably don 't even know , is ob@@ ese , your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher .
in addition , because obesity is not a un@@ ic@@ en@@ tric epidemic , there 's not a P@@ ati@@ ent Zero of the obesity epidemic -- if we find that guy , there was a spread of obesity out from him -- it 's a mul@@ tic@@ en@@ tric epidemic .
you 'd rather be D , on the edge of the network .
now , what is the point of this ?
this was created using raw materials from Earth .
today , you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure , create a bun@@ ch of micro@@ scope slides and have a trained person examine it .
there 's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find h@@ emo@@ zo@@ in .

one of the problems that you have if you 're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don 't know what 's the most effective thing to do .

something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
if Jo@@ e jumped in a coral ree@@ f , there are many things the alien could see .
here we have the extreme with dead cor@@ als , micro@@ b@@ ial sou@@ p and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
the cor@@ als are doing better here . lots of small fish .
if we get all of the fish of a coral ree@@ f together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the her@@ bi@@ vo@@ res , the par@@ rot@@ fish , the surge@@ on@@ fish that eat the algae .
when we went to pris@@ tine reefs , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this pyramid was in@@ ver@@ ted .
the top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like King@@ man Re@@ ef , which is now protected .
but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
if the world was a s@@ mar@@ ter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
I mean , it 's just a losing proposition .
for example , fac@@ toring quad@@ rati@@ cs with leading coefficients greater than one .
this is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
this is really destructive .
( la@@ ughter ) In all seriousness . here 's an example from a physics textbook .
I 'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
none of it 's a distr@@ actor , so we lose that .
we need more patient problem sol@@ vers . thank you . ( appl@@ ause )
it is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an am@@ us@@ ement park ...
and she said , " M@@ om , have you done this before ? "
because she knows that I adopted her and that I can 't have kids .
and then she got all caught up in the legs . " but how would the legs go , M@@ om ?
one , two , three , four , five .
KS : that was spectacular .
moderator : you played all of that by yourself .
now , how many of you in this room consider yourself a care@@ r ?
I am a former cared @@@ -@@ @ for patient myself .
in those situations , care@@ rs are also advocates for the patient .
there are currently more than 100 million care@@ rs providing 80 percent of care across Europe .
and this realization is allowing us to re @@@ -@@ @ conceptu@@ alize the way that we actually approach these diseases , by controlling an@@ gi@@ ogene@@ sis .
but what 's very cool is when we combine the two less potent te@@ as together , the combination , the blend , is more potent than either one alone .
if you take the ob@@ ese mouse and give it an an@@ gi@@ ogene@@ sis in@@ hibit@@ or , it loses weight .
stop the treatment , gains the weight back . restart the treatment , loses the weight .
best of all , I 'm healthier , I know that I 'm going to live longer , and I 've even lost a little weight .
we see beautiful beaches , cu@@ te animals , beautiful nature , cultural rites and stuff .
here we see , it says on the top , " Families in the world by income , " and we have the street represented just beneath it , you can see .
so let 's go there .
they look pretty much as we 're used to , right ?

coming to our group up here , similar shoes , Jordan , US .
it 's great stuff .

but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we 're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool .
very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of .
the other big issue is conformity .
there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
one is fast food , where everything is standardized .
( la@@ ughter ) It worked out for Eric , that 's all I 'm saying .

now , the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they 've learned how to copy themselves .
in other countries there is protection for our ar@@ tful designs . "
but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world , it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really in@@ effec@@ tual .

the retailers have kind of qu@@ ashed this notion though .
there 's a bun@@ ch of other industries that don 't have copyright protection , including the food industry .

we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
but when was the last time you worried about small@@ po@@ x , a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us ?
now , it 's interesting because there are 30 @@@ -@@ @ odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we 're still threatened by things like HIV and flu .
you took a path@@ ogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
in addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models .
so what we 've got is a situation .
what if that wild bird flies by again ?
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
so , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem .
it 's such a large conference .

if you presented it with a chess board , it tried to figure out what you might mean by that .
let 's just come down a bit and fly around .
and finally , I 'd like to leave you with a g@@ lim@@ pse that takes us back to the world of imagery .
we can grab elements off the front , where upon they re@@ anim@@ ate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here .
what do you think , what in your mind is the first kill@@ er app for this ?
ju : it 's been a great pleasure .
in reality , these animals have no terrestrial counterpart ; they 're unique in the world .
this was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shri@@ mp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
you have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end .
I actually jumped in and photograph@@ ed this , and with the fisher@@ man 's permission , I cut the tur@@ tle out , and it was able to swim free .

but anonym@@ ity basically allows people to say anything , all the rules gone .
and when you 've got that , you 've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money .
and it 's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
so that 's what we 're arguing about .
so below the ice , there 's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
and when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they em@@ it light at particular colors .
and the element hel@@ ium was discovered just by st@@ aring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
that 's a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
that 's quite an incredible prediction .
what happens when you have a star that 's right on the edge of that mass ?
and what it does is it suc@@ ks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the Chan@@ dra@@ se@@ k@@ har limit , and then it explo@@ des .

you only get one chance to make a first impression , and that 's true if you 're a robot as well as if you 're a person .
the first time that I met one of these robots was at a place called Wil@@ low Gar@@ age in 2008 .
and that was not a great first impression .
the thing that I learned about robots that day is that they kind of do their own thing , and they 're not totally aware of us .
and what I learned that day was that I had pretty high expectations for this little du@@ de .
he was not only supposed to be able to navigate the physical world , but also be able to navigate my social world -- he 's in my space ; it 's a personal robot .
they get new names .
when you drive your car , it feels like you are operating machinery .
in contrast , the genetic difference between HIV sub@@ types from different patients may be as much as 35 percent .

which means we 're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts , if at all .
this is based on ranges from data , but if you look at nuclear , it would be the size of Rho@@ de Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet .

when there was one boat , not much of an impact .
it turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right wh@@ ales in the summer time , and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision .

near and far , people gave their dollars , they gave their cents , they gave their hearts , they gave their spirit .
change @@@ -@@ @ making does not belong to one group of people ; it belongs to all of us .
do you have any advice during these current times ? "
be good to as many people as possible . "
the story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .
now what Ok@@ ol@@ lo@@ h did would not have been possible without digital technology .
I call it cognitive surplus .
that 's the second half of cognitive surplus .
and using cognitive surplus , we 're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific , literary , artistic , political efforts .
designing .
there are other candidates of course , but LO@@ L@@ cats will do as a general case .
freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
this is a graph from a paper by U@@ ri G@@ nee@@ zy and Al@@ do Rus@@ ti@@ ch@@ ini , who set out to test , at the beginning of this decade , what they called " deterrence theory . "
simple , straightforward , common@@ sen@@ sical -- also , largely un@@ tested .
and so they went and studied 10 day@@ care centers in Ha@@ ifa , Israel .
if you pick your k@@ id up more than 10 minutes late , we 're going to add a 10 she@@ kel fine to your bill .
and the minute they did that , the behavior in those day@@ care centers changed .
and you can see immediately what happened , right ?
researchers at the C@@ DC and other places have increasingly been linking sub@@ urban development patterns with se@@ d@@ ent@@ ary lifestyles .
and then there 's finally -- there 's the affordability question .
by 1980 , it had been sub@@ divided into a big m@@ all on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right .
I mean now we 're hoping we start to see it ; they 've already built City Hall , attracted two hotels .
so they 've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time .
but some of them were not wh@@ ale meat at all .
we had these data a few years ago .
in 1932 , that 's the picture .
this morning , the world 's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats , I think concluded that ultimately , the solution is , people shou@@ ld@@ n 't sit down .
they pointed out that , I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today , they will be steering cars by wire , without all that mechanical stuff .
( la@@ ughter ) That 's reas@@ suring .
every other form of transportation 's been improved .
the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wil@@ shire Bou@@ lev@@ ard , or Fifth Avenue , or Tokyo , or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their down@@ towns .
because technically I 've got motors ; I 've got wheels -- I 'm a motor vehicle .
and so I said , " S@@ ure . "
they learned to start with cell phones .
if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30 @@@ -@@ @ minute walk becomes 10 minutes .
if you need more resource , you just apply more computer .
so , with that , in turn , 20 million dollars today does this ; 20 years from now we 'll make Star Tre@@ k repl@@ ic@@ ators that make anything .
a farmer in a rural village -- a k@@ id needs to measure and modify the world , not just get information about it on a screen .
real invention is happening in these lab@@ s .
the only problem with that is it breaks everybody 's boundaries .
the real opportunity is to harness the inven@@ tive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems .
it breaks every organizational boundary we can think of .
we maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe .
why grow homes ? because we can .
we 've got Mc@@ People , Mc@@ Cars , Mc@@ Houses .
it is the landscape , right ?
we use a modified ink@@ jet printer , and we print geometry .
it could have been an English T@@ ud@@ or or Spanish Colonial , but we kind of chose this shape .
that 's why we grow homes . thanks very much .
the simple action of an individual raising a hand led many others to do the same .
for example , if even one fish sees a pre@@ dat@@ or and fle@@ es , this can alert many others to danger .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , honestly , I did@@ n 't mind a C + .
we know that humans are in@@ nat@@ ely innovative , because if we we@@ ren 't , we 'd all be using the same ar@@ ro@@ whe@@ ads that we were using 10,000 years ago .
be inclusive of our diversity -- the way we look , think and act .
they articulated what took us 20 years to identify .
for us , for me , it was about prioritizing children 's voices to give them the tools to help build a harmonious and sustainable world .
but it is not so .
some of them are artificial .
to begin with , artificial landscapes , which I invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time .
he did not know the mathematics ; it did@@ n 't yet exist .
could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new ?
mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
the equation is hidden there , z goes into z squ@@ ared , plus c .
and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different color@@ ings because some color@@ ings emphasize that , and others it is that or that .
thank you very much .
and I 'm thinking , no , this is not possible .
I think it 's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides .
a fifth of kids under two drinks so@@ da .
but I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long @@@ -@@ @ term at things like the food system and make change .
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
in the year 2007 , I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections .
that , I think , is movement .
this box contains one billion people .
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here .
and they will start to buy electric cars .
and they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation .
thank you very much .
to put that in context : more people visit the Ver@@ mont T@@ ed@@ dy Be@@ ar Factory each year than are followers of the J@@ ain religion in America .
( la@@ ughter ) Now , a couple of interesting things about N@@ ones are : there are a lot of us , and we ske@@ w young .
even if they did@@ n 't believe , they were hed@@ ging their bets .
women are still mi@@ stru@@ sted , sha@@ med , harmed and , in the worst cases , subjected to honor killings if they don 't ble@@ ed on their wedding night .
in Oslo , doctors are examining the hy@@ mens of young girls to reas@@ sure parents that their children are not ru@@ ined .
in Norwegian , it is even called " the vir@@ gin membrane . "
you may have wondered why we brought a h@@ ula ho@@ op on@@ stage today .
so if we wanted to do a vir@@ g@@ inity check on this ho@@ op right here , right now , that would be very easy .
it 's more like this -- a sc@@ run@@ ch@@ ie or a rubber band .
there is no vir@@ gin seal that mag@@ ically dis@@ appears after sex , and half of vir@@ g@@ ins can easily have sex without bleeding .
we wish we could say that by removing these my@@ ths , everything would be OK , that shame , harm and honor killings would all just disappear .
and that is much harder to change .
we want them to know that the hy@@ men can 't be used as a proof of vir@@ g@@ inity .
( la@@ ughter ) But how she answers that question is her choice .
this is the ocean as I used to know it .
and they can handle water .
they don 't have another thing they can do .
if you go to the Gulf and you look around , you do see a lot of oil .
parts of the ocean there look just absolutely ap@@ oc@@ aly@@ p@@ tic .
they 're finding that their world is really collap@@ sing .
there 's a lot you can 't see , also , underwater .
so this is the Gulf of Mexico ...
until you add a dispers@@ ant ...
these guys have to swim around through it .
he said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago ; like about a week ago , and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what 's going on .
that guide 's entire calendar year is cancel@@ ed bookings .
he said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dol@@ ph@@ in do that .
now , in the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez spill , about 30 percent of the kill@@ er wh@@ ales died in the first few months .
so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable .
I 'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water .
they get near shore -- Lo@@ ok at these two boats .
also , for all the sho@@ reline that has bo@@ oms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of sho@@ reline -- all of the sho@@ reline that has bo@@ oms , there 's adjacent sho@@ reline that do@@ es@@ n 't have any bo@@ oms .
it 's really , really important that we express our compassion .
( appl@@ ause ) Not just BP .
and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for , and who has gotten above the laws .
that 's certainly one of the things we need to do .
so I think that the oil bl@@ ow@@ out , the bank ba@@ il@@ out , the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause .
so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it 's our government safeguarding our interests , and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost .
now there 's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place , but the lob@@ by@@ ists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed .
so it 's a continued fight .
it 's a historic moment right now .
we 're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy .
people who sell us fossil fuels .
we 've been here before with energy , and people saying the economy CA@@ N@@ NOT withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery .
and that 's because they 're both designed to fit the human hand .
it 's an extraordinary phenomenon , but it 's true .
how does evolution do cumulative , comb@@ in@@ atorial things ?
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
it 's not confined to its own line@@ age .
no other animal does it .
as Adam Smith said , " No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . "
ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ ee troops have different cultures in different troops .
and why does exchange raise living standards ?
O@@ z takes one hour to make a spe@@ ar and two hours to make an ax@@ e .
he can make his own spe@@ ars and axes .
you render it down . you make a cand@@ le , etc. etc .
that 's what we 've achieved as a species .
but a modern tourist going around the palace of Ver@@ sa@@ ill@@ es and looking at Louis XIV 's pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
we 're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other 's living standards .
there 's no working for each other across the colonies .
and the reason for that is because there 's a reproductive division of labor .
it 's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
in all hun@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ ga@@ there@@ r societies today , there 's a for@@ aging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
it is@@ n 't always quite that simple , but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
and the man knows that he do@@ es@@ n 't have to do any dig@@ ging to get roots .
they were a highly cooperative species .
they were a highly intelligent species .
you also see seas@@ hel@@ ls -- as discovered by a team here in Oxford -- moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and speci@@ alize ?
he 's totally wrong about this one .
it was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
who 's going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
he is a bridge figure .
he finds a local sporting team .
and it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
the concept centers on something called the No@@ or stones .
in a world like that , they 'll always be a job for Super@@ man and The 99 .
or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here ?
or have they got longer lives and live up there ?
and the richest 20 percent , they take out of that about 74 percent .
you have to train health staff . you have to educate the population .
there are some web pages like this , you know , but they take some nour@@ ishment down from the databases , but people put prices on them , stupid passwords and b@@ oring statistics .
we have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here .
we need really to see it .
the first one was actually a funeral -- to be more precise , a re@@ burial .
it basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size .
now the total planet number in our solar system was nine .
in the next 15 years , almost 500 planets were discovered or@@ biting other stars , with different methods .
but the statistical result is loud and clear .
so the question is : what do we do next ?
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different bio@@ chem@@ i@@ stries wherever we find them ?
and so , that 's what we are trying to do .
so why should you care about that ?
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that un@@ fol@@ ds the cor@@ te@@ x , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .
it only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .
and the great thing about it is that we 've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about " disappear . "
and also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heigh@@ ten the experience that you 're having , in real time .
now bl@@ ink left to turn back left .
but I saw parents on social media reaching out to other parents , asking if their au@@ ti@@ stic children could play together .
and they would tell these kids , some as young as six years old , that society do@@ es@@ n 't want them , and their own parents never wanted a broken child , so they should just kill themselves .
but I think that kids should not be punished , they should be talked to .
but we know we can 't treat people equally to do that .
so I went to his a@@ unt , who is the contact that I have for him .
the celebr@@ ant got some of the facts wrong , and it made me really angry .
do you know how you want to be remembered ?
how many of you have a will ?
we wondered : does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one ?
even up to a year later , American parents were more likely to express negative emotions , as compared to their French counterparts .
thank you .
and I brought women into the laboratory , and I asked them , " Which one would you pick ? "
I 'm sorry to have a sad slide like this , but not everything is all that happy , especially in my work .
but lo and behold , I 'm one of the high @@@ -@@ @ end individuals .
and as you know , there 's been a very weak response , up until recently , to actually collect the oil .
it 's gotten much more aggressive .
and we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture .
that 's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects .
but my bad dreams go like this .
and what I 'd like to talk to you today about , a little bit , is really transforming the relationship , or the inter@@ play , between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet .
mountain ranges , plate tec@@ ton@@ ics , moves the continents around , forms ore deposits .
all of them interact with one another .
that 's one of the themes that Syl@@ via reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
and many of you remember the early stages of oce@@ an@@ ography , when we had to use what we had at our fin@@ g@@ erti@@ ps .
we will be present throughout the volume of the ocean , at will , communicating in real time .
and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites .
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species .
the way this works is that our mon@@ keys normally live in a kind of big zo@@ o social enclosure .
most of the mon@@ keys went with guys who had better food .
people are a little risk @@@ -@@ @ a@@ verse . so what ?
many , many people have died on Mt . E@@ ve@@ rest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the moun@@ taine@@ ers and then bring them down the mountain .
and to the right hand side of us was this great K@@ hum@@ b@@ u Gl@@ ac@@ ier .
and luc@@ k@@ ily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gas@@ p of air .
and I don 't where I got it from , but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake .
and I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt . E@@ ve@@ rest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly .
when I was born , the world 's population was 3.5 billion people .
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri .
now , if you get a Ph.D. , and you decide not to teach , you don 't always end up in a place like this .
so I did it : I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps .
population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet , and right now , it 's a simple " not equal . "
how is a consumer going to walk through this minefi@@ eld ?
it 's got to be something we all care about .
we need Co@@ ke to work with P@@ ep@@ si .
so , the where : we 've identified 35 places globally that we need to work .
why is 25 percent important ?
by companies asking for this , we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .
in sal@@ mon aquaculture , we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago .
three of the original eight entities were su@@ ing each other .
so it 's the demand that brings them to the table .
the good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago .
and in the next 18 months , we will have signed up to work with another 40 , and we think we 'll get those signed as well .
why is Car@@ g@@ ill important ?
that 's not insignificant .
what they 've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance , they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa on 40 percent of the land .
these companies have begun to think differently .
but when we looked at their genes , it turns out that what they wanted to eat was the food we were already feeding them .
I mean , honestly , that is all speculation , but the only thing I know for certain is that there are a hundred billion billion bil@@ l@@ lion living micro@@ b@@ ial cells underlying all the world 's oceans .
there was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from Ma Bell .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) There is one corner , by the way , that I 'm not going to tell anybody about , where the WiFi actually works .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
I 'll give you one very dramatic example of this , a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
( la@@ ughter ) He had no idea what that was .
they actually make us worse off .
and , you know , it happens for several reasons .
we don 't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed .
in Niger , one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth .
well , it just so happens , at that time , there was a group in Connecticut called the Ni@@ antic Community Church Group in Connecticut .
he@@ if@@ er sent two go@@ ats to Africa .
they sold the milk for cash .
turns out that it 's a failed irrigation project .
one year , all the chick@@ ens died , and no one wanted to put the chick@@ ens in there .
join the movement .
feel hap@@ pier and help save the world .
and there was a huge row online about , " He@@ y , this can 't be real . "
now , this tech incorporates three big elements .
this is Dim@@ it@@ ri .
now , you notice he 's sitting .
you 're actually sculp@@ ting a human being here .
you stand up , and you sk@@ im the stone .
it 's that simple .
and notice two of them are wearing head@@ scar@@ ves , and yes , even they can laugh .
then he opened it up . " born in Iran ? wait . "
I said , " Well , he 's passed away , but his name was K@@ hos@@ ro . "
I want to ro@@ b a bank in a film , but do it with a gun , not with a bomb stra@@ pped around me , right ?
that 's what I try and show in my stand @@@ -@@ @ up , good people everywhere .
they have these G@@ low@@ C@@ aps which flash and email you and do cool things to remind you to take your medicine .
the eye is exquis@@ itely sensitive to patterns in variations in color , shape and pattern .
should I take vitamin C ? should I be taking whe@@ at@@ grass ?
so you can immediately ap@@ prehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity , but you can also , if you grade the evidence , do a " worth it " line .
so the data is now alive ; this is a living image , and I can update it in a second .
their entire camp , every item of gear , was fer@@ ried 8@@ 85 miles from Mc@@ Mur@@ do Station , the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica .
so you have living din@@ osa@@ urs and space aliens , animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions .
it 's not an animal we draw carto@@ ons of or draw at all .
and this should be presented fac@@ tually , straight@@ for@@ war@@ dly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
the reason I 've taken this time is I 've been fasc@@ inated to hear some of the reactions to this .
another review@@ er called it " hil@@ arious . "
I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignor@@ ant of other faiths .
question : was domes@@ tic@@ ation good for sheep ?
here 's what he said : " ten thousand years ago , at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebr@@ ate land@@ mass . "
life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet .
and it turns the mouse into M@@ igh@@ ty M@@ ouse , makes it fear@@ less , so it runs out in the open , where it 'll be eaten by a cat .
first of all , the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is -- it 's to bring purpose to the lives of millions , and he has succeeded .
there are lots of people out there who don 't have purpose in their life , and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal .
yes .
I wish he could do this with a revision , a Mark 2 version of his book .
well , the sense of which I agree with him , except I think it has an evolutionary explanation .
it 's an old move .
bap@@ tize them in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , and teach them to do everything I 've told you . ' " the Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world .
I am helpl@@ ess over this . "
the oil industry is like a huge , gig@@ antic oc@@ top@@ us of engineering and finance and everything else , but we actually see it in very moral terms .
this is an early @@@ -@@ @ on photograph -- you can see , we had these g@@ ush@@ ers .
early journalists looked at these sp@@ ills , and they said , " This is a fil@@ thy industry . "
and we 've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CE@@ Os .
we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves ; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf .
I mean , we 've essentially been exporting oil sp@@ ills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations .
apart from shared experiences , trial and error , conventional farming extension services are boots on the ground and radio -- expensive and hard to scale in the face of population growth .
by the end of this year , we 'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions .
and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for por@@ n on the Web , it 's very few .
we have focused on the worst @@@ -@@ @ case scenario .
but we 've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff .
and actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it 's also part of the good news .
it 's a very important period -- it 's roughly half the period when we 've been fully modern humans on the planet .
the system suddenly , very surprisingly , loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover .
the yellow do@@ t in the middle here is our starting point , the pre @@@ -@@ @ industrial point , where we 're very safely in the safe operating space .
under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the Australian Great Barri@@ er Re@@ ef Authority and scientists that the Great Barri@@ er Re@@ ef is doomed under the current governance regime .
but again , a crisis , new partnerships , actors locally , transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning .
you solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector , while at the same time , stimulating innovation -- examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level .
and these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel .
and what I mostly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me .
I 've had hundreds of people tell me what they don 't want to feel .
( la@@ ughter ) Only dead people never get stressed , never get broken hearts , never experience the disappointment that comes with failure .
these are essential skills for us , our families , our communities .
it costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid .
but then let 's go up from there .
what 's holding them back from supplying that demand ?
everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal .
and then because you 've felt that satisfaction , you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary .
( silence ) Ex@@ ac@@ tly ! well done .
and I wanted to join that team .
Earth observation satellites .
these stories that I 've shared with you all illustrate that space truly is useful for sustainable development for the benefit of all peoples .
it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet .
and what you 're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon .
the Ar@@ mill@@ aria is actually a pre@@ datory fun@@ gu@@ s , killing certain species of trees in the forest .
the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection .
and aside from coral , the answer is no .
and then , you might have heard of this giant cl@@ am that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old .
they contain thousands of years of their own hi@@ stories within themselves , and they also contain records of natural and human events .
and it actually never sh@@ eds those leaves , so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom .
so , now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet .
but what 's unique about it is that it 's doing DNA repair below freezing .
and what that means is that it 's not dor@@ man@@ t -- it 's actually been living and growing for half a million years .
well , that 's kind of an obvious statement up there .
I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi .
( la@@ ughter ) The second thing he said was that , " If children have interest , then education happens . "
at that time , a large amount of money had come into New@@ castle University to improve schooling in India .
they said , " We look at it every day . "
I asked that girl , " W@@ ould you teach them enough biotechnology to pass ? "
I said , " No , use the method of the grand@@ mother . "
I said , " Well , what you 've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time .
so , having experi@@ mented in all sorts of remote places , I came to the most remote place that I could think of .
each group of four can use one computer and not four computers . "
remember , from the H@@ ole in the Wall .
you can go to another group , peer over their shoulders , see what they 're doing , come back to you own group and claim it as your own work . "
and I explained to them that , you know , a lot of scientific research is done using that method .
the teachers said , " Is this deep learning ? "
( la@@ ughter ) The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time , sitting in their homes , one day in a week .
( video ) Teacher : you can 't catch me .
teacher : I 'm the g@@ ing@@ erb@@ read man .
you know , stuff which I don 't know anything about .
after watching eight TE@@ D@@ Tal@@ ks , he wants to become Leon@@ ardo da V@@ inc@@ i .
( la@@ ughter ) ( Appl@@ ause ) It 's pretty simple stuff .
this is what I 'm building now -- they 're called sol@@ es : self Organized Learning Environ@@ ments .
if they want , they can call the gran@@ ny cloud .
the mediator is from P@@ une , India .
so how far can we go ? one last little bit and I 'll stop .
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year @@@ -@@ @ old students .
I started writing English questions on the black@@ board .
there was silence for a while , then they said , " You 've spelled it wrong .
and then , in 20 minutes , the right @@@ -@@ @ ang@@ led tri@@ angles began to appear on the screens .
but in the meanwhile , there is a method available .
I would say with a great smile , " I will definitely pass . "
so it went on like that , and I did@@ n 't know where else to find myself .
and then school also started supporting me .
so it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school .
and one of those competitions , I just won a small , little transi@@ stor Philips radio .
I said , " It 's a prize from [ an ] art competition . "
I think you should study in a school of art .
and that fasc@@ inated me , to explore that territory .
so this is called " Self In Progress . "
this is the trace of fire , this is the trace of sun .
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
you know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin , and this is the second , and there 's a third , and each creates a meaning .
and he turned to me , and he said , " Car@@ ne , you have to be very cle@@ ver to be a diplomat . "
and as those numbers suggest , I was induc@@ ted into an elite and fascinating and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating world .
I wanted to be an ambassador , and my ment@@ ors , my heroes , people who got to the top of my profession , and here I was throwing it all away .
but one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots , which went on for several days , took place -- was because the Kosovo people were dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised from their own future .
and it 's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump .
that means the power of others things is rising .
we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world .
but I want to be clear , just as the religious Re@@ formation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the pri@@ es@@ thood ; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance .
so I 'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean .
and we 've got it worked out , and we can say , " Yes , CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now . "
then there was similar mortality in ' 97@@ - ' 98 .
so these events in our recent past really are unique .
and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it .
that the place where , during an earthquake in 1954 , this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly , and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .
it 's 11 meters in diameter , and we know that it started growing in the year 15@@ 84 .
you can see there 's some signals there .
you know , we 're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
so one of the things we 're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabol@@ ic energy to build and maintain their shells .
so , Char@@ lie Ver@@ on came up with this statement last year : " the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release . "
so , let 's explore .
it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two .
and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear .
and it 's important to note that it 's not just the stars who are benefiting : because you can see the best , everyone can learn .
invite the crowd , let in the light , dial up the desire .
ok@@ ay , step back a minute .
even he said that , and he would know .
it 's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation .
video is high @@@ -@@ @ bandwidth for a reason .
here , let me introduce you to Sam Hab@@ er .
face @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ face communication has been fine @@@ -@@ @ tun@@ ed by millions of years of evolution .
that 's what 's made it into this mysterious , powerful thing it is .

now , TED is just a small part of this .
schools can 't be si@@ los .
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy .
so , no matter how at@@ y@@ pical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
and in @@@ -@@ @ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of med@@ itative quiet in bed .
and this spreads on out end@@ lessly into a distance .
but what I 'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic , but also actually early detection of an epidemic .
the epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left , over here .
( music ) Than@@ k you . thank you .
in the Netherlands -- where I come from -- you actually never see a pig , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pigs .
in the bre@@ wing process , there 's lots of clou@@ dy elements in the beer , so to get rid of these clou@@ dy elements , what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gel@@ atin si@@ eve in order to get rid of that clou@@ d@@ iness .
so it 's not an accident that a great flow@@ ering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee .
that 's really where innovation happens .
so they want to tell the story of the eu@@ re@@ ka moment .
about a decade or two ago , a wonderful schol@@ ar named How@@ ard G@@ ru@@ ber went back and looked at Dar@@ win 's note@@ books from this period .
and what G@@ ru@@ ber found was that Dar@@ win had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epi@@ ph@@ any reading Mal@@ thus in October of 18@@ 38 .
and then someone says , " These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community . "

what 's in that information ?
if we take many images of many sl@@ ices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three @@@ -@@ @ dimensional image .
and so I think we 're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuro@@ science : how are the bra@@ ins of men and women different ?
girls ' bra@@ ins are like sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti ; everything in their life is connected to everything else .
and a ne@@ ur@@ on , well , that 's smaller than brain .
it 's absurd .
likewise , every connec@@ t@@ ome changes over time .
what kinds of changes happen ?
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connec@@ t@@ ome -- an idea that you may find empowering .
and if you 'll allow me to asc@@ end to met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical heights , I will remind you that ne@@ ural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuro@@ scientists think -- of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
well , I propose a direct test .
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connec@@ tom@@ es .
but it won 't be easy , because they 're not going to look like this .
( la@@ ughter ) What a m@@ ess -- have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this ?
one figure for that : 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition .
this is a picture I took in 2005 , walking on Fri@@ days over the hills in Kabul , and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation .

these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
and we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty .
what do they like to eat ?
that 's the closest you 'll probably ever get .
and from our data that gets collected , when that tag comes back , because a fish@@ er returns it for a thousand @@@ -@@ @ dollar reward , we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now , on a back@@ b@@ oned animal .
both the electronic tags I 'm talking about are expensive .
we 're going to do something that in recent years we 've started : take a m@@ uc@@ us sample .

they 're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
they 're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Pol@@ es .
what we rely on is not an incomplete system .

( la@@ ughter ) So here 's a series of projects over the last few years where I 've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection .
sometimes they 're very , very simple things .
and I promise you , if you take that walk inside Google Stree@@ t@@ view , you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face .
and I collected those moments -- the photos inside Google Stree@@ t@@ view and the memories , specifically .
it had ' Chad ' written in magic marker on it .
he died long after he left the pil@@ low at my house , but we never got around to returning it . "
so I thought , " Well let 's just give it a try .
it can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person 's life and , in short to love .
because as that happens , I think we can feel free to interact in a way that 's more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
so because of having cooked food , it 's easier to dig@@ est .
it 's a very big signal ; it 's sent to the brain says , " Go and eat . "
we have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward , as you know .
actually , what happens is that a very intr@@ icate structure appears .
every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe .
and what happens next ?
( la@@ ughter ) No , but it 's true : the Internet has changed the world .
they are shaping our very desires .
and here we are now .
the length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
and that 's why I call it a transform@@ ational innovation .
here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot .
time taken for moving a molec@@ ule to marketplace , after all the human and animal testing , was 10 years , now it is 15 years .
p@@ s@@ ori@@ asis is very dre@@ ad@@ ful disease of the skin .
and therefore , the standard process , where you develop a molec@@ ule , put it into m@@ ice , into men , are not yielding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent .
and basically , what I 'd like to tell you is that power is changing , and there are two types of changes I want to discuss .
what happened ? the Industrial Revolution , which meant that all of a sudden , Europe and America became the dominant center of the world .
to understand power diffusion put this in your mind : computing and communications costs have fallen a thous@@ and@@ fold between 1970 and the beginning of this century .
but to make it more real , if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power , you could buy a car today for five dollars .
so in 1970 , if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasi@@ lia and anywhere simultaneously , you could do it .
so let me step back and ask : what 's power ?
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what I call soft power .
it 's not whose army wins ; it 's also whose story wins .
history is not linear .
and that 's the good news I have . we can do that .
the who and the why are what 's important to me .
but what if we eat only in the green list ?
we have rav@@ aged our Earth and then used the food that we 've sourced to handic@@ ap ourselves in more ways than one .
while we try to manage declining marine populations , the media 's recommending increased consumption of seafood .
this is what the green list says .
new industries are created , new tasks have to be done and that means often new roles have to be filled .
they 've fallen for the intelligence myth , the belief that machines have to copy the way that human beings think and reason in order to out@@ perform them .
but if human beings can 't explain themselves , the tasks are called non @@@ -@@ @ routine , and they 're thought to be out reach .
yes , the lump of work might get bigger and change , but as machines become more capable , it 's likely that they 'll take on the extra lump of work themselves .
solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways .
now if we look at what 's going on in someone 's head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring .
I don 't know what 's inside them until I open them .
and in the end , it 's this word , " engagement , " that I want to leave you with .
so you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s , when I was seven or eight years old , watching Jacques Cou@@ ste@@ au document@@ aries on the living room floor with my mask and f@@ lip@@ pers on .
but when I got there , I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .
I needed to head towards conservation goals .
but before I do , I just want you to pon@@ der this graph for a moment .
but the ocean @@@ -@@ @ protected area is basically flat line until right about now -- it appears to be tic@@ king up .
but s@@ cu@@ ba diving , subm@@ er@@ si@@ bles and all the work that we 're setting about to do here will help rectify that .
they 're very low to the water , and they 're all un@@ inhabited , except one island has about 35 care@@ tak@@ ers on it .
and we finished our trip .
you can see the Islands -- there are eight islands -- that pop out of the water .
in the west we have the Gil@@ bert Islands .
in the center we have the Pho@@ eni@@ x Islands , which is the subject that I 'm talking about .
and when I was first going up there , I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago , and people would ask me , " Why are you going to this place called Kiribati ? "
he co@@ ined the term " reverse fishing license . "
what we may need is a transformation from today 's system that largely ca@@ res for the sick , to a system that ca@@ res for the healthy .
to change our current " sick care " approach into a true " health care " approach .
in 2012 , 50 percent of all Americans had a single chronic disease , resulting in 86 percent of the $ 3 trillion US health care budget being spent for treating such chronic diseases .
this may work for solar farms , but when you think of buildings , of streets , of architecture , aesthe@@ tics does matter .
the resulting thin layer is the active layer , absorbing the energy of the sun .
and it 's semi @@@ -@@ @ transparent .
I hope organic photo@@ volta@@ ics will be a big part of this .
let me give you an example .
it 's a pretty simple conceptual framework .
if our predictions match our observations , great ! -- we got it right , so we can make further predictions by changing this or that aspect of the model .
( la@@ ughter ) But then something amazing happened .
because nothing worth doing is easy .
so those who fall a little behind find it near impossible to ever catch up and appreciate that beauty .
but why is this a problem ?
it 's clear that while we have demand for mathematics skills rapidly increasing , supply is in steady decline .
to put things in perspective , half of the students completing high school today in Australia are not prepared to understand any argument about rates of change in data .
there , you see it now , right ?
we need to put an end to high @@@ -@@ @ stakes tests and instead follow a ma@@ stery @@@ -@@ @ based learning approach .
and most of them don 't .
for instance , they found that incenti@@ vi@@ zing students for inputs , like effort , worked a lot better than incenti@@ vi@@ zing for outputs , like test scores .
I immediately got excited about the possibilities of implementing this in our program .
but once the excitement settled down , there were a few concerns that cre@@ pt in our minds .
( la@@ ughter ) Second@@ ly , how would we fund this thing ?
so it 's practically n@@ au@@ ght .
so , from a purely economic point of view : if we don 't use immediate incentives , we are under@@ investing in student outcomes .
she said to me , " M@@ o ...
in fact , as our user base has grown , we found the percentage to be pretty steady , at around 75 percent .
there is a reason we keep going down one rab@@ bit hole after another , even when we know it 's going to make us feel worse .
one of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to ide@@ alize the person who broke it .
none of us is immune to heart@@ break .
it 's like " Love , Ac@@ tually " meets " The F@@ ast and the Fu@@ rious . "
heart@@ break is a complex psychological injury .
you 'll be more present with your friends , more engaged with your family , not to mention the billions of dollars of compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided .
this is , like , half the total spent on education in the US .
they could trust their colleagues .
and so we built it .
and there 's a helpful , friendly square that push@@ es the ball up the hill , and then a mean triangle push@@ es the ball back down .
even greater pain than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself .
this creates a beautiful fairness circle .
so if fairness is a key@@ stone of life , why is@@ n 't every leader making it their priority ?
w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n 't it be nice to be able to kno@@ ck on the door of a Chief F@@ air@@ ness Officer ?
promoting the guy who did@@ n 't finish high school was a risk .
whether worn by refugees or world @@@ -@@ @ changing entrepreneurs , when people are allowed the freedom to present themselves in a manner that celebrates their own unique identities , a magical thing happens .
