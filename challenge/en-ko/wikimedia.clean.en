The public mask app is an application created to effectively manage the inventory supply and demand of public masks and inventory quantities by locations in the process of distributing public masks after the coronavirus pandemic .
It was released on March 10 , 2020
Background
During the first two months after the first patient was discovered in January 2020 , there was a serious shortage of masks in Korea . Between January 28 and February 21 , 2020 , the online sales price of the KF94 mask rose 10 times from about 300 won to 3,000 won . Citizens across the country suffered the lack of masks .
Citizen developers ( citizen hackers ) proposed the government to disclose the pharmacy 's public mask inventory data to the public . The government accepted the proposal and soon launched a task @-@ force team to open data and the API to enable anyone to create a face mask @-@ related service .

In the C + + programming language , new and delete are a pair of language constructs that perform dynamic memory allocation , object construction and object destruction . [ 1 ]
Overview
where p is a previously declared pointer of type T ( or some other type to which a T pointer can be assigned , such as a superclass of T ) .
The default constructor for T , if any , is called to construct a T instance in the allocated memory buffer .
calls a single @-@ argument T constructor instead of the default constructor when initializing the newly allocated buffer .
A different variant allocates arrays of objects rather than single objects :
This requests a memory buffer from the free store that is large enough to hold a contiguous array of N objects of type T , contiguously , and calls the default constructor on each elements of the array .
Memory allocated with the new [ ] must be deallocated with the delete [ ] operator , rather than delete . Using the inappropriate form results in undefined behavior .
C + + compilers are not required to generate a diagnostic message for using the wrong form .
The C + + 11 standard specifies an additional syntax ,
that initializes each p [ i ] to initializeri .
Overloading
Relation to malloc and free
In contrast to the C routines , which allow growing or shrinking an allocated array with realloc , it is not possible to change the size of a memory buffer allocated by new [ ] .
The C + + standard library instead provides a dynamic array that can be extended or reduced in its std : : vector template class .

Linux startup process is the multi @-@ stage initialization process performed during booting a Linux installation . It is in many ways similar to the BSD and other Unix @-@ style boot processes , from which it derives .
Overview
Early stages of the Linux startup process depend very much on the computer architecture .
On shutdown , all init is called to close down all user space functionality in a controlled manner . The init then terminates and the kernel executes its own shutdown .
Boot loader phase
In UEFI systems , a payload , such as the Linux kernel , can be executed directly . Thus no boot loader is necessary . Below is a summary of some popular boot loaders :
SYSLINUX / ISOLINUX is a boot loader that specializes in booting full Linux installations from FAT filesystems . It is often used for boot or rescue floppy discs , live USBs , and other lightweight boot systems . ISOLINUX is generally used by Linux live CDs and bootable install CDs .
Kernel loading stage
Kernel startup stage
According to Red Hat , the detailed kernel process at this stage is therefore summarized as follows : [ 1 ]
At this point , with interrupts enabled , the scheduler can take control of the overall management of the system , to provide pre @-@ emptive multi @-@ tasking , and the init process is left to continue booting the user environment in user space .
Early user space
This applies to SysV @-@ style init .
The developers of systemd aimed to replace the Linux init system inherited from UNIX System V and Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) operating systems . Like init , systemd is a daemon that manages other daemons .
All daemons , including systemd , are background processes .
Systemd is the first daemon to start ( during booting ) and the last daemon to terminate ( during shutdown ) .
Systemd is also capable of aggressive parallelization .
Upstart operates asynchronously ; it handles starting of the tasks and services during boot and stopping them during shutdown , and also supervises the tasks and services while the system is running .
Runit features parallelization of the start up of system services , which can speed up the boot time of the operating system . [ 14 ]

Even if the type and nature of a rootkit is known , manual repair may be impractical , while re @-@ installing the operating system and applications is safer , simpler and quicker . [ 85 ]
Public availability
Like much malware used by attackers , many rootkit implementations are shared and are easily available on the Internet . It is not uncommon to see a compromised system in which a sophisticated , publicly available rootkit hides the presence of unsophisticated worms or attack tools apparently written by inexperienced programmers . [ 24 ]
Defenses
New secure boot specifications like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface have been designed to address the threat of bootkits , but even these are vulnerable if the security features they offer are not utilized . [ 50 ]

modprobe is a Linux program originally written by Rusty Russell and used to add a loadable kernel module ( LKM ) to the Linux kernel or to remove a LKM from the kernel . It is commonly used indirectly : udev relies upon modprobe to load drivers for automatically detected hardware . [ citation needed ]
As of 2014 [ update ] modprobe is distributed as part of the software package " kmod " [ 1 ] ( maintained by Lucas De Marchi and others ) . It was previously developed as :
" module @-@ init @-@ tools , " [ 2 ] for Linux kernel version 2.6 and later ( maintained by Jon Masters and others ) " modutils " [ 3 ] for use with Linux versions 2.2.x and 2.4.x. .
Operation
The modprobe program offers more full @-@ featured " Swiss @-@ army @-@ knife " features than the more basic insmod and rmmod utilities , with the following benefits :
If invoked with no switches , the program by default adds / inserts / installs the named module into the kernel . Root privileges are typically required for these changes .
Any arguments appearing after the module name are passed to the kernel ( in addition to any options listed in the configuration file ) .
In some versions of modprobe , the configuration file is called modprobe.conf , and in others the equivalent is the collection of files called < modulename > in the / etc / modprobe.d directory .
Features
Blacklist
There are cases where two or more modules both support the same devices , or a module invalidly claims to support a device : the blacklist keyword indicates that all of a particular module 's internal aliases are to be ignored . [ 4 ]
There are two ways to blacklist a module using modprobe , employing the modprobe.conf system , the first is to use its blacklisting system in / etc / modprobe.d / blacklist :
An install primitive is the highest priority in the config file and will be used instead of the blacklisting method above , requiring this second method :
Alternately , you can modify / etc / modprobe.conf :

In computing , a loadable kernel module ( or LKM ) is an object file that contains code to extend the running kernel , or so @-@ called base kernel , of an operating system .
LKMs are typically used to add support for new hardware ( as device drivers ) and / or filesystems , or for adding system calls .
When the functionality provided by a LKM is no longer required , it can be unloaded in order to free memory and other resources .
Advantages
Disadvantages
Implementations in different operating systems
Binary compatibility
Other operating systems , such as Solaris , FreeBSD , OS X , and Windows keep the kernel API and ABI relatively stable , thus avoiding this problem . For example , FreeBSD kernel modules compiled against kernel version 6.0 will work without recompilation on any other FreeBSD 6.x version , e.g. 6.4 . However , they are not compatible with other major versions and must be recompiled for use with FreeBSD 7.x , as API and ABI compatibility is maintained only within a branch .
Security
While loadable kernel modules are a convenient method of modifying the running kernel , this can be abused by attackers on a compromised system to prevent detection of their processes or files , allowing them to maintain control over the system .
Many rootkits make use of LKMs in this way . Note that on most operating systems modules do not help privilege elevation in any way , as elevated privilege is required to load a LKM ; they merely make it easier for the attacker to hide the break @-@ in . [ 8 ]

Design
Smack consists of three components :
A kernel module that is implemented as a Linux Security Module . It works best with file systems that support extended attributes . A startup script that ensures that device files have the correct Smack attributes and loads the Smack configuration .
A set of patches to the GNU Core Utilities package to make it aware of Smack extended file attributes . A set of similar patches to Busybox were also created .

Smack has been criticized for being written as a new LSM module instead of an SELinux security policy which can provide equivalent functionality . Such SELinux policies have been proposed , but none had been demonstrated .
Smack 's author replied that it would not be practical due to SELinux 's complicated configuration syntax and the philosophical difference between Smack and SELinux designs . [ 10 ]

There are several implementations of buffer overflow protection , including those for the GNU Compiler Collection , LLVM , Microsoft Visual Studio , and other compilers .
Overview
There are three types of canaries in use : terminator , random , and random XOR . Current versions of StackGuard support all three , while ProPolice supports terminator and random canaries .
In this way , once the canary or the control data is clobbered , the canary value is wrong . Random XOR canaries are random canaries that are XOR scrambled using all or part of the control data .
Bounds checking is a compiler @-@ based technique that adds run @-@ time bounds information for each allocated block of memory , and checks all pointers against those at run @-@ time .
For C and C + + , bounds checking can be performed at pointer calculation time [ 4 ] or at dereference time . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
StackGuard and ProPolice cannot protect against overflows in automatically allocated structures that overflow into function pointers .
ProPolice at least will rearrange the allocation order to get such structures allocated before function pointers . A separate mechanism for pointer protection was proposed in PointGuard [ 28 ] and is available on Microsoft Windows . [ 29 ]
Microsoft Visual Studio
The compiler suite from Microsoft implements buffer overflow protection since version 2003 through the / GS command @-@ line switch , which is enabled by default since version 2005 . [ 30 ] Using / GS- disables the protection .
A canary example
Normal buffer allocation for x86 architectures and other similar architectures is shown in the buffer overflow entry . Here , we will show the modified process as it pertains to StackGuard .
By overwriting RETA , the function can be made to execute other code ( when it attempts to return ) , either existing functions ( ret2libc ) or code written into the stack during the overflow .
Details
This is a common vulnerability because format bugs were previously thought harmless and resulted in vulnerabilities in many common tools .
MITRE 's CVE project lists roughly 500 vulnerable programs as of June 2007 , and a trend analysis ranks it the 9th most @-@ reported vulnerability type between 2001 and 2006 . [ 2 ]
Format string bugs can occur in other programming languages besides C , although they appear with less frequency and usually cannot be exploited to execute code of the attacker 's choice . [ 3 ]
Prevention
Many compilers can statically check format strings and produce warnings for dangerous or suspect formats .
In the GNU Compiler Collection , the relevant compiler flags are , -Wall , -Wformat , -Wno @-@ format @-@ extra @-@ args , -Wformat @-@ security , -Wformat @-@ nonliteral , and -Wformat = 2 . [ 9 ]

Limitations
Where code is written and executed at runtime - a JIT compiler is a prominent example - the compiler can potentially be used to produce exploit code ( e.g. using JIT Spray ) that has been flagged for execution and therefore would not be trapped . [ 12 ] [ 13 ]

OS implementations
Many operating systems implement or have an available executable space protection policy . Here is a list of such systems in alphabetical order , each with technologies ordered from newest to oldest .
A technology supplying Architecture Independent emulation will be functional on all processors which aren 't hardware supported . The " Other Supported " line is for processors which allow some grey @-@ area method , where an explicit NX bit doesn 't exist yet hardware allows one to be emulated in some way .
As of Android 2.3 and later , architectures which support it have non @-@ executable pages by default , including non @-@ executable stack and heap . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
IA @-@ 32
For systems that lack NX hardware , the 32 @-@ bit kernels now provide an approximation of the NX CPU feature via software emulation that can help block many exploits an attacker might run from stack or heap memory .
Non @-@ execute functionality has also been present for other non @-@ x86 processors supporting this functionality for many releases .
Exec Shield allows these controls to be set for both binary executables and for libraries ; if an executable loads a library requiring a given restriction relaxed , the executable will inherit that marking and have that restriction relaxed .
The PaX NX technology can emulate NX functionality , or use a hardware NX bit .
PaX works on x86 CPUs that do not have the NX bit , such as 32 @-@ bit x86 . The Linux kernel still does not ship with PaX ( as of May , 2007 ) ; the patch must be merged manually .
PaX provides two methods of NX bit emulation , called SEGMEXEC and PAGEEXEC .
SEGMEXEC does not cause programs to use more system memory ( i.e. RAM ) , it only restricts how much they can access .
On 32 @-@ bit CPUs , this becomes 1.5 GB rather than 3 GB .
PAGEEXEC SEGMEXEC mprotect ( ) restrictions Trampoline emulation Randomized executable base Randomized mmap ( ) base
PaX ignores both PT _ GNU _ STACK and PT _ GNU _ HEAP . In the past , PaX had a configuration option to honor these settings but that option has been removed for security reasons , as it was deemed not useful .
Windows
When NX is supported , it is enabled by default . Windows allows programs to control which pages disallow execution through its API as well as through the section headers in a PE file . In the API , runtime access to the NX bit is exposed through the Win32 API calls VirtualAlloc [ Ex ] and VirtualProtect [ Ex ] .
API
The program stack in foo ( ) with various inputs :
A. - Before data is copied .
B. - " hello " is the first command line argument .
C. - " A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ A ​ \ x08 ​ \ x35 ​ \ xC0 ​ \ x80 " is the first command line argument .
The attacker can also modify internal variable values to exploit some bugs . With this example :
Platform related differences
Stacks that grow up
Over the years a number of schemes have been developed to inhibit malicious stack buffer overflow exploitation . These may usually be classified into three categories :
Nonexecutable stack
Randomization

The Linux API is composed out of the System Call Interface of the Linux kernel , the GNU C Library ( by GNU ) , libdrm , libalsa and libevdev ( by freedesktop.org ) .
The GNU C Library is a wrapper around the system calls of the Linux kernel .
The Linux kernel and GNU C Library together form the Linux API . After compilation , the binaries offer an ABI .
Released under the GNU Lesser General Public License , glibc is free software .
History
The Glibc project was initially written mostly by Roland McGrath , working for the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) in the 1980s .
In February 1988 , FSF described glibc as having nearly completed the functionality required by ANSI C. [ 3 ] By 1992 , it had the ANSI C @-@ 1989 and POSIX.1 @-@ 1990 functions implemented and work was under way on POSIX.2. [ 4 ]
In the early 1990s , the developers of the Linux kernel forked glibc . Their fork , called " Linux libc , " was maintained separately for years and released versions 2 through 5 .
The last used version of Linux libc used the internal name ( soname ) libc.so.5. Following on from this , glibc 2.x on Linux uses the soname libc.so.6 [ 9 ] ( Alpha and IA64 architectures now use libc.so.6.1 , instead ) . The * .so file name is often abbreviated as libc6 ( for example in the package name in Debian ) following the normal conventions for libraries .
Installation of a steering committee
Starting in 2001 the library 's development had been overseen by a committee , [ 11 ] with Ulrich Drepper [ 12 ] kept as the lead contributor and maintainer . The steering committee installation was surrounded by a public controversy as it was openly described by Ulrich Drepper as failed hostile takeover maneuver by RMS . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
Switch to git
While previously in a CVS repository , in 2009 glibc was migrated to a Git repository on Sourceware . [ 16 ]
Version history
For most systems , the version of glibc can be obtained by executing the lib file ( for example , / lib / libc.so.6 ) .
Malvertising
There are many different BitTorrent websites . These sites typically contain multiple torrent files and an index of those files .
The following table compares the features of some of the most popular BitTorrent websites ; it 's not comprehensive as regard to torrent trackers , especially private trackers . [ 1 ] The Alexa global ranking is accurate as of January 21 , 2016 .
Protection from return @-@ to @-@ libc attacks
Address space layout randomization ( ASLR ) makes this type of attack extremely unlikely to succeed on 64 @-@ bit machines as the memory locations of functions are random .
For 32 @-@ bit systems ASLR provides little benefit since there are only 16 bits available for randomization , and they can be defeated by brute force in a matter of minutes . [ 3 ]

PIC is commonly used for shared libraries , so that the same library code can be loaded in a location in each program address space where it will not overlap any other uses of memory ( for example , other shared libraries ) .
History
An improvement on this situation was the ability to relocate executable programs when they were loaded into memory . Only one copy of the program was required , but once loaded the program could not be moved .
IBM OS / 360 programs ( 1966 ) fit this model .
In segmented systems such as Multics ( 1964 ) , code is inherently position @-@ independent , since addresses in a program are relative to the current segment rather than absolute .
Position @-@ independent code was developed to eliminate these restrictions for non @-@ segmented systems . A position @-@ independent program could be loaded at any address in memory .

Overall , pivoting adds more operations to the computational cost of an algorithm . These additional operations are sometimes necessary for the algorithm to work at all . Other times these additional operations are worthwhile because they add numerical stability to the final result .
Examples of systems that require pivoting
In the case of Gaussian elimination , the algorithm requires that pivot elements not be zero . Interchanging rows or columns in the case of a zero pivot element is necessary . The system below requires the interchange of rows 2 and 3 to perform elimination .

The only connection between the crimes was DNA , which as of March 2009 had been recovered from 40 crime scenes , ranging from murders to burglaries .
In late March 2009 , investigators concluded that the " Phantom " criminal did not exist , and the DNA recovered at the crime scenes had already been present on the cotton swabs used for collecting DNA samples . [ 1 ]
The investigations were concentrated in a special task force " parking lot " at the Heilbronn police department .
In January 2009 , the reward for clues regarding the whereabouts of the person was increased to € 300,000 . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
Associated crimes
The DNA attributed to the " Phantom " was found at the scene , as well as purportedly at the sites of the following crimes :

Background
To refine a poorly designed or complicated interface . Allow code to work together which otherwise cannot ( e.g. Incompatible data formats ) . Enable cross language and / or runtime interoperability .
Wrapper libraries are implemented using the Adapter , Façade , and to a lesser extent , Proxy design patterns .
Structure and implementation
Example
The following provides a general illustration of a common wrapper library implementation . In this example , a C + + interface acts as a " wrapper " around a C @-@ language interface .
C interface
C + + wrapper
The above code closely mimics the implementation of boost : : scoped _ lock and boost : : mutex which are part of the boost : : thread library .
Driver wrappers
In order to achieve this , languages like Java provide a mechanism called foreign function interface that makes this possible . Some examples of these mechanisms include :
Java Native Interface ( JNI ) Java Native Access ( JNA ) A foreign function library for Python Managed Extensions SWIG ( Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator )
Some examples of existing wrapper libraries :

Consequences
An accidental overflow may result in data corruption or unexpected behavior by any process which uses the affected memory area . On operating systems without memory protection , this could be any process on the system .
A deliberate exploit may result in data at a specific location being altered in an arbitrary way , or in arbitrary code being executed .
For example , a Microsoft JPEG GDI + buffer overflow vulnerability could allow remote execution of code on the affected machine . [ 1 ]
iOS jailbreaking often uses heap overflows to gain arbitrary code execution , usually for kernel exploits to achieve the ability to replace the kernel with the one jailbreak provides .
Detection and prevention
As with buffer overflows there are primarily three ways to protect against heap overflows . Several modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux provide some implementation of all three .

Because performing bounds checking during every usage is time @-@ consuming , it is not always done . Bounds @-@ checking elimination is a compiler optimization technique that eliminates unneeded bounds checking .
Index checking
Mainstream languages that enforce run time checking include Ada , C # , Haskell , Java , JavaScript , Lisp , PHP , Python , Ruby , and Visual Basic . The D and OCaml languages have run time bounds checking that is enabled or disabled with a compiler switch .
Data validation
In the context of data collection and data quality , bounds checking refers to checking that the data is not trivially invalid . For example , a percentage measurement must be in the range 0 to 100 ; the height of an adult person must be in the range 0 to 3 meters .

Most graphics editing programs , like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP , allow the user to modify the basic blend modes - for example by applying different levels of opacity to the top picture .
In the formulas shown on this page , values go from 0.0 ( black ) to 1.0 ( white ) .
Normal blend mode
This is the standard blend mode which uses the top layer alone , [ 2 ] without mixing its colors with the layer beneath it . [ examples needed ]
Dissolve
Multiply and Screen
Multiply
Multiply blend mode multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the top layer with the corresponding pixel for the bottom layer . The result is a darker picture .
, where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value .
With Screen blend mode the values of the pixels in the two layers are inverted , multiplied , and then inverted again . This yields the opposite effect to multiply . The result is a brighter picture .
, where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value .
where a is the base layer value and b is the top layer value .
Depending on the value a of the base layer , one gets a linear interpolation between black ( a = 0 ) , the top layer ( a = 0.5 ) , and white ( a = 1 ) .
Hard Light
Hard Light combines Multiply and Screen blend modes . Equivalent to Overlay , but with the bottom and top images swapped .
Soft Light
This is a softer version of Hard Light . Applying pure black or white does not result in pure black or white [ examples needed ] .
These three results coincide with gamma correction of the bottom layer with γ = 2 ( for top black ) , unchanged bottom layer ( or , what is the same , γ = 1 ) ( for top neutral gray ) , and γ = 0.5 ( for top white ) .
The formula used by Photoshop has a discontinuity of local contrast ( was [ dubious - discuss ] ) , and other formulas correct it . Photoshop 's formula is : [ 5 ]
Pegtop 's formula [ 5 ] is smoother and corrects the discontinuity [ < span title = " See above . Also , this source uses the term " discontinuance , " not " discontinuity . " However the function is continuous despite being piecewise ( November 2012 ) " > better source needed ] at b = 0.5 :
A third formula defined by illusions.hu [ 6 ] corrects the discontinuity in a different way , doing gamma correction with γ depending on b :
For b = 0 , one still gets γ = 2 , for b = 0.5 one gets γ = 1 , for b = 1 one gets γ = 0.5 , but it is not a linear interpolation between these 3 images .

Western Philosophical skepticism originated in ancient Greek philosophy . [ 9 ] The Greek Sophists of the 5th century BC were partially skeptics .
The regress argument ( also known as the diallelus ( Latin < Greek di allelon " through or by means of one another " ) ) is a problem in epistemology and , in general , a problem in any situation where a statement has to be justified . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
According to this argument , any proposition requires a justification . However , any justification itself requires support . This means that any proposition whatsoever can be endlessly ( infinitely ) questioned .
Origin
Structure
Assuming that knowledge is justified true belief , then :
Aristotle argued that knowing does not necessitate an infinite regress because some knowledge does not depend on demonstration :
Infinite regress in optics is the formation of an infinite series of receding images created in two parallel facing mirrors . See optical feedback .

TOMOYO Linux is a Linux kernel security module which implements Mandatory access control ( MAC ) .
Overview
TOMOYO Linux focuses on system behavior .
TOMOYO Linux allows each process to declare behaviours and resources needed to achieve their purpose . When protection is enabled , TOMOYO Linux acts restricts each process to the behaviors and resources allowed by the administrator .
Features
The main features of TOMOYO Linux include :
System analysis Increased security through Mandatory Access Control Automatic policy generation Simple syntax Ease of use
History and versions
TOMOYO was merged in Linux Kernel mainline version 2.6.30 ( 2009 , June 10 ) / [ 2 ] It is currently one of four standard LSM modules , along with SELinux , AppArmor and SMACK .
The TOMOYO Linux project started as a patch for the Linux kernel to provide MAC .
However , more hooks are needed to integrate the remaining MAC functionality of TOMOYO Linux . Consequently , the project is following two parallel development lines :

Debug symbol
Implementation
Uses
An object file will contain a symbol table of the identifiers it contains that are externally visible . During the linking of different object files , a linker will use these symbol tables to resolve any unresolved references .
At that time of accessing variables and allocating memory dynamically , a compiler should perform many works and as such the extended stack model requires the symbol table .
Example
Consider the following program written in C :
A C compiler that parses this code will contain at least the following symbol table entries :
Symbol name Type Scope bar function , double extern x double function parameter foo function , double global count int function parameter sum double block local i int for @-@ loop statement
In computer software , strings is a program in Unix @-@ like operating systems that finds and prints text strings embedded in binary files such as executables . It can be used on object files and core dumps .
Common usage includes piping its output to grep and fold or redirecting the output to a file . [ 1 ]
It is part of the GNU Binary Utilities ( binutils ) , and has been ported to other operating systems including Microsoft Windows . [ 2 ]
Example

General syntax
GAS supports a general syntax that works for all of the supported architectures . The general syntax includes assembler directives and a method for commenting .
Directives
Comments
GAS supports two comment styles : [ 2 ]
As in C multi @-@ line comments start and end with mirroring slash @-@ asterisk pairs :
/ * comment * /
Single line comments have a few different formats varying on which architecture is being assembled for .
Usage
Being the back @-@ end for a popular compiler suite , namely GCC , the GNU Assembler is very widely used in compiling modern open source software .
GAS is often used as the assembler on GNU / Linux operating systems in conjunction with other GNU software .
A modified version of GAS can also be found in the Macintosh operating system 's development tools package since OS X.
Example Programs

Those more accustomed to writing in Intel syntax have argued that not supporting the Intel syntax for assembly on the x86 and x86 @-@ 64 platforms , as many other assemblers do , is a flaw .

Standard signals
The C standard defines only 6 signals . They are all defined in signal.h header ( csignal header in C + + ) : [ 1 ]
SIGABRT - " abort , " abnormal termination .
SIGILL - " illegal , " invalid instruction .
SIGINT - " interrupt , " interactive attention request sent to the program .
SIGSEGV - " segmentation violation , " invalid memory access .
SIGTERM - " terminate , " termination request sent to the program .
Additional signals may be specified in the signal.h header by the implementation . For example , Unix and Unix @-@ like operating systems ( such as Linux ) define more than 15 additional signals ; see Unix signal . [ 2 ]
A signal can be generated by calling raise ( ) or kill ( ) system calls. raise ( ) sends a signal to the current process , kill ( ) sends a signal to a specific process .
make successful calls to the function signal ( ) assign values to objects of type volatile sig _ atomic _ t return control to its caller
If the signal reports an error within the program ( and the signal is not asynchronous ) , the signal handler can terminate by calling abort ( ) , exit ( ) , or longjmp ( ) .

Overview
History
Originally developed in the Sydney suburb of Balmain by software engineer Greg Wilkins , Jetty was originally an HTTP server component of Mort Bay Server ( Mort Bay is an area of Balmain ) . [ 14 ]
Jetty was originally called IssueTracker ( its original application ) and then MBServler ( Mort Bay Servlet server ) . Neither of these were much liked , so Jetty was finally picked . [ 14 ]
Jetty was started in 1995 and was hosted by MortBay , creating version 1.x and 2.x , until 2000 .
From 2000 to 2005 , Jetty was hosted by sourceforge.net where version 3.x , 4.x , and 5.x were produced .

A vacuum fluorescent display ( VFD ) is a display device used commonly on consumer @-@ electronics equipment such as video cassette recorders , car radios , and microwave ovens .
A VFD operates on the principle of cathodoluminescence , roughly similar to a cathode ray tube , but operating at much lower voltages .
Each tube in a VFD has an anode coated phosphor that is bombarded by electrons emitted from the cathode filament . [ 1 ] In fact , each tube in VFD is a triode vacuum tube because it also has a mesh control grid . [ 2 ]
Unlike liquid crystal displays , a VFD emits a very bright light with high contrast and can support display elements of various colours .

Positronium hydride ball and stick model
Positronium hydride , or hydrogen positride [ 1 ] is an exotic molecule consisting of an exotic atom of positronium , which is a positron and electron in combination , and one of hydrogen . Its formula is PsH .
Decay
PsH is constructed from one proton , two electrons , and one positron . The binding energy is 6981176239413570000 ♠ 1.1 ± 0.2 eV . The lifetime of the molecule is 0.65 nanoseconds .
Positronium deuteride also has the same lifetime . [ 4 ]
The decay of positronium is easily observed by detecting the two 511 keV gamma ray photons emitted in the decay . The energy of the photons from positronium should differ slightly by the binding energy of the molecule . However this has not yet been detected . [ 1 ]

In 1973 , Claude Deron and Daniel Denis , both former members of Belgian " Zeuhl " band Arkham ( which had disbanded the previous year ) , set up a new group , Necronomicon .
In 1977 , they released their first eponymous album Univers Zero , later remixed and renamed as 1313 .
The album shows a heavy rock and roll approach despite the fact that the instrumentation was largely acoustic .
The group disbanded in 1987 but reformed in 1999 . In the interim , drummer Daniel Denis released two solo albums and joined Art Zoyd , a similar band from France .
Since 1999 , Univers Zéro have released five studio albums .
Univers Zero ( also known as Univers Zéro and Univers @-@ Zero [ 1 ] ) are an instrumental progressive Belgian band formed in 1974 by drummer Daniel Denis . The band is known for playing dark music heavily influenced by 20th century chamber music .
According to a booklet that was included in their first album , the band 's name was a reference to a fictional character , a " gentle giant " that happens upon a band of musicians and is enthralled with their music . The character is reminiscent of those from the Renaissance tales of François Rabelais . [ 7 ]
The band 's first album was the self @-@ titled Gentle Giant in 1970 . Combining the collective band members ' influences of rock , blues , classical , and 1960s British soul , it was an immediately challenging effort , though sometimes criticised for a slightly disappointing recording quality .
Gentle Giant at the Musikhalle , Hamburg , April 1974
In 1976 , this side of the band was captured on the live album Playing the Fool , recorded during the European tour for Interview .
While Gentle Giant 's skill as performers remained undiminished , their creative peak was now behind them . Affected by changes in popular style ( including the growth of punk rock ) , the band made a mutual decision to refine their writing and performance style in pursuit of a broader market , particularly in America .
Over the next two years , the band gradually jettisoned many of their complicated stylings in order to attempt to write simpler pop music and attempt to create hit singles .

There are six major considerations when examining a construct 's validity through the MTMM matrix , which are as follows :
A variety of statistical approaches have been used to analyze the data from the MTMM matrix .
One of the most used models to analyze MTMM data is the True Score model proposed by Saris and Andrews ( [ 6 ] ) . The True Score model can be expressed using the following standardized equations :
3 ) Yij = qijFi + rijmijMj + e * where : qij is the quality coefficient , which is equal to : qij = rij • vij Consequently : qij2 = rij2 • vij2 = σ2Fi / σ2Yij where : qij2 is the quality
The assumptions are the following :
Example
In this example the first row and the first column display the trait being assessed ( i.e. anxiety or depression ) as well as the method of assessing this trait ( i.e. interview or survey as measured by fictitious measures ) . The term heteromethod indicates that in this cell the correlation between two separate methods is being reported . Monomethod indicates the opposite , in that the same method is being used ( e.g. interview , interview ) .
Heterotrait indicates that the cell is reporting two supposedly different traits .
Monotrait indicates the opposite- that the same trait is being used .

History
Origins
1970 to 1990
The Hyundai Pony , the first Korean @-@ developed automobile , was built in 1975 . Hyundai Motors accomplished this by engaging George Turnbull of British Leyland Motor Corporation as vice @-@ president . The final result was a collaborative effort , comprising :
design from Italdesign ; transmission and engine from Mitsubishi ; technology transfer ( bodies ) from Perkinson ; car body molding from Ogihara Mold Company ; machine press from France ; and Funds from Barclays Bank and France Suez .
Hyundai chalked up another first when it exported the Pony to South America , in countries like Colombia , Venezuela and Ecuador between 1976 and 1982 , making it the first Korean @-@ developed car to be exported .
In 1977 , Motores Tecno in Costa Rica , became the first Hyundai distributor in Central America , where the Hyundai Pony pickup where sold .
1990 to present
Hyundai 's cumulative exports to the U.S. exceeded one million in 1990 .
Asia Motors was completely merged with Kia Motors Company ( the new name for Kia Industry , changed in 1990 ) in 1999 . Kia Motors had financial trouble in 1997 , and helped push South Korea into the Asian financial crisis . Kia was subsequently acquired by Hyundai Motors in 1998 .

DWARF is a widely used , standardized debugging data format .
History
The first version of DWARF proved to use excessive amounts of storage , and an incompatible successor , DWARF @-@ 2 , superseded it and added various encoding schemes to reduce data size .
The DWARF Workgroup of the Free Standards Group released DWARF version 3 in January 2006 , [ 2 ] adding ( among other things ) support for C + + namespaces , Fortran 90 allocatable data and additional compiler optimization techniques .
The DWARF committee published version 4 of DWARF , which offers " improved data compression , better description of optimized code , and support for new language features in C + + , " in 2010 . [ 3 ]

History
When stabs was created in the 1980s , the dominant object file format was a.out , which ( unlike more recent formats such as ELF ) makes no provision for storing debugging information .
Stabs works around this problem by encoding the information using special entries in the symbol table .
At one stage stabs was widely used on Unix systems , but the newer DWARF format has largely supplanted it .

Main points
Denial of materialistic existence , in itself , does not constitute solipsism .
A feature of the metaphysical solipsistic worldview is the denial of the existence of other minds . Since personal experiences are private and ineffable , another being 's experience can be known only by analogy .
The theory of solipsism also merits close examination because it relates to three widely held philosophical presuppositions , each itself fundamental and wide @-@ ranging in importance :
History
Gorgias of Leontini
Solipsism was first recorded by the Greek presocratic sophist , Gorgias ( c . 483 @-@ 375 BC ) who is quoted by the Roman skeptic Sextus Empiricus as having stated : [ 4 ]
Nothing exists . Even if something exists , nothing can be known about it . Even if something could be known about it , knowledge about it can 't be communicated to others .
Much of the point of the Sophists was to show that " objective " knowledge was a literal impossibility . ( See also comments credited to Protagoras of Abdera ) .

Niemann @-@ Pick disease ( / niːmənˈpɪk / nee @-@ mən @-@ PIK ) [ 1 ] is a group of inherited , severe metabolic disorders in which sphingomyelin accumulates in lysosomes in cells . The lysosomes normally transport material through and out of the cell .
The prognosis is individual , but the severe form is fatal in toddlerhood and , in some cases , patients with the milder forms may have normal lifespans .
This disease involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids , which are fats found in cell membranes , so it is a kind of sphingolipidosis . Sphingolipidoses , in turn , are included in the larger family of lysosomal storage diseases . [ 2 ]
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms are related to the organs in which sphingomyelin accumulates . Enlargement of the liver and spleen ( hepatosplenomegaly ) may cause reduced appetite , abdominal distension , and pain . Enlargement of the spleen ( splenomegaly ) may also cause low levels of platelets in the blood ( thrombocytopenia ) .

1 @-@ 3 digits are reserved for country code . Prefixes are not included ( e.g. , 00 prefixes an international MSISDN when dialing from Sweden ) .
Minimum length of the MSISDN is not specified by ITU @-@ T but is instead specified in the national numbering plans by the telecommunications regulator in each country .
In GSM and its variant DCS 1800 , MSISDN is built up as

Desoutter Industrial Tools founded in 1914 and headquartered in France , is an industrial manufacturer providing electric and pneumatic assembly tools .
Products and services are sold in more than 170 countries through 20 business units .
Desoutter Tools is active in fields such as Aerospace , Automotive Industry , Light Assembly and Heavy Vehicles , Off @-@ Road , General Industry .
History
Origin
This innovation was met with interest from other persons needing a lighter artificial leg ; and it resulted in the founding of the Desoutter Company , headed by Marcel Desoutter .
Product lines
From the outset , Desoutter needed to develop specific pneumatic tools to ensure that the aluminum components of the artificial limbs were drilled efficiently .
Logo
This horsepower concept was developed in many of the brand 's advertisements for about twenty years . The managing board at the time even decided that it was the embodiment of the company 's identity .
In 1973 , the horse 's head was combined with the Desoutter logo script , which was a facsimile of Louis Albert Desoutter 's [ 9 ] signature , [ 10 ] one of the company 's founders .
To mark the centenary of the brand , the emblem recently adopted a more contemporary graphic design .

An initial value problem is a differential equation

A solution to an initial value problem is a function y { \ displaystyle y } that is a solution to the differential equation and satisfies
For a large class of initial value problems , the existence and uniqueness of a solution can be illustrated through the use of a calculator .
Hiroshi Okamura obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique . This condition has to do with the existence of a Lyapunov function for the system .
Start by noting that y ′ = d y d t { \ displaystyle y ' = { \ frac { dy } { dt } } } , so
Now rearrange the equation so that y { \ displaystyle y } is on the left and t { \ displaystyle t } on the right
Now integrate both sides ( this introduces an unknown constant B { \ displaystyle B } ) .
Eliminate the ln { \ displaystyle \ ln }
this gives the final solution of y ( t ) = 19 e 0.85 t { \ displaystyle y ( t ) = 19e ^ { 0.85t } } .

The procedure for calculating the numerical solution to the initial value problem via the improved Euler 's method is :
by way of Heun 's method , is to first calculate the intermediate value y ~ i + 1 { \ displaystyle { \ tilde { y } } _ { i + 1 } } and then the final approximation y i + 1 { \ displaystyle y _ { i + 1 } } at the next integration point .
where h { \ displaystyle h } is the step size and t i + 1 = t i + h { \ displaystyle t _ { i + 1 } = t _ { i } + h } .
A diagram depicting the use of Heun 's method to find a less erroneous prediction when compared to the lower order Euler 's Method
Using the principle that the slope of a line equates to the rise / run , the coordinates at the end of the interval can be found using the following formula :

TypeScript is a free and open @-@ source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft . It is a strict superset of JavaScript , and adds optional static typing and class @-@ based object @-@ oriented programming to the language .
TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript . [ 7 ] As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript , any existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs .
The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript , transcompiled to JavaScript and licensed under the Apache 2 License .
TypeScript 0.9 , released in 2013 , added support for generics . [ 19 ] TypeScript 1.0 was released at Build 2014 . [ 20 ] Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provides built @-@ in support for TypeScript . [ 21 ]
In July 2014 , the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler , claiming 5 × performance gains . Simultaneously , the source code , which was initially hosted on CodePlex , was moved to GitHub . [ 22 ]
On September 22 , 2016 , TypeScript 2.0 was released ; it introduced several features , including the ability for programmers to optionally prevent variables from being assigned null values . [ 23 ]
TypeScript developers sought a solution that would not break compatibility with the standard and its cross @-@ platform support . Knowing that the current ECMAScript standard proposal promised future support for class @-@ based programming , TypeScript was based on that proposal .
TypeScript adds support for features such as classes , modules and an arrow function syntax as proposed in the ECMAScript 2015 standard .
Type annotations and compile @-@ time type checking Type inference Type erasure Interfaces Enumerated type Mixin Generic Namespaces Tuple Await
Syntactically , TypeScript is very similar to JScript .NET , another Microsoft implementation of the ECMA @-@ 262 language standard that added support for static typing and classical object @-@ oriented language features such as classes , inheritance , interfaces , and namespaces .
TypeScript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time . This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular dynamic typing of JavaScript .
TypeScript supports ECMAScript 2015 classes that integrate the optional type annotations support .
TypeScript supports generic programming . [ 31 ]

1940s and 1950s : Romancing the consumer
LUX is a global brand developed by Unilever . The range of products includes beauty soaps , shower gels , bath additives , hair shampoos and conditioners . Lux started as " Sunlight Flakes " laundry soap in 1899 .
In 1925 , it became the first mass @-@ market toilet soap in the world . It is noted as a brand that pioneered female celebrity endorsements .
The brand was founded by the Lever Brothers in 1899 and now known as Unilever . [ 2 ] The name changed from " Sunlight Flakes " to " Lux " in 1900 , a Latin word for " light " and suggestive of " luxury . "
Lux 's early advertising campaigns aimed to educate users about its credentials as a laundry product and appeared in magazines such as Ladies Home Journal .
By the early 1920s , it was a hugely successful brand and in 1924 , the Lever Brothers conducted a contest that led them to a very interesting finding : women were using Lux as pud soaps .
Made with fine @-@ texture , rich in fragrance , and manufactured using a method created in France , the first Lux toilet soap was sold for 10 cents apiece .

Lux toilet soap was launched in the United States in 1925 and in the United Kingdom in 1928 . Subsequently , Lux soap has been marketed in several forms , including handwash , shower gel and cream bath soap .
This era saw key launches of LUX in the UK , India , Argentina and Thailand . The brand concentrated on building its association with the increasingly popular movie world , focusing more on movie stars and their roles rather than on the product .
Advertising commercials showed ordinary looking women with direct references to leading ladies from the movies such as Deanna Durbin and Deborah Kerr .
In the 1990s , Lux moved from generic beauty benefits to focus on specific benefits and transformation . More emphasis on functionality and variant associations with different skin types as well as mention of ingredients . The communication was far more regional specific and localized , using in Brazil stars like Malu Mader and Debora Bloch .

Development of the concept
The categorical view of psychosis is most associated with Emil Kraepelin , who created criteria for the medical diagnosis and classification of different forms of psychotic illness .
In contrast , psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler did not believe there was a clear separation between sanity and madness , believing instead that psychosis was simply an extreme expression of thoughts and behaviours that could be present to varying degrees throughout the population . [ 2 ]
The concept of psychosis as a spectrum was further developed by psychologists such as Hans Eysenck and Gordon Claridge , who sought to understand unusual variations in thought and behaviour in terms of personality theory .
Eysenck conceptualised cognitive and behavioral variations as all together forming a single personality trait , psychoticism . [ 3 ]

Hugh of Saint Victor , C.R.S.A.
London : Routledge . Cambridge : Cambridge University Press Evans , G. R. ( 2002 ) Fifty Key Medieval Thinkers .
Hugh of Saint Victor , C.R.S.A. ( c . 1096 - 11 February 1141 ) , was a Saxon canon regular and a leading theologian and writer on mystical theology .
As with many medieval figures , little is known about Hugh 's early life .
Hugh was influenced by many people , but chiefly by Saint Augustine , especially in holding that the arts and philosophy can serve theology .
Various other works were wrongly attributed to Hugh in later thought . One such particularly influential work was the Exposition of the Rule of St Augustine , now accepted to be from the Victorine school but not by Hugh of St Victor . [ 24 ]
Hugh was heavily influenced by Augustine 's exegesis of Genesis . Divine Wisdom was the archetypal form of creation .
His works are in hundreds of libraries all across Europe . He is quoted in many other publications after his death , and Bonaventure praises him in De reductione artium ad theologiam .
He was also an influence on the critic Edward Said , who cited this passage from Hugh of St Victor in numerous published works :
Hugh 's most significant works include :

Notes
Agrippa ( Greek : Ἀγρίππας ) was a Skeptic philosopher who probably lived towards the end of the 1st century AD . [ 1 ] He is regarded as the author of " five grounds of doubt " or tropes ( Greek : τρόποι ) , which are purported to establish the impossibility of certain knowledge .
These tropes are given by Sextus Empiricus , in his Outlines of Pyrrhonism . According to Sextus , they are attributed only " to the more recent skeptics " and it is by Diogenes Laertius that we attribute them to Agrippa . [ 2 ] The tropes are :
Aenesidemus Münchhausen trilemma Philosophical skepticism Pyrrhonism Sextus Empiricus Theory of justification

The grey @-@ fronted dove , ( Leptotila rufaxilla ) is a large New World tropical dove . It is a resident breeder in South America from Colombia , Venezuela and the Guyanas south to northeast Argentina and Uruguay . Several subspecies exist , among them L. r. hellmayrii from Trinidad and the Paria Peninsula in Venezuela .
The grey @-@ headed dove , Leptotila plumbeiceps , of Central America and the Grenada dove , L. wellsi , of Grenada were formerly considered conspecific with grey @-@ fronted dove .
The grey @-@ fronted dove inhabits humid forest and woodland . It builds a large stick nest in a bush or on a stump and lays two white eggs .
The grey @-@ fronted dove is very similar to the closely related white @-@ tipped dove , Leptotila verreauxi , which , in the area of overlap , prefers more open , drier , woodland .
The white tip to the tail is narrower than in the white @-@ tipped dove . The bill is black , the legs red and the iris is yellow . L. r. hellmayrii has a paler forehead and darker , more rufous , breast .
The food of this species is mainly seeds obtained by foraging on the ground , but it will also take insects . The call is a deep hollow ooo @-@ wooooo @-@ ou .
Its flight is fast and direct , with the regular beats and clattering of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general . The grey @-@ fronted dove is usually seen singly or in pairs , and is rather wary .

Absolute idealism
Anaxagoras ( 480 BC ) was known as " Nous " ( " Mind " ) because he taught that " all things " were created by Mind , that Mind held the cosmos together and gave human beings a connection to the cosmos or a pathway to the divine .
Subjective Idealism ( immaterialism or phenomenalism ) describes a relationship between experience and the world in which objects are no more than collections or " bundles " of sense data in the perceiver .

Examples and counterexamples
As referential transparency requires the same results for any given set of inputs at any point in time , a referentially transparent expression is therefore deterministic .
Consider a function that returns the input from some source . In pseudocode , a call to this function might be GetInput ( Source ) where Source might identify a particular disk file , the keyboard , etc .
Even with identical values of Source , the successive return values will be different . Therefore , function GetInput ( ) is neither deterministic nor referentially transparent .
As an example , let 's use two functions , one which is referentially opaque , and the other which is referentially transparent :
The referential opacity of rq makes reasoning about programs more difficult . For example , say we wish to reason about the following statement :
One may be tempted to simplify this statement to :
Such mathematical identities will hold for referentially transparent functions such as rt .
However , a more sophisticated analysis can be used to simplify the statement to :
This takes more steps and requires a degree of insight into the code infeasible for compiler optimization .

Advantages :
It can assemble input with both Intel and AT & T ( as ) syntax ; Library interface for compiler developers .
Disadvantages :
Due to the rich development involved with NASM , documentation is expected to be more complete ; Yasm lacks Relocatable Object Module Format ( OMF ) object support .

FASM ( flat assembler ) is an assembler for x86 processors . It supports Intel @-@ style assembly language on the IA @-@ 32 and x86 @-@ 64 computer architectures .
An unofficial port targeting the ARM architecture ( FASMARM ) also exists . [ 3 ]
Fresh , an internet community supported project started by John Found , is an integrated development environment ( IDE ) for flat assembler language .
The primary goal of Fresh is to make programming in assembly as fast and efficient as in other visual languages , without sacrificing the small application size and the raw power of assembly language .
Fresh can be used for Windows programming , but also to create programs for any OS that FASM supports - DOS , Linux , FreeBSD , BeOS , MenuetOS .

In the x86 assembly language , the TEST instruction performs a bitwise AND on two operands . The flags SF , ZF , PF are modified while the result of the AND is discarded .
The OF and CF flags are set to 0 , while AF flag is undefined .

The LTR x86 instruction stands for load task register and is used in operating systems that support multitasking .
LTR is supported only in protected mode and long mode , not in real mode or virtual 8086 mode . It must be executed when the CPL is 0 , and therefore cannot be used by application programs .
LTR loads the special x86 task register with a segment selector that points to a task state segment .
After executing the LTR instruction , the TSS pointed to by the argument is marked busy , but no hardware task switch occurs .
The opposite of the LTR instruction is the STR instruction , which copies the value of the task register to the specified location . Note that the x86 task register is only accessible directly through the LTR and STR instructions .

The last Imam of Oman , Ghalib Bin Ali , started an uprising in 1954 when the Sultan granted licenses to the Iraq Petroleum Company despite the fact that the largest oil fields lay inside the Imamate .
The hostilities were put down in 1955 , but the longer conflict would evolve into the Jebel Akhdar rebellion , where Sultan Said bin Taimur relied heavily on continued British military support . Iraq Petroleum , along with its operator of oil exploration , Petroleum Development Oman , was owned by European oil giants including Anglo @-@ Iranian Oil 's successor British Petroleum which encouraged the British government to extend their support to the Sultan .

Examples of transcendental functions include the exponential function , the logarithm , and the trigonometric functions .
Formally , an analytic function ƒ ( z ) of one real or complex variable z is transcendental if it is algebraically independent of that variable . [ 3 ] This can be extended to functions of several variables .
A function that is not transcendental is algebraic . Simple examples of algebraic functions are the rational functions and the square root function , but in general , algebraic functions cannot be defined as finite formulas of the elementary functions . [ 4 ]
Differential algebra examines how integration frequently creates functions that are algebraically independent of some class , such as when one takes polynomials with trigonometric functions as variables .
Most familiar transcendental functions , including the special functions of mathematical physics , are solutions of algebraic differential equations . Those that are not , such as the gamma and the zeta functions , are called transcendentally transcendental or hypertranscendental functions .
In general , finding the exceptional set of a function is a difficult problem , but it has been calculated for some functions :
Complex function Function ( mathematics ) Generalized function List of special functions and eponyms List of types of functions Rational function Special functions
Dimensional analysis
The following functions are transcendental :
The indefinite integral of many algebraic functions is transcendental . For example , the logarithm function arose from the reciprocal function in an effort to find the area of a hyperbolic sector .

Hydroxycitric acid ( HCA ) is a derivative of citric acid that is found in a variety of tropical plants including Garcinia cambogia and Hibiscus subdariffa . [ 1 ]
There are four isomers , ( + ) - and ( - ) -hydroxycitric acid , and ( + ) - and ( - ) -allo @-@ hydroxycitric acid . The ( - ) -hydroxycitric acid isomer is the one found in Garcinia . [ 2 ]
( - ) -HCA is a competitive inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase , which converts citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA . [ 2 ] The reverse of this conversion is a step in the citric acid cycle .
Biological effects
Researchers at the University of Houston reported hydroxycitrate is capable of dissolving calcium oxalate crystals , a component of human kidney stones . This is an unusual effect because it is rare for a crystal to dissolve while in a supersaturated growth solution . The researchers believe the effect could lead to the development of new drugs for human kidney stones . [ 9 ]
A statistic ( singular ) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . It is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
Observability
More formally , statistical theory defines a statistic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . The term statistic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .
Properties
It can be shown that choosing the optimal coefficient

where we used the fact that cos ( kx ) = 1 for all k > q . As a consequence , at any such x ∈ R
This function h is also smooth ; it equals 1 on the closed interval [ − 1,1 ] and vanishes outside the open interval ( − 2,2 ) . Using h , define for every natural number n ( including zero ) the smooth function
With the smooth transition function g as above , define

Consider the function
The function f has continuous derivatives of all orders in all points x of the real line , given by
where pn ( x ) is a polynomial of degree n − 1 given recursively by p1 ( x ) = 1 and
The proof , by induction , is based on the fact that for any nonnegative integer m ,
This implies that all f ( n ) are continuous and differentiable at x = 0 , because
By the power series representation of the exponential function , we have for every natural number m ( including zero )
because all the positive terms for n ≠ m + 1 are added . Therefore , using the functional equation of the exponential function ,
The induction step from n to n + 1 is similar . For x > 0 we get for the derivative
As seen earlier , the function f is smooth , and all its derivatives at the origin are 0 . Therefore , the Taylor series of f at the origin converges everywhere to the zero function ,
Note that although the function f has derivatives of all orders over the real line , the analytic continuation of f from the positive half @-@ line x > 0 to the complex plane , that is , the function

In complex analysis a complex @-@ valued function ƒ of a complex variable z :
( this implies that the radius of convergence is positive ) .
One of the most important theorems of complex analysis is that holomorphic functions are analytic . Among the corollaries of this theorem are
In contrast the partition of unity is a tool which can be used on any real manifold .
Interchange of the integral and infinite sum is justified by observing that f ( w ) / ( w − a ) { \ displaystyle f ( w ) / ( w @-@ a ) } is bounded on C by some positive number M , while for all w in C
for some positive r as well . We therefore have
on C , and as the Weierstrass M @-@ test shows the series converges uniformly over C , the sum and the integral may be interchanged .
As the factor ( z − a ) n does not depend on the variable of integration w , it may be factored out to yield
which has the desired form of a power series in z :
Since power series can be differentiated term @-@ wise , applying the above argument in the reverse direction and the power series expression for
gives
This is a Cauchy integral formula for derivatives . Therefore the power series obtained above is the Taylor series of ƒ .

Approximate identity Non @-@ analytic smooth function Bump function Convolution Weierstrass transform Distribution ( mathematics ) Kurt Otto Friedrichs Generalized function Sergei Sobolev
A mollifier ( top ) in dimension one . At the bottom , in red is a function with a corner ( left ) and sharp jump ( right ) , and in blue is its mollified version .
A paper where the differentiability of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations is investigated by using mollifiers .
In mathematics , mollifiers ( also known as approximations to the identity ) are smooth functions with special properties , used for example in distribution theory to create sequences of smooth functions approximating nonsmooth ( generalized ) functions , via convolution .
It must be pointed out that there is a little misunderstanding in the concept of mollifier : Friedrichs defined as " mollifier " the integral operator whose kernel is one of the functions nowadays called mollifiers .
However , since the properties of a linear integral operator are completely determined by its kernel , the name mollfier was inherited by the kernel itself as a result of common usage .
Definition 1 . If φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi } is a smooth function on ℝn , n ≥ 1 , satisfying the following three requirements
Note 2 .
As briefly pointed out in the " Historical notes " section of this entry , originally , the term " mollifier " identified the following convolution operator : [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
where φ ϵ ( x ) = ϵ − n φ ( x / ϵ ) { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ varphi _ { \ epsilon } ( x ) = \ epsilon ^ { -n } \ varphi ( x / \ epsilon ) } and φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi } is a smooth function satisfying the first three conditions stated above and one or more supplementary conditions as positivity and symmetry .
Consider the function φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi } ( x ) { \ displaystyle ( x ) } of a variable in ℝn defined by
The function φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi } ( x ) { \ displaystyle ( x ) } in dimension one
All properties of a mollifier are related to its behaviour under the operation of convolution : we list the following ones , whose proofs can be found in every text on distribution theory . [ 14 ]
For any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } , the following family of convolutions indexed by the real number ϵ { \ displaystyle \ epsilon }
where ∗ { \ displaystyle \ ast } denotes convolution , is a family of smooth functions .
For any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } , the following family of convolutions indexed by the real number ϵ { \ displaystyle \ epsilon } converges to T { \ displaystyle T }
For any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } ,
where s u p p { \ displaystyle \ mathrm { supp } } indicates the support in the sense of distributions , and + { \ displaystyle + } indicates their Minkowski addition .
The basic applications of mollifiers is to prove properties valid for smooth functions also in nonsmooth situations :
In some theories of generalized functions , mollifiers are used to define the multiplication of distributions : precisely , given two distributions S { \ displaystyle S } and T { \ displaystyle T } , the limit of the product of a smooth function and a distribution
defines ( if it exists ) their product in various theories of generalized functions .

Consider the ordinary differential equation
The backward Euler method computes the approximations using
If this sequence converges ( within a given tolerance ) , then the method takes its limit as the new approximation y k + 1 { \ displaystyle y _ { k + 1 } } . [ 2 ]
Alternatively , one can use ( some modification of ) the Newton @-@ Raphson method to solve the algebraic equation .
Now approximate the integral on the right by the right @-@ hand rectangle method ( with one rectangle ) :
Finally , use that y n { \ displaystyle y _ { n } } is supposed to approximate y ( t n ) { \ displaystyle y ( t _ { n } ) } and the formula for the backward Euler method follows . [ 3 ]
The same reasoning leads to the ( standard ) Euler method if the left @-@ hand rectangle rule is used instead of the right @-@ hand one .
The pink region outside the disk shows the stability region of the backward Euler method .
The backward Euler method has order one . This means that the local truncation error ( defined as the error made in one step ) is O ( h 2 ) { \ displaystyle O ( h ^ { 2 } ) } , using the big O notation . The error at a specific time t { \ displaystyle t } is O ( h ) { \ displaystyle O ( h ) } .
The backward Euler method is a variant of the ( forward ) Euler method . Other variants are the semi @-@ implicit Euler method and the exponential Euler method .
The backward Euler method can be seen as a Runge @-@ Kutta method with one stage , described by the Butcher tableau :
The backward Euler method can also be seen as a linear multistep method with one step . It is the first method of the family of Adams @-@ Moulton methods , and also of the family of backward differentiation formulas .

Suppose that we want to solve the differential equation
The trapezoidal rule is given by the formula
where h = t n + 1 − t n { \ displaystyle h = t _ { n + 1 } -t _ { n } } is the step size . [ 1 ]
Integrating the differential equation from t n { \ displaystyle t _ { n } } to t n + 1 { \ displaystyle t _ { n + 1 } } , we find that
The trapezoidal rule states that the integral on the right @-@ hand side can be approximated as
Now combine both formulas and use that y n ≈ y ( t n ) { \ displaystyle y _ { n } \ approx y ( t _ { n } ) } and y n + 1 ≈ y ( t n + 1 ) { \ displaystyle y _ { n + 1 } \ approx y ( t _ { n + 1 } ) } to get the trapezoidal rule for solving ordinary differential equations . [ 3 ]
It follows from the error analysis of the trapezoidal rule for quadrature that the local truncation error τ n { \ displaystyle \ tau _ { n } } of the trapezoidal rule for solving differential equations can be bounded as :

Motivation
( Note : Haskell documentation uses the same arrow for both function types and kinds . )
Haskell 's kind system [ 3 ] has just two rules :
Examples
Standard Haskell does not allow polymorphic kinds . This is in contrast to parametric polymorphism on types , which is supported in Haskell . For instance , in the following example :
because the kind of [ ] , ∗ → ∗ { \ displaystyle * \ rightarrow * } does not match the expected kind for z , which is always ∗ { \ displaystyle * } .
For instance : Higher @-@ order type operators are allowed however .
For example : GHC has the extension PolyKinds , which , together with KindSignatures , allows polymorphic kinds .
In GHC 8.0.1 , types and kinds can merged using the experimental compiler option -XTypeInType . [ 6 ]

In tiling or tessellation problems , there are to be no gaps , nor overlaps . Many of the puzzles of this type involve packing rectangles or polyominoes into a larger rectangle or other square @-@ like shape .
For example , it is possible to pack 147 rectangles of size ( 137,95 ) in a rectangle of size ( 1600,1230 ) . [ 20 ]

Dynamite mixtures containing nitrocellulose , which increases the viscosity of the mix , are commonly known as " gelatins . "
The main use of nitroglycerin , by tonnage , is in explosives such as dynamite and in propellants .
Nitroglycerin is an oily liquid that may explode when subjected to heat , shock or flame .
Nitroglycerin was also used as an ingredient in military propellants for use in firearms .
Nitroglycerin has an advantage over some other high explosives , that on detonation it produces practically no visible smoke . Therefore , it is useful as an ingredient in the formulation of various kinds of " smokeless powder . " [ 22 ]
Blasting gelatin , also known as gelignite , was invented by Nobel in 1875 , using nitroglycerin , wood pulp , and sodium or potassium nitrates . This was an early low @-@ cost , flexible explosive .

In geometry , a uniform tiling is a tessellation of the plane by regular polygon faces with the restriction of being vertex @-@ transitive .
Uniform tilings can exist in both the Euclidean plane and hyperbolic plane . Uniform tilings are related to the finite uniform polyhedra which can be considered uniform tilings of the sphere .
Finally tilings can be described by their vertex configuration , the sequence of polygons around each vertex .
Coxeter groups for the plane define the Wythoff construction and can be represented by Coxeter @-@ Dynkin diagrams :

It is one of three regular tilings of the plane . The other two are the square tiling and the hexagonal tiling .
The vertex arrangement of the triangular tiling is called an A2 lattice . [ 2 ] It is the 2 @-@ dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb .
The A * 2 lattice ( also called A3 2 ) can be constructed by the union of all three A2 lattices , and equivalent to the A2 lattice .

The vertices of the triangular tiling are the centers of the densest possible circle packing . [ 3 ] Every circle is in contact with 6 other circles in the packing ( kissing number ) . The packing density is π ⁄ √ 12 or 90.69 % .
Since the union of 3 A2 lattices is also an A2 lattice , the circle packing can be given with 3 colors of circles .
The voronoi cell of a triangular tiling is a hexagon , and so the voronoi tessellation , the hexagonal tiling has a direct correspondence to the circle packings .
This tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra with Schläfli symbols { 3 , n } , continuing into the hyperbolic plane .
It is also topologically related as a part of sequence of Catalan solids with face configuration Vn.6.6 , and also continuing into the hyperbolic plane .
Like the uniform polyhedra there are eight uniform tilings that can be based from the regular hexagonal tiling ( or the dual triangular tiling ) .
Drawing the tiles colored as red on the original faces , yellow at the original vertices , and blue along the original edges , there are 8 forms , 7 which are topologically distinct . ( The truncated triangular tiling is topologically identical to the hexagonal tiling . )

Icosidodecahedron Vertex figure represented as 3.5.3.5 or ( 3.5 ) 2
Example : A truncated cube 3.8.8 has an angle defect of 30 degrees . Therefore , it has 720 / 30 = 24 vertices .
Semiregular polyhedra have vertex configurations with positive angle defect .
NOTE : The vertex figure can represent a regular or semiregular tiling on the plane if its defect is zero . It can represent a tiling of the hyperbolic plane if its defect is negative .
For uniform polyhedra , the angle defect can be used to compute the number of vertices .
Descartes ' theorem states that all the angle defects in a topological sphere must sum to 4π radians or 720 degrees .
Since uniform polyhedra have all identical vertices , this relation allows us to compute the number of vertices , which is 4π / defect or 720 / defect .
In particular it follows that { a , b } has 4 / ( 2 - b ( 1 - 2 / a ) ) vertices .
Every enumerated vertex configuration potentially uniquely defines a semiregular polyhedron . However , not all configurations are possible .
The number in parentheses is the number of vertices , determined by the angle defect .

Vertex configuration List of regular polytopes
The vertex figure of a triangular prism is an isosceles triangle . The triangle face makes the short edge , and the two square faces make the long edges . A shorthand notation for this vertex figure is 3.4.4
The vertex figure for a great icosahedron is a regular pentagram or star polygon { 5 / 2 } .
In geometry , a vertex figure , broadly speaking , is the figure exposed when a corner of a polyhedron or polytope is sliced off .
Cromwell ( 1999 ) makes a spherical cut or scoop , centered on the vertex . The cut surface or vertex figure is thus a spherical polygon marked on this sphere .
Many combinatorial and computational approaches ( e.g. Skilling , 1975 ) treat a vertex figure as the ordered ( or partially ordered ) set of points of all the neighboring ( connected via an edge ) vertices to the given vertex .
This set of elements is elsewhere known as a vertex star .
A vertex figure for an n @-@ polytope is an ( n − 1 ) -polytope . For example , a vertex figure for a polyhedron is a polygon figure , and the vertex figure for a 4 @-@ polytope is a polyhedron .
By considering the connectivity of these neighboring vertices an ( n − 1 ) -polytope , the vertex figure , can be constructed for each vertex of a polytope :
Vertex figures are the most useful for uniform polytopes because one vertex figure can encode the entire polytope .
For polyhedra , the vertex figure can be represented by a vertex configuration notation , by listing the faces in sequence around a vertex . For example 3.4.4.4 is a vertex with one triangle and three squares , and it represents the rhombicuboctahedron .
If the polytope is vertex @-@ transitive , the vertex figure will exist in a hyperplane surface of the n @-@ space . In general the vertex figure need not be planar .
For nonconvex polyhedra , the vertex figure may also be nonconvex . Uniform polytopes , for instance , can have star polygons for faces or for vertex figures .
For a uniform polyhedron , the face of the dual polyhedron may be found from the original polyhedron 's vertex figure using the " Dorman Luke " construction .
If a polytope is regular , it can be represented by a Schläfli symbol and both the cell and the vertex figure can be trivially extracted from this notation .
For a regular polyhedron { p , q } , the vertex figure is { q } , a q @-@ gon . Example , the vertex figure for a cube { 4,3 } , is the triangle { 3 } .
truncated cubic honeycomb ( partial ) .
The vertex figure of a truncated cubic honeycomb is a nonuniform square pyramid . One octahedron and four truncated cubes meet at each vertex form a space @-@ filling tessellation .
Vertex figure : A nonuniform square pyramid Schlegel diagram Perspective Created as a square base from an octahedron ( 3.3.3.3 ) And four isosceles triangle sides from truncated cubes ( 3.8.8 )
Related to the vertex figure , an edge figure is the vertex figure of a vertex figure . [ 3 ] Edge figures are useful for expressing relations between the elements within regular and uniform polytopes .
Regular polytopes ( and honeycombs ) have a single edge figure which is also regular . For a regular polytope { p , q , r , s , ... , z } , the edge figure is { r , s , ... , z } .
Less trivially , the truncated cubic honeycomb t0,1 { 4,3,4 } , has a square pyramid vertex figure , with truncated cube and octahedron cells . Here there are two types of edge figures . One is a square edge figure at the apex of the pyramid .

This table shows the 11 convex uniform tilings ( regular and semiregular ) of the Euclidean plane , and their dual tilings .
There are three regular and eight semiregular tilings in the plane . The semiregular tilings form new tilings from their duals , each made from one type of irregular face .
John Conway calls the uniform duals Archimedean tilings , in parallel to the Archimedean solid polyhedra .
Uniform tilings are listed by their vertex configuration , the sequence of faces that exist on each vertex . For example 4.8.8 means one square and two octagons on a vertex .
In addition to the 11 convex uniform tilings , there are also 14 nonconvex tilings , using star polygons , and reverse orientation vertex configurations .

SPICE was developed at the Electronics Research Laboratory of the University of California , Berkeley by Laurence Nagel with direction from his research advisor , Prof. Donald Pederson .
SPICE1 was largely a derivative of the CANCER program , [ 4 ] which Nagel had worked on under Prof. Ronald Rohrer .
It is written in C , uses the same netlist syntax , and added X Window System plotting .
As an early public domain software program with source code available , [ 11 ] SPICE was widely distributed and used .
The birth of SPICE was named an IEEE Milestone in 2011 ; the entry mentions that SPICE " evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simulator . " [ 21 ]
SPICE2 included these analyses :
Since SPICE is generally used to model nonlinear circuits , the small signal analyses are necessarily preceded by a quiescent point calculation at which the circuit is linearized .
SPICE3 retained the netlist for circuit description , but allowed analyses to be controlled from a command @-@ line interface similar to the C shell . SPICE3 also added basic X plotting , as UNIX and engineering workstations became common .

In general , medical intervention is limited to symptomatic therapy . Before pregnancy , patients with EDS should have genetic counseling and familiarize themselves with the risks to their own bodies that pregnancy poses .
In this case , emotional support and behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful . Support groups can be immensely helpful for patients dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health . Family members , teachers , and friends should be informed about EDS so they can accept and assist the child .
Studies have shown that local anesthetics , arterial catheters and central venous catheters cause a higher risk in haematoma formation in patients with Ehlers @-@ Danlos syndrome .
Ehlers @-@ Danlos syndrome patients also show a resistance to local anaesthetics . [ 46 ] Resistance to Xylocaine and Bupivacaine is not uncommon , and Carbocaine tends to work better in EDS patents .
Surgery with Ehlers @-@ Danlos patients requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterward .
Signs vary widely based on which type of EDS the patient has . In each case , however , the signs are ultimately due to faulty or reduced amounts of collagen .
EDS typically affects the joints , skin , and blood vessels . Following is a list of major signs and symptoms .
Because it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood , some instances of Ehlers @-@ Danlos syndrome have been mischaracterized as child abuse . [ 34 ]
The pain associated with the condition may be severe . [ 35 ]
Mutations in the following genes can cause subtypes of the Ehlers @-@ Danlos syndrome :
X @-@ ray of a wrist with midcarpal instability
As of 2017 there are 13 types of Ehlers @-@ Danlos syndromes , with a significant overlap in features . [ 39 ]
Classical EDS - associated with extremely elastic ( stretchy ) , smooth skin that is fragile and bruises easily ; wide , atrophic scars ( flat or depressed scars ) ; and joint hypermobility .
Molluscoid pseudotumors ( calcified hematomas over pressure points such as the elbow ) and spheroids ( fat @-@ containing cysts on forearms and shins ) are also frequently seen . Hypotonia and delayed motor development may occur . [ 39 ]
Arthrochalasia EDS - characterized by severe joint hypermobility and congenital hip dislocation . Other common features include fragile , elastic skin with easy bruising ; hypotonia ; kyphoscoliosis ( kyphosis and scoliosis ) ; and mild osteopenia . [ 39 ]
Spondylodysplastic EDS ( spEDS ) characterized by short stature ( progressive in childhood ) , muscle hypotonia ( ranging from severe congenital , to mild later @-@ onset ) , and bowing of limbs . [ 39 ]

Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF @-@ β ) , interleukin 6 ( IL @-@ 6 ) , interleukin 21 ( IL @-@ 21 ) and interleukin 23 ( IL @-@ 23 ) contribute to Th17 formation in mice and humans .
Th17 cells are involved in B cell recruitment through CXCL13 chemokine signaling , and Th17 activity may encourage antibody production . [ 11 ]
The dysregulation of Th17 cells has been associated with autoimmune disorders and inflammation . In the case of autoimmune disorders , Th17 cell over activation can cause an inappropriate amount of inflammation , like in the case of rheumatoid arthritis .
Th17 cells have also been shown to be necessary for maintenance of mucosal immunity .
In HIV , the loss of Th17 cell populations can contribute to chronic infection .

Type I diamonds , the most common class , contain nitrogen atoms as their main impurity , commonly at a concentration of 0.1 % .
Type I diamonds absorb in both the infrared and ultraviolet region , from 320 nm .
Type IaB , where the nitrogen atoms are in large even @-@ numbered aggregates ; these impart a yellow to brown tint . Type Ib make up about 0.1 % of all natural diamonds .
They also have differing fluorescence characteristics , but no discernible visible absorption spectrum .
The crystals as found tend to be large and irregular in shape . Type II diamonds were formed under extremely high pressure for longer time periods .
Many famous large diamonds , like the Cullinan , Koh @-@ i @-@ Noor , and Lesedi La Rona , are Type IIa . Synthetic diamonds grown using the CVD process typically also belong to this type . Type IIb diamonds make up about 0.1 % of all natural diamonds , making them one of the rarest natural diamonds and very valuable .

Consider the following example in set @-@ builder notation .
In this annotated version of the example :
A list comprehension has the same syntactic components to represent generation of a list in order from an input list or iterator :
The order of generation of members of the output list is based on the order of items in the input .
x { \ displaystyle x } is the variable representing members of an input set .
An input list ( or iterator ) . An optional predicate expression . And an output expression producing members of the output list from members of the input iterable that satisfy the predicate .
In Haskell 's list comprehension syntax , this set @-@ builder construct would be written similarly , as :
Here , the list [ 0 .. ] represents N { \ displaystyle \ mathbb { N } } , x ^ 2 > 3 represents the predicate , and 2 * x represents the output expression .
The SETL programming language ( 1969 ) has a set formation construct which is similar to list comprehensions . This code prints all prime numbers from 2 to N :
Smalltalk block context messages which constitute list comprehensions have been in that language since at least Smalltalk @-@ 80 .
Burstall and Darlington 's work with NPL influenced many functional programming languages during the 1980s , but not all included list comprehensions .
An exception was the influential pure lazy functional programming language Miranda , which was released in 1985 . The subsequently developed standard pure lazy functional language Haskell includes many of Miranda 's features , including list comprehensions .
Comprehensions were proposed as a query notation for databases [ 1 ] and were implemented in the Kleisli database query language . [ 2 ]
In Haskell , a monad comprehension is a generalization of the list comprehension to other monads in functional programming .
Version 3.x and 2.7 of the Python language introduces syntax for set comprehensions . Similar in form to list comprehensions , set comprehensions generate Python sets instead of lists .
Racket set comprehensions generate Racket sets instead of lists .
Version 3.x and 2.7 of the Python language introduced a new syntax for dictionary comprehensions , similar in form to list comprehensions but which generate Python dicts instead of lists .
Racket hash table comprehensions generate Racket hash tables ( one implementation of the Racket dictionary type ) .
In Python we could do as follows :
Like the original NPL use , these are fundamentally database access languages .
In XPath , the expression :
is conceptually evaluated as a series of " steps " where each step produces a list and the next step applies a filter function to each element in the previous step 's output . [ 3 ]
In XQuery , full XPath is available , but FLWOR statements are also used , which is a more powerful comprehension construct . [ 4 ]
So , in another functional language the above FLWOR statement may be implemented like this :
C # 3.0 has a group of related features called LINQ , which defines a set of query operators for manipulating object enumerations .
It also offers an alternative comprehension syntax , reminiscent of SQL :
This allows , amongst other things , for the IQueryable to
rewrite an incompatible or inefficient comprehension translate the AST into another query language ( e.g. SQL ) for execution
There is some effort in providing C + + with list @-@ comprehension constructs / syntax similar to the set builder notation .

Whenever a new node joins , three invariants should be maintained ( the first two ensure correctness and the last one keeps querying fast ) :
Each node 's successor points to its immediate successor correctly . Each key is stored in s u c c e s s o r ( k ) { \ displaystyle successor ( k ) } . Each node 's finger table should be correct .
Initialize node n { \ displaystyle n } ( the predecessor and the finger table ) . Notify other nodes to update their predecessors and finger tables . The new node takes over its responsible keys from its successor .
Notify ( ) : notifies n 's successor of its existence , so it can change its predecessor to n Fix _ fingers ( ) : updates finger tables
With high probability , Chord contacts O ( log ⁡ N ) { \ displaystyle O ( \ log N ) } nodes to find a successor in an N { \ displaystyle N } -node network .
The pseudocode to find the successor node of an id is given below :
The pseudocode to stabilize the chord ring / circle after node joins and departures is as follows :

Horch [ hɔʁç ] was a car brand manufactured in Germany by August Horch & Cie , at the beginning of the 20th century .
It is the direct ancestor of the present day Audi company , which in turn came out of Auto Union , formed in 1932 when Horch merged with DKW , Wanderer and the historic Audi enterprise which August Horch founded in 1910 .

August Horch and his first business partner Salli Herz established the company on November 14 , 1899 in the district of Ehrenfeld , Cologne in Cologne . [ 1 ] August Horch had previously worked as a production manager for Karl Benz .
Three years later , in 1902 , he moved the company to Reichenbach im Vogtland .
On May 10 , 1904 he founded the Horch & Cie . Motorwagenwerke AG , a joint @-@ stock company in Zwickau ( Kingdom of Saxony ) .
The city of Zwickau was the capital of the South Western Saxon County and one of Saxony 's industrial centres at that time .
In 1932 both companies from Zwickau ( Horch and Audi ) merged with Zschopauer Motorenwerke J. S. Rasmussen ( the DKW brand ) and the Wanderer car @-@ production facilities to become the Auto Union corporation of Saxony .
The company initially began producing 5 hp ( 3.7 kW ; 5.1 PS ) and 10 hp ( 7.5 kW ; 10 PS ) twin @-@ cylinder engine automobiles near Cologne in 1901 .
The firm soon ran into financial troubles , not surprising considering the pioneering nature of the automobile business at that time . Horch had to seek new partners .
In March 1902 , August Horch produced a 20 hp ( 15 kW ; 20 PS ) four @-@ cylinder car with a shaft drive in Reichenbach in Vogtland .
Horch cars were considered more advanced and superior to those being then built by Mercedes or Benz ( who were then separate manufacturers ) .
By 1903 , Horch had built a car with a four @-@ cylinder engine . In March of the following year , he introduced his new car at the Frankfurt Fair .

In 1904 , August Horch developed the first six @-@ cylinder engine , which appeared in 1907 .
In 1906 a Horch automobile driven by Dr. Rudolf Stöss from Zwickau won the Herkomer Competition ( equivalent to a ' brand @-@ name ' world championship at the time ) .
In 1923 , Paul Daimler ( a Stauss associate ) worked for Horch as the chief engineer for 8 @-@ cylinder engines . Horch vehicles were subsequently the first to introduce 8 @-@ cylinder engines in series production .
In 1909 , the supervisory board ( the German equivalent of the Board of Directors ) of the corporation forced out Horch .
In 1928 , the company was acquired by Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen , owner of DKW ( from the German Dampfkraftwagen , or steam engine vehicle ) who had bought the remains of the US automobile manufacturer Rickenbacker in the same year .
The Rickenbacker purchase included their manufacturing equipment for eight @-@ cylinder engines .
Eventually , on 29 June 1932 , Horch , Audi , DKW and Wanderer merged to form the Auto Union AG , Chemnitz affiliated group . The current Audi four @-@ ring logo is the Auto Union logo that represents the merger of these four brands .
In the 1930s , Horch introduced a new line of smaller and cheaper , but still presentable , V8 automobiles .
In 1936 , Horch presented the 25,000th 8 @-@ cylinder luxury car in Zwickau .
The Auto Union Grand Prix racing cars types A to D , were developed and built by a specialist racing department of Horch works in Zwickau between 1933 and 1939 .
Between 1935 and 1937 Auto Union cars won 25 races , driven by Ernst von Delius , Tazio Nuvolari , Bernd Rosemeyer , Hans Stuck and Achille Varzi .
11 . Auto Union became a major supplier of vehicles to the German Wehrmacht , such as Heavy standard passenger car ( Horch 108 ) , Medium standard passenger car ( Horch 901 and Wanderer 901 ) and Half @-@ track Sd.Kfz. Civilian production was suspended after March 1940 .
Daimler @-@ Benz retained the trademark rights to the Horch brand until the mid 1980s .
From 1955 @-@ 1958 , old Horch factories produced the Horch P240 , a 6 @-@ cylinder car that was respected at the time .
The former Horch and Audi operations from Zwickau were unified in 1958 . A new brand , Sachsenring , within the East German corporation IFA was born .
After unification in 1958 , the P240 car was renamed as the Sachsenring P240 . As the Soviet Administration inexplicably banned the foreign exportation of the P240 , the East German economic administration decided to stop production of the vehicle .
IFA also produced the initial Trabant " P @-@ 50 " model from 1957 . [ 3 ]
The Zwickau site was acquired in 1991 by Volkswagen , effectively restoring its connection with Audi .
On June 24 , 2006 , a rare 1937 Horch 853A Sport Cabriolet in original unrestored , unprepared condition sold at auction in Cortland NY for $ 299,000 US . [ 4 ]

Water as a dielectric
Notes
A water capacitor is a device that uses water as its dielectric insulating medium .
A capacitor is designed to store electric energy when disconnected from its charging source . Compared to more conventional devices , water capacitors are currently not practical devices for industrial applications . Capacitance can be increased by the addition of electrolytes and minerals to the water , but this increases the self leakage , and cannot be done beyond its saturation point . [ 6 ]

Leukocidin
Genetic analysis shows that PVL CA @-@ MRSA has emerged several times , on different continents , rather than being the worldwide spread of a single clone . [ 17 ]
Panton @-@ Valentine leukocidin ( PVL ) is a cytotoxin - one of the β @-@ pore @-@ forming toxins .
The presence of PVL is associated with increased virulence of certain strains ( isolates ) of Staphylococcus aureus .
PVL creates pores in the membranes of infected cells .
PVL is produced from the genetic material of a bacteriophage that infects Staphylococcus aureus , making it more virulent . [ 4 ]
It was initially discovered by Van deVelde in 1894 due to its ability to lyse leukocytes .
It was named after Sir Philip Noel Panton and Francis Valentine when they associated it with soft tissue infections in 1932 . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Exotoxins such as PVL constitute essential components of the virulence mechanisms of S. aureus . Nearly all strains secrete lethal factors that convert host tissues into nutrients required for bacterial growth . [ 7 ]

Sleep / wakefulness
Type 1 - inhibited by serotonin . Type 2 - excited by serotonin and adenosine .
Since serotonin and adenosine accumulate during wakefulness [ 7 ] it is likely that type 2 play a role in sleep induction , and type 1 play a role in sleep consolidation .
The remaining third of neurons in the VLPO are excited by norepinephrine . Their role is unclear .
Schematic representation of the Flip @-@ Flop Switch Hypothesis
The secretion of these inhibitory neurotransmitters suppresses the arousal system and results in sleep . The VLPO also receives afferent projections from the DMS nuclei of the arousal system .

Because it seeks to engage in all issues that concern the society , public theology may find itself spread too thin across these issues . As a result , it may fail to engage the issues with sufficient depth and academic rigour because it lacks the necessary subject matter expertise . This overt broadness may also cause public theology to lack a focused approach and method because each issue may require a different methodology . [ 22 ]

The Edwin Smith Papyrus documents ancient Egyptian medicine , including the diagnosis and treatment of injuries .
The medicine of the ancient Egyptians is some of the oldest documented .
This is the earliest surviving version of the Hippocratic Oath the 3rd @-@ century Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2547 .
Until the 19th century , the main sources of information about ancient Egyptian medicine were writings from later in antiquity . The Greek historian Herodotus visited Egypt around 440 BC and wrote extensively of his observations of their medicinal practice .
Pliny the Elder also wrote favorably of them in historical review .
Hippocrates ( the " father of medicine " ) , Herophilos , Erasistratus and later Galen studied at the temple of Amenhotep , and acknowledged the contribution of ancient Egyptian medicine to Greek medicine .
In 1822 , the translation of the Rosetta stone finally allowed the translation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions and papyri , including many related to medical matters ( Egyptian medical papyri ) .
Other documents such as the Hearst papyrus ( 1450 BC ) , and Berlin Papyrus ( 1200 BC ) also provide valuable insight into ancient Egyptian medicine .
Other information comes from the images that often adorn the walls of Egyptian tombs and the translation of the accompanying inscriptions .
Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the Temple of Kom Ombo .
Health related amulets are classified as homeopoetic , phylactic and theophoric . Homeopoetic amulets portray an animal or part of an animal , from which the wearer hopes to gain positive attributes like strength or speed . Phylactic amulets protected against harmful gods and demons .

Darwin 's Black Box
Irreducible complexity and intelligent design
Notes
In 1996 , Behe published his ideas on irreducible complexity in his book Darwin 's Black Box . Behe 's refusal to identify the nature of any proposed intelligent designer frustrates scientists , who see it as a move to avoid any possibility of testing the positive claims of ID while allowing him and the intelligent design movement to distance themselves from some of the more overtly religiously motivated critics of evolution .

Bras and kets as row and column vectors
It is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets , by
Since virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators , it can involve , and often does involve , bra @-@ ket notation . A few examples follow :
Starting from any ket | Ψ ⟩ in this Hilbert space , we can define a complex scalar function of r , known as a wavefunction :
On the left side , Ψ ( r ) is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number ; on the right side , | Ψ ⟩ = ∫ d3r Ψ ( r ) | r ⟩ is a ket .
One occasionally encounters an expression such as
though this is something of an abuse of notation . The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator , acting on kets , that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected into the position basis ,
even though , in the momentum basis , the operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator ( by iħp ) .
A stationary spin @-@ 1 / 2 particle has a two @-@ dimensional Hilbert space . One orthonormal basis is :
where | ↑ z ⟩ is the state with a definite value of the spin operator Sz equal to + 1 / 2 and | ↓ z ⟩ is the state with a definite value of the spin operator Sz equal to − 1 / 2 .
Since these are a basis , any quantum state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination ( i.e. , quantum superposition ) of these two states :
Again , any state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two :
where aψ and bψ are complex numbers .
A different basis for the same Hilbert space is :
defined in terms of Sx rather than Sz .
In vector form , you might write
There are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community , but which might confuse the non @-@ initiated .
( in other words , a function composition ) . This expression is commonly written as ( cf. energy inner product )
If the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side ,
denotes the rank @-@ one operator with the rule
then this expression gives the expectation value , or mean or average value , of the observable represented by operator A for the physical system in the state | ψ ⟩ .
A convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space H is given by the outer product : if ⟨ φ | is a bra and | ψ ⟩ is a ket , the outer product
For a finite @-@ dimensional vector space , the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication :
The outer product is an N × N matrix , as expected for a linear operator .
One of the uses of the outer product is to construct projection operators . Given a ket | ψ ⟩ of norm 1 , the orthogonal projection onto the subspace spanned by | ψ ⟩ is
If A is expressed as an N × N matrix , then A † is its conjugate transpose .
By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the dual space , [ 6 ]
Since bras are linear functionals ,
These rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression ; some examples are as follows :
Bra @-@ ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate ( also called dagger , and denoted † ) of expressions . The formal rules are :
Inner products :
Outer products :
for a Hilbert space H , with respect to the norm from an inner product ⟨ · , · ⟩ .
See quantum entanglement and the EPR paradox for applications of this product .
Consider a complete orthonormal system ( basis ) ,
must be the identity operator , which sends each vector to itself .
From basic functional analysis , it is known that any ket | ψ ⟩ can also be written as
with ⟨ · | · ⟩ the inner product on the Hilbert space .
From the commutativity of kets with ( complex ) scalars , it follows that
The object physicists are considering when using bra @-@ ket notation is a Hilbert space ( a complete inner product space ) .
That is , Let H be a Hilbert space and h ∈ H a vector in H. What physicists would denote by | h ⟩ is the vector itself .
One ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars . Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a ring multiplication .
The right part is called the ket / kɛt / ; it is a vector , typically represented as a column vector and written
The left part is called the bra , / brɑː / ; it is the Hermitian conjugate of the ket with the same label , typically represented as a row vector and is written
A combination of bras , kets , and operators is interpreted using matrix multiplication . A bra and a ket with the same label are Hermitian conjugates of each other .
Bra @-@ ket notation was introduced in 1939 by Paul Dirac [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and is also known as the Dirac notation .
The standard mathematical notation for the inner product , preferred as well by some physicists , expresses exactly the same thing as the bra @-@ ket notation ,
which can also be represented as a matrix multiplication ( i.e. , a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix ) .
If the ket is an element of a vector space , the bra is technically an element of its dual space - see Riesz representation theorem .
For instance , the momentum operator p has the following form ,
where ⟨ A | is called a bra , read as " bra @-@ A , " and | B ⟩ is a ket as above .
For a finite @-@ dimensional vector space , using a fixed orthonormal basis , the inner product can be written as a matrix multiplication of a row vector with a column vector :
Based on this , the bras and kets can be defined as :
and then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies matrix multiplication .
The conjugate transpose ( also called Hermitian conjugate ) of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa :
because if one starts with the bra
then performs a complex conjugation , and then a matrix transpose , one ends up with the ket
In mathematics terminology , the vector space of bras is the dual space to the vector space of kets , and corresponding bras and kets are related by the Riesz representation theorem .
Vectors vs kets
Spinless position @-@ space wave function
Its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread . Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra @-@ ket notation .
Bras and kets can also be configured in other ways , such as the outer product
Bra @-@ ket notation uses a specific notation for inner products :
Bra @-@ ket notation splits this inner product ( also called a " bracket " ) into two pieces , the " bra " and the " ket " :
Bra @-@ ket notation
Bra @-@ ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a Hilbert space .
The mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is based in large part on linear algebra :

Commemoration and use
When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son , the son panics , fearing some kind of retribution . The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship . However , he gradually draws the son closer to him by employing him in successively higher positions , only to tell him of their kinship in the end . [ 26 ] In the Buddhist parable , the father symbolises the Buddha , and the son symbolises any human being .

In many Christian traditions , regular public worship is complemented by worship in private and small groups , such as meditation , prayer and study . [ 3 ] Singing often forms an important part of Christian worship . [ 4 ]

As Levy summarized in the preface of Hackers , the general tenets or principles of hacker ethic include : [ 7 ]

Discourage Black Hat Hacking

Encourage White Hat Hacking
Sharing
and states more precisely that hacking ( which Stallman defines as playful cleverness ) and ethics are two separate issues :
Another sharing of resources occurred when Bob Albrecht provided considerable resources for a non @-@ profit organization called the People 's Computer Company ( PCC ) .
PCC opened a computer center where anyone could use the computers there for fifty cents per hour .
This behavior was not malicious in nature : the MIT hackers did not seek to harm the systems or their users .
This deeply contrasts with the modern , media @-@ encouraged image of hackers who crack secure systems in order to steal information or complete an act of cyber @-@ vandalism .
Throughout writings about hackers and their work processes , a common value of community and collaboration is present . For example , in Levy 's Hackers , each generation of hackers had geographically based communities where collaboration and sharing occurred .
Raymond also notes that the success of Linux coincided with the wide availability of the World Wide Web . The value of community is still in high practice and use today .
Levy identifies several " true hackers " who significantly influenced the hacker ethic . Some well @-@ known " true hackers " include :
Levy 's " third generation " practitioners of hacker ethic include :

In July 2008 , the EWG first published an analysis of over 900 sunscreens . The report concluded that only 15 % of the sunscreens met the group 's criteria for safety and effectiveness . [ 4 ]
The EWG issues various product safety warnings .
Critics of the list have suggested that it significantly overstates the risk to consumers of the listed items , and that the methodology employed in constructing the list " lacks scientific credibility . " [ 14 ]

The internal energy is one of the two cardinal state functions of the state variables of a thermodynamic system .
Though it is a macroscopic quantity , internal energy can be explained in microscopic terms by two theoretical virtual components . One is the microscopic kinetic energy due to the microscopic motion of the system 's particles ( translations , rotations , vibrations ) . The other is the potential energy associated with the microscopic forces , including the chemical bonds , between the particles ; this is for ordinary physics and chemistry .

Authenticated encryption with associated data
Approaches to authenticated encryption
Around the year 2000 , a number of efforts evolved around the notion .
The header part is intended to provide authenticity and integrity protection for networking or storage metadata for which confidentiality is unnecessary , but authenticity is desired .
This is a variant of AE where the data to be encrypted needs both authentication and integrity as opposed to just integrity .
It is required , for example , by network packets . The header needs integrity , but must be visible ; payload , instead , needs integrity and also confidentiality . Both need authenticity .

Overload resolution
The following is a declaration of the concept " EqualityComparable " from the concept @-@ enabled C + + standard library ( which is a separate ISO Technical Specification , ISO / IEC DTS 21425 ) .
A function template constrained on this concept may be declared as follows :
void f ( const EqualityComparable & ) ; / / constrained function template declaration
And may be called as usual
The main uses of concepts are :
Introducing type @-@ checking to template programming Simplified compiler diagnostics for failed template instantiations Selecting function template overloads and class template specializations based on type properties Constraining automatic type deduction
Typical compiler diagnostic without concepts is over 50 lines of output , beginning with a failure to compile an expression that attempts to subtract two iterators :
If concepts are used , the error can be detected and reported in the context of the call :
error : cannot call function ' void std : : sort ( _ RAIter , _ RAIter ) [ with _ RAIter = std : : _ List _ iterator < int > ] ' note : concept ' RandomAccessIterator ( ) ' was not satisfied
Concepts may be used instead of the unconstrained type deduction placeholder auto in variable declarations and function return types :
auto x1 = f ( y ) ; / / the type of x1 is deduced to whatever f returns Sortable x2 = f ( y ) ; / / the type of x2 is deduced , but only compiles if it satisfies Sortable
Concepts , as specified in ISO / IEC TS 19217 : 2015 , are implemented in GCC 6 . [ 2 ]
During the C + + standards committee meeting in March 2016 , the evolution working group moved to merge Concepts into the mainline C + + 17 standard , but the motion was defeated in full committee . [ 3 ]
Concepts v1 was merged into the C + + 20 draft . [ 4 ]
In contrast to this abandoned proposal , the C + + 20 version of Concepts is sometimes referred to as " Concepts Lite . " [ 6 ]

Example
In generic programming , a concept is a description of supported operations on a type , including syntax and semantics . In this way , concepts are related to abstract types but concepts do not require a subtype relationship .
There was a proposal to add concepts as an explicit language feature in C + + 11 , though it was rejected as " not ready . "
Another language implementing something very similar to concepts is Haskell , where the feature is called type classes .
For example , if a type I satisfies the Trivial Iterator concept in C + + , and i is of type I , the following are valid expressions with corresponding semantics : [ 4 ]
I i default construction . * i must be convertible to some type T. i- > m is valid if ( * i ) .m is .

Notes
In a similar fashion , nominal subtyping means that one type is a subtype of another if and only if it is explicitly declared to be so in its definition .
Nominally @-@ typed languages typically enforce the requirement that declared subtypes be structurally compatible ( though Eiffel allows non @-@ compatible subtypes to be declared ) . However , subtypes which are structurally compatible " by accident , " but not declared as subtypes , are not considered to be subtypes .
C + + , C # , Java , Objective @-@ C , Delphi , Swift , and Rust all primarily use both nominal typing and nominal subtyping .
Some nominally @-@ subtyped languages , such as Java and C # , allow classes to be declared final ( or sealed in C # terminology ) , indicating that no further subtyping is permitted .

Early life
Major General John Huston Church ( June 28 , 1892 - November 3 , 1953 ) was a senior officer in the United States Army . He fought in World War I , World War II and in the Korean War . During the latter conflict , he provided assistance to the South Korean Army in the opening days of the war .
At the end of the war , Church decided to continue with his service in the army . He was aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Brigdier General F. C. Marshall in 1920 and , having been promoted to captain , a post as an instructor with the National Guard in Maryland followed .
From 1933 to 1936 , he served in the Philippines .
In 1936 , and by now a major , he returned to the United States to attend the Command and General Staff School for two years . [ 4 ] He later served with the Arizona National Guard as an instructor .
In October 1940 , he became the assistant chief of staff for operations of the 45th Infantry Division . [ 1 ]
From 1948 until 1949 Church served as the deputy chief of Army Field Forces at Fort Monroe , Virginia .
In 1950 , he was serving in General Douglas MacArthur 's headquarters in Tokyo as a section chief . [ 5 ]
After a stubborn fight , the American troops retreated . Dean got separated from his troops and was captured . On July 22 , Church , without a command following the dissolution of ADCOM , was given command of the division . [ 10 ]

In December 1944 , President Roosevelt suspended Executive Order 9066 . Incarcerees were released , often to resettlement facilities and temporary housing , and the camps were shut down by 1946 . [ 4 ]
In 1990 , surviving internees began to receive individual redress payments and a letter of apology . This bill applied to the Japanese Americans and to members of the Aleut people inhabiting the strategic Aleutian islands in Alaska who were also relocated . [ 8 ]

Second derivative power rule
The Laplacian of a function is equal to the divergence of the gradient and the trace of the Hessian matrix .
Chirpyness , second derivative of instantaneous phase
The second derivative of a quadratic function is constant .
On the graph of a function , the second derivative corresponds to the curvature or concavity of the graph . The graph of a function with a positive second derivative is upwardly concave , while the graph of a function with a negative second derivative curves in the opposite way .
The power rule for the first derivative , if applied twice , will produce the second derivative power rule as follows :
That is : The second derivative of a function f ( x ) { \ displaystyle f ( x ) } is usually denoted f ″ ( x ) { \ displaystyle f " ( x ) } .
When using Leibniz 's notation for derivatives , the second derivative of a dependent variable y with respect to an independent variable x is written
This notation is derived from the following formula :
Given the function
the derivative of f is the function
The second derivative of f is the derivative of f ′ , namely
It is possible to write a single limit for the second derivative :
The limit is called the second symmetric derivative . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Note that the second symmetric derivative may exist even when the ( usual ) second derivative does not .
The expression on the right can be written as a difference quotient of difference quotients :
This limit can be viewed as a continuous version of the second difference for sequences .
The sign function is not continuous at zero and therefore the second derivative for x = 0 { \ displaystyle x = 0 } does not exist . But the above limit exists for x = 0 { \ displaystyle x = 0 } :
This quadratic approximation is the second @-@ order Taylor polynomial for the function centered at x = a .
For other well @-@ known cases , see the main article eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative .
The second derivative generalizes to higher dimensions through the notion of second partial derivatives . For a function f : R3 → R , these include the three second @-@ order partials
and the mixed partials
Another common generalization of the second derivative is the Laplacian . This is the differential operator ∇ 2 { \ displaystyle \ nabla ^ { 2 } } defined by

These include Paul Romer , Elhanan Helpman , Bronwyn Hall , W. Brian Arthur , Robert Axtell , Richard R. Nelson , Richard Lipsey , Michael Porter , Keun Lee , Christopher Freeman .
In contrast to neoclassical economics , innovation economics offer differing perspectives on main focus , reasons for economic growth , and the assumptions of context between economic actors :
Concisely , evidence shows that innovation contributes to steady economic growth and rise in per capita income . [ 7 ]
The term ' new institutional economics ' was coined by Oliver Williamson in 1975 . [ 4 ]

Myerson @-@ Satterthwaite theorem
A social choice function f ( ) is dictatorial if one agent always receives his most @-@ favored goods allocation ,
The theorem states that under general conditions any truthfully implementable social choice function must be dictatorial ,
X is finite and contains at least three elements Preferences are rational f ( Θ ) = X { \ displaystyle f ( \ Theta ) = X }
The average distortion of the principal 's surplus must be 0 . To flatten the schedule , find an x { \ displaystyle x } such that its inverse image maps to a θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } interval satisfying the condition above .
Mechanism design studies solution concepts for a class of private @-@ information games .
that a game " designer " chooses the game structure rather than inheriting one that the designer is interested in the game 's outcome
The 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Leonid Hurwicz , Eric Maskin , and Roger Myerson " for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory . " [ 2 ]
A game of mechanism design is a game of private information in which one of the agents , called the principal , chooses the payoff structure . Following Harsanyi ( 1967 ) , the agents receive secret " messages " from nature containing information relevant to payoffs . For example , a message may contain information about their preferences or the quality of a good for sale .
As a benchmark the designer often defines what would happen under full information . Define a social choice function f ( θ ) { \ displaystyle f ( \ theta ) } mapping the ( true ) type profile directly to the allocation of goods received or rendered ,
A proposed mechanism constitutes a Bayesian game ( a game of private information ) , and if it is well @-@ behaved the game has a Bayesian Nash equilibrium . At equilibrium agents choose their reports strategically as a function of type
Simply define a mechanism that would induce agents to choose the same equilibrium . The easiest one to define is for the mechanism to commit to playing the agents ' equilibrium strategies for them .
which is also called the incentive compatibility ( IC ) constraint .

In mathematics , in the area of harmonic analysis , the fractional Fourier transform ( FRFT ) is a family of linear transformations generalizing the Fourier transform .
For any real α , the α @-@ angle fractional Fourier transform of a function ƒ is denoted by F α ( u ) { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal { F } } _ { \ alpha } ( u ) } and defined by
Fractional kernel
and ƒ is determined by ƒ ̂ via the inverse transform F − 1 { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal { F } } ^ { -1 } }
The FrFT provides a family of linear transforms that further extends this definition to handle non @-@ integer powers n = 2α / π of the FT .

Proposal Number & Agreed Value
The Paxos protocol was first published in 1989 and named after a fictional legislative consensus system used on the Paxos island in Greece . [ 4 ] It was later published as a journal article in 1998 . [ 5 ]
In order to simplify the presentation of Paxos , the following assumptions and definitions are made explicit . Techniques to broaden the applicability are known in the literature , and are not covered in this article .
Any of the Acceptors waits for a Prepare message from any of the Proposers . If an Acceptor receives a Prepare message , the Acceptor must look at the identifier number n of the just received Prepare message . There are two cases .
This Accept message should be interpreted as a " request , " as in " Accept this proposal , please ! . "
If an Acceptor receives an Accept message , ( n , v ) , from a Proposer , it must accept it if and only if it has not already promised ( in Phase 1b of the Paxos protocol ) to only consider proposals having an identifier greater than n .
Phase 1a : Prepare
Graphic representation of the flow of messages in the basic Paxos
Phase 2a : Accept
Here , V is the last of ( Va , Vb , Vc ) .
Quorums express the safety ( or consistency ) properties of Paxos by ensuring at least some surviving processor retains knowledge of the results .
In order to guarantee safety ( also called " consistency " ) , Paxos defines three properties and ensures they are always held , regardless of the pattern of failures :
In most deployments of Paxos , each participating process acts in three roles ; Proposer , Acceptor and Learner . [ 14 ] This reduces the message complexity significantly , without sacrificing correctness :

For the subsequent discussion a State Machine will be defined as the following tuple of values [ 2 ] ( See also Mealy machine and Moore Machine ) :
A set of States A set of Inputs A set of Outputs A transition function ( Input × State → State ) An output function ( Input × State → Output ) A distinguished State called Start .
It should be noted that failed replicas are not required to stop ; they may continue operating , including generating spurious or incorrect Outputs .
Faults where a replica sends different values in different directions ( for instance , the correct Output to some of its fellow replicas and incorrect Outputs to others ) are called Byzantine Failures . [ 5 ] Byzantine failures may be random , spurious faults , or malicious , intelligent attacks .
The preceding intuitive discussion implies a simple technique for implementing a fault @-@ tolerant service in terms of a State Machine :
The remainder of this article develops the details of this technique .
Step 1 and 2 are outside the scope of this article .
Step 3 is the critical operation , see Ordering Inputs .
Step 4 is covered by the State Machine Definition .
Step 5 , see Ordering Outputs .
Step 6 , see Auditing and Failure Detection .
The appendix contains discussion on typical extensions used in real @-@ world systems such as Logging , Checkpoints , Reconfiguration , and State Transfer .
A Visible Channel is a communication path between two entities actively participating in the system ( such as clients and servers ) . Example : client to server , server to server
When all communication paths are visible channels and no hidden channels exist , a partial global order ( Causal Order ) may be inferred from the pattern of communications . [ 8 ] [ 10 ] Causal Order may be derived independently by each server .
Inputs to the State Machine may be executed in Causal Order , guaranteeing consistent State and Output for all non @-@ faulty replicas .
In open systems , hidden channels are common and a weaker form of ordering must be used . An order of Inputs may be defined using a voting protocol whose results depend only on the visible channels .
If there is no majority of replicas with the same Output , or if less than a majority of replicas returns an Output , a system failure has occurred . The client response must be the unique Output : FAIL .

Immunologic adjuvants
Adjuvants can enhance the immune response to the antigen in different ways :
Extend the presence of antigen in the blood Help the antigen presenting cells absorb antigen Activate macrophages and lymphocytes Support the production of cytokines
Alum as an adjuvant
Alum was the first aluminium salt used as an adjuvant , but has been almost completely replaced by aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate for commercial vaccines . [ 10 ]
Adjuvants may make vaccines too reactogenic , which often leads to fever . This is often an expected outcome upon vaccination and is usually controlled in infants by over @-@ the @-@ counter medication if necessary .
Adjuvants as stabilizing agents
Although immunological adjuvants have traditionally been viewed as substances that aid the immune response to the antigen , adjuvants have also evolved as substances that can aid in stabilizing formulations of antigens , especially for vaccines administered for animal health . [ 1 ]

Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz ( 1646 @-@ 1716 ) , German philosopher , mathematician , and namesake of this widely used mathematical notation in calculus .
History
Consider y as a function of a variable x , or y = f ( x ) . If this is the case , then the derivative of y with respect to x , which later came to be viewed as the limit
was , according to Leibniz , the quotient of an infinitesimal increment of y by an infinitesimal increment of x , or
where the right hand side is Joseph @-@ Louis Lagrange 's notation for the derivative of f at x .
English mathematicians were encumbered by Newton 's dot notation until 1803 when Robert Woodhouse published a description of the continental notation . Later the Analytical Society at Cambridge University promoted the adoption of Leibniz 's notation .
Suppose a dependent variable y represents a function f of an independent variable x , that is ,
Then the derivative of the function f , in Leibniz 's notation for differentiation , can be written as
The Leibniz expression , also , at times , written dy / dx , is one of several notations used for derivatives and derived functions . A common alternative is Lagrange 's notation
Another alternative is Newton 's notation , often used for derivatives with respect to time ( like velocity ) , which requires placing a dot over the dependent variable ( in this case , x ) :
In its modern interpretation , the expression dy / dx should not be read as the division of two quantities dx and dy ( as Leibniz had envisioned it ) ; rather , the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shorthand for
( note Δ vs. d , where Δ indicates a finite difference ) .

Start with 800 mL of distilled water to dissolve all salts .
Adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl . Add distilled water to a total volume of 1 liter . The resultant 1x PBS should have a final concentration of 10 mM PO43 − , 137 mM NaCl , and 2.7 mM KCl .
The pH of PBS is ~ 7.4 . When making buffer solutions , it is good practice to always measure the pH directly using a pH meter . If necessary , pH can be adjusted using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide .
PBS can also be prepared by using commercially made PBS buffer tablets or pouches . [ 4 ]

The critical decision to use LOR was viewed as vital to ensuring that Man reached the Moon by the end of the decade as proposed by President John F. Kennedy .
In the process , LOR saved time and billions of dollars by efficiently using existing rocket technology .
Diagram of LOR
Lunar orbit rendezvous ( LOR ) is a key concept for efficiently landing humans on the Moon and returning them to Earth . It was utilized for the Project Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s .
In a LOR mission , a main spacecraft and a smaller lunar lander travel to lunar orbit .
Disadvantage
Apollo 11 Lunar Module rendezvousing with Command Module in lunar orbit
Besides requiring less payload , the ability to use a lunar lander designed just for that purpose was another advantage of the LOR approach .
Representation of the lunar gravity well , illustrating how resources needed only for the trip home don 't have to be carried down and back up the " well "
Advocacy
Dr. John Houbolt would not let the advantages of LOR be ignored .
According to Houbolt , these ground rules were constraining NASA 's thinking about the lunar mission - and causing LOR to be ruled out before it was fairly considered . [ 1 ]
A robotic lunar orbit rendezvous is planned for use by the Chinese Chang 'e 5 lunar sample return mission scheduled in 2019 . [ 14 ]

A comfort zone is a psychological state in which things feel familiar to a person and they are at ease and in control of their environment , experiencing low levels of anxiety and stress .
In this zone , a steady level of performance is possible . [ 1 ]
Performance management
-Stepping out of a comfort zone raises anxiety and generates a stress response . This results in an enhanced level of concentration and focus .
Optimal performance management requires maximizing time in the optimum performance zone .

Early life
Jadon Malik Sancho ( born 25 March 2000 ) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund and the England national team .
Adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , also known as adenosine pyrophosphate ( APP ) , is an important organic compound in metabolism and is essential to the flow of energy in living cells .
ADP consists of three important structural components : a sugar backbone attached to adenine and two phosphate groups bonded to the 5 carbon atom of ribose .
The diphosphate group of ADP is attached to the 5 " carbon of the sugar backbone , while the adenosine attaches to the 1 " carbon . [ 1 ]
Glycolysis is performed by all living organisms and consists of 10 steps . The net reaction for the overall process of glycolysis is : [ 6 ]
Citric acid cycle
Oxidative phosphorylation
ADP can be interconverted to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) .
ATP contains one more phosphate group than does ADP . AMP contains one fewer phosphate group .
Energy transfer used by all living things is a result of dephosphorylation of ATP by enzymes known as ATPases .
The cleavage of a phosphate group from ATP results in the coupling of energy to metabolic reactions and a by @-@ product of ADP . [ 1 ] Being the " molecular unit of currency , " ATP is continually being reformed from lower @-@ energy species ADP and AMP .
The biosynthesis of ATP is achieved throughout processes such as substrate @-@ level phosphorylation , oxidative phosphorylation , and photophosphorylation , all of which facilitating the addition of a phosphate group to ADP .
Under normal conditions , small disk @-@ shape platelets circulate in the blood freely and without interaction with one another .
ADP is stored in dense bodies inside blood platelets and is released upon platelet activation .
ADP interacts with a family of ADP receptors found on platelets ( P2Y1 , P2Y12 , and P2X1 ) , which leads to platelet activation . [ 14 ]
P2Y1 receptors initiate platelet aggregation and shape change as a result of interactions with ADP .
P2Y12 receptors further amplify the response to ADP and draw forth the completion of aggregation .
ADP in the blood is converted to adenosine by the action of ecto @-@ ADPases , inhibiting further platelet activation via adenosine receptors .

Catabolism
The ten @-@ step catabolic pathway of glycolysis is the initial phase of free @-@ energy release in the breakdown of glucose and can be split into two phases , the preparatory phase and payoff phase .
Glycolysis overview
When RNA is broken down by living systems , nucleoside monophosphates , including adenosine monophosphate , are formed .
AMP can be regenerated to ATP as follows :
AMP can be converted into IMP by the enzyme myoadenylate deaminase , freeing an ammonia group .
In a catabolic pathway , adenosine monophosphate can be converted to uric acid , which is excreted from the body in mammals . [ 2 ]
Physiological Role in Regulation
AMP / ADP protects AMPK from being inactivated by binding to the γ @-@ subunit and maintaining the dephosphorylation state . [ 9 ]
AMP plays an important role in many cellular metabolic processes , being interconverted to ADP and / or ATP . AMP is also a component in the synthesis of RNA . [ 1 ]

Production and degradation
AMP does not have the high energy phosphoanhydride bond associated with ADP and ATP .
AMP can be produced from ADP :
Or AMP may be produced by the hydrolysis of one high energy phosphate bond of ADP :
AMP can also be formed by hydrolysis of ATP into AMP and pyrophosphate :
When the data are roughly elliptically distributed and there are no prominent outliers , the Spearman correlation and Pearson correlation give similar values .
The Spearman correlation is less sensitive than the Pearson correlation to strong outliers that are in the tails of both samples . That is because Spearman 's rho limits the outlier to the value of its rank .
The Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ranked variables . [ 3 ]
N.B. : the figure in the center has a slope of 0 but in that case the correlation coefficient is undefined because the variance of Y is zero .
Pearson 's correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations . The form of the definition involves a " product moment , " that is , the mean ( the first moment about the origin ) of the product of the mean @-@ adjusted random variables ; hence the modifier product @-@ moment in the name .
For a population
Pearson 's correlation coefficient when applied to a population is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ ( rho ) and may be referred to as the population correlation coefficient or the population Pearson correlation coefficient . Given a pair of random variables ( X , Y ) { \ displaystyle ( X , Y ) } , the formula for ρ [ 7 ] is :

Between about 1880 and 1950 TAA was used as an anesthetic with the contemporary name of amylene hydrate .
In 1930 's [ 16 ] TAA was mainly used as a solvent for tribromoethanol ( TBE ) , forming Avertin at a 0.5 : 1 volume ratio of TAA to TBE .
TAA was rarely used as a sole hypnotic because of the existence of more efficient drugs . [ 2 ] Avertin is a brand @-@ name for now discontinued TAA and TBE solution made by Winthrop Laboratories . [ 16 ]
Tertiary alcohols like TAA generally can not be oxidised to aldehyde or carboxylic acid [ 17 ] metabolites which are often toxic ( e.g. acetaldehyde and formic acid from ethanol and methanol ) .
Nowadays TAA has found use as a recreational drug . [ 1 ]
Use and effects

First Naval Area Command : responsible for the northern part of Gulf of Thailand Second Naval Area Command : responsible for the southern part of Gulf of Thailand Third Naval Area Command : responsible for the Andaman Sea ( Indian Ocean )
Personnel were initially drawn from the Royal Thai Marine Corps , but are now being recruited directly .
The First Coastal Defence Regiment is based near the Marine Corps facility at Sattahip . The First Air Defence Regiment was near the Naval Air Wing at Utapao .
Coastal Defence Command was greatly expanded in 1992 , following the government 's decision in 1988 to charge the RTN with the responsibility of defending the entire eastern seaboard and Southern Seaboard Development Project . The Second Air Defence Regiment , based at Songkhla , was then formed the following year . Some analysts believe that this element will eventually grow to a strength of up to 15,000 personnel .

Historical
Historical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ciphers . They include simple substitution ciphers ( such as Rot 13 ) and transposition ciphers ( such as a Rail Fence Cipher ) .
Modern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria : by type of key used , and by type of input data .
By type of key used ciphers are divided into :
symmetric key algorithms ( Private @-@ key cryptography ) , where the same key is used for encryption and decryption , and asymmetric key algorithms ( Public @-@ key cryptography ) , where two different keys are used for encryption and decryption .
In an asymmetric key algorithm ( e.g. , RSA ) , there are two separate keys : a public key is published and enables any sender to perform encryption , while a private key is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct decryption .
Ciphers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data :
block ciphers , which encrypt block of data of fixed size , and stream ciphers , which encrypt continuous streams of data
Key size and vulnerability
In a pure mathematical attack , ( i.e. , lacking any other information to help break a cipher ) two factors above all count :

Traces of Semtex , TNT , white phosphorus , PETN , and RDX were found in the wreckage . [ 2 ]
Samples of semtex and other plastic explosives
Semtex is a general @-@ purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and PETN . [ 1 ] It is used in commercial blasting , demolition , and in certain military applications .
The new explosive was widely exported , notably to the government of North Vietnam , which received 14 tons during the Vietnam War .
Exports fell after the name became closely associated with terrorist attacks .
According to the manufacturer , even this untagged Semtex can now be detected . [ 8 ] The shelf life of Semtex was reduced from ten years before the 1990s to five years now .

The composition of the two most common variants differ according to their use .
The 1A ( or 10 ) variant is used for blasting , and is based mostly on crystalline PETN .
The version 1AP and 2P are formed as hexagonal booster charges ; a special assembly of PETN and wax inside the charge assures high reliability for detonating cord or detonator .
The H ( or SE ) variant is intended for explosion hardening . [ 4 ]

Introduction
Loss functions
Different loss functions are used depending on whether the problem is one of regression or one of classification .
Regression
The most common loss function for regression is the square loss function ( also known as the L2 @-@ norm ) . This familiar loss function is used in Ordinary Least Squares regression . The form is :
The absolute value loss ( also known as the L1 @-@ norm ) is also sometimes used :
where θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } is the Heaviside step function .
One example of regularization is Tikhonov regularization .

When the directivity D { \ displaystyle D } of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum directivity in any direction , namely
Summary
where Zin is the feedpoint impedance .
Published numbers for antenna gain are almost always expressed in decibels ( dB ) , a logarithmic scale . From the gain factor G , one finds the gain in decibels as :
Partial gain
As a result of this definition , we can conclude that the total gain of an antenna is the sum of partial gains for any two orthogonal polarizations .
Power gain ( or simply gain ) is a unitless measure that combines an antenna 's efficiency Eantenna and directivity D :
Suppose a lossless antenna has a radiation pattern given by :
Let us find the gain of such an antenna .
Solution :
First we find the peak radiation intensity of this antenna :
The total radiated power can be found by integrating over all directions :
Since the antenna is specified as being lossless the radiation efficiency is 1 . The maximum gain is then equal to :
Expressed relative to the gain of a half @-@ wave dipole we would find :
Realized gain
Gain may be expressed as absolute gain if further clarification is required to differentiate it from realized gain . [ 1 ]
The notions of efficiency and directivity depend on the following .
Total radiated power is the sum of all RF power radiated by the antenna when the source power is included in the measurement .
TRP is expressed in Watts , or equivalent logarithmic expressions , often dBm or dBW . [ 2 ]
TRP can be measured while in the close proximity of power @-@ absorbing losses such as the body and hand of the Mobile Device Under Test User . [ 3 ]
The TRP can be used to determine Body Loss ( BoL ) . The Body Loss is considered as the ratio of TRP measured in the presence of losses and TRP measured while in free space .

Route map of the world 's scheduled commercial airline traffic , 2009
Commercial aviation is the part of civil aviation ( both general aviation and scheduled airline services ) that involves operating aircraft for hire to transport passengers or multiple loads of cargo .
After World War II , commercial aviation grew rapidly , using mostly ex @-@ military aircraft to transport people and cargo .
The experience used in designing heavy bombers such as the B @-@ 29 and Avro Lancaster could be used for designing heavy commercial aircraft .
The DC @-@ 3 also made for easier and longer commercial flights . The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British de Havilland Comet .

A domestic airport is an airport that handles only domestic flights - flights within the same country . Domestic airports do not have customs and immigration facilities and so cannot handle flights to or from a foreign airport .
Most municipal airports in Canada and the United States are of this classification . At international airports in Canada , there are domestic terminals that handle flights within Canada ( flying from one Canadian city to another ) .
Additionally , some airports that are named " international " are essentially domestic airports that do not handle international traffic on a regular basis . Many of these airports are located through the United States .
In the United Kingdom , an example of a domestic airport is Wick Airport , which operates frequent flights to other Scottish airports .

DMARC ( Domain @-@ based Message Authentication , Reporting and Conformance ) is an email authentication protocol . It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use , commonly known as email spoofing .
The purpose and primary outcome of implementing DMARC is to protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks , phishing emails , email scams and other cyber threat activities .
DMARC operates by checking that the domain in the message 's From : field ( also called " 5322.From " ) is " aligned " with other authenticated domain names .
If either SPF or DKIM alignment checks pass , then the DMARC alignment test passes .
Like SPF and DKIM , DMARC uses the concept of a domain owner , the entity or entities that are authorized to make changes to a given DNS domain .
SPF checks that the IP address of the sending server is authorized by the owner of the domain that appears in the SMTP MAIL FROM command .
( The email address in MAIL FROM is also called envelope @-@ from or 5321.MailFrom. ) In addition to requiring that the SPF check pass , DMARC additionally checks that 5321.MailFrom aligns with 5322.From.
DKIM allows parts of an email message to be cryptographically signed , and the signature must cover the From field .
There may be several DKIM signatures on an email message ; DMARC requires one valid signature where the domain in the d = tag aligns with the sender 's domain stated in the From : header field .
DMARC records are published in DNS with a subdomain label _ dmarc , for example _ dmarc.example.com. Compare this to SPF at example.com , and DKIM at selector . _ domainkey.example.com.
For example : The content of the TXT resource record consists of name = value tags , separated by semicolons , similar to SPF and DKIM .
Aggregate reports
For example : example.com ! example.org ! 1475712000 ! 1475798400.xml.gz.
DMARC records can also be directly transformed in HTML by applying an XSL stylesheet .
DMARC is defined in RFC 7489 , dated March 2015 , as " Informational . " [ 1 ]
These policies are published in the public Domain Name System ( DNS ) as text TXT records .
Under DMARC a message can fail even if it passes SPF or DKIM , but fails alignment . [ 1 ]
Setting up DMARC may have a positive impact on deliverability for legitimate senders . [ 4 ]

The mechanism of · OH production ( Part 1 ) highly depends on the sort of AOP technique that is used . For example , ozonation , UV / H2O2 and photocatalytic oxidation rely on different mechanisms of · OH generation :
H2O2 + UV → 2 · OH ( homolytic bond cleavage of the O @-@ O bond of H2O2 leads to formation of 2 · OH radicals )
AOPs hold several advantages that are unparalleled in the field of water treatment :
Current shortcomings
It should be realised that AOPs are not perfect and have several drawbacks . [ 10 ]

Chemical principles
Generally speaking , chemistry in AOPs could be essentially divided into three parts : [ 7 ]
Formation of · OH ; Initial attacks on target molecules by · OH and their breakdown to fragments ; Subsequent attacks by · OH until ultimate mineralization .
Luminosities are obtained from photometric observations , correcting the observed brightness of the object for the distance dimming and extinction effects . In general , unless a complete spectrum of the radiation emitted by the object is obtained , a model must be extrapolated through either power law or blackbody fits . The luminosity thus obtained is known as the bolometric luminosity .
Masses are often calculated from the dynamics of the virialized system or from gravitational lensing .
Typical mass @-@ to @-@ light ratios for galaxies range from 2 to 10 ϒ ☉ while on the largest scales , the mass to light ratio of the observable universe is approximately 100 ϒ ☉ , in concordance with the current best fit cosmological model .

June 1972 advertisement for MITS Model 1440 Calculator
The first product was a " four @-@ function " calculator that could add , subtract , multiply , and divide . The display was only eight digits , but the calculations were performed with 16 digits precision .
The MITS Model 816 calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics . [ 1 ] The kit sold for $ 179 and an assembled unit was $ 275 .
Unlike the previous kits that MITS had offered , thousands of calculator orders came in each month . [ 19 ]
MITS was now $ 300,000 in debt , and Roberts was looking for a new hit product . [ 22 ]
May 1975 advertisement for the Altair 8800 computer kit
Roberts decided to return to the kit market with a low cost computer . The target customer would think that " some assembly required " was a desirable feature .
MITS products typically had generic names such as the Model 1440 Calculator or the Model 1600 Digital Voltmeter . The editors of Popular Electronics wanted a more alluring name for the computer .
MITS technical writer David Bunnell came up with three pages of possible names , but Roberts was too busy finishing the computer design to choose one .
When the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics reached readers in mid @-@ December 1974 , MITS was flooded with orders . [ 31 ] They had to hire extra people just to answer the phones .
In February , MITS received 1,000 orders for the Altair 8800 . The quoted delivery time was 60 days , but it was many more months before the machines were shipped .
By August 1975 , they had shipped over 5,000 computers . [ 32 ]
The Altair 8800 computer was a break @-@ even sale for MITS . They needed to sell additional memory boards , I / O boards , and other options to make a profit .
There were several design and component problems in the MITS 4K Dynamic RAM board .
MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976 .
Several other companies started making add @-@ in boards and the first clone , the IMSAI 8080 , was available in December 1975 . [ 35 ]
Altair 8K BASIC on paper tape . Bill Gates gave Paul Allen a paper tape containing BASIC to take to MITS .
They entered several small programs and they worked . The BASIC interpreter was not complete and crashed several times , but Roberts had a high level language for his computer . Roberts hired Allen as Vice President and Director of Software at MITS . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Bill Gates also worked at MITS ; the October 1975 company newsletter gives his title as " Software Specialist . " [ 40 ]
MITS would supply the computer time necessary for development on a PDP @-@ 10 owned by the Albuquerque school district . [ 42 ]
MITS realized that BASIC was a competitive advantage and bundled the software with computer hardware sales . Customers who purchased the computer , memory , and I / O boards from MITS could get BASIC for $ 75 ; the standalone price was $ 500 .
Sale to Pertec
In 1976 , MITS had 230 employees and sales of $ 6 million . [ 44 ] Roberts was tiring of his management responsibilities and was looking for a larger partner .

GTP ' ( GTP prime ) is an IP based protocol used within GSM and UMTS networks .
It can be used with UDP or TCP .
GTP ' uses the same message structure as GTP ( GTP @-@ C , GTP @-@ U ) , but it is largely a separate protocol .
GTP ' uses registered UDP / TCP port 3386 .
GTP ' uses the GTP Version Not Supported , Echo Request and Echo Response messages unchanged , but adds the following messages
The Redirection messages are used to :
In either case the CDFs are given more information about an impending or immediate failure than would be the case if the CDF was polling using Echo Request messages .
This message contains details about the cause , and optionally address ( es ) of an alternate CGF .
GTP ' is used on the Ga interface within the 3GPP GPRS Core Network definition .
The Data Record Transfer messages are used to reliably transport CDRs from the point of generation ( SGSN / GGSN ) to non @-@ volatile storage in the CGF .
Each Data Record Transfer Request message can contain a message of one of four types :
Send Data Record Packet - This message contains zero or more CDRs .
Release Data Record Packet - This message orders the CGF to write the contents of one or more Data Record Packets from the CGF " possibly duplicated " pending queue .
The Data Record Transfer Response acknowledges receipt of one or more Data Record Transfer messages ; responses can be grouped for reasons of efficiency but must be sent more frequently than the sending CDFs timeout .
The acknowledgement includes a cause and can be a rejection of the contained records .
Direct access to the numbered 3GPP specifications Open source Charging Gateway Function ( CGF )
Header
GTP ' v1 and v2 headers contain the following fields
+ Bits 0 @-@ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 @-@ 15 16 @-@ 31 32 @-@ 47 0 Version PT [ 0 ] Reserved Hdr len Message Type Length Sequence Number
Version The first header field in a GTP ' packet is the 3 @-@ bit version field . For GTP ' v2 , this has a value of 2 ( hence the name GTP ' v2 ) . Protocol Type ( PT ) a 1 @-@ bit value that differentiates GTP ' ( value 0 ) from GTP ( value 1 ) .

In 3GPP architectures , GTP and Proxy Mobile IPv6 based interfaces are specified on various interface points .
GTP can be decomposed into separate protocols , GTP @-@ C , GTP @-@ U and GTP ' .
GTPv1 headers contain the following fields : [ 1 ]
This field exists if any of the E , S , or PN bits are on . N @-@ PDU number an ( optional ) 8 @-@ bit field . The field must be interpreted only if the PN bit is on .
Next Extension Headers are as follows :
+ Bits 0 @-@ 7 8 @-@ 23 24 @-@ 31 0 Extension length Contents ... ... ... Contents Next extension header
It is also known as evolved @-@ GTP or eGTP .
GTPv2 @-@ C headers contain the following fields : [ 2 ]
There is no GTPv2 @-@ U protocol , GTP @-@ U in LTE also uses GTPv1 @-@ U.
Version It is a 3 @-@ bit field .
The TEID ( if present ) and the Sequence Number shall be included in the length count .
Apart from the common message structure , there is also a common mechanism for verifying connectivity from one GSN to another GSN . This uses two messages .
Apart from the two messages previously mentioned , there are no other messages common across all GTP variants [ 3 ] meaning that , for the most part , they effectively form three completely separate protocols .
It also controls forwarding relocation messages ; SRNS context and creating forward tunnels during inter LTE handovers .
GTP @-@ U is used for carrying user data within the GPRS core network and between the radio access network and the core network . The user data transported can be packets in any of IPv4 , IPv6 , or PPP formats .
GTP @-@ U is , in effect a relatively simple IP based tunneling protocol which permits many tunnels between each set of end points .
When used in the UMTS , each subscriber will have one or more tunnel , one for each PDP context that they have active , as well as possibly having separate tunnels for specific connections with different quality of service requirements .
The GTPv1 @-@ U protocol is used to exchange user data over GTP tunnels across the Sx interfaces .
An IP packet for a UE is encapsulated in an GTPv1 @-@ U packet and tunneled between the P @-@ GW and the eNodeB for transmission with respect to a UE over S1 @-@ U and S5 / S8 interfaces .
GTP ' - charging transfer
The GTP ' protocol is used to transfer charging data to the Charging Gateway Function .
GTP ' uses TCP / UDP port 3386 .
Within the GPRS core network
Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network .
GTP ' ( GTP prime ) uses the same message structure as GTP @-@ C and GTP @-@ U , but has an independent function .
GTP can be used with UDP or TCP .
GTP version 1 is used only on UDP .
GTP @-@ U is also used to transport user data from the RNC to the SGSN in UMTS networks . However , in this case signalling is done using RANAP instead of GTP @-@ C.
The original version of GTP ( version 0 ) had considerable differences from the current versions ( versions 1,2 ) :
Different GTP variants are implemented by RNCs , SGSNs , GGSNs and CGFs within 3GPP networks .
GPRS mobile stations ( MSs ) are connected to a SGSN without being aware of GTP .
GTP was originally standardized within ETSI ( GSM standard 09.60 ) .
With the creation of the UMTS standards this was moved over to the 3GPP which , as of 2005 [ update ] maintains it as 3GPP standard 29.060 .
GTP ' uses the same message format , but its special uses are covered in standard 32.295 along with the standardized formats for the charging data it transfers .
Later versions of TS 29.060 deprecate GTPv1 / v0 interworking such that there is no fallback in the event that the GSN does not support the higher version .
GTPv2 ( for evolved packet services ) went into draft in early 2008 and was released in December of that year .
GTPv2 offers fallback to GTPv1 via the earlier " Version Not Supported " mechanism but explicitly offers no support for fallback to GTPv0 .
GTP can be used with UDP or TCP . UDP is either recommended or mandatory , except for tunneling X.25 in version 0 .
GTP version 1 is used only on UDP .
GSM standard 09.60 , ETSI , 1996 @-@ 98 , this standard covers the original version 0 of GTP .
General features
All variants of GTP have certain features in common . The structure of the messages is the same , with a GTP header following the UDP / TCP header .
Nocturnes ( L. 91 ) , sometimes Trois Nocturnes or Three Nocturnes , is an orchestral composition in three movements by the French composer Claude Debussy . It was completed on 15 December 1899 .
'Fêtes ' gives us the vibrating , dancing rhythm of the atmosphere with sudden flashes of light .
'Sirènes ' depicts the sea and its countless rhythms and presently , amongst the waves silvered by the moonlight , is heard the mysterious song of the Sirens as they laugh and pass on . [ 4 ]
Instrumentation
Arrangements
The complete work was transcribed for two pianos by Maurice Ravel .
Fêtes was arranged for solo piano by the English pianist Leonard Borwick , and the arrangement has been recorded by Emil Gilels , among others . [ 1 ] Fêtes has also been transcribed for large symphonic wind ensemble by Merlin Patterson and William Schaefer .
Movements
The three movements are :
The three movements were inspired by a series of impressionist paintings , also entitled Nocturnes by James Abbott McNeill Whistler . [ 1 ]
Debussy wrote an " introductory note " to Nocturnes as follows :
LifeScan , Inc. is a diagnostic systems manufacturer with products focusing on the diabetes market , specifically blood glucose monitoring systems .
LifeScan manufactures and markets the OneTouch Ultra and One Touch Verio families of products for home use . [ 1 ] The company philosophy is to " create a world without limits for people with diabetes . "
During its existence , LifeScan revolutionized blood glucose monitoring by introduction of its " One Touch " systems .
The work is in four movements :
The Scherzo and its trio are particularly brief . The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform . The name " Spring Sonata " was given to it after Beethoven 's death .
The Allegro movement is featured in the stage show Fame and in the syllabus of grade 8 of ABRSM 's bowed strings exam from 2016 till 2019 [ 2 ] .

The Heinz dilemma is a frequently used example in many ethics and morality classes . One well @-@ known version of the dilemma , used in Lawrence Kohlberg 's stages of moral development , is stated as follows [ 1 ] :
Stage five ( social contract orientation ) : Heinz should steal the medicine because everyone has a right to choose life , regardless of the law .
Or : Heinz should not steal the medicine because the scientist has a right to fair compensation . Even if his wife is sick , it does not make his actions right .
Stage six ( universal human ethics ) : Heinz should steal the medicine , because saving a human life is a more fundamental value than the property rights of another person .
Or : Heinz should not steal the medicine , because others may need the medicine just as badly , and their lives are equally significant .
References
Stage one ( obedience ) : Heinz should not steal the medicine because he will consequently be put in prison which will mean he is a bad person .
Or : Heinz should steal the medicine because it is only worth $ 200 and not how much the druggist wanted for it ; Heinz had even offered to pay for it and was not stealing anything else .
Stage two ( self @-@ interest ) : Heinz should steal the medicine because he will be much happier if he saves his wife , even if he will have to serve a prison sentence .
Or : Heinz should not steal the medicine because prison is an awful place , and he would more likely languish in a jail cell than over his wife 's death .
Stage three ( conformity ) : Heinz should steal the medicine because his wife expects it ; he wants to be a good husband .
Or : Heinz should not steal the drug because stealing is bad and he is not a criminal ; he has tried to do everything he can without breaking the law , you cannot blame him .
Stage four ( law @-@ and @-@ order ) : Heinz should not steal the medicine because the law prohibits stealing , making it illegal .

In 1949 , Prokofiev attended a concert in which Mstislav Rostropovich performed Nikolai Miaskovsky 's Cello Sonata No. 2 in A minor , Op. 81 . [ 1 ] Prokofiev was so impressed by Rostropovich 's performance that he was determined to write a Cello Sonata for him .
The sonata is structured in three movements :
A typical performance lasts for about 25 minutes .
The work was premiered on March 1 , 1950 in the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory with Rostropovich as soloist and with Sviatoslav Richter at the piano . In his memoirs Richter wrote :
( TEM cryomicroscopy technique ) - S. aureus forms a fibrin capsule that protects it from the immune system of cattle
A fibrin clot formed in a test tube by the coagulase reaction
If ' positive ' ( e.g. , the suspect colony is S. aureus ) , the plasma will coagulate , [ 6 ] resulting in a clot ( sometimes the clot is so pronounced , the liquid will completely solidify ) . If ' negative ' , the plasma remains a liquid . The negative result may be S. epidermidis but only a more detailed identification test can confirm this , using biochemical tests as in analytical profile index tests methods .
It is also produced by Yersinia pestis . [ 3 ]
If ' positive ' , macroscopic clumping would be observed in the plasma within 10 seconds , with no clumping in the saline drop . If ' negative ' , no clumping will be observed .

Most Romantic period sonatas were highly influenced by those of Beethoven . After 1804 , Beethoven ceased publishing sonatas in sets and only composed them as a single opus . It is unclear why he did so .
Opus 53 : Piano Sonata No. 21 in C major ( " Waldstein " ) ( 1803 ) WoO 57 : Andante favori - Original middle movement of the " Waldstein " sonata ( 1804 )
The " Hammerklavier " was deemed to be Beethoven 's most difficult sonata yet . In fact , it was considered unplayable until almost 15 years later , when Liszt played it in a concert .
Glenn Gould , Sviatoslav Richter , and Rudolf Serkin recorded selected sonatas , but never recorded the complete series .

On 1 October 1961 the first full @-@ scale television station , HLKA @-@ TV ( now known as KBS 1TV ) , was established and began operation under the Ministry of Culture and Public Information .
Following KBS was Tongyang Broadcasting Corporation 's TBC @-@ TV which was launched in 1964 , and ran until merged in 1980 . It was the first private television network in South Korea .

Glucose transporter type 4 ( GLUT @-@ 4 ) , also known as solute carrier family 2 , facilitated glucose transporter member 4 , is a protein encoded , in humans , by the SLC2A4 gene .
As muscles contract , they use ATP .
The energy needed to make ATP comes from a variety of different pathways - such as glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation - that ultimately use glucose as a starting material . [ 13 ]
In striated skeletal muscle cells , GLUT4 concentration in the plasma membrane can increase as a result of either exercise or muscle contraction .
In order to increase glucose levels in the cell , GLUT4 is the primary transporter used in this facilitated diffusion . [ 14 ]
Although muscle contractions function in a similar way and also induce the translocation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane , the two skeletal muscle processes obtain different forms of intracellular GLUT4 .
An analysis of mRNA levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in cardiac muscles show that GLUT1 plays a larger role in cardiac muscles than it does in skeletal muscles . [ 18 ] GLUT4 , however , is still believed to be the primary transporter for glucose . [ 19 ]
Much like in other tissues , GLUT4 also responds to insulin signaling , and is transported into the plasma membrane to facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell . [ 20 ]
If GLUT4 is over @-@ expressed , it can actually alter nutrient distribution and send excess glucose into adipose tissue , leading to increased adipose tissue mass . [ 23 ]
Regulation
When glucose in the blood binds to glucose receptors on the beta cell membrane , a signal cascade is initiated inside the cell that results in insulin stored in vesicles in these cells being released into the blood stream . [ 25 ] Increased insulin levels cause the uptake of glucose into the cells . GLUT4 is stored in the cell in transport vesicles , and is quickly incorporated into the plasma membrane of the cell when insulin binds to membrane receptors . [ 3 ]
PI @-@ 3 kinase converts the membrane lipid PIP2 to PIP3 .
Inhibition of the GTPase @-@ activating domain leaves proteins next in the cascade in their active form , and stimulates GLUT4 to be expressed on the plasma membrane . [ 28 ]
RAC1 is a GTPase also activated by insulin .
Rac1 stimulates reorganization of the cortical Actin cytoskeleton [ 29 ] which allows for the GLUT4 vesicles to be inserted into the plasma membrane . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] A RAC1 Knockout mouse has reduced glucose uptake in muscle tissue . [ 31 ]
Knockout mice that are heterozygous for GLUT4 develop insulin resistance in their muscles as well as diabetes . [ 32 ]
Muscle stretching
Muscle stretching also stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in rodent muscle via RAC1 . [ 38 ]

GLUT4 also contains a UBX @-@ domain .
These are ubiquitin @-@ regulatory regions that can assist with cell signaling . [ 10 ]

Accessed 25 December 2009 .
Like all proteins , the unique amino acid arrangement in the primary sequence of GLUT4 is what allows it to transport glucose across the plasma membrane .
In addition to the phenylalanine on the N @-@ terminus , two Leucine residues and acidic motifs on the COOH @-@ terminus are believed to play a key role in the kinetics of endocytosis and exocytosis . [ 11 ]

N @-@ terminal modifications
N @-@ terminal acetylation
N @-@ terminal acetylation is a form of protein modification that can occur in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes .
It has been suggested that N @-@ terminal acetylation can prevent a protein from following a secretory pathway . [ 4 ]
N @-@ Myristoylation
The N @-@ terminus can be modified by the addition of a myristoyl anchor . Proteins that are modified this way contain a consensus motif at their N @-@ terminus as a modification signal .
N @-@ Acylation
The N @-@ terminus can also be modified by the addition of a fatty acid anchor to form N @-@ acylated proteins . The most common form of such modification is the addition of a palmitoyl group .
N @-@ terminal targeting signals
Signal peptide
One form of C @-@ terminal modification is prenylation . During prenylation , a farnesyl- or geranylgeranyl @-@ isoprenoid membrane anchor is added to a cysteine residue near the C @-@ terminus . Small , membrane @-@ bound G proteins are often modified this way .
Another form of C @-@ terminal modification is the addition of a phosphoglycan , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) , as a membrane anchor .
The GPI anchor is attached to the C @-@ terminus after proteolytic cleavage of a C @-@ terminal propeptide . The most prominent example for this type of modification is the prion protein .

Function
Recombinases are genetic recombination enzymes .
Site specific recombinases
RecA recombinase appears to be universally present in bacteria .
RecA has multiple functions , all related to DNA repair .
RecA has a central role in the repair of replication forks stalled by DNA damage and in the bacterial sexual process of natural genetic transformation . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Eukaryotic Rad51 and its related family members are homologous to the archaeal RadA and bacterial RecA recombinases .
Rad51 is highly conserved from yeast to humans . It has a key function in the recombinational repair of DNA damages , particularly double @-@ strand damages such as double @-@ strand breaks . In humans , over- or under @-@ expression of Rad51 occurs in a wide variety of cancers .
During meiosis Rad51 interacts with another recombinase , Dmc1 , to form a presynaptic filament that is an intermediate in homologous recombination . [ 9 ] Dmc1 function appears to be limited to meiotic recombination .
Like Rad51 , Dmc1 is homologous to bacterial RecA .
Some DNA viruses encode a recombinase that facilitates homologous recombination . A well @-@ studied example is the UvsX recombinase encoded by bacteriophage T4 . [ 10 ] UvsX is homologous to bacterial RecA .
UvsX , like RecA , can facilitate the assimilation of linear single @-@ stranded DNA into an homologous DNA duplex to produce a D @-@ loop .

Recombinases have a central role in homologous recombination in a wide range of organisms . Such recombinases have been described in archaea , bacteria , eukaryotes and viruses .
Archaea
The archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus RadA recombinase catalyzes DNA pairing and strand exchange , central steps in recombinational repair . [ 6 ] The RadA recombinase has greater similarity to the eukaryotic Rad51 recombinase than to the bacterial RecA recombinase . [ 6 ]
Bacteria
By sequence similarity , most sigma factors are σ70 @-@ like ( InterPro : IPR000943 ) . They have four main regions ( domains ) that are generally conserved :
The regions are further subdivided . For example , region 2 includes 1.2 and 2.1 through 2.4 .
Not every sigma factor of the σ70 family contains all the domains .
Group 2 , which includes RpoS , is very similar to Group 1 but lacks domain 1 . Group 3 also lacks domain 1 , and includes σ28 .
Group 4 , also known as the Extracytoplasmic Function ( ECF ) group , lack both σ1.1 and σ3 . RpoE is a member . [ 1 ]
Other known sigma factors are of the σ54 / RpoN ( InterPro : IPR000394 ) type . They are functional sigma factors , but they have significantly different primary amino acid sequences . [ 8 ]
Sigma cycle
The sigma factor in the RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex is required for the initiation of transcription , although once that stage is finished , it is dissociated from the complex and the RNAP continues elongation on its own .
References
Specialized sigma factors
Different sigma factors are utilized under different environmental conditions . These specialized sigma factors bind the promoters of genes appropriate to the environmental conditions , increasing the transcription of those genes .

Second parity rule
The second of Chargaff 's rules ( or " Chargaff 's second parity rule " ) is that the composition of DNA varies from one species to another ; in particular in the relative amounts of A , G , T , and C bases .
Such evidence of molecular diversity , which had been presumed absent from DNA , made DNA a more credible candidate for the genetic material than protein .
The rule itself has consequences . In most bacterial genomes ( which are generally 80 @-@ 90 % coding ) genes are arranged in such a fashion that approximately 50 % of the coding sequence lies on either strand .
While Szybalski 's rule generally holds , exceptions are known to exist . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The biological basis for Szybalski 's rule , like Chargaff 's , is not yet known .

Urethral cancer is cancer originating from the urethra . Cancer in this location is rare , and the most common type is papillary transitional cell carcinoma . [ 1 ] The most common site of urethral cancer is the bulbomembranous urethra .
The main medical risk factors are having bladder cancer or having conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the urethra . People over the age of 60 and white women have the highest risks .
Diagnosis is established by transurethral biopsy . Types of urethral cancer include transitional cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , and melanoma .
Nongonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) is an inflammation of the urethra that is not caused by gonorrheal infection .
The most common bacterial cause of NGU is Chlamydia trachomatis , [ citation needed ] but it can also be caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum , Haemophilus vaginalis , Mycoplasma genitalium , Mycoplasma hominis , Gardnerella vaginalis , Acinetobacter lwoffi , Ac.calcoclaceticus and E.coli.

Parasitic causes include Trichomonas vaginalis ( rare ) . [ citation needed ]
Noninfectious
Urethritis can be caused by mechanical injury ( from a urinary catheter or a cystoscope ) , or by an irritating chemical ( antiseptics or some spermicides ) .
For treatment purposes , doctors usually classify infectious urethritis in two categories : gonococcal urethritis , caused by gonorrhea , and nongonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) . [ 1 ]
Treatment is based on the prescription and use of the proper antibiotics depending on the strain of the ureaplasma . [ 6 ]
If left untreated , complications include epididymitis and infertility . Consistent and correct use of latex condoms during sexual activity greatly reduces the likelihood of infection . [ citation needed ]
Symptoms

NGU is transmitted by touching the mouth , penis , vagina or anus by penis , vagina or anus of a person who has NGU .
There are many causes of NGU . This is in part due to the large variety of organisms living in the urinary tract .

The combination of lamivudine and zidovudine is composed of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) . [ 12 ]
Lamividuine and zidovudine combination therapy is believed to work synergistically together to prevent mutations in the HIV virus , which can contribute to drug resistance . [ 16 ]
Pharmacokinetics
Zidovudine is also well absorbed in the body and penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid . Oral bioavailability is 75 % and primarily metabolized by the liver by glucuronidation .
The primary metabolite is GZDV , an inactive metabolite produced after first pass metabolism . The half @-@ life of zidovudine is 0.5 to 3 hours and binds poorly to plasma proteins . [ 1 ]
Lamivudine / Zidovudine ( brand name Combivir ) was introduced to the market with FDA licensure in 1997 .

Its current leader , Commissioner Andrew Saul , has served since June 2019 , succeeding Acting Commissioner Nancy Berryhill .
SSA is headquartered in Woodlawn , Maryland , just to the west of Baltimore , at what is known as Central Office .
The agency includes 10 regional offices , 8 processing centers , approximately 1300 field offices , and 37 Teleservice Centers .
As of 2018 [ update ] , about 60,000 people were employed by SSA . [ 3 ] Headquarters non @-@ supervisory employees of SSA are represented by American Federation of Government Employees Local 1923 . Social Security is the largest social welfare program in the United States . For 2014 , the net cost of Social Security was $ 906.4 billion , an amount corresponding to 21 % of US Federal Government expenditures . [ 4 ]
Coverage
In 1939 , the age restriction for entering Social Security was eliminated .
The job of filing workers ' applications for Social Security quickly became , in the government 's words , " part of the biggest bookkeeping job in the world . "

In historical linguistics , vowel breaking , vowel fracture , [ 1 ] or diphthongization is the sound change of a monophthong into a diphthong or triphthong .
Types
Vowel breaking sometimes occurs only in stressed syllables . For instance , Vulgar Latin open @-@ mid / ɛ / and / ɔ / changed to diphthongs only when they were stressed .
Vowel breaking may be unconditioned or conditioned . It may be triggered by the presence of another sound , by stress , or in no particular way .
Assimilation
Vowel breaking is sometimes defined as a subtype of diphthongization , when it refers to harmonic ( assimilatory ) process that involves diphthongization triggered by a following vowel or consonant .
See also
Thus , vowel breaking , in the restricted sense , can be viewed as an example of assimilation of a vowel to a following vowel or consonant .
References
Vowel breaking is sometimes not assimilatory and is then not triggered by a neighboring sound . That was the case with the Great Vowel Shift in English in which all cases of / iː / and / uː / changed to diphthongs .

where | G | and | H | denote the orders of G and H , respectively . In particular , the order of every subgroup of G ( and the order of every element of G ) must be a divisor of | G | . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Right cosets are defined analogously : Ha = { ha : h in H } . They are also the equivalence classes for a suitable equivalence relation and their number is equal to [ G : H ] .
Example : Subgroups of Z8
Let G be the cyclic group Z8 whose elements are
and whose group operation is addition modulo eight . Its Cayley table is
Example : Subgroups of S4 ( the symmetric group on 4 elements )

Folding
Advantage of domains in protein folding
However , the role of inter @-@ domain interactions in protein folding and in energetics of stabilisation of the native structure , probably differs for each protein .
Domains and protein flexibility
Given the fact that phosphoinositides are sequestered to various cell membranes ( due to their long lipophilic tail ) the PH domains usually causes recruitment of the protein in question to a membrane where the protein can exert a certain function in cell signalling , cytoskeletal reorganization or membrane trafficking . Src homology 2 domain ( SH2 ) : SH2 domains are often found in signal transduction proteins . SH2 domains confer binding to phosphorylated tyrosine ( pTyr ) .

Three mitochondrial outer membrane receptors are known :
TOM70 Binds to internal targeting peptides and acts as a docking point for cytosolic chaperones .
TOM20 Binds presequences TOM22 Binds both presequences and internal targeting peptides
The TOM channel ( TOM40 ) is a cation specific high conductance channel with a molecular weight of 410 kDa and a pore diameter of 21Å .
The presequence translocase23 ( TIM23 ) is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane and acts a pore forming protein which binds precursor proteins with its N @-@ terminus .
TIM23 acts a translocator for preproteins for the mitochondrial matrix , the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as for the intermembrane space .
TIM50 is bound to TIM23 at the inner mitochondrial side and found to bind presequences .
TIM44 is bound on the matrix side and found binding to mtHsp70 . The presequence translocase22 ( TIM22 ) binds preproteins exclusively bound for the inner mitochondrial membrane .
Mitochondrial matrix targeting sequences are rich in positively charged amino acids and hydroxylated ones .
Targeting signals
Proteins are targeted to submitochondrial compartments by multiple signals and several pathways .
Targeting to the outer membrane , intermembrane space , and inner membrane often requires another signal sequence in addition to the matrix targeting sequence .
Peroxisomes
All peroxisomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes .
To date there are two types of known Peroxisome Targeting Signals ( PTS ) :

The basic algorithm can be written as follows :
Inputs : n : a composite number Output : a nontrivial factor of n or failure
The running time of this algorithm is O ( B × log B × log2 n ) ; larger values of B make it run slower , but are more likely to produce a factor .
Example
If we want to factor the number n = 299 .
Since 1 < 13 < 299 , thus return 13 .
299 / 13 = 23 is prime , thus it is fully factored : 299 = 13 × 23 .
Let n be a composite integer with prime factor p . By Fermat 's little theorem , we know that for all integers a coprime to p and for all positive integers K :
If a number x is congruent to 1 modulo a factor of n , then the gcd ( x − 1 , n ) will be divisible by that factor .

It is a three @-@ row , seven @-@ passenger vehicle positioned above the GLE @-@ Class , and is the flagship of the Mercedes @-@ Benz SUV line .
The GLS shares the same unibody architecture with the GLE @-@ Class . Most GLS @-@ Class vehicles are assembled at the Mercedes plant in Alabama , except for a small number of early 2007 production vehicles which were manufactured in Germany .
The first generation model ( X164 ) was manufactured between 2006 and 2012 and was replaced in 2012 by the new generation GL @-@ Class ( X166 ) .
The X166 GL @-@ Class went on sale on September 2012 .
Models feature efficiency improvements via the addition of an engine start stop system , drive by wire steering , and new turbocharged petrol and diesel engines .
The second generation model also introduced a high performance GL63 AMG variant , powered by the hand @-@ built M157 engine . [ 3 ] Following the facelift in 2016 , it was renamed to GLS @-@ Class to correspond with the new Mercedes @-@ Benz naming scheme .
The trademark registration leads to GLS 600 and GLS 680 as possible Mercedes @-@ Maybach version . [ 7 ] With possible demise of Mercedes @-@ Benz V12 engine , the GLS 600 might be equipped with 4.0 @-@ litre twin @-@ turbo V8 and GLS 680 with same engine as GLS 600 but paired with more powerful electric motor as demonstrated in Mercedes @-@ AMG GT Concept .

Classes
The following table [ 1 ] shows the different structures and their key features :
The Cys2His2 @-@ like fold group ( C2H2 ) is by far the best @-@ characterized class of zinc fingers , and is common in mammalian transcription factors . Such domains adopt a simple ββα fold and have the amino acid sequence motif : [ 1 ]
The retroviral nucleocapsid ( NC ) protein from HIV and other related retroviruses are examples of proteins possessing these motifs .
The gag @-@ knuckle zinc finger in the HIV NC protein is the target of a class of drugs known as zinc finger inhibitors .
The best @-@ characterized proteins containing treble @-@ clef zinc fingers are the nuclear hormone receptors .
The zinc ribbon fold is characterised by two beta @-@ hairpins forming two structurally similar zinc @-@ binding sub @-@ sites .
The canonical members of this class contain a binuclear zinc cluster in which two zinc ions are bound by six cysteine residues . These zinc fingers can be found in several transcription factors including the yeast Gal4 protein .
Arrays with 6 zinc finger motifs are particularly attractive because they bind a target site that is long enough to have a good chance of being unique in a mammalian genome . [ 20 ]

An example of two moving average curves
Moving average regression model
In a moving average regression model , a variable of interest is assumed to be a weighted moving average of unobserved independent error terms ; the weights in the moving average are parameters to be estimated .
Those two concepts are often confused due to their name , but while they share many similarities , they represent distinct methods and are used in very different contexts .
Cumulative moving average
Weighted moving average
WMA weights n = 15
Exponential moving average
EMA weights N = 15
The EMA for a series Y may be calculated recursively :
Simple moving average
The coefficient α represents the degree of weighting decrease , a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1 . A higher α discounts older observations faster .
Yt is the value at a time period t .
St is the value of the EMA at any time period t .
Relationship between SMA and EMA
When calculating successive values , a new value comes into the sum , and the oldest value drops out , meaning that a full summation each time is unnecessary for this simple case :

Modification
Isomerisation
Posttranslational modification
Finally , the protein can undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications , which are briefly summarized here .
The N @-@ terminal amino group of a polypeptide can be modified covalently , e.g. ,
1 N @-@ terminal acetylation
The positive charge on the N @-@ terminal amino group may be eliminated by changing it to an acetyl group ( N @-@ terminal blocking ) .
The N @-@ terminal methionine usually found after translation has an N @-@ terminus blocked with a formyl group . This formyl group ( and sometimes the methionine residue itself , if followed by Gly or Ser ) is removed by the enzyme deformylase .
2 Formation of pyroglutamate from an N @-@ terminal glutamine
An N @-@ terminal glutamine can attack itself , forming a cyclic pyroglutamate group .
Similar to acetylation . Instead of a simple methyl group , the myristoyl group has a tail of 14 hydrophobic carbons , which make it ideal for anchoring proteins to cellular membranes .
The C @-@ terminal carboxylate group of a polypeptide can also be modified , e.g. ,
3 C @-@ terminal amidation
amination ( see Figure )
The C @-@ terminus can also be blocked ( thus , neutralizing its negative charge ) by amination .
glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) attachment
Finally , the peptide side chains can also be modified covalently , e.g. ,
glycosylation
hydroxylation
methylation
acetylation
Chemical
The hydrophobic isoprene ( e.g. , farnesyl , geranyl , and geranylgeranyl groups ) and palmitoyl groups may be added to the S γ { \ displaystyle \ mathrm { S ^ { \ gamma } } } atom of cysteine residues to anchor proteins to cellular membranes .
Unlike the GPI and myritoyl anchors , these groups are not necessarily added at the termini .
carboxylation
ubiquitination and SUMOylation
Various full @-@ length , folded proteins can be attached at their C @-@ termini to the sidechain ammonium groups of lysines of other proteins . Ubiquitin is the most common of these , and usually signals that the ubiquitin @-@ tagged protein should be degraded .
Most of the polypeptide modifications listed above occur post @-@ translationally , i.e. , after the protein has been synthesized on the ribosome , typically occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum , a subcellular organelle of the eukaryotic cell .
Many other chemical reactions ( e.g. , cyanylation ) have been applied to proteins by chemists , although they are not found in biological systems .
Peptides can be synthesised chemically via a range of laboratory methods . Chemical methods typically synthesise peptides in the opposite order to biological protein synthesis ( starting at the C @-@ terminus ) .
Primary structure in other molecules
Relation to secondary and tertiary structure
See also
Notes and references
Peptides can be directly sequenced , or inferred from DNA sequences . Large sequence databases now exist that collate known protein sequences .
Secondary structure elements typically spontaneously form as an intermediate before the protein folds into its three dimensional tertiary structure .
The Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure , in short DSSP , is commonly used to describe the protein secondary structure with single letter codes .
The secondary structure is assigned based on hydrogen bonding patterns as those initially proposed by Pauling et al. in 1951 ( before any protein structure had ever been experimentally determined ) .
There are eight types of secondary structure that DSSP defines :
According to DSSP , a hydrogen @-@ bond exists if and only if E is less than − 0.5 kcal / mol ( − 2.1 kJ / mol ) .
Although the DSSP formula is a relatively crude approximation of the physical hydrogen @-@ bond energy , it is generally accepted as a tool for defining secondary structure .
SST [ 1 ] classification
SST is a Bayesian method to assign secondary structure to protein coordinate data using the Shannon information criterion of Minimum Message Length ( MML ) inference .
SST accurately delineates any protein chain into regions associated with the following assignment types : [ 12 ]
Predicting protein tertiary structure from only its amino sequence is a very challenging problem ( see protein structure prediction ) , but using the simpler secondary structure definitions is more tractable .
The concept of secondary structure was first introduced by Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm @-@ Lang at Stanford in 1952 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Other types of biopolymers such as nucleic acids also possess characteristic secondary structures .
Distant relationships between proteins whose primary structures are unalignable can sometimes be found by secondary structure . [ 1 ]

Ligand binding
The interactions and bonds of side chains within a particular protein determine its tertiary structure . The protein tertiary structure is defined by its atomic coordinates . These coordinates may refer either to a protein domain or to the entire tertiary structure . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] A number of tertiary structures may fold into a quaternary structure . [ 3 ]
Determination
The knowledge of the tertiary structure of soluble globular proteins is more advanced than that of membrane proteins because the former are easier to study with available technology .
X @-@ ray crystallography
X @-@ ray crystallography is the most common tool used to determine protein structure . It provides high resolution of the structure but it does not give information about protein 's conformational flexibility .
NMR
Protein NMR gives comparatively lower resolution of protein structure . It is limited to smaller proteins . However , it can provide information about conformational changes of a protein in solution .
Cryogenic electron microscopy
Cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryo @-@ EM ) can give information about both a protein 's tertiary and quaternary structure . It is particularly well @-@ suited to large proteins and symmetrical complexes of protein subunits .
Dual polarisation interferometry provides complementary information about surface captured proteins . It assists in determining structure and conformation changes over time .

Cynewulf took the opportunity to assert the independence of Wessex : in about 758 he took Berkshire from the Mercians . Cynewulf was also often at war with the Welsh .
In 779 , Cynewulf was defeated by the new King of Mercia , Offa , at the Battle of Bensington , and Offa then retook Berkshire , and perhaps also London . Despite this defeat , there is no evidence to suggest Cynewulf subsequently became subject to Offa .

Differencing in statistics is a transformation applied to time @-@ series data in order to make it stationary . A stationary time series ' properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed .
In order to difference the data , the difference between consecutive observations is computed . Mathematically , this is shown as
Differencing removes the changes in the level of a time series , eliminating trend and seasonality and consequently stabilizing the mean of the time series .
Sometimes it may be necessary to difference the data a second time to obtain a stationary time series , which is referred to as second order differencing :
Another method of differencing data is seasonal differencing , which involves computing the difference between an observation and the corresponding observation in the previous season e.g a year . This is shown as :
ARIMA models can be estimated following the Box @-@ Jenkins approach .
Modeling approach
Differencing to achieve stationarity
Box and Jenkins recommend the differencing approach to achieve stationarity . However , fitting a curve and subtracting the fitted values from the original data can also be used in the context of Box @-@ Jenkins models .
Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots
The original model uses an iterative three @-@ stage modeling approach :
The sample autocorrelation plot and the sample partial autocorrelation plot are compared to the theoretical behavior of these plots when the order is known .
Specifically , for an AR ( 1 ) process , the sample autocorrelation function should have an exponentially decreasing appearance . However , higher @-@ order AR processes are often a mixture of exponentially decreasing and damped sinusoidal components .
Stationarity and seasonality
The first step in developing a Box @-@ Jenkins model is to determine whether the time series is stationary and whether there is any significant seasonality that needs to be modelled .
In biochemistry , two biopolymers are antiparallel if they run parallel to each other but with opposite directionality ( alignments ) . An example is the two complementary strands of a DNA double helix , which run in opposite directions alongside each other .

In redox @-@ transmetalation / ligand exchange the ligands of two metal complexes switch places with each other , bonding with the other metal center .
The second and less common intermediate is the formation of a cation where R is bridging the two metals and X is anionic .
The RTLE reaction proceeds in a concerted manner . Like in RT reactions , the reaction is driven by electronegativity values .
The X ligand is attracted to highly electropositive metals .
If M1 is a more electropositive metal than M2 , it is thermodynamically favorable for the exchange of the R and X ligands to occur .

The trident of Poseidon and his Roman equivalent , Neptune , has been their traditional divine attribute featured in many ancient depictions . Poseidon 's trident was crafted by the Cyclopes .
The view shared by Friedrich Wieseler , E. M. W. Tillyard and several other researchers is that Poseidon 's trident is a fish spear , typical for coast @-@ dwelling Greeks . [ 13 ]
According to Robert Graves , however , both Poseidon 's trident and Zeus ' thunderbolt were originally a sacred labrys , but later distinguished from each other when Poseidon became god of the sea , while Zeus claimed the right to the thunderbolt . [ 14 ]

A ripple effect is a situation in which , like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it , an effect from an initial state can be followed outwards incrementally .
The ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier in macroeconomics . For example , an individual 's reduction in spending reduces the incomes of others and their ability to spend . [ 1 ]
The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure . [ 4 ]

Message .
Action . Receiver R receives message m .
Utility .
Nash equilibrium . We look for an equilibrium where each player decides optimally , assuming that the other player also decides optimally .
Players are rational , although R has only limited information . Expectations get realized , and there is no incentive to deviate from this situation .
Crawford and Sobel characterize possible Nash equilibria .
This basic setting set by Crawford and Sobel [ 1 ] has given rise to a variety of variants .
The ti ( N ) " s are the bounds of intervals where the messages are constant : for ti @-@ 1 ( N ) < t < ti ( N ) , µ ( t ) = mi .
To give a formal definition , cheap talk is communication that is : [ 2 ]
Indifference condition . What happens at t = ti ? The sender has to be indifferent between sending either message mi @-@ 1 or mi .
This gives information about N and the ti .
N = 1 : This is the babbling equilibrium. t0 = 0 , t1 = 1 ; a1 = 1 / 2 = 0.5 .
With N = 1 , we get the coarsest possible message , which does not give any information . So everything is red on the top left panel . With N = 3 , the message is finer .
However , it remains quite coarse compared to full revelation , which would be the 45 ° line , but which is not a Nash equilibrium .
With a higher N , and a finer message , the blue area is more important . This implies higher utility . Disclosing more information benefits both parties .
If they both announce different options , then no coordination is achieved .

A geometrized unit system or geometric unit system is a system of natural units in which the base physical units are chosen so that the speed of light in vacuum , c , and the gravitational constant , G , are set equal to unity .
Any velocity can be interpreted as the slope of a curve ; in geometric units , slopes are evidently dimensionless ratios . Physical quantities which can be identified with dimensionless ratios include the components of the electromagnetic potential four @-@ vector and the electromagnetic current four @-@ vector .
Here is a table collecting some important physical quantities according to their dimensions in geometrized units .
They are listed together with the appropriate conversion factor for SI units .
This table can be augmented to include temperature , as indicated above , as well as further derived physical quantities such as various moments .
This system is useful in physics , especially in the special and general theories of relativity . All physical quantities are identified with geometric quantities such as areas , lengths , dimensionless numbers , path curvatures , or sectional curvatures .
Many equations in relativistic physics appear simpler when expressed in geometric units , because all occurrences of G and of c drop out . For example , the Schwarzschild radius of a nonrotating uncharged black hole with mass m becomes r = 2m .
The small numerical size of the few conversion factors reflects the fact that relativistic effects are only noticeable when large masses or high speeds are considered .

Amino is an American online application developed by Narvii , Inc .
It was created by Yin Wang and Ben Anderson in 2014 . [ 1 ]
Funding
Amino received $ 1.7 million dollars in seed funding in July 2014 .
In September 2015 , Amino received $ 6.5 million in Series A funding . In Series B and C funding , Amino received $ 19.2 million and $ 45 million , respectively . Amino has raised a total of $ 72.4 million dollars over those four funding rounds .
Amino Apps is also partnered with All Ages of Geek . [ 9 ]
Users who manage popular communities which get noticed by Narvii Inc. were capable of receiving a separate application for their community only , however this has changed and all activity now takes place in the Amino app .
This application is what users use to create and manage their own community in Amino .
In 2014 , Amino was officially released , and the K @-@ pop and photography apps previously released became the first Amino communities .
In July 2014 , Anderson and Wang launched the parent company of Amino Apps , Narvii , and received $ 1.7 million dollars in seed funding . [ 3 ]
Before 2016 , when a user wanted to join a new Amino , they had to download another app for the Amino they wanted to join .
In 2016 , Amino Apps launched a centralized portal that hosted every Amino community in one app , meaning users no longer had to download multiple apps . [ 5 ]
In the same year , ACM , an app that allowed users to create their own communities , was launched . This resulted in the number of communities on Amino skyrocketing to over 2.5 million . [ 6 ]

As with any other bodily attribute , the length and girth of the penis can be highly variable between mammals of different species . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In many mammals , the size of a flaccid penis is smaller than its erect size .
A bone called the baculum or os penis is present in most mammals but absent in humans , cattle and horses .
In mammals the penis is divided into three parts : [ 1 ]
Even @-@ toed ungulates ( Artiodactyla )
The penises of even @-@ toed ungulates are curved in an S @-@ shape when not erect . [ 17 ] In bulls , rams and boars , the sigmoid flexure of the penis straightens out during erection . [ 18 ]

Odd @-@ toed ungulates ( Perissodactyla )
Stallions ( male horses ) have a vascular penis . When non @-@ erect , it is quite flaccid and contained within the prepuce ( foreskin , or sheath ) .
In most species of animals in which there is an organ that might reasonably be described as a penis , it has no major function other than intromission , or at least conveying the sperm to the female , but in the placental mammals the penis bears the distal part of the urethra , which discharges both urine during urination and semen during copulation . [ 2 ]
Genitorinary system of a raccoon ( Procyon lotor )
The male fossa has an unusually long penis and baculum ( penis bone ) , reaching to between his front legs when erect [ 74 ] with backwards @-@ pointing spines along most of its length . [ 75 ] The male fossa has scent glands near the penis , with the penile glands emitting a strong odor . [ 74 ]
The beech marten 's penis is larger than the pine marten 's , with the bacula of young beech martens often outsizing those of old pine martens . [ 76 ]
Raccoons have penis bones which bend at a 90 degree angle at the tip . [ 77 ] The extrusibility of a raccoon 's penis can be used to distinguish mature males from immature males . [ 78 ] [ 79 ]
Male walruses possess the largest penis bones of any land mammal , both in absolute size and relative to body size . [ 80 ] [ 81 ]
The adult male American mink 's penis is 2.2 in ( 5.6 cm ) long , and is covered by a sheath . The baculum is well @-@ developed , being triangular in cross section and curved at the tip . [ 82 ]
In males , the expulsion of urine from the body is done through the penis . The urethra drains the bladder through the prostate gland where it is joined by the ejaculatory duct , and then onward to the penis .
The most common form of genital alteration is circumcision , the removal of part or all of the foreskin for various cultural , religious , and more rarely medical reasons . There is controversy surrounding circumcision .

Reverse @-@ and @-@ add process
Because 196 ( base @-@ 10 ) is the lowest candidate Lychrel number , it has received the most attention .
The reverse @-@ and @-@ add process produces the sum of a number and the number formed by reversing the order of its digits . For example , 56 + 65 = 121 . As another example , 125 + 521 = 646 .
In 1995 , Tim Irvin and Larry Simkins used a multiprocessor computer and reached the two million digit mark in only three months without finding a palindrome .
Jason Doucette then followed suit and reached 12.5 million digits in May 2000 .
Wade VanLandingham used Jason Doucette 's program to reach 13 million digits , a record published in Yes Mag : Canada 's Science Magazine for Kids . Since June 2000 , Wade VanLandingham has been carrying the flag using programs written by various enthusiasts .
Other potential Lychrel numbers which have also been subjected to the same brute force method of repeated reversal addition include 879 , 1997 and 7059 : they have been taken to several million iterations with no palindrome being found . [ 12 ]
Other bases
This number obviously cannot be a palindrome , and none of the other numbers in the sequence are palindromes .
Some numbers become palindromes quickly after repeated reversal and addition , and are therefore not Lychrel numbers . All one @-@ digit and two @-@ digit numbers eventually become palindromes after repeated reversal and addition .

The OEIS sequence A326414 contains 19353600 terms with 288 @-@ step delay known at present . Any number from A281506 could be used as a primary base to construct higher order 261 @-@ step palindromes .

Decimal palindromic numbers
Decimal palindromic numbers with an even number of digits are divisible by 11 .
All numbers in base 10 ( and indeed in any base ) with one digit are palindromic . The number of palindromic numbers with two digits is 9 :
There are 90 palindromic numbers with three digits ( Using the Rule of product : 9 choices for the first digit - which determines the third digit as well - multiplied by 10 choices for the second digit ) :
and also 90 palindromic numbers with four digits : ( Again , 9 choices for the first digit multiplied by ten choices for the second digit . The other two digits are determined by the choice of the first two )
so there are 199 palindromic numbers below 104 .
For instance : Palindromic numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics . A typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property and are palindromic .
G. J. Simmons conjectured there are no palindromes of form nk for k > 4 ( and n > 1 ) . [ 2 ]
Palindromic numbers can be considered in numeral systems other than decimal . For example , the binary palindromic numbers are :
with , as usual , 0 ≤ ai < b for all i and ak ≠ 0 . Then n is palindromic if and only if ai = ak − i for all i .
Zero is written 0 in any base and is also palindromic by definition .
There are many palindromic perfect powers nk , where n is a natural number and k is 2 , 3 or 4 .
The first nine terms of the sequence 12 , 112 , 1112 , 11112 , ... form the palindromes 1 , 121 , 12321 , 1234321 , ... ( sequence A002477 in the OEIS )
Other bases
In base 7 , because 1017 is twice a perfect square ( 52 = 347 ) , several of its multiples are palindromic squares :
In base 18 , some powers of seven are palindromic :
And in base 24 the first eight powers of five are palindromic as well :
Any number n is palindromic in all bases b with b ≥ n + 1 ( trivially so , because n is then a single @-@ digit number ) , and also in base n − 1 ( because n is then 11n − 1 ) . A number that is non @-@ palindromic in all bases 2 ≤ b < n − 1 is called a strictly non @-@ palindromic number .
It was solved by Jason Doucette 's algorithm and program ( using Benjamin Despres ' reversal @-@ addition code ) on November 30 , 2005 . For example , 1,186,060,307,891,929,990 takes 261 iterations to reach the 119 @-@ digit palindrome 44562665878976437622437848976653870388884783662598425855963436955852489526638748888307835667984873422673467987856626544 , which is the current world record for the Most Delayed Palindromic Number .

This tailing leaves the vector with a single 3 ' -overhanging thymine residue on each blunt end . [ 5 ] Manufacturers commonly sell TA Cloning " kits " with a wide range of prepared vectors that have already been linearized and tagged with an overhanging thymine .
The major downside of TA cloning is that directional cloning is not possible , so the gene has a 50 % chance of getting cloned in the reverse direction . [ 1 ]

Crazyhouse by Fergus Duniho , The Chess Variant Pages Scidb a chess database supporting Crazyhouse Rules for the variant on Lichess Blog post with introduction , theory and more resources
Unlike shogi , having two or more pawns on a file , and checkmating with a dropped pawn , are both permissible .
The physical problem of changing the color of a captured piece can be handled by : [ 5 ]
Crazyhouse ( also known as drop chess , mad chess , reinforcement chess , turnabout chess and schizo @-@ chess ) is a chess variant similar to bughouse chess , but with only two players . It effectively incorporates a rule from the game shogi , in which a player can introduce a captured piece back to the chessboard as their own .
There is no standard FEN specification for Crazyhouse . However at Lichess an extended version of FEN is in use . Here is Lichess 's FEN implemention example . [ 6 ]
Lichess simply adds a 0th rank as a reserve .
There are more than 8 pieces on the reserve , so the last section may have more than 8 characters .
A different notation is used by Xboard / Winboard . The reserve is given in square brackets following the board position .
Chess.com uses another notation . The reserve is put after full @-@ move number .
Rules
All the rules and conventions of standard chess apply , with the addition of drops , as explained below .

At the age of 17 she began a modeling career . She starred in several commercials , where she was noticed by Georgian film directors .
Dalakishvili got into the project almost at the last moment , because initially Oksana Akinshina had to play Lesya . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]

Apart from some isolated fragments , there is no record of the Salian Frankish language but it is presumed to be ancestral to the modern family of Low Franconian dialects , which are represented today by Dutch and Flemish dialects , and Afrikaans .

Note that : The beam splitters and mirrors direct the idler photons towards detectors labeled D1 , D2 , D3 and D4 .
This result is similar to that of the double @-@ slit experiment , since interference is observed when it is not known from which slit the photon originates , while no interference is observed when the path is known .

Bowing
Different degrees of bowing and prostration , here drawn from Eastern Orthodox religious liturgical use
Basic bows originate at the waist and are performed with the back straight and the hands at the sides ( for men ) or clasped in front ( for women ) , and with the eyes down .
Bows are a required and expected part of any apology or expression of thanks in East Asia , especially Japan and Korea .
Bows also replace speaking under certain circumstances . For example , when encountering again a person to whom one has already spoken that day , a silent bow replaces such phrases as " hello " or " hi . "
When addressing a subordinate , a manager , supervisor , or other leader generally only nods the head slightly ( some may not bow at all ) , while the subordinate bends forward slightly from the waist .
Generally when bowing in proximity to another , as necessitated when combining bowing and shaking hands , people turn slightly to one side to avoid bumping heads .
In China
In many situations , the standing bow has replaced the kowtow .
In Europe and the Commonwealth

Judo practitioner ( right ) performs a bow while seated in seiza .
Bowing is an integral part of traditional martial arts . Bows are used to begin and end practice , sparring bouts and competitions , and when entering and leaving the dojo , or practice room .
In tea ceremonies
Man bowing and scraping
The host of a tea ceremony bows before beginning the ceremony . Bows are exchanged repeatedly throughout a tea ceremony , between the host and guest of honor , among the guests , between guests and the hosts assistants , and between the host and guests .
In many Eastern religions bowing is used as a sign of respect in worship and has its origins in the Indic Añjali Mudrā .
Bows are performed in Shinto settings . Visitors to a Shinto shrine will clap or ring a bell to attract the attention of the enshrined deity , clasp the hands in prayer , and then bow .
He is here quoting a similar passage regarding bowing from the Old Testament , Isaiah 45 : 23 .
In Islam , there are two types of bowing , Sujud and Ruk 'u .
Ruku ' is bowing down in the standing position during daily prayers ( salat ) .
The position of ruku ' is established by bending over , putting one 's hands on one 's knees , and remaining in that position while also praising Allah and glorifying Him .

Properties of equilibrium
Three basic properties of equilibrium in general have been proposed by Huw Dixon . [ 2 ] These are :
Equilibrium property P1 : The behavior of agents is consistent .
Disequilibrium characterizes a market that is not in equilibrium . [ 9 ] Disequilibrium can occur extremely briefly or over an extended period of time .
Equilibrium property P2 : No agent has an incentive to change its behavior .
Equilibrium property P3 : Equilibrium is the outcome of some dynamic process ( stability ) .

However , a trie also has some drawbacks compared to a hash table :
This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes ( or parts ) of different words being stored .
Tries are also well suited for implementing approximate matching algorithms , [ 8 ] including those used in spell checking and hyphenation [ 2 ] software .
A simple Node class can be used to represent nodes in the trie :
A slight modifications of this routine can be utilized
to check if there is any word in the trie that starts with a given prefix ( see § Autocomplete ) , and to return the deepest node corresponding to some prefix of a given string .
Insertion proceeds by walking the trie according to the string to be inserted , then appending new nodes for the suffix of the string that is not contained in the trie :
Tries can be used to return a list of keys with a given prefix . This can also be modified to allow for wildcards in the prefix search . [ 1 ]
Full @-@ text search
Another alternative in order to avoid the use of an array of 256 pointers ( ASCII ) , as suggested before , is to store the alphabet array as a bitmap of 256 bits representing the ASCII alphabet , reducing dramatically the size of the nodes . [ 17 ]
Compressing tries
Compressing the trie and merging the common branches can sometimes yield large performance gains . This works best under the following conditions :
The result of such compression may look similar to trying to transform the trie into a directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) , because the reverse transform from a DAG to a trie is obvious and always possible .
However , the shape of the DAG is determined by the form of the key chosen to index the nodes , in turn constraining the compression possible .
One more approach is to " pack " the trie . [ 4 ] Liang describes a space @-@ efficient implementation of a sparse packed trie applied to automatic hyphenation , in which the descendants of each node may be interleaved in memory .
External memory tries
Several trie variants are suitable for maintaining sets of strings in external memory , including suffix trees .
NIST 's Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures : Trie
As discussed below , [ where ? ] a trie has a number of advantages over binary search trees . [ 6 ] [ examples needed ]
A trie can also be used to replace a hash table , over which it has the following advantages :
LSD sorts are generally stable sorts .
MSD sorts are not necessarily stable if the original ordering of duplicate keys must always be maintained .
Other than the traversal order , MSD and LSD sorts differ in their handling of variable length input .
LSD sorts can group by length , radix sort each group , then concatenate the groups in size order .
MSD sorts must effectively ' extend ' all shorter keys to the size of the largest key and sort them accordingly , which can be more complicated than the grouping required by LSD .
However , MSD sorts are more amenable to subdivision and recursion .
Radix sort dates back as far as 1887 to the work of Herman Hollerith on tabulating machines . [ 1 ] Radix sorting algorithms came into common use as a way to sort punched cards as early as 1923 . [ 2 ]
Complexity and performance
Radix sorts operates in O ( nw ) time , where n is the number of keys , and w is the key length .
LSD variants can achieve a lower bound for w of ' average key length ' when splitting variable length keys into groups as discussed above .

Clearly , h is holomorphic on D \ { a } , and there exists

We have c0 = h ( a ) = 0 and c1 = h ' ( a ) = 0 ; therefore
Hence , where z ≠ a , we have :

Vacumatic and Aerometric Parker 51s
The Parker 51 is a fountain pen first introduced in 1941 .
There were two iterations of a special ink formulated exclusively for use in the Parker 51 .
This initial ink was highly alkaline and while water @-@ based , also included a substantial amount of isopropyl alcohol .
The 51 is popular with pen collectors , and in 2002 Parker issued a lookalike model called the 51 Special Edition .
In 2004 , the larger and heavier Parker 100 was released .

Parker 51 Special Edition ( Originally official site for limited reissue of Parker 51 , but seems to have other news about Parker pens , too . ; )
The Parker " 51 " stayed in production until 1972 with a series of revisions throughout its production cycle .
The filling system was re @-@ designed in 1948 , with the introduction of the Aerometric filling system . This filling system operated by pressing a pressure bar on " Pli @-@ Glass " sac . [ 2 ]
In addition , Parker reformulated its " 51 " ink , reducing the alkalinity , and introducing a selection of brilliant colors , and calling the ink Superchrome .
Like the 51 ink , it also came with a warning that it should be used only in the Parker 51 but the warning was more discreet .
The pen was not named after the P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter plane ; but Parker took advantage of the coincidence by comparing the pen and the plane in its advertising .

In computer networking , a unicast flood is when a switch receives a unicast frame and treats it as a broadcast frame , flooding the frame to all other ports on the switch .
Devices other than switches may create unicast floods as well . A router which has a bridge interface but does not have the destination frame 's address in the bridge cache will flood the frame out to all bridge members . [ 2 ]
or a more robust , cross @-@ switch solution than ' switchport protected ' is the use of Private VLANs . [ 7 ]
When a network is experiencing unicast flooding , network performance is degraded . Here is an graph of a bridge before and after adjusting the size of the bridge address cache :
When a switch receives a unicast frame with a destination address not in the switch 's forwarding table , the frame is treated like a broadcast frame and sent to all hosts on a network :
Another common cause are hosts with ARP timers longer than the address cache timeout on switches - the switch forgets which port connects to the host . [ 1 ]
MAC flooding can also be used as a rudimentary VLAN hopping attack . [ 2 ]
To prevent MAC flooding attacks , network operators usually rely on the presence of one or more features in their network equipment :

It began in the late fourteenth @-@ century , largely through the work of Gerard Groote , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and flourished in the Low Countries and Germany in the fifteenth century , but came to an end with the Protestant Reformation . [ 2 ] It is most known today through its influence on Thomas à Kempis , the author of The Imitation of Christ , a book which proved highly influential for centuries . [ 1 ]
Origins
In the wake of the Protestant Reformation , the institutions of the Devotio Moderna declined rapidly . In Protestant territories , both the brother houses and the monasteries were dissolved .
The Imitation of Christ
By the late 15th century the advent of the printing press increased the reach of the movement ; The Imitation of Christ was printed in several languages by the end of the century .
The spiritual life of the Devotio Moderna followers was marked by focus on inner devotions and frequent short periods of meditation , especially before each new activity . [ 1 ]

Devotio Moderna began as a lay movement - around 1374 Groote established his parental house in Deventer into a hostel for poor women who wished to serve God .
By the end of the fifteenth century , there were almost 100 houses ( 84 of them male ) in the Chapter of Windesheim . [ 3 ]

Precautions and contraindications
Administration of tylosin should be avoided in animals with a known hypersensitivity to the product , or to other macrolides . [ 1 ]
Oral administration can result in diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disturbance .
This is particularly true of horses , such that it can be fatal . [ 9 ] Tylosin also has a foul taste that is difficult to disguise .
The injectable formulations of tylosin can cause pain , inflammation , and itchiness around the injection site .
Since tylosin has a relatively poor spectrum of activity against Gram @-@ negative organisms , it may not be a sensible therapeutic choice in the treatment of infections caused by unknown , potentially unsusceptible organisms .
Tylosin may increase digitalis blood levels , thus its toxicity , [ 1 ] and may be antagonistic to chloramphenicol or lincosamides .

Langerhans cells are immature dendritic cells that are found in all areas of the penile epithelium , [ 11 ] but are most superficial in the inner surface of the foreskin . [ 11 ]
The foreskin can be seen depicted in art from different ages .
Human neonatal dermal fibroblasts isolated from foreskin stained with calcein @-@ AM . Such cells are commonly used in bioreactor and tissue engineering applications .
Foreskins of babies are also used for skin graft tissue , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and for β @-@ interferon @-@ based drugs . [ 16 ]
Foreskin fibroblasts have been used in biomedical research . [ 17 ]
Development
The foreskin is present in non @-@ human primates , including the chimpanzee . [ 1 ]
Once the foreskin has naturally separated from the glans , the foreskin 's two layers of outer skin and inner mucosa can be retracted to reveal the glans , inner foreskin , and ridged band .
The foreskin typically covers the glans when the penis is not erect ( top image ) , but generally retracts upon erection ( bottom image ) . Coverage of the glans in a flaccid and erect state varies depending on foreskin length
Sensitivity
Modifications
Preputioplasty is the most common foreskin reconstruction technique , most often done when a boy is born with a foreskin that is too small ; [ 1 ] : 177 a similar procedure is performed to relieve a tight foreskin without resorting to circumcision . [ 41 ] : 181
Other cultural or aesethetic practices include genital piercings involving the foreskin and slitting the foreskin . [ 45 ]
Conditions
The foreskin can be involved in balanitis , phimosis , sexually transmitted infection and penile cancer . [ 46 ]
Frenulum breve is a frenulum that is insufficiently long to allow the foreskin to fully retract , which may lead to discomfort during intercourse .
Lichen sclerosus is a chronic , inflammatory skin condition that most commonly occurs in adult women , although it may also be seen in men and children . Topical clobetasol propionate and mometasone furoate were proven effective in treating genital lichen sclerosus . [ 47 ]

SUMO proteins are small ; most are around 100 amino acids in length and 12 kDa in mass . The exact length and mass varies between SUMO family members and depends on which organism the protein comes from .
Although SUMO has very little sequence identity with ubiquitin ( less than 20 % ) at the amino acid level , it has a nearly identical structural fold .
The structure of human SUMO1 is depicted on the right .
JASSA uses a scoring system based on a Position Frequency Matrix derived from the alignment of experimental SUMOylation sites or SIMs .
SUMO attachment ( SUMOylation )
SUMO attachment to its target is similar to that of ubiquitin ( as it is for the other ubiquitin @-@ like proteins such as NEDD 8 ) .
DeSUMOylation
SUMO can be removed from its substrate , which is called deSUMOylation . Specific proteases mediate this procedure ( SENP in human or Ulp1 and Ulp2 in yeast ) . [ 1 ]

The primary antibody binds to an antigen ( in red ) . A labeled secondary antibody ( in green ) , then binds to the primary antibody . The label is then used to indirectly detect the antigen .

Secondary antibodies help increase sensitivity and signal amplification due to multiple secondary antibodies binding to a primary antibody [ 2 ] .

Cultural traits alter the social and physical environments under which genetic selection operates .
View of culture
Genetic influence on cultural evolution
Genes affect cultural evolution via psychological predispositions on cultural learning . [ 20 ] Genes encode much of the information needed to form the human brain .
Culture can profoundly influence gene frequencies in a population .
Because genetic evolution is relatively well understood , most of DIT examines cultural evolution and the interactions between cultural evolution and genetic evolution .
DIT holds that genetic and cultural evolution interacted in the evolution of Homo sapiens .
Cultural group selection
Culture capacities are adaptations
Social learning processes give rise to cultural evolution . Cultural traits are transmitted differently from genetic traits and , therefore , result in different population @-@ level effects on behavioral variation .
Genes and culture co @-@ evolve
Group selection is a proposed mechanism of evolution in which natural selection acts at the level of the group , instead of at the more conventional level of the individual .

In mathematics , the notion of cancellative is a generalization of the notion of invertible .
The positive ( equally non @-@ negative ) integers form a cancellative semigroup under addition . The non @-@ negative integers form a cancellative monoid under addition .
In fact , any free semigroup or monoid obeys the cancellative law , and in general , any semigroup or monoid embedding into a group ( as the above examples clearly do ) will obey the cancellative law .
Note that this remains valid even if the ring in question is noncommutative and / or nonunital .
The cross product of two vectors does not obey the cancellation law . If a × b = a × c , then it does not follow that b = c even if a ≠ 0 .
Matrix multiplication also does not necessarily obey the cancellation law .

Ruling China from 1644 until the overthrow of the monarchy during the Xinhai Revolution , the Qing dynasty was the last imperial dynasty in China 's history .
Between 1862 and 1912 , the dynasty represented itself with the dragon flag .
In Chinese culture , a flaming pearl is shown on top of the dragon 's head . The pearl is associated with wealth , good luck , and prosperity .
The design of the flag was largely based on the Plain Yellow Banner , the one of three " upper " banner armies among the Eight Banners under the direct command of the emperor himself , and one of the four " right wing " banners . [ 2 ] [ 1 ]
The Eight Banners
The Eight Banners were administrative / military divisions under the Qing dynasty into which all Manchu households were placed . In war , the Eight Banners functioned as armies , but the banner system was also the basic organizational framework of all of Manchu society .

The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10,000 hours for power tubes .
Lighthouse tubes
Soviet lighthouse tube 6С5Д ( 6S5D )
Transit time effects are reduced by reduced spacings in the tube .
Tubes such as the 416B ( a Lighthouse design ) and the 7768 ( an all @-@ ceramic miniaturised design ) are specified for operation to 4 GHz . They feature greatly reduced grid @-@ cathode spacings in the order of 0.1 mm .
These greatly reduced grid spacings also give a much higher amplification factor than conventional axial designs .
The 7768 has an amplification factor of 225 , compared with 100 for the 6AV6 used in domestic radios and about the maximum possible for an axial design .
Anode @-@ grid capacitance is not especially low in these designs .
Operation
The triode 's anode current is highly dependent on anode voltage as well as grid voltage , causing it to appear as a voltage source in circuit .
The JFET 's drain current is virtually unaffected by drain voltage , thus it appears as a constant @-@ current device , similar in action to a tetrode or pentode tube .
Both the JFET and tetrode / pentode valves offer much higher voltage gains than the triode .
The triode was the first non @-@ mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies , and made radio practical . Triodes are used for amplifiers and oscillators .
Vacuum tubes are obsolete in mass @-@ marketed consumer electronics , having been overtaken by less expensive transistor @-@ based solid @-@ state devices . However , more recently , vacuum tubes have been making somewhat of a comeback .
Characteristics
In the class @-@ A triode amplifier , an anode resistor would be connected between the anode and the positive voltage source . For example , with Ra = 10000 ohms , the voltage drop on it would be
VRa = Ia × Ra = 22.5 V if an anode current of Ia = 2.25 mA is chosen .
Since the grid voltage changes from − 1.5 V to − 0.5 V , and the anode resistor voltage drops from 12 to 33 V , an amplification of the signal resulted . The amplification factor is 21 : output voltage amplitude divided by input voltage amplitude .
