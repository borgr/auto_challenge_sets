for systems that lack NX hardware , the 32 @-@ bit kernels now provide an approximation of the NX CPU feature via software emulation that can help block many exploits an attacker might run from stack or heap memory .
Exec Shield allows these controls to be set for both binary executables and for libraries ; if an executable loads a library requiring a given restriction relaxed , the executable will inherit that marking and have that restriction relaxed .
on 32 @-@ bit CPUs , this becomes 1.5 GB rather than 3 GB .

the LTR x86 instruction stands for load task register and is used in operating systems that support multitasking .
LTR is supported only in protected mode and long mode , not in real mode or virtual 8086 mode . it must be executed when the CPL is 0 , and therefore CANNOT be used by application programs .
LTR loads the special x86 task register with a segment selector that points to a task state segment .
after executing the LTR instruction , the TSS pointed to by the argument is marked busy , but no hardware task switch occurs .

biological effects
a statistic ( singular ) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample ( e.g. , its arithmetic mean value ) . it is calculated by applying a function ( statistical algorithm ) to the values of the items of the sample , which are known together as a set of data .
observability
more formally , statistical theory defines a statistic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample 's distribution ; that is , the function can be stated before realization of the data . the term statistic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample .

approximate identity Non @-@ analytic smooth function Bump function convolution Weierstrass transform Distribution ( mathematics ) Kurt Otto Friedrichs Generalized function Sergei Sobolev
a mollifier ( top ) in dimension one . at the bottom , in red is a function with a corner ( left ) and sharp jump ( right ) , and in blue is its mollified version .
in mathematics , mollifiers ( also known as approximations to the identity ) are smooth functions with special properties , used for example in distribution theory to create sequences of smooth functions approximating nonsmooth ( generalized ) functions , via convolution .
it must be pointed out that there is a little misunderstanding in the concept of mollifier : Friedrichs defined as " mollifier " the integral operator whose kernel is one of the functions nowadays called mollifiers .
as briefly pointed out in the " Historical notes " section of this entry , originally , the term " mollifier " identified the following convolution operator : [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
where φ ϵ ( x ) = ϵ − n φ ( x / ϵ ) { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ varphi _ { \ epsilon } ( x ) = \ epsilon ^ { -n } \ varphi ( x / \ epsilon ) } and φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi } is a smooth function satisfying the first three conditions stated above and one or more supplementary conditions as positivity and symmetry .
for any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } , the following family of convolutions indexed by the real number ϵ { \ displaystyle \ epsilon }
where ∗ { \ displaystyle \ ast } denotes convolution , is a family of smooth functions .
for any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } , the following family of convolutions indexed by the real number ϵ { \ displaystyle \ epsilon } converges to T { \ displaystyle T }
for any distribution T { \ displaystyle T } ,

a packing density or packing fraction of a packing in some space is the fraction of the space filled by the figures making up the packing . in packing problems , the objective is usually to obtain a packing of the greatest possible density .
all translations of a fixed body is also a common supply collection of interest , and it defines the translative packing constant of that body .

uniform tilings can exist in both the Euclidean plane and hyperbolic plane . uniform tilings are related to the finite uniform polyhedra which can be considered uniform tilings of the sphere .
finally tilings can be described by their vertex configuration , the sequence of polygons around each vertex .
the first is made of 2 @-@ edges , and next two are triangular edges , and the last has overlapping hexagonal edges .
2 { 6 } 6 or 3 { 4 } 6 or 3 { 6 } 3 or 6 { 3 } 6 or
drawing the tiles colored as red on the original faces , yellow at the original vertices , and blue along the original edges , there are 8 forms , 7 which are topologically distinct . ( the truncated triangular tiling is topologically identical to the hexagonal tiling . )

for uniform polyhedra , the angle defect can be used to compute the number of vertices .
Descartes ' theorem states that all the angle defects in a topological sphere must sum to 4π radians or 720 degrees .
in particular it follows that { a , b } has 4 / ( 2 - b ( 1 - 2 / a ) ) vertices .

this tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra and tilings , extending into the hyperbolic plane : { 4 , p } , p = 3,4,5 ...
like the uniform polyhedra there are eight uniform tilings that can be based from the regular square tiling .

second derivative power rule
the laplacian of a function is equal to the divergence of the gradient and the trace of the Hessian matrix .
on the graph of a function , the second derivative corresponds to the curvature or concavity of the graph . the graph of a function with a positive second derivative is upwardly concave , while the graph of a function with a negative second derivative curves in the opposite way .
the power rule for the first derivative , if applied twice , will produce the second derivative power rule as follows :
that is : the second derivative of a function f ( x ) { \ displaystyle f ( x ) } is usually denoted f ″ ( x ) { \ displaystyle f " ( x ) } .
when using Leibniz 's notation for derivatives , the second derivative of a dependent variable y with respect to an independent variable x is written
the derivative of f is the function
it is possible to write a single limit for the second derivative :
the second derivative generalizes to higher dimensions through the notion of second partial derivatives . for a function f : R3 → R , these include the three second @-@ order partials
another common generalization of the second derivative is the laplacian . this is the differential operator ∇ 2 { \ displaystyle \ nabla ^ { 2 } } defined by

the length of main span is the most common method of comparing the sizes of suspension bridges , often correlating with the height of the towers and the engineering complexity involved in designing and constructing the bridge .

reception and interpretation
decimal Palindromic numbers
decimal Palindromic numbers with an even number of digits are divisible by 11 .
for instance : Palindromic numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics . a typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property and are Palindromic .
with , as usual , 0 ≤ ai < b for all i and AK ≠ 0 . then n is Palindromic if and only if ai = AK − i for all i .
zero is written 0 in any base and is also Palindromic by definition .

the JFET 's drain current is virtually unaffected by drain voltage , thus it appears as a constant @-@ current device , similar in action to a tetrode or pentode tube .
the triode was the first non @-@ mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies , and made radio practical . triodes are used for amplifiers and oscillators .
in the class @-@ A triode amplifier , an anode resistor would be connected between the anode and the positive voltage source . for example , with Ra = 10000 ohms , the voltage drop on it would be
since the grid voltage changes from − 1.5 V to − 0.5 V , and the anode resistor voltage drops from 12 to 33 V , an amplification of the signal resulted . the amplification factor is 21 : output voltage amplitude divided by input voltage amplitude .

where an underlying cause can be identified , treatment may be directed at this . clearly heavy periods at menarche and menopause may settle spontaneously ( the menarche being the start and menopause being the cessation of periods ) .
treatment depends on the cause , severity , and interference with quality of life . [ 4 ] Initial treatment often involve birth control pills .
complications of heavy menstrual bleeding could also be the initial symptoms . excessive bleeding can lead to anemia which presents as fatigue , shortness of breath , and weakness . anemia can be diagnosed with a blood test .
