and I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville .
I fell asleep on the plane until , during the middle of the night , we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling .
and I thought to myself , in the middle of the night , in the middle of the Atlantic , what in the world could be wrong in Washington ?

now wait a minute , you may say , how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first ?

but think for a moment what that means .
your brains are about 100 million times more complicated .
somewhere , in a pattern like this , is you , your perceptions , your emotions , your memories , your plans for the future .
we thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic , we should be able , artificially , to nag the Actor into changing its policy .
in the experiments I told you about , we have lifted the identity of the Critic , but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job .
so for us , this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie .
so these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say , " I built that , and I 'm proud of it . "

1874 : General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory , specifically the Black Hills .
this is the legacy of Manifest Destiny .
and right now , that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us , that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption .
and that was a stroke of absolute genius , because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract , private power , to deliver public goods .
those factories will probably never see an inspector .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park .
this is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan .
the circled node is the one we 're trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
when you see a diagram like this , I don 't want you to be afraid .
we 've got a real problem with math education right now .
and in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
that 's an amazing amount of human endeavor .
what does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth ?
the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection , and it operates very differently .
no , I don 't think it is .
every small obstacle , every slight uphill , would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up .

and he goes on saying , and everyone looks at him like a hero , probably for the first time in his life .
and only now , " he says , " I 'm beginning to understand where I am , and I actually like it . "

they 're beautiful . they 're bamboo .
so we basically turned the box into a bubble .
and you know what these are .
there 's nowhere to flush .
and they work . people use them . people are okay .
I said , " Welcome to Green School . "
it 's becoming a community .
this is the school buffalo .
green School is a place of pioneers , local and global .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this .
we had them engineered by the engineers .
and Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers , selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age @-@ old techniques , mostly by hand .
it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world , but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful .
green School is a model we built for the world .
it is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed .
the " high seas " is a legal term , but in fact , it covers 50 percent of the planet .

so stay tuned for further information .
now , I 'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn 't support , but I am going to tell you that , if it matters to you , your legislators need to know that .
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half @-@ circle of explosion .
but there 's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it .
but there 's also the fear of losing loved ones , and I think that 's even worse .
it 's too painful . you don 't want to think about it .
we have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics , tactics , weapons , dollars and casualties .
eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children . Oh .
or , as we speak now , hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated .
how interesting .
these just become numbers that we refer to .
it is a chess game .
and in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace , we must understand war and peace from both sides .
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don 't start investing in women and girls .
she was sending them to school . have a new home .
ideas , language , even the phrase ' each other ' no longer makes any sense . "
but let 's sort of start at the beginning .
so , we have companies and non @-@ profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort .
if you try that , I think you 'll agree , and hopefully you can do it more often .
you can put these things away , and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule , at your own time , when you 're available , when you 're ready to go again .
just don 't have it .
certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill -- even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .
I got that staircase for 20 dollars , including delivery to my lot .
and they gave me the fence , but they didn 't give me the shaper , so we made a deadbolt out of it .
( laughter ) And sure enough , we 've had no problems with bull elephants .
( laughter ) Then , this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle @-@ class front door in America .

" oops . scratch . dumpster . "
by the middle of the 19th century , it 's in full flower .
I feel that expectation , and so I accommodate it , and I 'm living my life according to what you expect me to do .
you see this in junior high a lot .
I want you to know that there are farmers ' markets in every community popping up .
they start off like 17 camels , no way to resolve it .
and yet , like many family reunions , it 's not all peace and light .
no , it 's because of the story , because we feel personally involved in that story .
and his basic value was respect , was kindness toward strangers .
he said , " It was like a light that went on in our lives -- it brought us hope . "
because as people walk , they spend money .
that 's a third @-@ side act .
capitalism , fundamentally , is a series of marketplaces .
that means that in terms of biomass , insects are more abundant than we are , and we 're not on a planet of men , but we 're on a planet of insects .
that 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we 're eating , like a cow or a pig or a sheep .
now you may say , " Okay , so we 're eating 500 grams just by accident . "
one gram of gold is 30 euros .
the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .
on the right @-@ hand side you see a grasshopper .
a Dutch chocolate maker .
and I 'm going to show to Bruno some first tries , and he can have the first bite .
they 're extremely sensitive to smell .
well don 't talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
a clicker , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors .
and by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second @-@ line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
thank you very much .
it 's the notion that all people in a society deserve fair and equitable rights , opportunities and access to resources .
it can look like this ...

when you see the cube one way , behind the screen , those boundaries go away .
so now we 're going to be subjects in the experiment .
Jeff Hawkins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
we put them in bottles , refrigerate them , and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again .
it serves 220 people a day .
but this story 's not about eliminating it , it 's about minimizing it .
a couple of wormeries in there too .
this restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House -- same chairs , same tables .
the air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air @-@ conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there .
acorn House is the element of wood ; Waterhouse is the element of water ; and I 'm thinking , well , I 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities .
five weeks old , it 's my baby , and it 's hurting real bad .
so basically , the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway .
and I hope you all take part .
it 's too much to put this poor woman through , she 's been through so much already . "
first time , nobody answered .
maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious .
maybe something 's happening here .

those older people were not going to be able to make the crossing with them .
and got the chance to record this music , this new music that they were creating , and to spread it throughout the world .
and I think what Herbie said : please listen , listen .
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced , and then , based on the musical ability , then that person could either enter or not .
so there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
so we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
but thank you very much for having me !
but in the last couple of years we 've become infamous for a couple of things .
then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends , including President Obama .

he was a troubled kid .
he was having sex .
Johnny call , you go .
two things : one , I never had sex .
she 's 16 years old .
this fear , getting outside the man box , totally enveloped me .
see collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men .
we as men , good men , the large majority of men , we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization .

now I 'm going to give you a story .
so this is the foundation time which I got .
I don 't know if he really meant [ that ] , but it happened .
how do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ?

this was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket .
I had other options , but I didn 't choose them .

and in places where you wouldn 't think , such as South Korea , India and China , the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little , and families are no longer strongly preferring first @-@ born sons .

I have been teaching for a long time , and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students .

we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
so what do you do when the information is all around you ?
in Philadelphia we have a one @-@ to @-@ one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information .
to ask them to always have the right answer doesn 't allow them to learn .
and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint .
mark Granovetter , the sociologist , had a famous paper " The Strength of Weak Ties , " and what he did in this paper is he asked people how they got their jobs .

but in fact , there 's more to it than that .
it seems to us that when people start dissembling , people start lying about things , that 's when it gets really interesting .
I remember vividly , sitting there in the hospital .

so Alisa 's experience is not isolated .
I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in .
so I 'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life , this chasm of happiness that we 're driving our proverbial convertible straight into .
there 's something missing from these studies .
there 's another factor in our case .
can we move that up a little bit ?
and so today , what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now .
it will become many things .
Becka : the smile , I think .
woman 2 : um ...
PJ : you like the smirky look better ?

so , " Large @-@ scale governmental surveillance of email and internet traffic ought to be permissible as means to combat international crime and terrorism . "
some go from being uncertain to clear voting intention .
but it 's one thing to talk about the brain , and it 's another to see it .

a single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine , serotonin and noradrenaline .
WS : new move -- uppercut , right and left .
we 're bartering , trading , swapping , sharing , but they 're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms .
these four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defined by hyper @-@ consumption , towards the 21st century , defined by collaborative consumption .
that matches Mr. Jones , with some spare space in his back garden , with Mrs. Smith , a would @-@ be grower .
these three systems are coming together , allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles , or their cherished personal freedoms .
it 's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise .
I don 't want the DVD ; I want the movie it carries .
and this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption .
it 's a new social currency , so to speak , that could become as powerful as our credit rating .
grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down as she opens the envelope and reads .
the word " kufungisisa " opens up a floodgate of tears .
it literally means " thinking too much . "

BJ : but when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear , she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .
and that 's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period .
lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same , and so in a stroke , the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers .
BJ : so you have to know , looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now , it is all about critical awareness .
so what are our intentions , and what would our intentions be -- if we wake up in the morning , we have designs on the world -- well , what would our intention be as a species now that we 're the dominant species ?
this is what I presented to the White House .
so we 've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .
and at what point did that uniform turn from white to black ?
is there anybody here who doesn 't breathe ?
we see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don 't .
and yet , NOAA has now shown us , for example -- you see that little blue thing above Hawaii ?

here 's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet .
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor , a cradle to cradle car -- concept car .
the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever , some of the materials go back to soil -- it 's all solar @-@ powered .
this is their plan .
and they brought us in and said , " What would you do ? "
we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .
the farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next .
when I was in college , my senior year , I took a course called European Intellectual History .
and she said , " I learned something today .
we know that two @-@ thirds of them are going to go back .
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities , diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
and where is this waste handled ? usually in poor communities .
and I think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and we love this , because I love construction now , because we 're watching these things actually happen .
so I think what I 'll do is just call you a storyteller . "
and I was like , " Why not ' magic pixie ' ? "
so where I started was with connection .
the things I can tell you about it : it 's universal ; we all have it .
at one point , people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years .
I kind of understood , this is what shame is , this is how it works .
the other thing that they had in common was this : they fully embraced vulnerability .
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research , where our job -- you know , the definition of research is to control and predict , to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict .
( laughter ) A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown , but I assure you , it was a breakdown .
and I think I have a problem , and I need some help . "

stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump .
they didn 't make loans and then sell the loans .
and Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want .

so imagine a kid : " am I going to get wet ? am I going to get wet ?
I don 't know if this is called a basket @-@ bra , but it ought to be something like that .
we have art students getting together , taking old radiator parts and doing an iron @-@ pour to make something new out of it .
they did that in the summer , and it was very warm .
you know what those are , right ?
Billy @-@ Bob , or Billy Bass , or something like that .
DD : so it goes on to show you people making things out of wood , a grandfather making a ship in a bottle , a woman making a pie -- somewhat standard fare of the day .
he 's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys .
it 's a micro @-@ controller .
if you don 't know what those are , they 're just the " brains . "
and when someone opens your mailbox , you get a notification , an alert message goes to your iPhone .
let me connect the dots .
at worst , we shoot first and ask no questions .
imagine if we could reduce the intensity of threat within those 60 seconds and keep our brains from going on lockdown .
the cool part is the barbers use their cultural style to deliver this health education to 18- to 24 @-@ year @-@ old men while they 're cutting their hair .
my oldest , Bryan , is 26 , and my youngest , Julian , is 12 .
in August of 2013 , Julian , who was eight at the time , and I were folding laundry , which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence , I should have known something strange was going to happen .
on the TV were Trayvon Martin 's parents , and they were crying because of the acquittal of George Zimmerman .
HS : as Julian was getting it , I started to lose it .
HS : well , they better run .
HS : well , you know what , I 'm gonna call police , too , like I should .
but you can 't ; you 're right , you can 't just go chasing people .
I don 't like that .
JS : um ...
you never know what some crazy people will think about you .
with racial literacy , and yes , practice , we can decode the racial trauma from our stories , and our healing will come in the telling .
running : it 's basically just right , left , right , left , yeah ?
now , this is when something really bizarre happens .
so we all know what to do in this situation , right ?
you show me a creature with webbed feet and gills ; somehow water 's involved .
someone with that kind of heart , there 's some kind of connection there .
Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel .
that 's all we could do .
those expert trackers have to be part of the pack .
you can 't be a pissed @-@ off pack .
the pack has got to be able to swallow its ego , be cooperative , and pull together .
Geronimo was never saying , " You know something , my Achilles -- I 'm tapering .
resolutions , smoke .
there are things that the past can teach us to help us upgrade the present .
TKM : thank you .
on the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened .
walk the dog . have sex again .
as I was walking out of his bedroom , he said , " Dad ? " I went , " Yes , mate ? "
being more balanced doesn 't mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
ever since I was a little girl seeing " Star Wars " for the first time , I 've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots .
three years later -- a lot of programming , working with other graduate students in the lab -- Kismet was ready to start interacting with people .
we developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio .
and because it 's new , Leo doesn 't really know what to make of it .
the first was just the screen .
it turns out , when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost .
we try Skype , we try phone calls , but my boys are little -- they don 't really want to talk ; they want to play .
( laughter ) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study , they would come out to the car and say good @-@ bye to the robots .
and when it 's in their world , they can relate to it and play with it in a way that 's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
I think that 's very , very important .
Hawa Abdi : many people -- 20 years for Somalia -- [ were ] fighting .
and they are in our backyard .
Ha : we are doing C @-@ sections and different operations because people need some help .
would you explain the rules for admission ?
Ha : my age -- because I was born in 1947 -- we were having , at that time , government , law and order .
the next thing is sodium chloride .
( applause ) ( Music ) Felice Bell : gambling .
" how did you two meet ? " like we 're a married couple .
( laughter ) FB : we met at the Nuyorican Poets Caf√© in 1999 .
JM : really ?
( laughter ) FB : Sherlock Holmes doesn 't need a license .
( laughter ) FB : after the pizzeria reading , we have a slice .
FB : when a sister loves a sister , it is five o 'clock in the morning , you are asleep and she is calling .
FB : what is wrong with you ? JM : what 's wrong with you ?
FB : when a sister loves a sister , you listen to her read , thinking -- JM : as heaven to the gods is poetry to the beloved .
( whistling ) ( Whistling ends ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
and actually , until I was 34 , I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling , because , to be honest , my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior .
I would love to , but why ?
( laughter ) I lost my face .
( laughter ) No , no , no . it 's four minutes long .
and I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
he 's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
we need those things too , but we 're also bumping up against their limits .
compassion can 't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity .
and those distributions grow .
but we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .
two months later , something incredible happens .
here 's what it looked like in the laboratory .
what did we do to their brains ?
we 're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning .
( laughter ) Well , almost .
that day , I discovered the power of fashion , and I 've been in love with it ever since .
and so it 's the pursuit of better things , easily shared .
one of the founders went to Switzerland , saw it implemented someplace , said , " Wow , that looks really cool .
and so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car ?
from my perspective , one of the things pop @-@ up stores do is create perishability and urgency .
and then I thought , well this is fun .
the women in Bosnia were being raped .
I get there , and there are six other women , out of 183 .
Oh , I 'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound .
wait for the man with the mockingbird . "
they 've grown used to their face ; they think they 're special .
this was something more than that . he ignored it .
they 're trying to achieve difference in their lives .
we look at O.J. -- he 's a good @-@ looking guy .
and beauty doesn 't equate to goodness , and certainly doesn 't equate to contentment .
would we be happy if our doctor 's face , our lawyer 's face , our financial adviser 's face was covered ?
so we 've talked a lot about facial appearance .
so with modern technology , we used computers to make models .
just imagine , I can make a biologically @-@ degradable template .
can we distribute radio @-@ frequency tokens to identify people ?
so the genome really tells you much more about predisposition .
not going to be easy . "
so if I zoom into that picture , I can just show you what it means .
two years later , when the time came for me to go to university , my father turned his eyes , his attention , to my younger brothers .
they found something called Twitter .
they were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception .
if you switch off the cameras tonight , there will be a genocide .
thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
( laughter ) " That 's cool . "
I mean , these were the faces of my friends .
a year later , I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict .
" Oh , we 're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job .
and they would put a number : " please call this number if you know what 's going on in Providencia . "
women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
behind each image is a story .
the people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .
new York .
I use Man Ray , Helen Levitt , Giacomelli , other people 's artwork .
art is not supposed to change the world , to change practical things , but to change perceptions .
or , " How can we help ? "
and in the Egyptian revolution , the Revolution 2.0 , everyone has contributed something , small or big . they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .
we only ranked high when it comes to poverty , corruption , lack of freedom of speech , lack of political activism .
there are lots of people who are frustrated .
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010 .
" what are we going to do ? " " I don 't know . "
but did the regime learn anything ? not really .
and I did not really hear anything . I did not know anything .
and that was a personal belief , regardless of what 's going on , regardless of the details .
well , this is about state budgets .
but we have a problem .
now this leaves 10 percent deficit , sort of a mind @-@ blowing number .
receipts go down , some spending programs go up , but most of it is not because of that .
what were those things that allowed us to hide this ?
so what do we need to do ?
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
here 's the scanner going through , scanning the wound .
once it 's scanned , it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be .
and Dr. Kang 's going to walk onstage right now , and we 're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today .
put a pair of gloves here .
so Luke , you go to your communications professors -- you 're majoring in communications -- and you ask them for permission to come to TED , which might have a little bit to do with communications , and what was their reaction ?
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy .
which brings me to my third paradox .
so she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact .
they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin .
then you build on that in the next concept .
BG : is this ready for prime time ?
and the journalist was asking him , " Why is this so important ? "
it meant something that would connect us all together .
so Facebook isn 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible , algorithmic editing of the Web .
Google 's doing it too .
so here 's my friend Scott 's screen shot .
that 's how different these results are becoming .
it wasn 't perfect , but it got us through the last century .
we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
so you 're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made .
and we see these amazing structures -- these little knots of two colors of thread we call " social hot spots . "
the spiral thread we call a " solo hot spot . "
they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand .
but the paradox is , when a lot of these people slip into the policy @-@ making mode , that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants .
babies flop out , they 're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things .
it would be a big seller .
and they 've become elegant and slender -- they don 't really have thighs ; they just have one elegant calve on top of another .
so me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony , but it is the central organizing process of the way we think .
it tells us what to imprint .
and the third insight is that we 're not primarily self @-@ contained individuals .
time magazine asked Americans , " Are you in the top one percent of earners ? "
they couldn 't tell you how they did it , but they could feel cold , they felt a coldness , and they were more often right than wrong .
he was married to a woman named Carol , and they had a wonderful relationship .
now even light will be bent by those paths .
it didn 't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution .
this is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago , which is the reason I bring him up now , because it 's kind of an anniversary year .
she does very complex tasks , and I haven 't got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn 't like making mistakes .
they shoot everything , every single thing that moves that 's bigger than a small rat ; they sun @-@ dry it or smoke it .
somebody said that yesterday .
we 're in every state now , and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York .
but I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
I know that I 'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here , which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool .
( laughter ) Why was the scarecrow invited to TED ?
the poem was very indignant , and mainly exaggerated , but the only spoken @-@ word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant , so I thought that 's what was expected of me .
I love spoken word . I will keep coming back week after week . "
I use poetry to help me work through what I don 't understand , but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I 've been .
fourth , someone has something you thought you knew everything about , but they 're introducing a new angle of looking at it .
and most people respond really well to this exercise .
but in Hiroshima , some people were wiped clean away , leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page .
but in that instant , I get to share your present .
let me ! let me push the button ! "
and yet , in the world , there are so many people who still heat the water on fire , and they cook their food on fire .
there are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day .
and these ones , who have washing machines but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
this group uses three , one each .
of course , they must be more energy efficient .
she loved this .
( laughter ) But unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution .
now , I 'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity 's problems -- since there 's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra .
it 's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
and I want you to see , this is Fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
and so , my fellow primates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we rediscover creativity , fellowship and wonder .
we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
this is a Beefalo .
but something much , much more powerful is happening now .
some of you may have read about the FDA 's consideration right now of genetically @-@ engineered salmon .
it 's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy , a real " gold ring " of cloning , because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings .
the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways .
this is what Frankenstein 's lab looks like .
her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied .
but sadly , today , languages are dying at an unprecedented rate .
but I do know that I 've seen a lot of changes .
and this is the plot behind Stuxnet .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , " Well , we don 't know what the target is .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
it 's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
BJ : so Tom gave us a call and said , " Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre ? "
BJ : about 40 people .
the choreographer , Toby Sedgwick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse .
you can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there .
so here are some half @-@ finished horses ready to be worked in London .
BJ : Joey .
each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
I had failed .
I was born in Bombay , India , and just before my first birthday , I contracted polio , which left me paralyzed from the hips down .
many people who contract polio in developing countries do not have access to the same medical care , education , or opportunities like I have had in America .
in each image , I married disparate costumes from widely diverse traditions , countries and time frames .
I gamely employed the multicolored carpet and a vibrant color , in order to evoke the splendor of the multicolored painted bunting bird .
there is whiff of the rake about him , and that gives him an enchanting edge .
in fact , while we drove 140,000 miles , people didn 't even notice .
I wanted to be a rock star .
the choir people in my high school were pretty geeky , and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people .
and I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself .
well a couple of years ago , a friend of mine emailed me a link , a YouTube link , and said , " You have got to see this . "
( video ) Britlin Losee : hi Mr. Eric Whitacre .
so I wrote on my blog , " OMG OMG . "
afterwards , I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to .
( singing ) This is Jamal Walker from Dallas , Texas .
and a number of sopranos uploaded their parts .
here 's our winner of the soprano solo .
I said , " Thank you , Scott . I 'm so glad that you found me . "
thank you so much .
( video ) Soprano : ‚ô´ Upon my pillow ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Safe in bed ‚ô´ EW : that 's Georgie from England . she 's only nine .
yeah , I 'm sure a lot of you have heard that too .
" it hurt so much , and I shed some tears , but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words .
what I 'd like to close with then today is the first look at " Sleep " by Virtual Choir 2.0 .
this will be a premiere today .
right , the current wants to run through the play @-@ dough , not through that LED .
I can start plugging in lots of lights .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early .
you didn 't really want to jump , but you want out .
you do that because , 27 years before , an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that .
I have no idea whether it makes any difference , but he seemed to make sense , and I wasn 't going to test the hypothesis that he 'd be wrong .
so then you look around , you 're under a canopy and you say , " This is good . "
and that 's not going to hurt .
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership : Robert E. Lee , John Buford at Gettysburg .
and I 'm not sure that was real interaction .
and I saw my battalion commander , because I had let him down .
and that 's a new kind of leadership for me .
we talked about the operation , and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that .
I asked , " Where were you on 9 / 11 ? "
you don 't reset , or recharge your battery every time .
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world , but Google is the place I 'm familiar with because I 've been there for 10 years , so I 'll use Google as the case study .
they just go ahead and start a fundraiser .
so what are they ?
there are three components of compassion .
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?
in our experience , there are three ingredients .
so using the supercharged attention from step one , we create a high @-@ resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes .
I want you to be happy . "
so the movie will be called " The Greatest Movie Ever Sold . "
this would have been fine .
( laughter ) That 's very risky .
there 's your story , there 's my story and there 's the real story . "
so how specifically will we see Ban in the film ?
whether it 's a " Floral Fusion " or a " Paradise Winds , " they 'll have their chance .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we 're very much a challenger brand .
MS : that is a fantastic question .
these devices aren 't accessible to people . "
so they go around and do art installations like this .
this is called the EyeWriter , and you can see the description .
and now we 've created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
and I went on a run that I know so well .
this is me , all of me .
losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
and yet , look around us .
and in a chemically more complex universe , it 's possible to make more things .
and that is how our solar system was formed , four and a half billion years ago .
in the center of a star , there 's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again .
you don 't stabilize the individual ; you stabilize the template , the thing that carries information , and you allow the template to copy itself .
it 's what makes us different .
as long as the city 's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren 't going to be engaged .
but that 's not apathy ; that 's intentional exclusion .
public space .
( applause ) The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change , because we 've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression .
why do some large @-@ scale crises jolt us awake and inspire us to change and evolve while others might jolt us a bit , but then it 's back to sleep ?
and within each compartment , there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs , each competing with one another for credit , name recognition and of course , resources .
but first we need to picture the world that we 're fighting for .
the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask , " Where is God in all this ?
is God a cold , unfeeling spectator ?
the loving soul of the universe .
is God just another name for the universe , with no independent existence at all ?
and how would we live such a faith ? how would I live such a faith ?
these are real !
it was very James Bond .
so , his story . my father was born in Argentina .
Chaz Ebert : it was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak .
it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on " Casablanca " and " Citizen Kane . "
I plan to use it on television , radio and the Internet .
the point is Plato was only 50 years ago , an instant in time .
there are people who don 't want to make eye contact .
if I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago , I would be as isolated as a hermit .
I 've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days .
so how do we do this ?
we actually had a guy from the BBC 's " Frozen Planet " on one of these flights .
but the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells -- the fact that these cells are derived from five @-@ day old human embryos -- has encouraged research into other types of stem cells .
and adult stem cells are found in you and me -- in our blood , in our bone marrow , in our fat , our skin and other organs .
and they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
sometimes you even watch satellite , CNN , from the United States .
you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking .
it 's your land ; it 's your resource .
they all have blond hair , blue eyes . they 're happy .
and they have big cities , and the cities are all dependent on oil .
and the soldiers are Chinese , and everybody else is Chinese .
you see , that 's empathy .
the human species , in general , is fallible -- okay fine .
and the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing -- thank you , these are great answers , but they 're answers to a different question .
but just being wrong doesn 't feel like anything .
think back for a moment to elementary school .
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
it 's that you can see the world as it isn 't .
and yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
he proposed the film to me , and I said , " Yeah , maybe it 'll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . "
you know the one .
( laughter ) You know that teacher ?
I didn 't use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
that 's my brother Malcolm there on the right .
now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
and I think it 's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
but I don 't try to deny them that reality of being human .
I had bought a copy of this book , " The Universe and Dr. Einstein " -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we 're all made of -- and that 's four percent of the universe .
an extraordinary set of telescopes .
it 's not a thing I often do , so listen carefully .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) But that 's putting it too negatively .
this is one nation under God . "
so , my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy , but it isn 't very likely , is it ?
now , this is an elite audience , and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious .
( laughter ) He turns off the engines .
and then he says three words .
it feels great .
what would you get done that you 're waiting to get done because you think you 'll be here forever ?
thank you .
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
quite a few more .
how about fitness ?
Ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
in the interval , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
and one night , there 's a knock at his hotel room door .
I want to achieve it through not dying . "
who doesn 't want healthier children ?
and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it .
we respond to stories more than data .
and there are two ways to do this .
I have feeling and reality .
where do we get these models ? we get them from others .
I visit her in the hospital .
so in this case , for instance , novelty could be climbing Machu Picchu for the first time , as I did in 2016 .
I mean , think about the never @-@ ending fight of viruses and bacteria with our immune system .
so think about an alien invasion , now , here , in Milan , or me -- I stopped thinking for 15 minutes .
and somehow , we predict that the rate of innovation should decrease steadily over time .
so you listen to " Suzanne " by Leonard Cohen , and this experience triggers your passion for Cohen so that you start frantically listening to his whole production .
and the aim of all this is to raise a generation of people able to come up with new ideas to face the challenges in front of us .
is this something that other people can do ?
the National Movement of India was testimony to that .
it 's like its own little coupling .
why use triangles ?
( applause ) If you , as a matter of fact , put four marbles inside , you simulate the molecular structure of methane , CH4 .
I see hope . I see happiness in their faces .
now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around .
and now , if you have this pump , it 's like a great , great sprinkler .
and you put a little fan here .
there 's a hole here , and I shut this .
teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years , they just muck up the definition and they spit it out .
you can see a gleam in their eye .
over 100,000 children learn science this way .
and we 're just trying to see possibilities .
this is a little straw , and what you do is you just nip two corners here , and this becomes like a baby crocodile 's mouth .
I 'm going to keep this outside , to blow out . I 'm going to suck in air .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
( laughter ) ( Translator ) AW : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other .
my son Paul , he 's 19 years old , he 's driving me home from work one day , and he says , " Ma , did you know that the murder rate in Baltimore is higher than it 's ever been ? "
and they kept their word .
and I 'll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it .
and one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was , imagine this pipe , and you 've got valves , solenoid valves , taps , opening and closing .
if those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
he liked it very much .
the whole building is made of water .
and if there 's a bit of wind , if you want to minimize splashing , you can actually lower the roof .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
and this is what led us to think about the following project I 'll show you now .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pixels .
so as a fashion designer , I 've always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
but then I met a biologist , and now I think of materials like this -- green tea , sugar , a few microbes and a little time .
again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
and in fact , cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark .
what I 'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
it 's not something you have to worry about -- the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us .
so Boltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium .
now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means .
this is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
very , very high resolution .
has to be visible in bright daylight . will work anywhere .
now , we 've actually done some research -- Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market .
now , I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks .
only if we open enough locker doors .
( laughter ) Now the good news about Architects for Humanity is they 're really kind of the most amazing group .
and the really wonderful thing about this is , when you 're done , well -- you can eat it .
and we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ .
" free Bird . "
and then finally back into the English , which is , we 're totally fucked .
so we 're going to build this new building on stilts .
now this film isn 't really hard enough , so I wanted to make it a little bit harder .
and I fear , if we do nothing for our planet , in 20 years , it 's going to look like this .
( laughter ) Mr. Vice President , I wish I knew how to quit you .
the little things in life , sometimes that we forget about , like pollination , that we take for granted .
well , their answer was , " It 's all about risk and reward . "
" well , why ? "
rarely seen by the naked eye , this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment .
here are some images from the film .
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
thank you very much . I appreciate it .
projections are that we could lose polar bears , they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years .
there was no ice around .
we 're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic .
and when you have low productivity in this , in ice , the productivity in copepods go down .
but they 're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe , catch a breath , because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod .
Leopard seals , since the time of Shackleton , have had a bad reputation .
so this is that story .
it doesn 't work that way .
you get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac , floating in these icy waters , and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon .
he said , " If you get scared , you close your eyes , ya , and she 'll go away . "
she grabs another one . she does this over and over .
( laughter ) Now I 've got four or five penguins floating around my head , and I 'm just sitting there shooting away .
and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about , and that we 're familiar with , for the textile industry , the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things .
and we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C , so 140 degrees Fahrenheit , for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin .
how many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day ?
have you ever wondered why being around children , who smile so frequently , makes you smile very often ?
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate .
you 've got the Uffizi , you 've got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
explore .
this is the real cool part . it 's called Collections .
I 'm sure there are people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew , and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman .
he was a man of many , many parts .
he was full of macho , a kind of macho one @-@ upmanship .
and what did we talk about ?
the brain doesn 't feel pain .
for example , let 's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier , the one that 's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory .
and we 'll make different cells in the brain sensitive to light .
the animal hears a tone . a flash of light occurs .
there 's no audio , but you see that the animal freezes -- the tone used to mean bad news .
and the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
so it 's early days , to be upfront , but we 're excited about it .
I wanted to close with one story , which we think could potentially be a clinical application .
let 's zoom in on it so we can see it in more detail .
on the other hand , light can still get into the eye .
so we 're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach .
we 're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology .
( applause ) Juan Enriquez : so some of this stuff is a little dense .
Je : well , that might change a couple things . thank you .
EB : thank you .
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that .
this is a shop for a bag company .
this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball .
and openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges , but it 's quite a basic thing .
but the bridges that we saw that opened and closed -- I 'm slightly squeamish -- but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball .
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren 't being capitalized on .
it was voted the worst place in Britain to live .
so we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
but this phenomenal project 's been happening .
and by night , artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside .
and so the rest of the site was a public space .
the British government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
and there was a lot of terror .
and it 's in a piece of land that 's this site .
th : these are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure .
you can see that the arm is discolored , purplish in color .
I don 't design detention centers , and I don 't even design courthouses .
I 'm going to build the world 's first restorative justice center all by myself .
and we have plans to replicate it in Washington D.C. , Detroit , New York and New Orleans .
next summer , the village will launch , and it pops up every single week , expanding to more and more communities as it goes .
and I think this is actually a shrimp that 's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
now , in keeping with today 's theme , I 'd like to point out -- something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else .
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication .
and I like that .
this is again showing all the different contributions .
that 's all I 'm getting paid for this ?
you may recognize these two guys .
so we resynthesized this song .
after previewing it and confirming it 's what you submitted , you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context .
so basically motion through 3D space .
you mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video ? "
and I just worked and worked through problems , until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves .
and in a weird way , that 's what I actually like about Johnny Cash 's music as well .
so this isn 't finished at all , but it 's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate .
and you can also see the way that it was drawn .
and you type in the address -- it actually creates a music video specifically for you , pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself .
this is a great technology .
as you can see , the virus stopped , and it stopped very , very fast .
they had come from thousands of miles away .
now we don 't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this , to eradicating diseases .
so those are the kind of stakes that we 're after .
last year , it was 1,000 .
we should abandon this idea of eradication .
Umar also has polio .
we 're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child .
now remember , northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio .
here 's a great idea to spread : end polio now .
and what 's it going to be like the next couple of years ?
we spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year .
for me , this became incredibly important .
and it 's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist , even if I have to operate in the West only for now .
but apparently , that was not an issue at the time .
and we see , truly , in some Muslim communities , that tradition .
there is no punishment for apostasy .
which means that Muslims can , today , look at those things and say , " Well , the core of our religion is here to stay with us .
that trend is generally called Islamic modernism , and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen , not just as an intellectual idea , though , but also as a political program .
but the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islamists much more strident .
they just should be allowed to work for that .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
so for this , we developed many different types of non @-@ visual user interface technology .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
he 's coming up to the grandstand , fellow Federationists .
the secret of happiness is : find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .
the idea of replicating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
I 've not time to go into more of it .
that 's all the time I have , so thank you very much for your attention .
this didn 't really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it 's just because I don 't play with particles very often .
so a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
so let 's think about the atoms .
what can we do with just one person 's data ?
( laughter ) Yeah , that 's a terrifying result .
in other words , it 's kind of random , kind of ad hoc , how we figure out what we should do .
Aristotle said , " We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows . "
but here 's the way it works .
suppose I go up and I say , " I 'm going to take your phone . "
it 's wrong to take his phone because he 's a person and he has rights and he has dignity , and we can 't just interfere with that .
what should we be doing ? what 's the answer ?
what 's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do , whether we should use that guy 's data or not ?
not only can we think , we must .
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur , and so we come to that part of " Jurassic Park . "
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast .
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America 's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
now I combine them with hi @-@ tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can 't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
so in December we met in Miami , in a hotel conference room .
that 's more than 250 hundred @-@ thousand acres .
so if you think about this practically , here 's where we are .
what kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each conceiving a baby , OK ?
so two couples each conceiving one baby .
now I don 't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception , because if you do , you 're not going to listen to me , so just imagine that for a moment .
but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone , the body doesn 't react to the testosterone .
you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body .
where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African runner , Caster Semenya , had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only , really , by a few nucleotides ?
one of the places we 're seeing it , for example , in our culture , in the United States today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
the Founding Fathers were , for my point of view , the original anatomical activists , and this is why .
they were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
we find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights Movement saying , " I am a man . "
Henry can marry , in every state , a woman , but Mary can only marry today in a few states , a woman .
it gets way better .
what does it have to do with the future of health ?
this is an example of this paradigm shift .
we 're moving to this integration of biomedicine , information technology , wireless and , I would say , mobile now -- this era of digital medicine .
we 're now in the era of virtual visits .
and in two years , a $ 100 genome .
and by looking at the patterns , for example , in our blood , of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test , we can look at patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage .
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized .
how about more targeted therapies for cancer ?
embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful .
we have adult stem cells throughout our body ; we use those in bone marrow transplantation .
still very early days , but I think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example .
there 's something else that is interesting .
Martin Short is one of my all @-@ time favorite actors .
that is the essence of seeing a person first .
what could we achieve for medical science ?
and they made it clear that we should understand that their prosperity was not our entitlement , and I think that 's good wisdom from isirika .
and so I grew up with isirika .
I 'm under the river with those fish .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
I 'm going to give bebko to baba .
so they 're restrictive -- don 't use your mobile phone , don 't use your laptop , don 't search the Internet , don 't be on I.M.
and you know what ?
it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better .
it 's pretty bleak .
or is it crap ? is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
just like there 's benefits for humans and animals , there 's benefits for play at work .
two , I 've tried it . I 've tried at Sciant .
I 'm going to let you make decisions . I 'm going to empower you , and I 'm going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
and we 're going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
let them be on the Internet .
let them take long lunches .
let them do it . give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . let them have fun at the workplace .
what we need is a players ' uprising .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
but the reality is far from it .
as an iceberg melts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
thank you .
you love the game .
the excitement from using multi @-@ tracking , the way I did in the piece you will hear next , comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers , all generated from a single source .
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway .
and I 'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists .
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives .
and to connect our country after World War II , we didn 't build more two @-@ lane highways , we built the interstate highway system .
we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue .
I 'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer , to my mind , than work .
or look at the foreign word and the sounds : can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it 's pointing you towards ?
the sketches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
four is blue .
and here is one of my paintings .
and this effect is very pleasant on the mind , and it helps the sentence to feel right .
64 becomes 6,400 .
four across , four up and down -- it 's 16 .
in my theory , language evolves in such a way that sounds match , correspond with , the subjective , with the personal , intuitive experience of the listener .
so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
you know , what I do is write for children , and I 'm probably America 's most widely read children 's author , in fact .
she did it in secret .
and there 's a book -- John Gartner .
some of them committed suicide .
Sergey Brin : I want to discuss a question I know that 's been pressing on many of your minds .
audience : it 's people logging on to Google around the world .
and every one of those rising dots represents probably about 20 , 30 searches , or something like that .
there 's a lot of activity in China .
there 's a lot of activity in India .
and even in Antarctica -- well , at least this time of year -- we from time to time will see a query rising up .
okay , not very many people know about it .
we also have a lot of engineers in those meetings , and they don 't always do their laundry as much as they should .
I just wanted to show quickly .
and so in our search results , we never accept payment for our search results .
well let me show you .
first , there 's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indus script does not represent a language at all .
if you look at a map of India today , you 'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo @-@ European language family .
and I 'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .
are you ready ?
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
Oh , it 's almost 50 / 50 . okay .
and the Indus script now has this particular property .
most of you said U , which is right .
so we could deliberately erase some symbols , and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols .
so , as the old saying goes , if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script , then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .
and when she came down those steps , and it was just her and me for that moment , I was so glad that she didn 't have to say to her mother , " I wish Dad could have been here . "
and the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line .
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30 @-@ day challenges , my self @-@ confidence grew .
it turns out , all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month .
now is my book the next great American novel ?
and it 's a wonderful thing .
and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half .
but hey , they grow back .
but if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
and that 's the sort of thing that it would be seeing .
finally , there 's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern .
and the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver .
because it 's the first thing we draw ; we surround ourselves with images of it ; it 's probably the most common image on the planet .
our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate .
the average teenager sends 3,300 texts every [ month ] .
we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift .
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke .
the first C is cognitive training .
here 's what my neuropsychologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it .
untestable -- that 's when I 'm in my coma .
I 'm not a doctor . I have no medical background whatsoever .
but they asked one question . they said , " Is this repeatable ? "
that was a fair question because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me .
second aspect : I still had crushing migraine headaches .
this affected my entire body .
and I 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed .
I believe that we can all rise and shine .
( applause ) You know , when I heard Simon 's -- please sit down ; I just want to talk to him for a second -- when I read his book , I went to LA to meet him .
I don 't know what I had in my mind .
I didn 't expect that person that I was going to meet to be him .
tell a little bit about what you 're wearing on your leg .
and if I do this , probably the mic won 't hear it .
and it works . it works .
and it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation .
it works .
I must tell you , they 're an amazing -- there 's a hundred people who work in that building -- engineers , scientists , and other team members -- all the time .
the audience is too small .
so he saw a need and he stepped in .
my reading ability improved , but these forced reading lessons didn 't exactly inspire a love of reading .
when she saw her reflection in the mirror , she started to cry .
if he doesn 't kill me , then , I think , I want to do it myself .
I was being sexually abused by my father and his friends .
it 's a 24 / 7 confidential helpline in the UK for anyone who might be feeling desperate or suicidal .
but I guess in a world which is dominated by professionalizing everything we do , I really understood that that simple act of listening could have such a life @-@ changing effect .
( audio ) Good morning , you 're through to the Silver Line .
each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world 's people and not the other way around .
I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim @-@ majority societies .
if I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders , they come to your mind immediately .
well statistically , the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated .
and what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground , in addition to international aid , in addition to education , in addition to health .
but Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person .
and he can 't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated , and he vents his frustrations .
and he had a name for it .
imagine you had one second per product category .
you could count them in five minutes .
what is evolution ?
now Unilever did this and it didn 't work -- too complicated .
it didn 't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
you just have to believe me , it is , it is .
and I was " other " before being anything else -- even before being a girl .
that nagging dread of self @-@ hood didn 't exist when I was dancing .
but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness , our essence .
in those moments , I 'm connected to everything -- the ground , the air , the sounds , the energy from the audience .
what do you do when you grow up ? "
you can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them .
it 's out of print -- still ...
but what if you could rate those movies before they get made ?
it 's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation , like the buttons .
it involves light cones and quantum entanglement , and I don 't really understand any of that .
now is this a new idea ?
thank you .
but you know , at a local level , you scale ; everybody in this room is scaled .
and here 's scaling of cities .
and you can see , they all follow the same line .
what is the reason for this ?
and it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions .
and the question is : can we , as socio @-@ economic beings , avoid a heart attack ?
Laundry piles up to the skies , he has a conversation on the phone for an hour with your mom about God knows what , takes the dog you wanted for a walk ...
and the best thing to do is to show up for class .
and let your presence be a gift .
this is Hermann Goering .
now nobody believed him .
I don 't doubt that that plays some role , but what I want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on .
what I mean by this is we don 't just respond to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them .
or take sex .
these are stimuli I 've used in some of my studies .
but how attractive you find them , how sexually or romantically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you 're looking at .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
and that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery .
this is Marla Olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
( laughter ) For a dollar 99 , you can listen to that silence , which is different than other forms of silence .
in the other condition , they 're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose -- knows they 're shocking them .
others worry about peace and security , stability in the world .
this message , this word , can come out that this is not an old @-@ fashioned way of doing business ; it 's a brilliant way of saving your child 's life .
and so today we focus on not just passing out food , but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment , and teaching them about breastfeeding .
and this is climate @-@ proof .
and usually the institutions -- churches , temples , other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net .
but what is most amazing is the effect on girls .
we now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways .
but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response , but can 't quite control it .
is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply ? it needs to be constantly contracting , so therefore it 's almost selfish . it 's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .
we spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening , but we 're not very good at it .
( laughter ) But it 's a great intention to have in a relationship .
now we 're already starting to see some experiments here .
and it 's this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has , because it 's so fundamental to our lives .
the way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular , radio waves .
and the answer is yes .
so I 've mentioned to you the four challenges .
capacity : we have 10,000 times more spectrum , 10,000 times more LEDs installed already in the infrastructure there .
that 's aside .
and then I 've mentioned the availability .
these are potential sources for high @-@ speed data transmission .
and then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world .
it 's just that , whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light , your language relies on pulses , discrete pulses , of sound .
in fact , the Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language .
how do we know this ?
because this is exactly what our ancestors , the Homo erectus , did .
you can follow it through the fossil record .
okay , so what this tells us is that , contrary to the old adage , " monkey see , monkey do , " the surprise really is that all of the other animals really CANNOT do that -- at least not very much .
once we have language , we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn 't have before we acquired it .
( laughter ) Now we have to counter that , though , against the evidence we 've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans .
the European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their 23 official languages .
and we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
what we 've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans .
but the more I talked about it , the more objectified and fragmented my body became .
and in the name of connectedness , the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico .
it really opened my eyes .
( recording ) Girl : the hardest part is like finding out where he 's at , or like , when his court date is .
EA : according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation , the number of young people with a father incarcerated rose 500 percent between 1980 and 2000 .
I really miss you .
EA : how does a young black person growing up in America today come to understand justice ?
dw : the group . we all agreed on it .
one check we do have on prosecutors is defense .
and I 'm really glad that he didn 't take his life .
and in the year 2008 , he partnered with me in the first @-@ of @-@ its @-@ kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer something called mindfulness training to active @-@ duty military personnel .
these electrodes pick up the ongoing brain electrical activity .
we call it the N170 component .
and what I mean by this is that when we direct attention to the face , it becomes clearer and more salient , it 's easier to see .
this is having off @-@ task thoughts while we 're engaged in an ongoing task of some sort .
they pressed the button every time they saw the face .
even though it 's quite plain to see that it was upside down .
but that 's all in the context of these very controlled laboratory settings .
and when this mind @-@ wandering happens , it can be problematic .
so we might ask why do we do this ?
think of just the last time you were trying to read a book , got to the bottom of the page with no idea what the words were saying .
because those are the moments in which their attention is most likely to be vulnerable , because of stress and mind @-@ wandering .
but if you do engage in mindfulness practice , the more you do , the more you benefit .
they were discerning .
and he himself has gone on to continue practicing mindfulness in a daily way .
he went from having a really bad boss -- an attention system that nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite leader and guide , and saved his life .
climate change is already a heavy topic , and it 's getting heavier because we 're understanding that we need to do more than we are .
urban retrofitting : creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there .
increasingly , we 're realizing that we don 't even need to densify an entire city .
and that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot .
now , the ship sank between Robben Island to the south , and Dassen Island to the north -- two of the penguins ' main breeding islands .
could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
there was no day of intercultural cooperation .
and I rang Sir Bob Ayling , who was CEO of BA at the time , and said , " Mate , we 've got this invitation .
and working with NGOs and building this case .
and that letter basically said , " We 'll observe this day .
and on the 21st of September this year , we 're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
and obviously the life @-@ saving is increased , the concepts help .
why don 't you support the process of the largest ever global truce ?
would you go to governments and lobby and use the system ? "
we have about , you know , 38,000 places that are not worth caring about in the United States today .
unless the people that live here are Munchkins , nobody 's going to be using that .
we 're going to have to live closer to each other .
the age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end .
we 're not going to be rescued by the hyper @-@ car ; we 're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels .
sometimes it 's hard to tell the two apart .
which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos , we are so wonderfully optimistic .
and that 's indeed the case .
the same is true if we look at a Chinese individual versus an African , the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often .
and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago .
so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with Neanderthals , but far back and then have a long independent history .
so this presumably means that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past , since we don 't think that the ancestors of Melanesians were ever in Siberia .
when I travel with my work across Europe and the United States , one question always comes up : where is the Palestinian Gandhi ?
about seven years ago , they faced extinction , because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village .
but I think the girls could do it .
Hamas Party Member : we were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine .
there is no need to use violence .
in fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .
so I 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self @-@ assembling future .
can we really scale this up ? can we really embed robotics into every part ?
but it goes a step further , and it tries to have actual computation .
it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
so what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do .
it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do .
each element is completely identical , and they 're biased .
without them , humanity CANNOT survive . "
and it was really her strength , I believe , that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life .
now I worked with dying people for over 40 years .
now let 's advance to 10,000 years before the present .
and I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity , at least in the next few hundred years .
and politically , it was awful .
Thomas Edison would have been very , very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today .
and so we have to understand that if we 're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life , we need to power it somehow .
evolution kicked in -- and that 's the cool bit .
this seems most likely .
so we have some kind of primordial soup .
and they had a look at what was in the soup , and they found amino acids , but nothing came out , there was no cell .
and so forgive the molecules on the screen , but these are a very simple kit .
and this movie here shows this competition between molecules .
Lee Cronin : so many people think that life took millions of years to kick in .
so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon , maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for .
but you know , I have a problem with children 's books : I think they 're full of propaganda .
I have another idea .
and if you were here last year , I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2 , which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring .
also , though we designed it a few years ago -- it 's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so -- this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives .
you pick them up , and once you see something that you 're interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
in contrast to if you went inside the dome , where it 's kind of wild and crazy and everybody 's learning all kinds of things , or fooling around , or whatever they 're doing .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session , and from all the different presenters .
( laughter ) Telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
let 's think about the future : the dragon vis @-@ a @-@ vis the elephant .
in some communities , you might not find a public health center , a post office or even a school , but you 'll find a church or mosque .
many of our faith @-@ based organizations have tremendous amounts of wealth that can be utilized for social change .
an Africa that demonstrates that God loves Africans and that we are just as capable as any other world region in solving our problems in peace ...
and unfortunately , for mortals like you and me , we probably can 't understand it very well .
now , so far I 've mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group .
but what about the real cybercriminals ?
and then finally , Cagatay EVYAPAN , aka Cha0 -- one of the most remarkable hackers ever , from Ankara in Turkey .
remember that , when they developed those hacking skills , their moral compass had not yet developed .
now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron @-@ Cohen who 's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge .
they are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities -- are mobilizing them on behalf of the state .
they 're just relentless and obsessive about what they do .
we want to work with you . "
my name is Kate Hartman .
so I 'm specifically interested in how we , as humans , relate to ourselves , each other and the world around us .
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
and much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .
everybody 's got one -- all of you .
and so when working as an interaction designer , or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on , in or around the human form -- it 's really a powerful space to work within .
this one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat .
( laughter ) It 's fairly self @-@ explanatory .
what kind of an experience do they have ?
and so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves .
so they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst .
( laughter ) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .
and so when I was first living in New York City a few years back , I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them .
so I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack .
do I carve a message in the snow ?
or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool , like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice .
but really the most satisfying experience I 've had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship .
this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier .
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit .
and once again , it 's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
these are initial musings for this project .
and just as with the wall , how I wanted to be more wall @-@ like , with this project , I 'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace .
women have two copies of that big X chromosome ; men have the X and , of course , that small copy of the Y.
sorry boys , but it 's just a tiny little thing that makes you different .
how many are there in the human genome ? three billion .
is that a big number ?
and perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it .
that was all done on a machine like this .
it costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it .
then we bring that into software and reassemble it , and tell you what the story is .
so unfortunately , this doesn 't help this woman , but it does have severe -- profound , if you will -- implications to her family .
and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra 5 , 10 , 20 years , just because of this one thing .
do you think that 's not going to happen ?
anybody ? nobody .
they all hated each other , and all moved to different parts of the planet .
imagine one more thing , that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent : " would you be willing to meet your third cousin ? "
thank you .
so most everyone watches TV .
they call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
we love to watch TV .
this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
so to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
we went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
we surveyed the top @-@ 20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows .
five , the consumer society .
you can play a game and try and think of one I 've missed at , or try and boil it down to just four , but you 'll lose .
you need people to want to wear tons of clothes .
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year @-@ olds .
at the top of the international league table according to the latest PISA study , is the Shanghai district of China .
Winston Churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938 .
since time immemorial , there have been authors .
( laughter ) Now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
what you 're seeing is year by year frequency of " thrived " and " throve " over time .
ELA : if you were not yet convinced , sea levels are rising , so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature .
pretty much for the vast majority of history , no one gave a damn about 1950 .
and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
in fact , it 's as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
[ the ] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania , which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia .
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .
( laughter ) Additionally , I 've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them , of course , for doodling in classrooms .
but this was just the beginning .
and the national police even supported our work during the Ebola response .
over the course of the outbreak , West Africa had almost 29,000 cases .
we counted survival rate as a success : the end of suffering for the patient and fulfilling joy for families .
for these survivors , life can be compared to another health emergency .
however , many continue to bear intermittent pain .
simply the ID that denies you health care .
( laughter ) And then I imagined them looking at a specific picture of me with a beautiful young woman , and asking , " Who on earth is that with Dad ? "
people are living far longer now , and for the first time in human history , it 's common for four generations to be living side by side .
a few months ago , a 40 year @-@ old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live , and she was brought in confused .
she was resuscitated , stabilized , whisked over to a CAT scan suite right next to the emergency room , because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung .
and the real tragedy was , if you look through her records , she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years .
you might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh , and his character , Sherlock Holmes , was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell .
and Conan Doyle , writing about Bell , described the following exchange between Bell and his students .
she says , " I did . "
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh , except in the botanical gardens .
and so when Auenbrugger became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
and Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called " the cylinder . "
and that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .
this is a very famous painting : " the Doctor " by Luke Fildes .
I 've often wondered , what would Fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era , in the year 2011 ?
when are they going to come by and explain things to me ?
and the one critical piece missing is that of the patient .
it had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there .
but to her , it mattered deeply .
I say that because these are difficult patients .
and so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit , and I tried not to interrupt them .
the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this , but here 's what you should do , here 's what we should do . "
I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story .
we marry , for example , with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .
and out of that sense of failure , I remember , I would always examine the patient .
I would feel the abdomen .
and then the next day , I would come , and I would do it again .
and employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren 't actually ready for real work , didn 't have the right attitudes and experience .
it 's not perfect yet , but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands , possibly millions , of teenagers who are really bored by schooling .
a democracy could be upheld peacefully .
the belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep , proving that the African is capable of governing himself .
that 's what happens in academic journals , it 's what happens at academic conferences -- the Q & amp ; A session after a postdoc presents data is often a bloodbath .
but we 're also unimpressed by authority because it 's so easy to contrive .
that should ring alarm bells : if you know the answer to your trial , you shouldn 't be doing one .
the kids got the pills , and their performance improved .
if there is publication bias , if small negative trials have gone missing in action , you can see it on one of these graphs .
it 's perfect .
this is just the same thing on a screen .
something happened in the 70s that is sometimes referred to as " the software crisis , " where suddenly , computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for , from a design perspective .
what mattered was that it was there at all .
they would look and say , " Oh , the progress bar is half done .
if you do it wrong , it sounds like : tick @-@ TAT , tick @-@ TAT , tick @-@ TAT .
the rope became a big thing when women 's clothes became more fitted and the pantaloon came into being .
governesses used it to train their wards to jump rope .
those ropes created a space where we were able to contribute to something that was far greater than the neighborhood .
it 's where they get to shine .
so , a jump rope , you can use it for all different kinds of things .
and I think sometimes the simplest objects can make the most creative uses .
the button and the buttonhole is such a great invention .
it 's one of the most enduring designs in history .
there 's either a dome button with a little shank , or there 's just this sort of round thing with either a rim or not a rim , either two holes or four holes .
and the way you figure that out is : the diameter of the button plus the width of the button , plus a little bit of ease .
as we move across a stairway , the form dictates our pacing , our feeling , our safety and our relationship and engagement with the space around us .
when I was 10 years old , there was a girl in my class at school named Vicky .
she would hit herself and give herself bloody noses and she had hygiene problems -- she had big hygiene problems .
when I was 10 years old , I treated another human being like some worthless other ...
like I was better than her , and she was garbage .
what kind of a nice person does that ?
so , what if I wasn 't nice after all ?
the first step is starting to recognize the hate inside ourselves .
and then second : if we want to challenge the hate in our societies , we need to promote policies and institutions and practices that connect us as communities .
but anyway , a year after I began my journey , I wrote Vicky an apology .
the producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
it 's very complicated to explain .
and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they 're sick .
in urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
they find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside , but they don 't have the sense of belonging .
so for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
and also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
and this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
a father posted his son 's picture onto the Internet .
so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it 's about the environment .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
and I said , " What is that ? "
who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane ?
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types .
and this type of activity goes on for quite a while , until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs .
so why despair when the unexpected knocks on the horizon ?
we have conducted ourselves in ways that seem as if Africa is damned and doomed .
and that all these experiences in history have irreversibly , irreparably foreclosed the chances and possibility for Africa to emerge , thrive and flourish .
so you 'd think , with all this extra space , we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff .
so I 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
we need to think before we buy .
we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
my office folds away , easily hidden .
but it wasn 't until I got older and I learned more about the National Park System that I realized just how lucky I was .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) But -- ( Applause ) Here we are , a few years later .
and I 've seen glimpses of this future , and I know that it 's possible .
but we need to take it a step further .
and , actually , I think we can dust off Stephen Mather 's playbook .
my parents are visiting here from Minnesota , and they don 't really even care about this talk , all they 're talking about is going to Muir Woods .
everybody had a job .
we can do this ourselves .
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi @-@ step separation process begins .
I didn 't believe my father , not because he was a liar , but I 'd never heard this story , and my mother in fact validated that .
and so I and many others were finally able to go to high school , a regular high school , and take regular classes .
my medical exam was something completely different .
if it is , I can do that .
( applause ) And then the same day , I got a call from an attorney who was writing a book about civil rights .
we signed it in 2009 , but it doesn 't come into force until ratification , and the president -- no president can ratify a treaty without the consent of the Senate .
and as long as many countries don 't have the same laws as we do and don 't enforce them if they have them , opportunities for disabled people are more limited .
and frequently these cases are not adjudicated .
people talked to me differently . they acted differently towards me . "
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
so what 's it like to be a baby ?
so they were concerned that the stories weren 't quite as accurate as police were claiming them to be .
that goes for journalists themselves , people like me .
there was no official investigation into his death .
I got an email from an investment fund manager in New York .
Ian Tomlinson was walking through this area , attempting to get home from work .
and I realized : this is really something quite significant .
he realized we had an intention to tell a different version of events ; we were skeptical .
what I saw was the three men trying to pull him down below the seats .
and we could interrogate what they were saying and ensure it was consistent with what other passengers were saying , too .
and it was a physiological response .
now you probably know the answer to this already .
and the first was , I 'd ask other people : " do you like it ? " " yes . "
it 's the last thing she did , the last physical act .
that 's not the expression of joy .
it isn 't just about nice .
so that 's okay , isn 't it ?
it 's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that , that comes out of the tool correctly , that goes down the line without falling over .
so is that wrong ?
and he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
he had his head mic like I 've got .
I watch that TV show ' Lie To Me . ' I know you 're lying . "
on a given day , studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language .
ask a deceptive person to tell their story , they 're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places .
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
since 1986 , it hasn 't leaked .
so long as the sun shines , we 'll have no problem with power .
she actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
barefoot technology : this was 1986 -- no engineer , no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs .
every five years we have an election .
( laughter ) Men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate .
tell a woman .
she handled the national press , and she was a star .
that 's what I say in my mind . and I just say " thank you , " and I go on to the next one .
this way , when you have an interaction with a chatbot on your phone or a voice @-@ based system in the car , it sounds a little more human and less cold and disjointed .
and I created a piece that explores computer @-@ based intuition in a physical space .
sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves ; it 'll tell us who we are .
we have this mountain of data , which is anatomy , physiology and behavior .
there 's a little wimpy box on top there .
I 've got this experience , I 'm in the world .
it can run and hide . it has fears and emotions . it can eat you .
now in evolution , what happened ?
you still have that alligator brain . you do . it 's your emotional brain .
that 's because you 're making a prediction .
not like computer memory -- not at all like computer memory .
it 's a memory of very high @-@ dimensional patterns , like the things that come from your eyes .
are we going to really build intelligent machines ?
so you 're not going to see C @-@ 3PO .
I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor .
moreover , the Americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .
today we 're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated , as we have seen at Copenhagen .
and these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace .
the cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes .
about 15 years ago , when I learned of our new @-@ found ability to create quantum effects that don 't exist in nature , I was excited .
there 's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger .
arm amputation is usually caused by trauma , with things like industrial accidents , motor vehicle collisions or , very poignantly , war .
every time you contract a muscle , it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis .
we built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago where we 've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors , or six degrees of freedom .
you touch yourself , there 's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain .
he has not learned how to do this with the chest .
so we 're all motivated to get motor commands to drive robotic arms .
and we 're fortunate today to have Amanda Kitts come and join us .
( laughter ) And here you can see , on Jesse 's chest , when he just tried to do three different things , you can see three different patterns .
so Amanda , when you first started using this arm , how long did it take to use it ?
so if it stopped working , I just had to take it off .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , " What hand grasp pattern do I want ? "
TK : that 's Claudia , and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .
so it 'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made .
I 'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side , with yesterday 's theme .
there was a computer spook , a broken wire , a converter that sparked .
and then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
but it 's also used to assign a temperature range .
you place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musical score .
you all know the truth of what I 'm going to say .
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .
on that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies .
we collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder .
they 're all weighted equally .
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .
this is mental illness .
this is violence .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
what about causality ?
we 've got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top .
he 's an engineer .
it 's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
and he makes this complicated thing .
so what happens during the Second World War ?
well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945 ?
we live in a time where there are all kinds of really , really smart people running around , saying that they 've invented gadgets that will forever change our world .
is it because their weapons weren 't accurate ?
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?
horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer .
this got us very excited .
we 've completed , now , clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
we have this molecule , but it 's not a pill yet .
and so I want to thank you for your participation , your collaboration and most of all , for your confidence in our ideas .
( laughter ) So I made series of images , cuttings , and I assembled them in portfolios .
so this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives .
so scrolls are very convenient , because you can create a large image on a very small table .
" ReefCity . "
and in papercutting , you have the drawing as the structure itself .
so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
I made an artist book that 's in stainless steel instead of paper .
and Bronx literature , it 's all about Bronx writers and their stories .
and for other projects , like in Paris , it 's about the name of the street .
and I wanted to give them an escape .
it is a papercutting , and then after , I added color on the computer .
it had no windows , no plumbing , no electricity and it was filled with trash .
and I wasn 't able to see it myself until I lived there .
and after university , I wanted to do something -- probably na√Øvely -- to help .
during the year I worked on my house before moving in , I lived in a microcommunity inside Poletown , founded by a wild and virtuous farmer named Paul Weertz .
it 's realizing we have the power to create the world anew together and to do it ourselves when our governments refuse .
there 's a third way to rebuild , and it declines to make the same mistakes of the past .
while building my house , I found something I didn 't know I was looking for -- what a lot of millennials and people who are moving back to cities are looking for .
or clergy and teachers engaging in civil disobedience to block water shutoff trucks .
it means trusting those who know the problems best -- the people who live them -- with solutions .
or any date for that fact , it 's like , " I don 't exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . "
and I don 't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did .
I would tell them , " Hey guys , this is where I 'm going . this is my flight .
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now .
he : almost none .
he : well it goes to the last point that I was at .
then I had to measure morality .
so if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , I might help alleviate poverty .
but I 'm also a skeptic .
that 's not what we found .
and whenever we raise oxytocin , people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers .
I just found the molecule behind it .
" Hey , a guy just found it . "
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
so if you trust them , their brains don 't release oxytocin .
and we have testosterone .
and I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
and it 's so easy to cause people 's brains to release oxytocin .
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day .
( laughter ) Thank you .
and lots of generations , lots of tweaking and torquing , and we turn our puffer into the Mola .
so the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that 's streaming off , that 's right where we put the tag .
and it hasn 't been published , so it 's totally privy information just for TED .
and in showing you this , you know , when we 're looking at this data , we 're thinking , oh do these animals , do they cross the equator ?
and to me that -- I don 't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself : " one touch of nature makes the whole world kin . "
and sure , it may be just one big old silly fish , but it 's helping .
if it 's helping to unite the world , I think it 's definitely the fish of the future .
we have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car .
you 're not powering the propeller , you 're powering the wheels .
when we do have to do something truly out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ box , we use an incremental design , build , test , redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps .
there are thousands of local airstrips that don 't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could .
the Transition gives you a safer , more convenient and more fun way of using this resource .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you .
and in neuroscience , we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain .
and that is , why do we and other animals have brains ?
but apart from that , everything else goes through contractions of muscles .
so it 's really important to remember that sensory , memory and cognitive processes are all important , but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements .
now of course there are other moves , but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution .
we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that 's what we 'd like to know .
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be .
so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is , for example , sensory feedback is extremely noisy .
forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in darts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
so I have sensory input , which I can take in to make beliefs .
now both these sources of information carry important information .
so it 's the optimal way of combining information .
and what this part really says is I have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs .
and so they take it in turns to apply the force they 've just experienced back and forward .
so it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : quick question for you , Dan .
ca : well that was quite fascinating . thank you very much indeed .
so magic is a very introverted field .
( music ) Please .
( music ) You heard her , go ahead .
there isn 't much doubt , is there ?
and above all , it is a right , it is everyone 's right .
next , use short sentences , because grandma , like anyone of us , if you make very long sentences , she gets to the end and she can 't remember what you said in the beginning , anymore .
alright ? it 's easy !
and write in order to be understood . write to your grandma .
this structure , then , can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself , so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself , and that 's shown in green here on this micrograph .
I 'm going to add some resource from the left , here , that defuses into the system , and you can see , they really like that .
we call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
on the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who 's actually in the space .
so I 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it 's much faster .
let 's fast @-@ forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later , where I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3D laser scanning system .
all of this happens in seconds .
well , I 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so , while I 've been speaking , you have been scanned .
humans have long held a fascination for the human brain .
there 's a container underneath that 's collecting that tissue .
we 've done right now two human brains @-@ worth of data .
we 've put all of that together into one thing , and I 'll show you what that synthesis looks like .
we 're just starting to look at this data ourselves .
so I 'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go .
I want you to understand , each one of these is a hypothesis ; it is subject to revision .
now , you may not have focused on this , but index search accounted for 90 % of all search volume about 4 years ago .
and the simplest way to look at it is to look at a Google results page : the only logo on that page is Google 's ; everything else is in the same font .
the third hypothesis I have is no longer controversial , but it 's important to understand what happened .
we started doing things called " Twittercasts , " the first live concerts and then prerecorded concerts , distributed over Twitter .
you know , every Saturday and Sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games .
it 's just acceptable that play is a good thing .
already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time : the Africa of HIV / AIDS , the Africa of malaria , the Africa of poverty , the Africa of conflict , and the Africa of disasters .
I 'm working on an initiative now , along with the World Bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries ' moneys -- to get that sent back .
( laughter ) The smartest one , first to come in , was the MTN company of South Africa .
a new wave of openness and democratization in which , since 2000 , more than two @-@ thirds of African countries have had multi @-@ party democratic elections .
yr : yeah . I have no checklist for that .
( laughter ) But that would actually get you oriented pretty fast , right ?
when we sat people facing south , they organized time from left to right .
this is a little trick that you 're taught to use as kids .
do German speakers think of the sun as somehow more female @-@ like , and the moon somehow more male @-@ like ?
so , people who speak different languages will pay attention to different things , depending on what their language usually requires them to do .
language can also have really deep effects -- that 's what we saw with the case of number .
I 've told you about how speakers of different languages think differently , but of course , that 's not about how people elsewhere think .
they thought you just wear out , there 's nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
so part of it is like a baseball glove .
I just told you that , if you make a mutation in the daf @-@ 2 gene cell , that you get a receptor that doesn 't work as well ; the animal lives longer .
so maybe it 's working in people the same way .
so the next question , of course , is : is there any effect on age @-@ related disease ?
so in a daf @-@ 2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor .
you see one gene . there are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO .
and the way that Generation G is different from X , Y , and all the different generations that we may belong to , is that video games are the primary form of entertainment that Generation G is consuming .
part of the reason gamification has become such an emergent topic right now is because of Generation G 's effect on culture and society already .
another really interesting example is a thing called " speed camera lottery , " designed by Kevin Richardson , based in San Francisco , works for MTV .
of course , it 's also true , and I 'm here to tell you : the kids are alright .
but it 's going to take your help to make the kids awesome .
I have a prescription for you .
it made for a heck of a profile picture on Facebook for a week .
so we already are doing solar engineering .
but it 's so little , it would be like putting a handful of chalk into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain .
and I do worry about that .
so I am an optimist about our future selves , but I 'm not an optimist because I think our problems are small .
( laughter ) I didn 't know what to say . Kleiner 's second law is , " There is a time when panic is the appropriate response . "
consumers don 't really like these light bulbs .
so , if all goes well , they 're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels .
but I 'm really afraid we need much , much more .
it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country .
it wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth .
but they will do global economic damage , because they don 't have to hit , necessarily , to do this kind of damage .
the smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years .
it 's right here .
this is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago .
we have to find these things first .
( laughter ) But we 'd be rich !
but we 've figured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this .
this probe actually can 't use chemical rockets .
how can you change the conversation for extremely oppressed and forgotten people ?
education shapes our children . it shapes the way we teach .
somehow , we live in this world where , in 2017 , the US Constitution is held up as the supreme law of the land , right ?
we are medicine men , we are medicine women , we are sun dancers , we are pipe carriers , we are traditional language speakers .
what used to be 50 Cent in my room then , to a 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy 's room now is Sauti Sol .
Afrobeats has played the strongest role so far , if you ask me , as far as emancipating the youth is concerned .
in 2015 , President Obama came to Kenya , and we had the pleasure of being the entertainment for the state dinner that happened at state house , Nairobi .
with almost no force I can control his position and his velocity .
so I started shooting time @-@ lapse photography .
so , I have a gift I want to share with you today , a project I 'm working on called " Happiness Revealed . "
it 's not just another day .
now at the time that I was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment .
so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software .
but I think that Eleen expresses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration .
at the age of 19 , the day after I graduated high school , I moved to a place where it snowed and I became a massage therapist .
he 's about my age , and he 's in San Quentin State Prison .
and that 's felony murder -- 25 to life , parole at 50 if you 're lucky , and Tony 's not feeling very lucky .
what is that idea ?
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
we 're incredibly used to not having to face life 's hard realities , in a certain sense .
I mean , even the stupid " reply all " regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .
and that 's just regret about tattoos .
and I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device .
but one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
but Cambodia is not alone .
but it is in so many countries .
in Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn 't a 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy , it was an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
and then he said , " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . "
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
we have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
or maybe you 've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork .
( applause ) ( Applause ends ) You know , I never thought that I 'd end up working at Microsoft .
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
( laughter ) It 's like the six degrees of separation , but with research .
so for whatever reason , this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception .
( music ) ( Limited Frequency Music ) I had patients tell me that those sound the same .
because his grave was exhumed .
the brains remain hardwired for music .
now I want to show you one last video .
and here 's a video of Joseph .
and at about four months old , I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss .
there are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere .
you don 't actually have to hear it .
you wouldn 't want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
and I don 't think that we should give up on beauty .
I believe that journalism is a public good .
they 're under pressure to communicate their science outside of the academy .
so they 're collaborating with reporters , because for many researchers , it 's difficult for them to write a simple story or a clear story .
and it was a discussion with Revi that brought us to the edge of the researcher and reporter , that fuzzy boundary .
but we don 't see nor portray developing communities the same way .
it could be Somalia today .
it 's a terrific story .
this also is not a research picture .
Revi and I analyzed some of the mandates that researchers are under .
but social scientists understand that people 's time is valuable so they pay them for that time .
research environments and reporting trips and NGO projects are very intimate environments ; you make good friends while you 're doing good work .
do we have women as victims , and are men only the perpetrators ?
should they share in the profit ?
this is a for @-@ profit game .
but we can also sharpen our insights .
nobody notices .
a mother finishes setting the table for dinner .
the astronaut is asleep .
when I was little , I could not understand the concept that you could only live one life .
I was sure that I was going to actually experience what it felt like to be a leader of the civil rights movement or a ten @-@ year old boy living on a farm during the dust bowl or an emperor of the Tang dynasty in China .
I usually just got cut off .
good afternoon , I 'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow .
there is also one big thing about humor , it really hurts .
( laughter ) And then I started thinking , of course , we can 't just get rid of captchas , because the security of the web depends on them .
but since it doesn 't know the answer , it CANNOT grade it .
here 's how it works .
( laughter ) they contain Snoop Dogg .
so this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
and the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
by the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
there 's a lot of things to say about this question .
right now , the web is partitioned into multiple languages .
the problem with that is it 's not yet good enough and it probably won 't be for the next 15 to 20 years .
unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is even at the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
if this is what you want to do , you quickly realize you 're going to run into two big hurdles , two big obstacles .
spiders use silk for many purposes , including the trailing safety dragline , wrapping eggs for reproduction , protective retreats and catching prey .
for example , this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks .
the frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks : the filament and the sticky droplet .
to answer that , you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
there 's also aciniform silk , which is used to wrap prey .
minor ampullate silk is used in web construction .
you can see that the repeat units differ in length . they also differ in sequence .
here are stress @-@ strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider .
that 's what the spider has to interact with their environment .
these are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins .
yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
it frees us from the constraints of our imagination .
you 'll be seeing one of the most high @-@ performance materials known to man .
it is made out of silicon .
this is a setup I put in a physics lab .
and I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing .
but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain , noninvasively , with focused ultrasound in the ' 50s .
and there was something fundamental that they were missing .
so this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
it 's a target in the thalamus .
pain is something that can make your life miserable .
and doing that in the U.S.
well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen -- quite lethal , very lethal actually -- pancreas , liver , kidney .
this is a big fibroid .
she was offered a hysterectomy , but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .
it is really a sacred space .
everyone 's listening . we 're responding .
( music ) So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
so it 's unpredictable . we 'll paint this palette again .
it got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
so , my normal working field is called two @-@ photon polymerization .
what was my motivation ?
when I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water .
and like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him : you 're not sure .
when I came out of college , I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California , and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that .
I 've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra , who doesn 't think architecture is art .
( laughter ) FG : anyway , the Siza thing .
by saying all that , it means your work is good somehow .
( laughter ) RSW : frank had a sort of ...
( laughter ) But my point is that ... and I call it the " then what ? "
and I think that 's the issue , you know ; it 's the " then what " that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren 't hiring architects for that .
and I 've met with some of these people .
but let me just say a couple words .
( laughter ) I 'm going to make it for you !
with all of us knowing everything , we 're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something , to become enlightened .
and of course , we all will be deeply disappointed when we do .
and it 's inside and outside , self and other , and other is all very different .
and so you wouldn 't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it 's you versus the universe -- that 's all Buddha discovered .
it 's totally strange .
basically , she would collect string .
now , a landfill is basically something which is not going to go away , and it 's increasing .
these are actually bricks that are made from old demolition waste , which includes the glass , the rubble , the concrete .
can we use that , the ability to understand that all the materials available in that building are still usable ?
one day , I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River .
these are opium @-@ addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
I saw one day , the largest school in Afghanistan , a girls ' school .
but art can change the way we see the world .
( voices overlapping ) So , my wish ... My wish ... I wish ...
the easy way is just -- I 'm papering black @-@ and @-@ white images on walls .
now I realize that the community wanted to do art projects even more than I wanted .
Luana : we 're just a tool for people that want to send a positive message .
( music ) ( Camera clicking ) Touch the screen , take your picture , type in information .
( music ) Luana : it 's the people 's art project .
you CANNOT know when and how , but it 's worth trying .
so how do we stop this ?
man : this is paracetamol .
their ability to do that is strengthened when they 're enabled with modern technology .
thank you .
you of course want to record maybe how thick something is , which you can 't measure from space , whether that 's soil or snow .
she 's able to give back and really contribute in a meaningful way .
it was late fall , and we were getting ready for next spring .
I picked it up and he said , " Let me see that . "
ultimately , this technology is helping us to rewrite our history .
DJ : we need to know our history .
[ become a GlobalXplorer GlobalXplorer.org ]
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
so we go back and we do that again , and again .
the eventual goal is that we 'll get this into patients .
however , we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one @-@ time use .
you have a voice through the arts that doesn 't judge what you 've been through .
thank you .
old Man River , Big Muddy .
now , dead zone is a quite ominous word if you 're a fish or a crab .
" you know , I 'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey .
I strongly believe we can translate the science , bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment .
we all want a clean environment .
a picture that you 're familiar with -- the Amazon rainforests .
that 's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally .
someone once asked me , " Who is better or worse , is it Unilever or is it P & amp ; G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia ? "
thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
imagine your internet access went off for a day , and when it came back , it only stayed on for three hours at a time , with random 15 @-@ hour outages ?
they 're hard to just get automatically .
we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas , and we can replace it with all @-@ natural fresh fruit .
HC : so the key thing to remember here is , we don 't really care what this tuna really is .
as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment , it doesn 't matter .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture -- and that was the main issue with this challenge .
and my lung collapsed , so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well , to stop that catastrophic event from happening .
I was blind , I couldn 't speak and I couldn 't walk .
she is sleeping in the corner of this apartment . "
( laughter ) I very quickly realized I had to keep my teaching and my cartooning separate .
I 'd just take a sharpie , draw one panel after the other , figuring out what I wanted to say as I went .
it was like I was giving them a remote control over the information .
in 1944 , the " Journal of Educational Sociology " even devoted an entire issue to this topic .
( laughter ) He was wrong .
Dr. Wertham does a pretty dubious job of proving his case , but his book does inspire the Senate of the United States to hold a series of hearings to see if in fact comic books caused juvenile delinquency .
as of 2007 , we went from being a primarily rural planet to being a primarily urban one , and that has implications for how we 're going to feed these people , how we 're going to get the food to the people in the cities .
it takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy in our highly industrialized food system in order to produce one calorie of food energy .
we 'll also need to grow more food with less water .
in the Global South , we 're seeing desertification , whereas in the north , we 're seeing suburban sprawl .
that might sound like a lot , because we 're probably at about two percent at the most right now .
why not green food ?
( laughter ) So I 'm going to take you to task , guys .
so here 's the new history of gastronomy .
but of course it 's not the real thing , it 's either diluted or it 's completely inert .
and , sure -- pharmaceutical companies have moral obligations , just like we do .
and it 's also due , sometimes , to the fact that doctors and patients are falsely influenced by advertising campaigns of pharmaceutical companies .
they have a choice .
except that they 're not as rich as ours , because they don 't have a cerebral cortex like we do .
in other words , we 're not literally replacing the components of the retina .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
it 's very flat , kind of rigid .
you say , " Well , of course I can 't write today , because I 'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews , and then I 'm going to a cocktail party and then I 'll be drunk after that .
once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one .
other conditions show people the future self .
and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
now help me not to be a beggar anymore . "
scraps of men do not exist .
people like Mahmoud are agents of change .
and when you start changing , you CANNOT stop .
that 's Najmuddin , the one with the white coat .
terrible Najmuddin , is that one .
well don 't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over ; not at all . we are going on .
is it really necessary ? "
well now you should see me .
and this was an amazing year .
I 've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject .
I thought , " Oh my gosh . I 'm going to become a Crotchety old lady . "
what was I supposed to accomplish in this final act ?
and you 're able to go back and forgive them .
these live in a global space which is largely unregulated , not subject to the rule of law , and in which people may act free of constraint .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions .
in fact , what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
it 's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy .
I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough .
and here 's the third factor , which is totally different .
we are now interlocked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before .
it 's its capacity to lock together its institutions .
it is no longer the case .
for us , I think , part of the equation for our survival .
( laughter ) And if you did this for all thousand TED Talks , you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000 .
so I would end up paying hundreds of dollars .
some of you might actually right now be thinking , it 's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words .
and unfortunately , when I first received the answers -- and here , you 'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed .
but the thing about this filter is that it always leaves the same things in .
when asked to describe their lives , what is interesting is how few people said " mess . "
51 % wanted to turn his or her life into a story .
so again , we should be suspicious of stories .
you view your life like this instead of the mess that it is or it ought to be .
just imagine yourself pressing a button every time you tell the good versus evil story , and by pressing that button , you 're lowering your IQ by ten points or more .
you 'll hear this in so many contexts .
but to think that by buying the book gets you somewhere , that 's maybe the bigger fallacy .
they 're the ones who go out and make the worst mistakes .
so if you 're too attached to stories , what will happen is people selling products come along , and they will bundle their product with a story .
but , say , the alternative story is : " you don 't actually need a car as nice as your income would indicate .
I 'm really not sure , and I 'm not here to tell you to burn your DVD player and throw out your Tolstoy .
even though their disease may have been cured , the resulting nerve damage will have left many of them without a sense of touch in their hands .
well , we focus on needs and people and context .
but then one night , my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner , and I noticed that the edges of the chicken , which had been marinated in lemon juice , turned white .
most of the others either never responded back , said they didn 't have the time or didn 't have the equipment and couldn 't help me .
I 've also entered in her age , her gender and her height .
so I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
the red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
they need political solutions .
you CANNOT talk to everybody all the time .
and what is dialogue really about ?
it 's crucial to understand , I believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom @-@ up .
medical appointments would be scheduled during business hours , and I knew that I would need time off to recover from surgical procedures .
chemo brain presents itself through memory loss , an inability to concentrate and an inability to solve problems .
I was lucky that while he may not have even known about this concept of reasonable adjustments , to him , it was just common sense .
I knew that from the time I left the cancer care unit , I had about four hours before this fog screen would come down and I would start to be sick .
so what should be a manager 's first response when somebody says that they 're sick and they don 't know how it 's going to impact their work ?
they draw pictures of what they 're observing with their eyes , through technology like telescopes and microscopes , and also what they 're thinking about in their minds .
it 's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can 't go into right now .
but in each one of your cells , each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .
it 's involved with the growing of the microtubules , and it 's able to transiently couple onto them .
people in the community need to be able to get from one place to another as quickly as possible .
but this is the kind of community I was thinking of -- a lunar community It had all of the same needs as a community on Earth would have , but it had some very unique constraints .
and solar power had a real problem : the Moon orbits the Earth once a month .
some water @-@ cooled reactors run at over 70 atmospheres of pressure , and others have to run at as much as 150 atmospheres of pressure .
the reactors we have today use uranium oxide as a fuel .
it 's a ceramic material similar in performance to the ceramics we use to make coffee cups or cookware or the bricks we use to line fireplaces .
but then I learned about thorium , and the story got even better .
do we have enough thorium ?
and thorium is not a rare substance , either .
there are many sites like this one in Idaho , where an area the size of a football field would produce enough thorium each year to power the entire world .
after every criminal and societal sanction that we can come up with , people still use drugs , and far too many die .
many people who were reliant on a steady supply of prescription drugs turned to heroin .
lots of people using drugs , high crime rates and an overdose epidemic .
overdoses are uncommon .
this year even more people will get caught up in the illegal drug trade .
logical , but not necessarily true .
why is this ?
where is the infrastructure that creates a space for them so that they can collaborate with other great musicians ?
it 's like we need some melodic Viagra in our culture , ladies and gentlemen .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
these people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued -- they 've argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game .
I think there is an alternative .
in there , we 'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John .
why ? they don 't think we need it .
I 'm an independent , individual person . "
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
" give us the new , " we 're always saying .
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
what is a calendar ?
and the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
they don 't just deliver us sermons on this .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul @-@ like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
they 're poets , they 're philosophers , they 're photographers , they 're filmmakers .
and they don 't really change much .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
they 're selling us shoes and cars .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
and that 's what religions do .
that 's something we can learn from .
if you 're in the art world , look at the example of what religions are doing with art .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
there 's so much we can absorb .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
we 're losing them .
if I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
so he designed a different kind of sonar ping , one that looks random .
John Costas is the inventor of these patterns .
so what do these patterns look like again ?
it 's generated by repeatedly multiplying by the number three : 1 , 3 , 9 , 27 , 81 , 243 ...
let 's think about one of the most beautiful pieces ever written , Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony and the famous " da na na na ! " motif .
( laughter ) So without further ado , Michael Linville , the [ Dean ] of Chamber Music at the New World Symphony , will perform the world premiere of the perfect ping .
we have a bunch of engineers , but none of them could please this client .
yes , our workforce needs specialized skill , but that skill requires a far less rigorous and formalized education than it did in the past .
they teach us how to think critically .
green . the product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means .
the first metric is : is it sustainable ?
ninety @-@ seven percent of the world 's water is saltwater .
one is a closed photobioreactor that you see here , and what you see on the other side is our species - we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus .
now the problems with closed photobioreactors are : they are quite expensive , they are automated , and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale .
we actually have a solution for that .
there is a drawback to algae , however : it 's very expensive .
and the answer is : yes .
what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world , where there 's barren desert .
if you are a farmer , you need five things to be successful : you need seeds , you need soil , you need water and you need sun , and the last thing that you need is fertilizer .
most people use chemical fertilizers . but guess what ?
freshwater Mollies : cheap , they love to make babies , and they love to go to the bathroom .
well , we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab .
here 's the plant species . Salicornia virginica .
next , when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay - soybean fields gone - we came up with an idea : can you have a plant that has a land reclamation positive in Delaware ? and the answer is yes .
how about this : in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , next to the sea , saltwater , barren desert , how about we take that plant , plant it , half use for food , half use for fuel .
we can make that happen , inexpensively .
I say , " I 'm okay with that , ' cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers , which is significant . "
so , in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food , fuel and water .
because , you might ask , how do we find the real you , how do you know what the real you is ?
and that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves , something that 's the same throughout life .
you are the individuals you are , and you have this kind of core .
which is there isn 't actually a " you " at the heart of all these experiences .
we do things because of other things .
and so really , there are all these things , like beliefs , desires , sensations , experiences , they 're all related to each other , and that just is you .
we understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch , you put them together , and you create a watch .
but interestingly , it 's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience .
but it 's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together . "
there are lots of different processes in the brain , all of which operate , in a way , quite independently .
you might think that if it 's true , that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self , no permanent essence , does that mean that really , the self is an illusion ?
but I don 't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it .
the watch isn 't an illusion , because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts .
let 's take something like a waterfall .
these are the Iguazu Falls , in Argentina .
for one thing , it 's always changing .
of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance .
if you watch the X @-@ Factor too much , you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be .
I 've heard some fantastic musicians this morning , and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them .
the true self , as it were then , is not something that is just there for you to discover , you don 't sort of look into your soul and find your true self , What you are partly doing , at least , is actually creating your true self .
and it seems to me that we have actually two kinds of capitalism .
you can buy a machine today for about $ 300 that you can create yourself , which is quite incredible .
and I couldn 't wait to trip the mind fantastic .
is this an envelope we 're living inside of , or no , does it go onto infinity in both time and space ?
and when I jumped into that water , I yelled in my mother 's French , " Courage ! "
I knew there were Portuguese men o ' war , all kinds of moon jellies , all kinds of things , but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters .
I don 't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
and he is crying and he 's yelling to my trainer who 's trying to help me .
and at 41 hours , this body couldn 't make it .
we 've got Benadryl on board . if I get stung , I 'll just grin and bear it .
you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this . "
so now what do I do ?
he had a potentially life @-@ threatening condition called epiglottitis .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems , or more exactly , the confusions , of consciousness .
this fascination led me to submerge myself in art , study neuroscience , and later , to become a psychotherapist .
I mean , it 's self @-@ awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind .
so my question to you is , can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape ?
this is actually a brainwave sensor that 's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk .
we created the responsive room where the lights , music and blinds adjusted to your state .
imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight .
so these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover .
because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women .
in South Korea and Indonesia , women own nearly half a million firms .
and that 's just to start .
now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .
thank you very much .
and then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too - click !
and two days later , this package shows up on your doorstep .
so let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem .
I was out in the Bay area in ' 99 , 2000 , the dot com boom .
I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame @-@ out called Webvan .
and it really came down to the fact that we couldn 't do it cost effectively .
and that 's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home .
so long story short , during my one year at Webvan , what I realized by talking to all the material @-@ handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking .
so we said , there 's just got to be a better way to do this .
so how did I arrive at this notion ?
well , actually it came from a brainstorming exercise , probably a technique that many of you use , It 's this notion of testing your ideas .
take a blank sheet , of course , but then test your ideas at the limits - infinity , zero .
and say , labor is cheap , land is cheap .
diet Coke walks up to the front - pick it , put it in the tote , away it goes . "
( laughter ) So we said mobile shelving - We 'll put them on mobile shelving .
and so we got underway on that and then I 'm sitting on my couch in 2008 .
others work through the instrument of money .
the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world .
in other words , a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control .
war is simply no longer the best option , and that is why violence has decreased .
to understand how Tumor Treating Fields work , we first need to understand what are electric fields .
we 're , of course , all stuck in the Earth 's gravitational field right now .
10 years ago , Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
so these are patients who had received surgery , high dose radiation to the head and first @-@ line chemotherapy , and that had failed and their tumors had grown back .
we divided the patients into two groups .
and then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy .
so I 'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial .
he won the gold medal in Moscow in the 4,000 meter pursuit .
he received the standard treatments .
it 's still there .
she was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago .
she underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years , none of which had an effect .
thank you .
and on one side of the bunk bed , I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry .
so I did the only thing my frantic seven year @-@ old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
the first thing I want to do is start with a graph .
and we know that 's a measurement error because it 's messing up my data .
but normal is merely average .
even in a classroom full of people smarter than you , I felt you 'd be happy just to be in that classroom .
Thursday night is illicit drug use .
and into the silence , I said , " I 'd be happy to speak at your school , but that 's not a wellness week , that 's a sickness week .
the absence of disease is not health .
and I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success , which is this : if I work harder , I 'll be more successful .
and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons .
we 've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive .
in just a two @-@ minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually rewire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully .
she was able to anesthetize her quickly , and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation .
my colleague , Dr. Paul Fenton , was living this reality .
essentially , to deliver anesthesia , you want as pure oxygen as possible , because eventually you 're going to dilute it , essentially , with the gas .
I shudder to say simple ; it 's straightforward .
it 's also designed for the environment that it will be used in .
it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts .
this machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier .
so we 're thrilled .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
so I 've talked a lot about anesthesia , and I tend to do that .
who gets safe surgery and who doesn 't ?
if you could bring up the lights higher , because I 'm just going to use a piece of paper here .
and there 's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self @-@ feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
what 's that new state that the world is heading toward ?
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
so now we 've speeded up the time scales once again .
and I think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
and I say , " Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
and now let 's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
and let 's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . "
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .
so I 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
but they do the job .
and in fact , I know , I 'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
( laughter ) I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , " Oh look . look at this .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don 't quite understand the options of it .
so , foolishly or otherwise , I decided to build my own home .
no other major assembly in our lives is constructed like this .
your car doesn 't come to you in pieces with an extra 10 percent just in case , to be assembled at the mercy of the elements .
in fact , truly sustainable housing should be available to everyone and affordable for all .
but something was still bugging me , something was still keeping me up at night .
wrap your head around that number .
we could usher in an entirely new empowered experience of special needs or aged @-@ care accommodation .
now , in the span of less than an hour , I was understood both as a " sir " and as a " ma 'am . "
more specifically , I identify as genderqueer .
trust me , the discomfort can range from minor annoyance to feeling physically unsafe .
like the time at a bar in college when a bouncer physically removed me by the back of the neck and threw me out of a woman 's restroom .
but for me , authenticity doesn 't mean " comfortable . "
but for me , the possibility is what this child , who will grow to be a teenager and then a real @-@ life adult , will call me for the rest of our lives , was both extremely scary and exciting .
and I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called " mama " or something like it didn 't feel like me at all .
and no matter how many times or versions of " mom " I tried , it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable .
so I tried other words .
it felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked but you needed to wear and break in .
now one of the most common things that happens when people meet us is for people to " mom " me .
( laughter ) So , option one is to ignore the assumption and allow folks to continue to refer to me as " mom , " which is not awkward for the other party , but is typically really awkward for us .
and move on .
or say things like , " How can she be a father ?
only men can be dads . "
and I 'll say that over time , my ability to navigate this complicated map has gotten easier .
so I weigh the costs against the risks and sometimes the safety of my family comes before my own authenticity .
but despite this risk , I know as Elliot gets older and grows into her consciousness and language skills , if I don 't correct people , she will .
the technician saw a vulva and slapped the words " It 's a girl " on the screen and gave us a copy and sent us on our way .
but this situation , this aversion to a bag full of pink stuff , forced me to explore my rejection of highly feminized things in my child 's world .
so , rather than toning down or eliminating femininity in our lives , we make a concerted effort to celebrate it .
I had to choose option two .
I had to engage with some of my most uncomfortable parts to move towards my most authentic self .
I 've always struggled with the parts of my body that can be defined as more feminine -- my chest , my hips , my voice .
so I talk about it more , I explore the depths of this discomfort and find language that I feel comfortable with .
I 'm working against limiting myself .
I want her to see my journey towards authenticity even when it means showing her the messier parts .
and about a year later , Sarah switched shifts and we started working with a new nurse -- we 'll call her Becky .
Sarah 's warm and bubbly and said hi to Elliot and me and my wife and when talking to Elliot said something like , " Is your daddy holding your toy ? "
and as the conversation shifted to our pediatrician , I saw Sarah and Becky 's interaction continue , and it went something like this .
it would have been easier for Sarah .
and this is the poster .
and every tick mark here is when he made them clap .
and this is the shape of the " I Have a Dream " speech .
if you can think of a better system , keep your hands down .
we need to use it as a means , not as an end .
they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding , for example .
in fact , he was probably six inches taller than me , and she was about this tall .
we are changing our culture from within , but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions .
and yes , Qatar wants to be a modern nation .
it 's important for us to grow organically .
and for us young people , they 're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves .
which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global .
in a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the burger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others ?
I 'm not sure of how many of you in Washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and , the more recent , Museum of Islamic Art opened in Qatar in 2008 .
no , I don 't think so .
we 're here , we 're part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them .
art becomes a very important part of our national identity .
she lives in New York City , but she doesn 't try to be a Western artist .
our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
we will open the museum in a few days , and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways and come and join us .
and I think with time , in the years to come we 'll be learning a lot about our Picassos , our Legers and our Cezannes .
we do have artists , but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet .
it 's important for two things .
teaming is teamwork on the fly .
but increasingly for a lot of the work we do today , we don 't have that option .
of course , in teaming , the stakes aren 't always life and death .
and I would argue that it 's especially needed for work that 's complex and unpredictable and for solving big problems .
so we 're reaching out to team across big teaming , grand @-@ scale teaming .
OK . five years into the project , not a whole lot had happened .
( laughter ) All right .
well that 's not true , but we 'll get to the goose in a minute .
so if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur , a big one , then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one , and a better one .
so it 's real easy to tell them apart .
in North America in the northern plains of the United States and the southern plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan , there 's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth .
and we want to look at these three first .
but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related .
you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities .
it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out .
it 's inflating very fast .
the spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing , which means they 're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger .
and Torosaurus , when we cut into it , has mature bone .
and everybody says , " A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can 't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one . "
I mean , here 's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan .
here 's another one .
the bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile , or at least a subadult , and the other one is an adult , and we have an ontogeny .
and we get rid of Anatotitan .
and the last one is T. Rex .
so we cut into them .
( laughter ) Thank you very much .
we know this because trying to find a place to live is an example of an optimal stopping problem .
they 're in the explore phase of their lives , and some of those things could turn out to be delicious .
at the other end of the spectrum , the old guy who always goes to the same restaurant and always eats the same thing isn 't boring -- he 's optimal .
they 've tried things like choosing something at random or applying what 's called the " first @-@ in , first @-@ out principle , " which means removing the item which has been in the memory for the longest .
and each time he accessed a document , he 'd take it out , consult it and put it back in on the left @-@ hand side .
when computers face hard problems , they deal with them by making them into simpler problems -- by making use of randomness , by removing constraints or by allowing approximations .
because , of course , it 's not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
and I see the same process with combining photographs .
but combined , they can create something like this .
also , I have various family members , such as my grandfather and great uncle , who fought in World War II .
the bell had rung , and I was seated at my desk , when one of my students , who is deaf , approached me and said that he 'd like to join the military .
now , the second thing that happened , my friend had just moved to Israel .
ROTC , which stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps , allows students working on their college majors to concurrently participate in the ROTC program .
I figured I better stand in the second line , so I could watch what the cadets were doing in the row ahead of me .
but once they learned more about me and what I 'm capable of doing , there 's been tremendous support and unity .
plus , he doesn 't view me as a deaf person .
he 's a really sharp soldier .
he 's a veteran , having served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
he just kind of held the lollipop out like this . "
it is our light and not our darkness that frightens us . "
and not only do these genetic males mate with other males , they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they 're genetic males .
for those of you who don 't know , we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
and I have to take a little bit of artistic license .
we are in effect polluting our children .
and perhaps it 's the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it 's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area .
it 's also the most primitive - all other mouthparts are thought to have started out looking like this one before evolving into something different .
they stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism .
( laughter ) These are couples who can find good in any situation .
( laughter ) I 'm serious .
Bettie Davis , Joan Crawford , Halle Berry , Hilary Swank , Sandra Bullock , Reese Witherspoon -- all of them single , soon after taking home that statue .
and it 's not just successfully starring in films that 's dangerous .
we produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
and for the good of your relationships , I would encourage you to do the same .
and from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity , some perspective on it , I realized this seems a little bit dangerous .
it short @-@ circuits the brain , and we 're starting to find it has actual cognitive consequences , one of them being this sort of pervasive background hum of anxiety .
nonsense : anything a six @-@ year @-@ old with a smartphone can do is not going to be what the market rewards .
some of you might disagree , some of you might have scathing but accurate critiques of me and my points , and of course , I welcome all negative feedback .
and like anyone , my views on many things have changed , and hopefully matured , like my potential career choice .
and sometimes I had to be brave , and it wasn 't always easy .
back fat , I see you popping over my bra today , but that 's alright .
and that 's OK .
so basically what I 'm saying is that the majority of this room right now is considered plus size .
and it starts with becoming your own role model .
for girls who struggle to look inside the mirror and say , I love you .
it 's a very simple thing . it 's got one knob , on / off .
( music ) ( Heart @-@ beat ) We 've all got navigation controls in our car .
we perfectly know where all the ATMs are , just about the city of Maastricht .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
MHM ?
they might weigh up to two tons .
they 've been around a long time , very important to coastal communities .
and then they 'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour , boil them up , use the oil .
it 's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks .
one , it 's to try and work out the gender of the shark .
nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened .
we thought basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in our latitudes , but in actual fact , they 're obviously crossing the equator as well .
so it does seem to be that basking sharks , for some reason , have incredibly low diversity .
so Les did a finer study , and he found out it came out about 9,000 .
the problem with this is they were constrained with samples .
and some are caught in nets , in trawls .
so when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat , I thought , " If you take what you 're given in this world ... "
and he was like , " Yeah , yeah . later . "
so as a field biologist , you just want to get encounters with these animals , and learn as much as you can .
Government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster @-@ hardened veterans that Haiti was something different .
out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA -- the Trilogy Emergency Response Application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender @-@ based violence .
we have just published an evaluation of this program , and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable .
and 73 percent of them shared it .
right across the developing world , citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change , positive change , in their own communities .
they are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
the U.N. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the Developing World , compared to 20 percent today .
a transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models .
they 're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strategists .
we need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question , " What would Amazon or Google do with all of this data ? "
there are no more reasons not to do it .
unfortunately , when I was there , I couldn 't find one of them , but you have the antlers as proof .
now you 've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
and the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before .
so these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines .
in spite of that , people have to live , have to eat this food in order to survive .
the incredibly high price of flying food into these remote Northern aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival .
this is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
you turn it on , light goes everywhere .
now , like I said , I 'm a big fan of technology .
but the actual process of planet @-@ hunting involves a lot of looking at graphs , like the one I 'm showing you here , and annotating them .
you 'll see that all the people who contributed are listed below , and it 's sort of an odd amalgam of people 's real names and their log @-@ in names .
there are 60,000 people who participate in these projects , and most of them don 't have technical backgrounds .
however , it 's missing something .
the experience of looking up and knowing that the sky you 're looking at surrounds every known living thing in the universe is very profound .
they were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple .
and the Book of Chronicles , the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms .
the empire of Iran , the Medes and the Persians , united under Cyrus , became the first great world empire .
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand , calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon .
and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk .
40 years on and we 're in 1917 , and the cylinder enters a different world .
Cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the Shah .
it 's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months .
in the world of the Middle East at the moment , the debates are , as you know , shrill .
and also because that 's where , in terms of our own self @-@ interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
and just like that , you 've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .
these poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra 's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book .
I would bet many more of you insure your iPhone -- you 're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty .
and what I 'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow .
what does it have to do with time and savings , this issue of immediate gratification ?
one percent check the box . the rest do nothing .
we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .
if you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates , we think we 're going to eat bananas next week .
save More Tomorrow makes it easy .
mid @-@ sized company in the Midwest , blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they CANNOT save more right away .
this is a real difference .
it 's been part of the Pension Protection Act .
this is really the tip of the iceberg .
if you 're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again .
he died broken by history .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
she opened a computer store , then studied to be a beautician and opened another business .
centers were established .
but so many over the years were helped .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
but if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would .
Bobby 's own death , so similar to John 's , seems somehow fitting .
this picture was taken when Steve , on the left , was eight years old .
it was not this year .
one that I 'll highlight here is changing the patient 's name .
I 'm going to show you a few different targets like this , and that 's my talk . so we 'll look at automobiles .
think about it . when a car receives a radio signal , it 's processed by software .
they actually carried out their attack in real life .
well , you compromise the car by a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software , something like that .
they videotaped people on a bus , and then they post @-@ processed the video .
the accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone .
it 's the Supreme Court , right ?
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
thank you .
in addition to that , it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth , and much of it we don 't know about .
and so 10 years ago , an international program began called the Census of Marine Life , which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans .
it involved 17 different projects around the world .
it 's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida .
and to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool , because knowing how many fish are there is really critical .
and so from this we 're able to identify these blue highways , these hot spots in the ocean , that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation .
now one of the other things that you may think about is that , when you go to the supermarket and you buy things , they 're scanned .
the Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data .
what I 've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand .
well , I could stand here for hours , but , of course , I 'm not allowed to do that .
and that 's why biodiversity data can be so valuable .
one of the things that we 're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
we 've got about 75 percent of the fish , maybe as much as 90 percent .
the other point I 'd like to make about this is that this ocean 's interconnected .
so whether you 're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile , whether you 're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you 're a TEDster living in Edinburgh , the oceans matter .
and as the oceans go so shall we .
that would be a rigorous , powerful scientific inquiry into the effects of these environmental exposures .
what are the health impacts of mountaintop @-@ removal mining ?
we used the dust in laboratory experiments and found that it induced cardiovascular dysfunction in rats .
one governor has publicly declared that he refuses to read the research .
in this twilight zone , much of the data seems to point to one conclusion .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Midwest for example ?
the eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths to sustain this economy .
we need to accept the fear and then we need to act .
the Earth can support that if we choose the right path .
announcer Two : famine in Somalia . announcer Three : police pepper spray .
Oh , my God .
so let 's look at what this last century has been to see where we 're going .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
you see , scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource @-@ liberating force .
let me give you an example .
he 's the dude on the left .
it 's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
now we talk about water wars .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
because we live on a water planet .
I 'll tell you a little bit more about this .
and that four @-@ dimensional space consists of X , Y , Z , and then the yaw angle .
as you can see in this figure @-@ eight flight , they come within inches of each other .
now I think at this point it 's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts .
this is no surprise , though , if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always favored the man of action over the " man " of contemplation .
and instead of working alongside people they 've known all their lives , now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers .
and sure enough , the self @-@ help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like " How to Win Friends and Influence People . "
and they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part .
all right , let 's get ready for the worst TED Talk ever .
and we began making food that people could recognize , not things that come from a faraway place in plastic bags that you open and you CANNOT even smell .
simple : by calling and paying and getting .
I went to FEMA . they kicked me out with eight armored guards and AK @-@ 47s .
and we began going to the deeper areas , places that all of a sudden , the bridges were broken , but we had to go , because it was easy to stay in San Juan .
we brought the first water purification system to the island of Vieques , where we could be filtering one gallon per minute .
we began trying to be sending the message : we need to start moving away from the places that are already stabilized and keep concentrating in the areas that really need help .
( laughter ) DT : the public loves you .
Jos√© Andr√©s : this is great . this is how good my talk was .
( laughter ) NM : so tell us why , what were some of the challenges , and then when you noticed , they started coming to you to ask you .
salvation Army came and asked me for 420 meals on a Wednesday rainy night for a local elderly shop .
I love to help the Salvation Army , but in my world , they are the ones who are supposed to be helping us to answer those calls of help .
Thursday morning is when I wake up super worried that actually we didn 't have the plan to feed the island .
that 's where we began cooking .
so we went to a town called Morovis .
we dropped the sandwiches .
we arrived with the 120 chickens , we dropped the food , and the community were very thankful , but they told us , " We 're OK , we don 't need more food .
what we did was a flatter organizational chart where everybody was owning the situation and we all made quick decisions to solve the problems on the spot .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
and sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it doesn 't have when it doesn 't .
she was born in the 1880 's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
when I would see her as a little boy , she 'd come up to me and she 'd give me these hugs .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , " I want you to know I 've been watching you . "
well I adored my mom , so I said , " Yes , Mama . I 'll do that . "
I had some , your sister had some . have some beer . "
I said , " No , I don 't feel right about that . y 'all go ahead . y 'all go ahead . "
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
and I go to the jail and I see my client who 's 13 and 14 , and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult .
and I finally decided , oh gosh , I 've got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
for example , here in California we 're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don 't result in arrest .
56 percent of all rape cases don 't result .
and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
we all want affirmations that our lives have meaning .
it 's already halfway over , but something 's caught you and you 're drawn in and you care .
that 's your job as a storyteller , is to hide the fact that you 're making them work for their meal .
and the idea is that the character has an inner motor , a dominant , unconscious goal that they 're striving for , an itch that they can 't scratch .
Hey , off the bed !
and that 's what it really is , is that we all live life conditionally .
cyclist : who are you ?
it can 't be artificially evoked .
and he explained that when I was born , I was born premature , that I came out much too early , and I wasn 't fully baked ; I was very , very sick .
use what you know . draw from it .
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus .
this imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
a warmer ocean releases CO2 , just as a warm Coca @-@ Cola does .
what sea level rise can we look forward to ?
the last time CO2 was 390 ppm , today 's value , sea level was higher by at least 15 meters , 50 feet .
in recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
Jake is a super @-@ positive , enthusiastic boy .
so it 's got cute little game dynamics on it .
they haven 't given up on government .
this is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
( laughter ) Solar technology is ...
WG : first , the heart gap .
to be fair , race did pop up a few times in school , growing up .
and Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks .
as a result , we didn 't really care .
we can 't ignore the stats , either .
PV : that might seem like a weird reaction , but only if we don 't recognize how it 's emblematic of something larger , something deeper .
that according to a Columbia study on cis straight relationships black is often equated with masculinity and Asian with femininity , leading more men to not value black women and to fetishize Asian women .
and that is who you are . "
thank you .
this first project is a holiday card I made for my friends .
my goal in this was to get people to notice this going @-@ through @-@ the @-@ motions holiday thing that I 'm sure we 've all felt before .
and I did that through a holiday card , of course .
( laughter ) This card is literally a four @-@ frame documentary about receiving the card .
( laughter ) So it 's a recursive experience .
this next project I want to show you is a wedding invitation , which is a format practically begging for reinvention .
far more awesome , in fact , than the format of wedding invitations .
I remember seeing this as a kid , and it totally blew my mind .
so I began spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about needles : like , would we find needles with the right fidelity ?
( laughter ) So we did it , we really did it !
and then it segues into the real song for comparison .
( music and singing ) ( Music ends ) We were so excited when we finally got that to work .
we have assumptions about material experience , like that paper should be silent or that websites should be flat .
imagine your normal , everyday commuter @-@ newspaper @-@ reading ritual .
this is something we actually did do in the fall of 2008 , in a project that was conceptualized by artist Steve Lambert , organized by The Yes Men and executed by many , many people , some of whom are me .
years before Occupy Wall Street , we put in a maximum wage law -- ( Laughter ) to end the ginormous wage inequities between the lowest and highest income earners .
( laughter ) While the real " New York Times " has this slogan of , " All the News that 's Fit to Print , " we offered a more forward @-@ thinking message of , " All the News We Hope to Print . "
and Daniel Dunnam , my other half , and I formed the believability team .
more nefarious are companies like De Beers , who are making amends for their sale of blood diamonds by donating prosthetics to war @-@ torn African countries .
if you haven 't taken a ride on the New York City subway , you may not know Dr. Z.
( laughter ) So the news of our fake paper made it onto the real news all around the world .
we pushed our paper beyond its expected role in reporting the news , and we made a blueprint for a better world .
and you can see more of my work at : I 'll snore naked dot com .
they can heal and they can kill ...
someone in power says , " Those over there ...
when I lost my front tooth , my brother looked at me and said , " Oh , it has happened to you , too ?
I had a childhood that I would wish for anyone .
I had no idea which direction was home .
my past receded , grew jumbled , distorted .
this still happens to me standing right here .
you see , the chaos of the violence continues inside in the words we use and the stories we create every single day .
who are we in our breath ?
I know some of you have already decided you want a good career .
you 're afraid if you look for your passion and don 't find it , you 'll feel like you 're an idiot , so then you make excuses about why you 're not going to look for your passion .
you know what ? here 's a little secret : you want to work ? you want to work really , really , really hard ?
the world will give you the opportunity to work really , really , really , really hard .
I want to be a great friend .
says your kid , " I have decided I want to be a magician .
you have a battery in your phone , or iPod , right ?
but why don 't we see any evidence of it ?
on Earth , we 've seen how dramatically technology can accelerate in just 100 years .
they 're being wheeled out onto deck .
you go into the water and once you hit the water , it 's amazing .
they 're absolutely some of the coolest creatures on Earth .
the vitamin A that we ingest is converted by a family of enzymes to something called retinoic acid .
in the last several years , two groups have introduced home sperm @-@ testing devices that are iPhone @-@ based and that are easy to use .
when Richard Feynman was a young boy in Queens , he went for a walk with his dad and his wagon and a ball .
he said , " What 's inertia ? " and his dad said , " Ah .
so he understood that the sun was directly above the city of Swenet , because looking down a well , it was a straight line all the way down the well , right past the guy 's head up to the sun .
he knew that a stick stuck in the ground in Alexandria at the same time and the same day , at noon , the sun 's zenith , on the solstice , the sun cast a shadow that showed that it was 7.2 degrees off @-@ axis .
but for most of human history , we had to discover these things using our eyes and our ears and our minds .
Armand Fizeau was an experimental physicist in Paris .
it 's actually hitting a tooth .
what happens when you look at what the discoverers were thinking about when they made their discoveries , is you understand that they are not so different from us .
let 's see , I 'd say about three or four percent .
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference .
okay , that 's the majority .
and when that happens , the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings .
now it 's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor .
he collected all kinds of case studies .
he quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences .
and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .
and they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction .
of course , human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives .
we 're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are .
nonetheless , when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement , they can move mountains .
those things came along too recently .
this is why politics is so tribal .
we broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed .
nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom .
come , have a seat in my home entertainment center .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
we think about the user interface .
but what we 've found is they like the fluidity of the 3 @-@ D model .
we hope that we can make computing a user model you 're familiar with , and really derive insights from you , from all different directions .
this is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops , as well as wheat , tobacco , rice , sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum .
now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene .
( laughter ) It 's true .
because what little hoodlum wouldn 't want a million and a half bucks @-@ worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
( applause ) Or about 75,000 jobs .
vulnerability is not weakness .
and so many of the calls went like this , " Dr. Brown , we loved your TED talk .
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
" what do you do ? " " I study shame . " " Oh . "
and I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability .
and we 're going to walk in .
and I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn 't mess it up here .
( applause ) You know why this place is amazing ?
I know your dad really wasn 't in Luxembourg , he was in Sing Sing .
I know those things that happened to you growing up .
for women , the best example I can give you is Enjoli , the commercial .
" I can put the wash on the line , pack the lunches , hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine .
and he said , " That 's convenient . "
( laughter ) But he really listens -- because that 's all we need -- I 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work .
very quickly , some research by Mahalik at Boston College .
and there is a certain very quiet value in that , we like to believe .
you don 't look at him and say , " He 's an amputee with a prosthetic . "
you say , " He 's a guy with something really cool going on .
he 's kind of a classic , timeless @-@ type personality , so we did Herringbone tweed , but in polished nickel .
we will be evaluating products on how well they address a unique person , instead of a demographic model .
this all really hit home for us in one of the first legs we did ; when Chad here put on the leg , reached down and felt it and thought about it for a while .
he was literally standing on a floating plexiglass deck over his adoring fans , who had no choice but to praise to Yeezus up above .
and that 's what I 'm going to talk to you today about .
how can how can I , as a designer , or anybody as a designer or any architect or how can society -- in what way can design impact on that , in what way can it affect that ?
but as we all know , that process grew also on a kind of macro scale as well .
these are all typologies that are emblematic of the type of development that has taken place in modern cities , in Port of Spain and cities all over the world .
now , there 's nothing wrong with shopping malls , there 's nothing wrong with highways , and there 's nothing wrong with high @-@ rise buildings or suburban development .
it 's like the economic system in the world today -- it 's really not a sustainable system , and we have to find ways of addressing it .
in Trinidad , there are a number of examples .
it could become a really very important civic space .
do we have a corner on the market ?
they just move back to the Mid @-@ East and those come back .
yes , it 's going to continue .
now I had people in Washington last week told me , he said , " The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel .
so where are we headed from here ?
so there 's nothing going on that impresses me in Washington on that plan , other than I 'm trying to focus on that eight million 18 @-@ wheelers .
this stuff is everywhere .
but no , I 'm not . I own stocks .
you can 't -- okay .
your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we 'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?
that is , it 's going to be a small part , because you can 't rely on it .
how in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ?
and anything American will work for me .
ca : Boone , I really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation .
more and more women , two , three , four times more women , dying of heart disease than men .
and she wanted to study the Talmud .
Hollywood heart attack . Ughhhh .
where do women get fat ?
the second reason we really liked MRI is that there 's no radiation .
that 's all stem cells .
these are female and male stem cells .
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
we are bending the curve .
women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns .
and it 's political .
so my name is Taylor Wilson .
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has .
and this is me with President Obama , showing him my Homeland Security research .
he says that , " If at first you don 't succeed , hide all evidence you ever tried . "
but other days I am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table .
and I thought , surely , we do better than that .
and when they expressed wishes , all of those wishes came true , as it were .
thank you .
because of that , we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries , which is wrong .
and let me repeat what you saw last year .
( laughter ) But they were down here . they had 1,000 dollars per person per year .
and they lost one @-@ fifth of their kids before their first birthday .
this is Sweden , 1830 , when my great @-@ great @-@ grandma was born .
we can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am I choosing here ?
the Minister of the Environment of India said , " Well , you were the one who caused the problem . "
this we can call Dollar Street .
and the interesting thing , when you go around here in the photo panorama , you see the family still sitting on the floor there .
it comes beyond here , when you really can get good working conditions in the family .
my own research has not been in IT or anything like this .
and these two young farmers , they are girls now -- because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS -- they discuss with a trained agronomist .
that 's one context .
it 's also good with credit .
micro @-@ credits gave her the bicycle , you know .
I 'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
if you are fighting in a non @-@ governmental organization , you love equity between gender .
health is also important , but not that much as a mean .
and it was build by , not the guy on the left , but the guy on the right .
it may seem weird , but this comes back from HyperCard .
mark Hansen is a professor of statistics at UCLA . he 's also a media artist .
it 's a conversation amongst rabbis about this article in the New York Times , about the fact that religious workers don 't get a lot of time off .
( laughter ) But we would have never found this if it weren 't for this exploratory tool .
and my own story with September 11 has really become a more intricate one , because I spent a great deal of time working on a piece of the 9 / 11 Memorial in Manhattan .
how does this affect our lives ?
they carry weight .
when you read stock prices , think about them in a human context .
the electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago .
( applause ) Now let 's get started .
( laughter ) Until Volta , nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use .
this is the starting point for designing a battery -- two electrodes , in this case metals of different composition , and an electrolyte , in this case salt dissolved in water .
admittedly , I 've left out a few details .
so let 's abandon the paradigm of let 's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we 'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product .
in fact , I looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity , but instead consumes electricity , huge amounts of it .
and just a few short years following their discovery , aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material .
it 's about 50 feet wide and recedes about half a mile -- row after row of cells that , inside , resemble Volta 's battery , with three important differences .
so today at LMBC , we 're building cells 16 inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt @-@ hour -- 1,000 times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell .
and then we 've got a four kilowatt @-@ hour cell on the horizon .
temperature : conventional wisdom says set it low , at or near room temperature , and then install a control system to keep it there .
today , we don 't talk about flying transonically , or even supersonically , we talk about flying hypersonically -- not Mach 2 or Mach 3 , Mach 20 .
and when he hit send , he probably didn 't realize what a difference it would make .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : Regina , thank you .
ca : what do you picture that glider being used for ?
RD : sure .
I think you couldn 't be human if you didn 't ask those questions .
when I asked , " Who is that ? "
in Liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
today , we 've worked with over 300 .
one young woman I met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college .
Lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
I personally don 't accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so I decided to change that .
let me show you how they work .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don 't learn at schools .
( laughter ) But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
and keep your eyes on the big screen .
to enjoy being deceived , an audience must first suspend its disbelief .
the kerosene and charcoal value chains already figured this out : those fuels are ubiquitous across the entire country .
( laughter ) So ...
and so in 2006 , I founded a new political party .
and the European elections , the last European elections , we became the largest party and the most coveted youth demographic , sub @-@ 30 .
and what 's interesting is we did that on less than one percent of the competition 's budget .
and I 'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that .
and they can be applied to any business or social cause .
but applying these -- and we 've done this dozens of times , we know that this works .
a swarm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen of their own will to converge on a common goal .
( laughter ) I mean , seriously , what kind of idiot thinks they can change the world by starting a political party ?
my announcement was just two lines in a chat channel .
and , last but not least , it needs to be epic .
shoot for the moon !
when you can list the resources , you know what you need to get there .
we work for autonomy , mastery and purpose .
and this is where working swarmwise comes in , this is where swarm intelligence comes in .
those three factors are : speed , trust and scalability .
it was not abused once .
single @-@ celled life that transforms sunlight and carbon dioxide into edible gold .
some of these snare their prey with sticky tentacles , while others just take a bite out of their cousins .
I 'm a woman who loves getting texts who 's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem .
it says you 're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
this is not like that . I 'm much more like Scotty .
but when you do , you don 't get what you expect .
( laughter ) Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called [ " Dry " ] , and it 's about his time in rehab .
so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught , they do not have a cadaver dissection lab .
but this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics , especially in this part of the world .
now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest .
and there 's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival .
how do we feed the world without destroying it ?
we transformed our apartments into our laboratories , and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way .
yeah , sucka , put the scholarships in the bag , yeah , yeah .
Oh , you thought I was playing .
there is no other way .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement @-@ free blog in the world .
right . you know what I 'm saying .
and he said , " Frank , I 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . "
secrets can take many forms .
I was born in Den Bosch , where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after .
and I 've always been very fond of this painter who lived and worked in the 15th century .
this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee .
so I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
this is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center , where they trained chimpanzees to cooperate .
it 's already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn 't be able to do that .
( laughter ) This was the cooperation and reciprocity part .
in humans , of course , we can study that with yawn contagion .
and we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head .
so that 's what you see on the upper @-@ left , an animated head that yawns .
and that 's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy , and that is universal in the mammals , basically .
and consolation behavior -- ( Laughter ) it 's empathy driven .
one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them -- then the choices go down .
( laughter ) It 's as if they 're saying , " If you 're not behaving , I 'm not going to be pro @-@ social today . "
so what we did is we put two Capuchin monkeys side @-@ by @-@ side .
the one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber .
the one on the right is the one who gets grapes .
and so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the French Revolution .
this year , if you think about it , over a billion couples will have sex with one another .
here in Germany , the proportion of people that use contraception is about 66 percent .
Thailand , 64 percent .
they get it in their arm -- and they go about four times a year , they have to get it every three months -- to get their injection .
it 's stocked out 150 days out of the year .
and when our eldest daughter was born , we weren 't , I would say , exactly sure how to be great parents .
and so we waited a little while before we had our second child .
I want them to feel the way I did -- like they can do anything they want to do in life .
people who spoke the same language made that change as a group .
in Germany , this transition started in the 1880s , and it took just 50 years for family size to stabilize in this country .
and in Asia and Latin America , the transition started in the 1960s , and it happened much faster because of modern contraception .
I think , as we go through this history , it 's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue .
and so what did they do ?
empowering parents -- it doesn 't need justification .
she was incredibly optimistic about her family 's future .
the families were also wealthier .
I hope that they 'll be very proud of me for living out what they taught us about social justice and service .
and I thought it was just an amazing day .
the surgery on offer was pretty gruesome .
the thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
so I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation .
it then comes back into a round form , and then tapers and curves off .
everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not .
so many people in the medical world don 't want to change .
this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe .
in 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S.
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
there are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs .
it 's a natural process , but it is lost as we age .
the horse just has another nostril that 's developed because of a riding accident .
could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio @-@ degradable material on there ?
and it became a question of , how do we all get good at what we 're trying to do ?
and what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than I had understood .
thank you .
because of this , all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home .
yet , these men remain dead .
but sometimes when his female patients can 't afford his services , their families give the women to Jura in exchange for medical treatment .
many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival , and high rates of suicide are recorded .
and every time we paged them , we 'd ask them to answer several questions -- " On a one to seven scale , how happy are you right now ? "
we might spend time with people we don 't even like because it 's somehow interesting .
mummies are a great source of information , except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
( laughter ) So to address this problem , I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland , Denmark and the U.K.
but there 's a little secret .
are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
so I want to talk today about money and happiness , which are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about , either trying to earn them or trying to increase them .
anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else . "
what did they spend it on ?
the answer is much bigger .
that is almost equal to the number of people in the Earth .
you don 't have to dig deep down underground .
but moving to our fourth commandment , I really wouldn 't be here tonight .
now it 's 11 : 00 pm in Rio .
we are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city .
to do that I 'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to HIV .
but that actually doesn 't mean at all that if we gave people more exports , more trade , that that would increase prevalence .
but I just started again an hour ago . "
people go one , two , three , four , tear .
so you can look at this , and maybe you 've even seen things like this .
and I said , " Honey , no , they don 't want to go .
" but what if I saw them ? couldn 't we stay together ? "
and so , we made this game , and she got it .
I don 't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships .
I 'd been making games for 20 @-@ some years , and then I decided to do it again .
so this is a game called " S√≠och√°n leat . " it 's " peace be with you . "
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics , and if you 're going to cover a difficult topic , this is one you need to cover , and I 'll let you figure out what that 's about on your own .
and I also made a game about the Trail of Tears .
it 's an expression of beauty , it 's how they say they love you .
and so to me , this beautiful culture , this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games .
we conventionally divide space into private and public realms , and we know these legal distinctions very well because we 've become experts at protecting our private property and private space .
what translates generic public space into qualitative space ?
the Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent .
there are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
but one thing I can say is that it 's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration .
and then it was really easy all the way through .
four @-@ fifths of the world 's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo .
they 've created our wealth .
but they also have rising costs to our security , economy , health and environment that are starting to erode , if not outweigh their benefits .
so let 's start by making autos oil free .
last year , Volkswagen announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon .
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
let me show you one more .
now let me stop here .
I look at this picture and it freaks me out .
I can tell you , there isn 't a person in this room that would sit idly by .
I think that 's true , actually .
all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted .
so I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
I got about 3,000 emails .
so what I you to take away from my talk , the lesson of all of this , is to just be Stevie Nicks .
migrants can share perspectives , if only politicians would be willing to listen .
I fled Uganda to come to the United States in the hope of sustaining a voice for my brothers and sisters who experience a more serious plight as migrants .
we see , " I just feel like I 'm not going to have fun if it 's not the both of us . " that was from someone in Michigan .
the next movement is called mobs .
and we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men .
we see that the world is feeling " used " at 3.3 times the normal level right now .
we see " better " is the most frequent feeling , followed by " bad . "
you can see the little pink cursor moving along , representing our position .
for instance , you could find women who feel " addicted " in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh .
( laughter ) " I love how I feel today . "
another technique is directly questioning people .
you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted .
nobody 's seen this yet , publicly .
and for him , it wasn 't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you .
and in classical music we can follow these changes very , very accurately because of the music 's powerful silent partner , the way it 's been passed on : notation .
in 200 B.C. , a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks .
and you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass " Puer Natus est Nobis , " " For Us is Born . "
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pinpoint the pitch 's location .
Mozart was the same way .
and by the 1400s , music was being written that tried to mirror God 's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
Ah , baleful stars !
but what 's the actual difference between these two chords ?
it 's just these two notes in the middle .
turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .
now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
this is when those big forms arose -- the symphonies , the sonatas , the concertos .
now this moment so fascinates me .
what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance ?
is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude ?
it 's the passing on part . it 's the ' why ' part of it .
the culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that 's been sliced , diced , layered and , God knows , distributed and sold .
what 's the long @-@ term effect of this on us or on music ?
the question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
( music ) And he said , " Yes , yes . I was a little boy .
the symphony : Isaac Stern , the concerto , I heard it . "
you don 't need to worry about knowing anything .
follow traces . get lost . be surprised , amused inspired .
I love my food .
and as a result of that , I grew up with books everywhere around the house .
and two of the things about Bengal : they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets .
( laughter ) And then life was fine , dandy .
Oh , some of you have seen it .
and as it ran , this thing was saying , " Give me input . give me input . "
energy came to it in some form or shape , data came to it in some form or shape .
and as I went to research that even further , I got to a point where I discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis .
that actually for a given body mass of a primate the metabolic rate was static .
and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue .
when I moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
do you go to a restaurant ?
and by this time I was hooked .
and this is about 23 years into this process .
are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it ?
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
but technology alone isn 't enough .
( laughter ) They are competing in a naked bicycle race , and they are headed straight for your front door .
it 's a talking horse .
back in the 1980s , actually , I gave my first talk at TED , and I brought some of the very , very first public demonstrations of virtual reality ever to the TED stage .
and you say , " Hey , could you bring the skim milk ? "
this is an error page , but what if this error page was also an opportunity ?
that 's the kind of out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ box science that I love doing ...
and what 's interesting about this is that Beethoven was actually smarter than Bill Gates .
so he plays the concerto on the piano . it 's great .
everything you know about Beethoven -- basically wrong .
the very first thing that happens is : it redefines the product .
so the product becomes sheet music , becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home .
every time this happens , we take away some social interaction .
with each of these disruptions , it changes the amount of social interaction .
but there 's also less choice , because in a global pyramid , you can 't always tell what you want .
there 's one more thing that 's not on the list : piracy .
do you think Chopin would have been comforted by the thought , " Hey , 20 percent of the people who buy fake Chopin are more likely to go buy real Chopin " ?
so if you 're playing Chopin , the additions from different countries are different on purpose , because he wanted to be able to track who was a pirate .
well , you can still sell novels without books .
and it doesn 't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay , but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
" I 'm a genius , therefore I got an A , therefore I 'll get an A again and again in the future . "
when they failed , it wasn 't because they were dumb , but because the exam just happened to be unfair .
he found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately , but to get a kiss in three days .
he was taken to court , where a judge set 500 dollars bail .
it 's time to do something about that .
and so that explains this pattern that we 've seen before .
so these types of examples , today there are just a few of them , but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace .
now , this little boy here , Pamelo , from Zambia , he has trachoma .
the repeated infection will scar your eyelids so that they contract and they turn inside out .
but of course , that only gives them temporary respite , because they just grow back more vicious than before .
" F " stands for " face washing . "
they CANNOT eliminate trachoma unless they get more .
well , we believe that we can eliminate trachoma in 12 African countries and across the Americas and all across the Pacific .
and we can make significant progress in two countries which have the highest burden of the disease , which is Ethiopia and Nigeria .
we would be on the home straight to eliminate this disease from the whole world .
it 's no exaggeration to say that this had totally transformed her life .
she could work , she could socialize .
and she said to me , " I have my life back . "
but there are so many Twibas .
this is something that we can solve .
at 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface , sunlight is barely a glimmer .
I was drawn to oceanography by just this kind of challenge .
the wild thing that happened on that trip is that we discovered what everyone who looked before had completely missed : photosynthetic cells smaller than anyone thought possible .
we now know those tiny cells are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on earth .
this amazing discovery happened because we used new technology to see life in the ocean in a new way .
it 's exceedingly large , spanning from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean and around the globe .
these animals and their movements help connect the surface and deep ocean in important ways .
the animals are ground into fish meal to support increasing demands for aquaculture and for nutraceuticals such as krill oil .
this could have irreversible global @-@ scale impacts on marine life and food webs .
we need to get out ahead of fishing impacts and work to understand this critical part of the ocean .
the excitement level about this could not be higher on our team of ocean scientists , engineers and communicators .
this is the first time we 've shared this publicly .
and on that rocket will be a satellite .
because of the power of information , information from technology that is coming down in price and going up in precision .
methane pollution causes one quarter of the global warming that we 're experiencing right now .
and we talked about snakes -- I don 't know why -- we talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia .
and that little girl was crying and was terrified .
and not only is no one talking about it , but we refuse to acknowledge that the source of this crisis is rooted in the same injustice that first propelled the civil rights movement .
he brought us water , he brought us granola , and he brought us tissue .
they make a Midden , a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
two eyes at the bottom , optic nerve flowing out from the back .
and if you 're thinking of the brain as a computer , this is the transistor .
it 's called , " Prochlorococcus , " and this is oceans ' oxygen @-@ producing powerhouse and , I might argue , one of the most amazing discoveries of recent marine microbiology .
all of human history has depended on this little microbe for the oxygen they breathe every day , no matter where or when they lived .
but we may be less aware of the connection we have with marine microbes and the physical discomforts we can feel when those communities change .
as an extreme example : the disease cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in the ocean .
believe it or not , the picture on your right remains a very popular tourist snorkeling spot on the island of Maui , even though it 's lost most of its coral cover over the past decade or so .
we 're looking at a side view of the same coral as before , where the protective layer meets the seawater ; so , seawater on your right , coral on your left .
ecologists all over the world are used to being able to grab a pair of binoculars and go out and observe what their study creatures do each day .
in doing so , we can learn how they respond to our actions and our behaviors and the environment around them in ways that will help us better manage our oceans .
it was a little over 100 years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses .
and all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range .
and you need the fourth factor , which perhaps is the most important factor .
and he finally asked , " Can I see those ? "
I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection .
the murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel .
but then something unexpected happened .
the U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later , and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations .
if we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime , then that is the change we need to spread .
so please , without further ado .
we called it the Tele @-@ Actor .
now , it 's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this .
so we got one of these robots .
first , we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition .
( laughter ) I wish she could meet my dad .
and she would design these toys , where kids in playing with the toys would come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play .
and I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles .
we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .
but really the goal here was , within about a minute , I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create .
so basically , I want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space .
now , over time , this is going to heat up the planet .
so basically , what we 're getting here is the sequel to " An Inconvenient Truth , " in about two minutes , and that actually brings up an interesting point about games .
so here 's our little solar system , as we pull away from our melted planet here .
let 's fly to another one .
one of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO is a monolith that I can drop down .
I want to be able to play " The Day the Earth Stood Still , " " 2001 : a Space Odyssey , " " Star Trek , " " War Of the Worlds . "
one of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented so two @-@ dimensionally and so static .
so here 's a little black hole that we probably don 't want to get too close to .
you might be a vengeful god , conquesting , because you actually can do that , you can attack other intelligent races .
because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now are the result of short @-@ term thinking , and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 , 100 , or 1,000 years out .
let 's say the productivity of biofuel plantations is 1,200 liters of biofuel per hectare per year .
the energy consumption of the United Kingdom , the total energy consumption -- not just transport , but everything -- I like to quantify it in lightbulbs .
the population density of the UK is 250 people per square kilometer .
countries are different from each other .
half of the world 's population lives in countries that are already above that line .
so in an attempt to prepare their men for any future conflicts , they founded the National Rifle Association to promote rifle practice .
so instead , I 'm asking you to do your homework , write your own Choice D using supporting detail .
and he wanted to do this as a matter of principle .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
and so before we could start imaging Archimedes , we had to take this book apart .
and this is terribly important , because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.
the thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this .
and this didn 't exist in codices A and B.
so Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon .
now I should say at this point that normally when you 're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off , you don 't find unique texts .
but this is just a further evolution of a journey of uncomfortable learning throughout my life .
as a black student attending predominantly white private schools , I 've encountered attitudes and behaviors that reflected racial stereotypes .
to prepare myself to engage with controversy in the real world , I joined a group that brought controversial speakers to campus .
for many , it was difficult to see how bringing controversial speakers to campus could be valuable , when they caused harm .
it 's my belief that to achieve progress in the face of adversity , we need a genuine commitment to gaining a deeper understanding of humanity .
it was really crowded , as it is around the holidays , and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused .
I 'm totally overreacting . "
no .
we try to make sense of nonsense , and we swallow the furious feelings .
that fury that my friend felt holds centuries of never being able to directly address or express our indignation , our frustration and our rage .
time 's up on women being held responsible for men 's bad behavior .
thank you .
with the Falcon 9 and now the Falcon Heavy , we can launch into orbit any payload that has previously been conceived or is conceived right now .
I was excited .
GS : that 's not terrible , and you said it , I didn 't .
that 's part of the design principle that you , rather than just inventing ever bigger rockets , you team them up .
what on earth is this ?
we 're bringing the first stages back , and we 're landing them on federal property on an Air Force base .
so I think doing it , I don 't know , 10 kilometers out from a city , maybe it 's only five kilometers out from a city .
and yet , a long @-@ haul aircraft can only make one of those flights a day .
GS : yeah . so we 've got a video , this is a cropped video from others we 've shown , and then there 's a couple of new bits to it .
but basically , you 're going to lift off from a pad , you 've got a booster as well as the BFS , the Big Falcon Spaceship .
it will be within a decade -- not this decade .
fundamentally , it 's another place to explore , and that 's what makes humans different from animals , it 's our sense of exploration and sense of wonderment and learning something new .
among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice .
if Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law , it could be a model .
evaluating Egypt on this basis alone , however , ignores the real revolution .
where women agree , however , is on their own role , and that it must be central and active .
well , there are some technologies which obviously combine both .
and we can question these values .
this is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory behind the Sierra Nevadas , and in 1968 , I was working there collecting data for my thesis .
now , let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime , and that is , SETI , I think , is important , because it 's exploration , and it 's not only exploration , it 's comprehensible exploration .
you GOTTA get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something .
now , look , a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country .
it shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there , we 're looking for them out there , but they 're here , right ?
okay ? that had a big effect on me .
so to me , it is a privilege , and when I look in the mirror , the facts are that I really don 't see myself .
for some random reason , I can 't imagine , something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox .
identity is , especially when you 're a teenager , a fluid thing .
I look pretty good in a suit , frankly , so you can see why it would drive them into an anti @-@ capitalist frenzy .
but if I have to prove who I am , I 'll never send that message .
the goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don 't need identity , which is actually almost all transactions .
it 's something we can do about .
naturally , in these circumstances , I turn to Doctor Who .
because in this , as in so many other walks of life , Doctor Who has already shown us the answer .
you 're not nerds if you say yes .
who 's seen Doctor Who 's psychic paper ?
is that what you 're going to tell us ?
that 's a Japanese ATM , the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone .
it has to be a utility that you can use everywhere .
the first phones that have the technology built in , the Google Nexus , the S2 , the Samsung Wifi 7.9 , the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops .
so it turns out that we have upgraded .
we found another one last month .
so the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Homo sapiens ; the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around .
if these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non @-@ Olympic medal .
and as they pick that , these become bone , and then they pick another road and these become platelets , and these become macrophages , and these become T cells .
that turns out to be a big deal because now you can take , not just mouse cells , but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells .
and that 's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power .
what new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology ?
but instead I saw this .
if the wall around the erectile tissue wasn 't there , if it wasn 't reinforced in this way , the shape would change , but the inflated penis would not resist bending , and erection simply wouldn 't work .
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
and I 'm about to show you some stop @-@ motion footage that I made recently where you 'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour .
and this attracts metals from their local environment .
it is also not a monument to design , it is a monument to design 's utility .
does anyone know ? Chi ?
you see , babies are born in a state of utter fragility .
and this is not something that happens to humans only .
so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic , the brain determines who we 're going to be .
it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born .
there are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
so I feel that we have a bioethical imperative .
the science is there .
in fact , we believe there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism , and genetic anomalies , much more than just genes .
and so in the past many years , we 've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking .
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers .
they start over here -- they love people 's eyes -- and it remains quite stable .
and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength : predictable situations , situations that can be defined .
well , thank you for listening to me .
we make up half the population of the world , but we 're just 24 percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories .
initially , it defended itself , and said , " These aren 't our views .
she had been a bright , easygoing girl .
what she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and devalue their lives .
he balked at first , but said he eventually followed the directive happily , because his stories got better and his job got easier .
it 's important to keep talking about this , in light of Lara Logan .
you all have a stake in a strong , vibrant media .
suggest female sources to reporters and editors .
it 's for The Guardian newspaper .
it 's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist , but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world .
but it 's only when you get the whole picture , you can fully understand what 's going on .
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
he had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes .
all of us ? designers ?
intent changes the picture completely .
he 's the random state of nature we emerged from .
in fact , the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord @-@ injured males was invented by a veterinarian .
but we all had to change , but not just react to the given ; we bend to this new experience with intent .
as the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos , a confrontation with random , brutal nature , they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about .
today we don 't confront the chaos of nature .
how shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create , on all the circumstances we create , on all the places we change ?
in the middle of this chaos , I 'm rolling around in a wheelchair , and I was completely invisible . completely .
I was in a wheelchair ; I didn 't look like a looter .
we sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes .
" nurse ! is this the 28th or the 29th ? "
it 's just a set of choices that people make .
and of course all of this requires a broader workforce .
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
thank you .
( laughter ) Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not @-@ lost @-@ for @-@ long city , found from above .
my God , this lifestyle that I 'm living is so freaking evil ! "
I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time .
it goes and goes and engulfs !
when you get in front of this crowd , you 're gonna share the news .
again , we 'll get back to that .
and skaters , I think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging , but belonging on their own terms .
there 's some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality , which we are expressing by what we do .
( laughter ) Notice a couple of these shots from the police department .
you can be an iOS hacker , make your iPhone do stuff it wasn 't supposed to .
not authorized , but not illegal .
it was the red one or the blue one .
is that it ? what 's next ?
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ?
where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this ?
no , not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm , but that does not mean there 's not something going on at the highest possible levels .
now do you need towels , laundry , maids ?
and I noticed , he 's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions .
you can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters .
let me show you .
history as an imaging tool ?
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
it 'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today .
everyone is both a learner and a teacher .
now the students and I enjoyed the class , but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology isn 't .
they got this statement of accomplishment .
I would watch Nova on PBS .
we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
and now you 're riding along with the ISS where it is right now .
I 'm going to double @-@ click on Uranus , and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons .
it only looks like nothing 's moving because , well , Saturn here is 700,000 miles away , and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
it actually flies underneath Saturn .
when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China , it has , you know , led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India .
so within the company , there 's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries .
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations , because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms .
without that , you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today .
you can 't be a professor without having been a student .
India has the youngest growing population in the world .
in 2009 , they had 400,000 employees , by which time the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000 , whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000 .
Allison Hunt : my three minutes hasn 't started yet , has it ?
Ah : Oh my God , it 's harsh up here .
now , in Canada , we have that great healthcare system .
18 more months .
you just have to read the article until you find something you don 't know , and preferably something your dad doesn 't even know .
the Earth spins , of course , as it travels around the sun , so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle , like some Earthlings .
now in the old days , that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically , maybe getting sidetracked , that was fun .
this is the boy in me getting lucky again .
and this is a good way to learn , by looking at other people 's work .
or , the software is GPL , so it 's open @-@ source as well .
this one is made by a company called Adafruit , which is run by this woman called Limor Fried , also known as ladyada , who is one of the heroes of the open @-@ source hardware movement and the maker movement .
so let 's look at some projects .
or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make .
and then , when they had a final project , they actually went to Kickstarter and they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make a few of them to sell .
I call them the Net Generation .
I 'm a digital immigrant .
I said , " Great . what do you do ? "
and he says , " Well I used to be a banker and now I 'm a gold miner . "
you know , some of the best submissions didn 't come from geologists .
so this is good . it 's not bad .
do you know about this ?
the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled .
you know , during the Tunisian revolution , snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street .
up until two years ago , all revolutions in human history had a leadership , and when the old regime fell , the leadership and the organization would take power .
you were born , you lived your life and you died .
the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
I 've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like , but I 've been studying nature recently .
could we start to share our intelligence ?
that 's not to say that I 've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles .
I was gaunt . I walked as though my legs were wooden .
Steve , both a lawyer and a psychologist , has treated many patients with severe mental illness , and to this day he 'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen .
'Hi , ' I said , and then I returned to the couch , where I sat in silence for several moments .
'i think someone 's infiltrated my copies of the cases , ' I said .
I never struck anyone .
imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand , three @-@ inch diameter , with a single difference .
I study the future of crime and terrorism , and frankly , I 'm afraid .
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed .
and the man replied , " I 'm just an innocent schoolteacher . "
during this 60 @-@ hour siege on Mumbai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill .
this was done nearly four years ago .
there 's also been a big paradigm shift in crime .
you could rob 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
of course , criminals and terrorists weren 't the first to give guns to robots . we know where that started .
but as these get bigger in the future , what other items will you be able to print ?
as we move forward , we 'll see new technologies also , like the Internet of Things .
if you control the code , you control the world .
in the United States , there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet .
we recently saw a case where some researchers made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent .
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
or , we decide that we 're going to prevent dementia , and it will never happen to us because we 're going to do everything right and it won 't come and get us .
the middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean , and the third line is radioactive material leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean .
if you 're multiplying the rig , so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you 're using , you can collect a lot more .
what 's happening is that , because the boat changes shape , the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind .
in other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live .
things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
I mean , how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious , and in some cases life @-@ and @-@ death , circumstances ?
" I 'm not afraid to do what makes me happy . "
that is worth + 1 physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster .
every single second that you are not sitting still , you are actively improving the health of your heart , and your lungs and brains .
now I get to share one more little bit of science with you .
people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us , I know you 're not paying attention to me , but ...
and I can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there , but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project .
premature infants have real problems with their microbial community .
and he shrugged it off , I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot , or it was the typical M.D. " nothing can be wrong with my children . "
it 's extraordinary to watch .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
turn three . and John 's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
and Limor designed this , in part , because , like Carol , she felt threatened by GPS tracking .
they 're wide open , vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack .
you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spoofer .
there is , though , one redeeming feature of the GPS spoofer .
you may never experience the entire thing yourself .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn 't make sense .
why not ?
it was the first cancer virus discovered , and when I call it " oncogene , " meaning " cancer gene . "
so , he made a filtrate , he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter , and he injected it to another chicken , and he got another tumor .
so , when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish , we got a mass of blue cells .
on the right , you see it looks very ugly , the cells continue to grow , the normal ones stop .
this is what we got .
we inject them into the mouse , the ones on the right , and none of them would make tumors .
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
there is the people , and then there is the government or leaders .
but I 'm confident , with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one , I think we can get this and other goals done .
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image .
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel .
I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body .
what should we do ?
and since I study human decision making , I said , I 'm going to run some studies to find some answers .
you are going to solve a series of puzzles , and I 'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily .
I 'm going to give you one of these two teas , and keep in mind , I 'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you .
audience member : pulpit ! Baba Shiv : Whoa ! OK .
we let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver 's seat .
this is a tipping point .
unlike what you may have seen on " Law & amp ; Order : SVU , " justice is rare for victims of gender violence .
so while Civil Rights protects some victims , we should want to protect all victims .
I 'm here to say , " It 's time . "
and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does .
child : TV . ( children react ) Child : Oh my God .
child : Oh , that is so cool .
second child : it 's magic .
now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side .
mm on video : one , two , three . go !
every one of these circles is a cog , a stack of cogs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
and some even said , this would be Stasi 2.0 .
can they really store all this information about us ?
I 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
but then after a while I realized , this is my life .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
a simple volume , the cube .
so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we 're making the fold , but essentially you 're looking at a folded cube .
but that 's only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
for one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them .
and this is a photo now , it 's not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
after decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it 's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even .
people are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
what does this mean ?
until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor , who was looking at people and giving them meds .
have you been to southern Spain lately ? there are roads everywhere .
they didn 't say , " No , you know , we 're not going to take this . "
but there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance .
the first one needs little introduction -- " Girl with a Pearl Earring " by Johannes Vermeer , 17th @-@ century Dutch painter .
he 's an 18th @-@ century French painter best known for his still lifes , but he did occasionally paint people .
I 'm thinking of an older version of himself .
( laughter ) So , my work became popular .
but I didn 't want to .
DM : that 's awful .
empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with does not suddenly compromise your own deeply held beliefs and endorse theirs .
thank you so much .
there 's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let 's look at the first metric here , overwintering survival .
so the problems of bees today isn 't necessarily something new . it has been happening since over a thousand years ago , but what we don 't really notice are these problems in cities .
why are bees doing better in the city ?
1971 , we saw it spread to Europe and South America , and then , when we get to the 1980s , and specifically to 1987 , the varroa mite finally came to North America and to the United States , and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States .
think of the kids today . their childhood 's a bit different .
well , really , just change your perspective .
we all know Mubarak is technically dead .
so when these 300 million people , microbloggers , even they block the tweet in our censored platform .
the first five days after the train crash , there were 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media , which never happened in Chinese history .
so , the up is the Embassy data , the PM 2.5 .
I live in Beijing . every day , I just watch the American Embassy 's data to decide whether I should open my window .
maybe in Germany , in German language , it may be just " Aha ! "
Chinese is always cheating , right ?
" Weibo " is the Chinese translation for " microblog . "
it has its own innovation .
it became the media .
so that 's why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government , they want the emperor to settle the problem .
but now we have Weibo , so I call it the Weibo petition .
so the crackdown is very serious .
but it didn 't change the Chinese political system , and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions .
so , what 's the future ?
Don 't let them hook [ up ] with the Chinese cats .
it changes what we see . it changes what we remember .
so this is the footage that I was showing everybody .
( launch noises ) So literally what you 're seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people , a bunch of different memories , including my own , of taking a little bit of liberty with the subject matter .
( music ) Tom Hanks : Hello , Houston , this is Odyssey .
and in this particular case , this is the climax of the movie , and , you know , the weight of achieving it was simply take a model , throw it out of a helicopter , and shoot it .
( laughter ) And I 'm not going to argue with you . you 're an astronaut , a hero , and I 'm from New Jersey , so -- ( Laughter ) I 'm just going to show you some footage .
so I showed him this , and this is actual footage that he was on . this is Apollo 15 . this was his mission .
and he said , " Huh , that 's pretty good . can we use it ? "
( laughter ) Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic .
I 'll give it to Jim , because he could use the pat on the back .
and so I 'll just show it one more time .
that doesn 't move . "
( laughter ) ( Applause ) " And the thing without the wheels , that moves . "
he was the master of his universe , and we wanted Hugo to feel the same way , so we created this shot .
so I was kind of proud of it , and I went to a friend of mine , and said , " You know , this is , you know , kind of the best @-@ reviewed shot I 've ever worked on .
so here we have this piece of music by Beethoven , and my problem with it is , it 's boring .
( music ) Okay , I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the intonation was a little questionable . ( laughter ) Let 's watch just another clip .
( music ) So with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
there was the florist , and I can understand that , once again , we 're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally , but let 's look at one last piece today I 'm going to share with you .
this is going to be a piece called " aphasia , " and it 's for hand gestures synchronized to sound , and this invites yet another role , and final one I 'll share with you , which is that of the choreographer .
is it music ? here 's how I want to conclude .
so for me , choreography is very much a process of physical thinking . it 's very much in mind , as well as in body , and it 's a collaborative process .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
I 'm going to start really , really simply .
so all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand .
so I have to get myself in the zone . right .
they 're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase .
so they 're solving this problem for me , having a little -- They 're constructing that phrase .
yeah , down to the floor . can you go underneath ?
avoid it . avoid it . Whoom . kick it out of the way .
they 're starting it already , and this is a task @-@ based method , where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves .
I 'm going to think about it in 3D space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that 's in front of me , it 's a space that my body can go inside of .
thank you very much . ( applause ) Thank you . thank you . ( applause ) Here we go . ( applause ) ( Applause )
until 2017 claimed that record -- ( Laughter ) and left many people longing for earlier decades , when the world seemed safer , cleaner and more equal .
( laughter ) You can always fool yourself into seeing a decline if you compare bleeding headlines of the present with rose @-@ tinted images of the past .
but 30 years ago , the homicide rate was 8.5 per hundred thousand , poverty rate was 12 percent and we emitted 35 million tons of particulate matter and 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide .
but 30 years ago , there were 23 wars , 85 autocracies , 37 percent of the world population in extreme poverty and more than 60,000 nuclear weapons .
in the 19th century , Westerners worked more than 60 hours per week .
but my science story doesn 't have that spectacular Hollywood ending .
he was so concerned , he wrote to me from his wife 's email account because he was afraid a phone call could be traced .
( applause ) And I have worked hard to back up those words with actions .
and it may seem very obvious , the link , now , but at the time , I couldn 't really work out how could I use my photography to do something useful .
the people there have been forgotten , so I thought it was important to go and document their stories .
it was a realization that maybe it was worthwhile going off and doing these things .
many late nights of vodka @-@ fueled violence with me sitting in the corner with my bag , just going , " When was this a good idea ? "
now , I have to say , I had a " Lonely Planet " guide to Ukraine and in it , it gave some advice .
but one of the little kids , Lilic , he was the one who had taken my camera , and he started taking photographs .
he had a real eye for things .
that 's him , there .
he had taken a lot of pills and a lot of vodka .
then in February of last year , when I was on patrol in Afghanistan , I stepped on an IED .
I went to those places because I wanted to make some kind of change , and photography happened to be my tool .
but the reality is that we can all do something .
( laughter ) These questions became more complex as I got older .
but in the US , it 's a thing .
( laughter ) But he would say , " But you 're African .
but what we think of as community support takes on new urgency when you 're in the middle of an opioid and overdose crisis .
I 'm not sharing this to sensationalize Kensington .
and one way to provide support was learning how to administer Narcan .
and so I 'm here to explain what that is .
what you see here is two male chimpanzees who are the same size , but one is walking upright , has his hair up , has a big rock in his hand , and he 's the alpha male .
you don 't need to be the biggest and strongest male .
people who don 't like each other need to embrace each other and stand together , and that 's absolutely essential for the unity of the party , and if you don 't do that , the party may fall apart .
the second cost is that everyone wants your position .
alpha male position is a very important position , and everyone wants to take it from you , and so you constantly have to watch your back .
you have to be extremely vigilant .
WK : this is my home . this is where I live .
ca : you tested three , and found that four worked better ?
ca : so what did they make of -- that you were 14 , 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ? they were impressed ?
and when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he 's got to lose weight , so do I !
all start overage and under @-@ credit .
one got us invited to the White House , one 's a recent incarnation .
so here , and at a time when we 've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity , I urge you to do something .
or Jenny , who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master 's degree .
they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job , and we know many students who did .
DK : so here the video pauses , and the student types in the answer into the box and submits . obviously they weren 't paying attention .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions , and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions .
this is from Stanford 's Computer Science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color @-@ correct that blurry red image .
they 're typing their program into the browser , and you can see they didn 't get it quite right , Lady Liberty is still seasick .
and so , the student tries again , and now they got it right , and they 're told that , and they can move on to the next assignment .
so we had to come up with a different solution .
what 's even more surprising is that self @-@ grades , where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades .
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale , and is also a useful learning strategy for the students , because they actually learn from the experience .
and the really amazing thing is , because there were so many students , it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o 'clock in the morning , somewhere around the world , there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem .
this is the San Francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world .
because the data that we can collect here is unique .
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis @-@ driven mode to the data @-@ driven mode , a transformation that , for example , has revolutionized biology .
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer .
the big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer .
now , if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer , you would never notice .
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it 's kind of hard to miss .
educational researcher Benjamin Bloom , in 1984 , posed what 's called the 2 sigma problem , which he observed by studying three populations .
the first is the population that studied in a lecture @-@ based classroom .
because we CANNOT afford , as a society , to provide every student with an individual human tutor .
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone .
and even personalization is something that we 're starting to see the beginnings of , whether it 's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we 've shown you .
so the goal here is to try and push , and see how far we can get towards the green curve .
so , if this is so great , are universities now obsolete ?
so how do we do that ?
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles inland .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
we cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
I was helping clean the onsen , the communal onsen , the huge giant bathtubs .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them , Cindy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
so , how did she know that she was right ?
so , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
it means that organizations mostly can 't do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
they can 't think together .
so , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
but when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
after all , maybe they knew something he didn 't .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist 's clinic to do it .
you don 't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
they 're ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late .
max Little : yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . TR : right .
all right , let 's head back to 1964 , and let 's hear where some of Dylan 's early songs came from .
last one , this is " Who 's Going To Buy You Ribbons , " another traditional folk tune .
" the worlds are the important thing .
( music ) We know this tune , right ? we know it ?
that is " When the World 's on Fire , " a very old melody , in this case performed by the Carter Family .
Steve Jobs : and we have invented a new technology called multi @-@ touch .
we are not self @-@ made . we are dependent on one another , and admitting this to ourselves isn 't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness .
and I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo .
and then they 've said to every single one of their workforce , if you can , help those communities grow , and help them to maintain their spaces .
I catapulted out of the front screen door and threw myself on a fresh carpet of grass .
my mother cooked with the colors and textures of her garden .
and there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues , and African companies on turnarounds , making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally .
you should have seen my parents ' reaction !
and let 's start at the high level , on the macro @-@ factors .
Egypt : from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent .
and this is what today is about -- it 's about discussing those very opportunities .
Bing Capital 's acquisition of Edcon , a large retailer , is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .
but looking at Goldman Sachs ' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report .
the new report , " The Next Eleven , " highlights that by 2020 Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world .
bellwether signs again .
it 's just a sign of things to come .
but with Africa , let 's start being careful about this .
and Emeka and I have had these discussions .
for Africa to truly be sustainable , we have to move beyond to other industries .
let 's look at agriculture . let 's look at forestry .
as the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [ we will need ] poles for rolling out electricity .
there are only 700 ATMs in the country . opportunity .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard & amp ; Poors , Moody 's and Fitch 's .
they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
the air is thick with heat and dust , and it 's hard to breathe .
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can 't see much else .
slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
I couldn 't offer them any direct help .
it was more like a restaurant .
recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
it 's estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man @-@ made lake in the world .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
these miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
when I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
has been with me ever since I was a child .
and so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s .
and my heroine here -- like Satish 's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma .
she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon .
but we have to practice .
the only thing to do is to get up , make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you .
( applause ) So that 's fear . what about anger ?
if we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power .
and I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy @-@ makers .
because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
I 've got nightmare disorder , which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure , and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going , " You 're a failure ! "
( laughter ) But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap .
this experience changed our lives , and now we 're trying to change the experience .
I get a call from Caitria , hear the news , and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another Supercell was forming in their area .
we should inventory the donations piling up here .
co : my car is in my living room !
large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster , but they often fulfill very specific missions , and then they leave .
there 's a gap here .
data is inherently unsexy , but it can jump @-@ start an area 's recovery .
emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient .
but if you give locals the tools , if you show them what they can do to recover , they become experts .
over 80 percent are in low- and middle @-@ income countries , and many have no access to hearing care .
if I were screening Anuk at school , sound @-@ attenuating headphones and noise monitoring would take the place of a sound booth , and I would use a phone adapter instead of a microscope to examine his ears .
and yet , when we look back on the printing press in the early years , we like what happened .
this is feudalism : one owner , many workers .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn 't know of each other 's existence beforehand .
and it includes this very evocative screenshot .
the stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted .
this , graphically , was the answer . ( laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And that is indeed part of the problem , but only part .
so consider this .
T.S. Eliot once said , " One of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose . "
or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large ?
I 'm afraid I 'm one of those speakers you hope you 're not going to meet at TED .
and because of the rain until four o 'clock in the afternoon , nobody went to the polling stations .
the problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing .
and the first thing that went right was , of course , these five revolutions which , in my view , very much changed the way we 're living and deepened our democratic experience .
and the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s , which put the individual at the center of politics .
but after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s .
and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : " the government does not know better . "
and of course , you have 1989 -- the end of Communism , the end of the Cold War .
it has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics .
the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality .
when the Soviet Union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
these days it 's very popular to believe that this push for transparency , this kind of a combination between active citizens , new technologies and much more transparency @-@ friendly legislation can restore trust in politics .
I find this extremely important , because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions .
thank you very much .
( laughter ) Now , trust , if we 're going to rebuild it , we have to understand its component parts .
but if any one of these three gets shaky , if any one of these three wobbles , trust is threatened .
now here 's what I 'd like to do .
I want each of us to be able to engender more trust tomorrow , literally tomorrow , than we do today .
would you give me some sense of whether or not you 're here voluntarily ?
that takes care of the empathy wobblers .
( laughter ) But fortunately , it 's often the case that our logic is sound , but it 's our ability to communicate the logic that is in jeopardy .
you don 't want to have an authenticity wobble ? be you .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
and he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end , he had such popular support in London that he won .
and they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader .
and it didn 't have much more grandeur than the term " foreman " or " overseer . "
now , you can learn three interesting things from this .
a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
I 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human @-@ centered design -- " Let 's figure out what people want . "
well , here 's an example .
so it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution .
our other partner is East Meets West , an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region .
and keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C @-@ section , so that 's already kind of a bummer .
but here 's the problem : every doctor in the world , every hospital administrator , has seen TV -- curse those " ER " reruns !
and here 's what we developed .
it only fits a single baby , and the idea here is it 's obvious how you ought to use this device .
and one day I looked in -- they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished .
I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa .
I just want to say good afternoon , good evening .
I guess there goes my green card .
it comes from popular culture .
he says , " When the Sumerian tablets were first translated , they were thought to be business records .
in 1967 , in the middle of the Biafran @-@ Nigerian Civil War , Dr. Njoku @-@ Obi invented the Cholera vaccine .
in fact , every time I read in Ireland , people get me all mistaken and they say , " Oh , this is Chris O 'Barney from Cork . "
my story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison , and I had no language for it .
we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent : the valuable resource of the imagination .
Idris pauses , then he moves again , and Fraser says , " Please !
in that moment , Fraser says , " I am lost already , but not you ... not you . "
( laughter ) He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential , pure identity : religious , ethnic , historical , ideological .
you 've been seasoned by wind , dusk and sunlight .
pressure can make everything whole again .
brass nails tacked into the ebony wood , your face has been carved five times .
so close your eyes for a minute .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon ?
as John Cage said , " We are not moving towards some kind of goal .
actually , I need to take this off because I have a thing -- ( googly eyes rattle ) Oh .
you can have a camera ; you can get photos of your entire head .
and you just put a little bit like that .
( robot buzzes ) ( Laughter ) And then you have a little hand .
so , I promise -- I mean , it still has -- it doesn 't have any water in it , I 'm sorry .
instead it happened just because I was enthusiastic about what I was doing , and I was sharing that enthusiasm with other people .
Sydney . I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney .
the description read : " the suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto . "
to understand this , I think it kind of makes sense to look where we 've come from .
artists can take us to a far @-@ flung part of the city that we haven 't explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour .
we , the audience , were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal .
for " The Sultan 's Elephant , " Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time @-@ traveling elephant .
festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well @-@ being .
this is a concept known as thermal radiation .
the first time I tested this was on a rooftop in Stanford that I 'm showing you right here .
so I was really excited , because not only do we make something cool , but we might actually have the opportunity to do something real and make it useful .
one such process I 'd like to highlight are solar cells .
we tell it in our story of evolution as well , from our lolloping ancestors to Homo erectus , finally upright , to Homo sapiens , depicted , always a man , always mid @-@ stride .
he asked that question , but he never answered it , and here 's why .
we want to get everybody out of the hole , over the social foundation and into that green doughnut itself .
so can we find this dynamic balance in the 21st century ?
cities like London , Glasgow , Amsterdam are pioneering circular city design , finding ways to turn the waste from one urban process into food for the next .
but how meaningful is this calculation , really ?
her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , speechless .
over the next two years , I watched as she switched jobs five times , eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory .
she recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes , temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village .
by opening up their lives to me , they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world .
when you talk to workers , that 's what they want .
I mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that 's not why they 're in the city , and that 's not what they care about .
ca : was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
this is Oshodi Market in Lagos .
so , what am I talking about when I talk about System D ?
all of this is happening openly , and aboveboard .
it 's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called UAC foods that 's active throughout Africa and the Middle East , but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores .
I 'm so OK with it .
it 's basically just sitting there , waiting for Goldman Sachs to give it some money .
yes .
( laughter ) And when I looked up in the catalog to see how much this three @-@ foot @-@ high mouse cost , here 's how it was described ...
( laughter ) And that 's when I knew .
the string theory ; the idea that all of reality emanates from the vibrations of these teeny -- I call it " The Big Twang . "
we 've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky 's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years .
I 'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider 's human @-@ computer symbiosis , perhaps better termed " intelligence augmentation , " I.A.
Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the Internet .
humans are so amazing -- how we think , our non @-@ linear approaches , our creativity , iterative hypotheses , all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do .
we require high @-@ end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing .
silently , without much fanfare , this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess .
and for this task , supercomputer field brute force simply isn 't enough .
Foldit , a game created by computer scientists , illustrates the value of the approach .
last year , on the site of the Twin Towers , the 9 / 11 memorial opened .
the better the process , the less the friction .
as appealing as it might sound , you CANNOT algorithmically data mine your way to the answer .
they found a treasure trove of documents : 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters .
it turns out that al Qaeda , too , is not without its bureaucracy . ( laughter ) They answered questions like , " Who recruited you ? "
analyzing this data was hard . the originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated .
the data was incredibly disparate . the U.S. Army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country .
there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference , other geospatial data , none of it integrated .
but beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy , we 're also concerned about the quality of life lived .
I see some nodding heads there .
in India , I found the situation was not a lot better .
we have a precedent for this . good old Henry II here , in the 12th century , invented the jury .
the second phase is in getting decision @-@ making power out .
in fact , if you fly over Germany , for example , and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages , they 're all about a mile apart .
now there 's some trends that will impact cities .
I won 't go through all of them . I 'll just show one .
you have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world .
we actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston .
we can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like 28 times the land utilization with that kind of strategy .
you have a conventional one @-@ bedroom arrangement when you need it .
OK , so if we have a conventional building , we have a fixed envelope , maybe we can put in 14 units .
it says a lot about her peers who elected her .
I think we need to consider everything , everything from alpha to OMEGA .
they are our body 's own repair kits , and they 're pluripotent , which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies .
back then , 15 years ago , we didn 't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan .
it 's also involved in social interaction , understanding other people , and self @-@ awareness .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
to you and me , that 's a heart attack .
I don 't know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
the World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe 's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities . we can do better than that .
Hey , let 's all be interior sound designers , take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that 's effective and appropriate .
I went to my school kitchen , and I said , " Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at . "
so I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
there will always be waste . I 'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste @-@ free world .
a country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs .
it represents a colossal waste of food , but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg .
how have I insulted my host ? "
some food waste , as I said at the beginning , will inevitably arise , so the question is , what is the best thing to do with it ?
and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques , and he 's the guy giving the lecture .
I ran down the street and collapsed , and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming .
they kind of have this vault where they 're stored in high @-@ def , and George Lucas did all the sound effects . ( laughter ) So sometimes , remembering them , it 's like , it 's not like any other kind of memories .
thank you . ( applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . very lucky to be here . thank you . ( applause )
but first of all , I want you to do me a favor .
where does it come from ?
and for what ?
all the technology is in place for us to communicate , and all the technology is in place to communicate this .
why should we allow such a wonderful , brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings ?
we make things grow .
we are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
what do we do when we feel powerless ?
they raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
so I 'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that 's hormones . I look at hormones .
so there are a lot of differences . they take more risks .
here are a couple more .
this one is very low @-@ power .
risk tolerance , which is the gambling , we find that when you are in the high @-@ power pose condition , 86 percent of you will gamble .
so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it 's not just others , but it 's also ourselves .
but the next question , of course , is , can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
we then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
so I said , fake it till you make it .
I was thrown from the car .
I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
they say , " You 're not going to finish college .
eventually I graduated from college .
you 're going to stay , and this is what you 're going to do .
I don 't feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
and so I want to say to you , don 't fake it till you make it .
and so I started looking around , and I heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutes .
thank you .
and from day one , Noam and I decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the Web .
to anyone considering NAND2Tetris , it 's a tough journey , but you 'll be profoundly changed . "
so for example , let 's take area .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
I have to say that I 'm very glad to be here .
that was the computer we knew .
so that was 20 years ago , and I was always on the periphery of art .
you know , when people say , " I don 't get art .
so they 'd go to an antique shop , and they 'd look at this cup , and they 'd say , " Tell us about this cup . "
and as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , I 've spent my whole career making new media art .
but I found a sign for Russian @-@ speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
my favorite ones are " no plants . " why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? I 'm not sure .
and I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox , and I said great .
if you don 't like the hotel , there 's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night .
now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard @-@ wired in all of us .
now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect , like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs .
reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you .
this year , two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer @-@ to @-@ peer lending platforms .
what I mean by this is , say he started selling second @-@ hand books on Amazon . why should he have to start from scratch ?
what 's interesting is that Publicolor has heard from school administrators who say that attendance improves , graffiti disappears and kids actually say they feel safer in these painted schools .
we evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous , and abundance meant survival .
the interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we 've been limited , in a way .
we just haven 't had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously .
the problem is , I don 't think these projections are accurate .
now we have multi @-@ language , instantaneous , automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices , all the way down to smartphones .
and if any of us have used these , we know that they 're not perfect , but they 're decent .
not anymore .
it was written by an algorithm .
I want to ask : what have been the most important developments in human history ?
so when you do this and when you plot the data , you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions .
so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when I look at what 's going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey .
they don 't run on capital , they don 't run on labor .
waste was not reduced -- it was eliminated .
and when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means , through Freedom of Information Act requests , through harassing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent .
but people didn 't bother to use those registers .
this is a disaster .
we CANNOT know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information .
so if there was this world and this screen , and if there was the physical world around me , I couldn 't ever get them together in the same place .
normally it lives on the top of Big Ben , because that 's where you get the best reception , but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation .
they connect in a manhole like this . literally , this is where the 5,000 @-@ mile cable plugs in .
but what amazes me is Simon 's incredible geographic imagination .
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw , you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud .
well , I became a tapestry historian .
some of them are so big we had , to get them into the museum , we had to take them up the great steps at the front .
and you can just imagine them .
it wasn 't just your standard installation .
and I used to run away from home , when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so .
over the past six months , I 've spent my time traveling . I think I 've done 60,000 miles , but without leaving my desk .
and then I struggled , because I was thinking to myself , " What should I talk ? what should I do ? it 's a TED audience .
you don 't believe me , do you ? okay . ( applause ) So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don 't understand .
people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen .
it gets even worse than that . let me just walk you through this one .
so I 'll put a little line up here which represents learning , and that 's how we used to do it . we could see things , understand them , take the time to put them into practice .
( applause ) Thank you , thank you . ( applause )
popcorn changes all of that .
let 's go to this Google Map , and I 'll show you how you can edit it .
all you do , go into the timeline , double @-@ click the item , and I 've set it to Toronto , because that 's where I 'm from .
feelings are tunnels .
there 's an area of your brain you 've probably heard referred to as the " reward center . "
it 's actually three intertwined but separable systems .
how bad ? "
what Pavlov did was make the bell food @-@ related .
if you 're experiencing unwanted pain , talk to a medical provider .
is it sex @-@ related to have pressure directly against your clitoris ?
she recognized and articulated what she wanted and liked .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Applause for lube , absolutely .
but I want to tell you a darker listen @-@ to @-@ her @-@ words story .
there are times when consent is ambiguous and we need a large @-@ scale cultural conversation about that .
number 13 : on occasion , the victim , female or male , may experience a physical response , but this is not a sexual response in the sense of desire or mutuality . "
this brings me one step closer into the darkness , and then I promise we will find our way into the light .
imagine you 're on the jury and you learn that the victim had orgasms .
that kind of story can give a person all kind of feelings , from rage to shame to confused arousal because it is sex @-@ related , even though it is appalling .
I can see it helping people , even as I say the words .
but do have one brave conversation .
one in six men .
say it to a judge you know or a lawyer you know , or a cop or anyone who might sit on a jury in a sexual assault case .
a little easier and safer for the survivors , one in three women .
one in six men .
so for every brave conversation you have , thank you .
thanks .
en : the question I get asked most often is actually the question underneath pretty much all the other questions , so , can you get addicted to your vibrator , please help me with my erectile dysfunction ?
like , do you just want normal sex or do you want awesome sex in your life ?
( cello music continues ) ( Taps rhythmically ) You found me , you found me under a pile of broken memories with your steady , your steady , steady love .
what I do is I organize information .
but the question is , why is it obvious ?
you arrive in a new city , and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place .
every street is generally perceived as a straight line , and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make .
when we do , however , make a turn into a side street , our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 @-@ degree angle .
maybe you 've had that experience as well .
the cognitive map in your mind may tell you , " Aris , go back to the main cathedral square , take a 90 @-@ degree turn and walk down that other side street . "
the second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines .
she 'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work , and ... " go past that church where I got married , " that kind of thing .
so we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning .
you might add little symbols along the way .
if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you 've just drawn , you 'd realize your streets and the distances -- they 'd be way off .
no , what you 've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic .
in the 1930s , Harry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever .
of course , what you don 't know is that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart .
so when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago , I tried to make sense of that .
I researched how each and every bus route moved through the city , nice and logical , every bus route a separate line .
I 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and Westmoreland Street .
third , adapting to rising seas .
there are no quick fixes .
okay , let me just say , there 's some good news .
I don 't know if you can get that here . ( laughter ) So , zizzing away , and so - ( Laughter ) - And for every one - I know , I drew this myself . thank you .
but I got a little bad news for you folks . I got some bad news .
but it wasn 't until we tested it in people that we actually knew .
and three out of the four drugs we give you if you get cancer fail . and this is personal to me .
so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous .
fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States .
right ? when I got these results , I started talking to doctors , and they told me not to tell anyone , and my reaction is , " Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease ? "
and in biology , the numbers are even better .
I 've been around the early web . I 've been around the early creative commons world , and there 's four things that all of these share , which is , they 're all really simple .
it doesn 't actually do what it says on the tin .
we 've got to reveal the dangers in the product .
we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive .
if we look at al Qaeda . Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of .
they were effectively [ doing ] something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world , where there 's poverty , ignorance and injustice .
what I 'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently .
but it 's not an easy road . after the bomb , the victims are not into this .
what if the bombs are just simply wake @-@ up calls for us ?
I didn 't have the tools . I lacked the experience .
more precisely , the timber yard of a hardware store .
what else do we need ?
what else do tradies love ?
Tradies especially , and I 'm a tradie myself , we love egg and bacon rolls .
there 's counselors , there 's people who have gone through mental health .
we 've done events for men 's sheds , so the high rate of suicide is really high for older men .
we need to do events before 9am , which most of our brekkies are , and after 5 PM .
here 's some sobering statistics just to give you an idea .
they certainly do .
it 's because perception is grounded in our experience .
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being .
that 's actually what an experiment is .
the first step was to ask a question .
now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simulating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
I am very , very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're reflecting on my glasses .
I have listened to the three previous speakers , and guess what happened ?
they are throwing large sums of money for primary health , for primary education , for food relief .
there you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television .
it may have jeopardized short @-@ term sales , but it builds lasting , long @-@ term loyalty based on shared values .
Nextpedition turns the trip into a game , with surprising twists and turns along the way .
but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonderland .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
I 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
if you include Internet telephony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
it 's actually about three percent .
and then finally , the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen : the export @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio .
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error .
a second reason has to do with peer pressure .
he 's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
when you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants , the answer is about 24 percent . that 's their guess .
" foreign aid is the most aid to poor people , " is about the most home @-@ biased thing you can find .
" look what they 've been hiding from you , " he said .
and they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
that was not my intention . I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book .
slightly embarrassing admission : even when I was a kid , I used to have these little spy books , and I would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down .
our printing press is the Internet . our coffee houses are social networks .
so that 's why we 're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
and it 's getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that 's great . we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems .
so there 's a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there 's a few more coming on board .
in America , you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act .
when I got to the - For the next four , five years , I was held in four different children 's homes .
this is from an anti @-@ gay website , where they said gays are " worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices . "
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity .
and what they 've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you .
for some participants , we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands .
it was usually too hot , too stuffy or just too smelly , and my father would not let us use the air conditioner .
so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop .
we need to look for something else , and we 've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut .
that 's the first line of defense for the body .
what it is , it 's a lamination of two different metals together .
and grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system .
my initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
they get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know @-@ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
what I and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional MRI brain scanner .
( laughter ) " What ' tis to love ? " Shakespeare said .
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
but anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them .
as one businessman in New York said to me , " Anything she liked , I liked . "
you know , if you 're just sleeping with somebody casually , you don 't really care if they 're sleeping with somebody else .
but my most important question was always the same .
in fact , I had always thought it was a series of emotions , from very high to very low .
the kind of part of the mind when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
people live for love .
it 's very slow .
we all know of them , but nevertheless -- the Arabs say , " The dogs may bark , but the caravan moves on . "
and I say back into the job market , because this is not new .
the double income family was the standard .
in short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
and it 's going to have an impact .
and I think that the television is like the global campfire .
they tend to be contextual , holistic thinkers , what I call web thinkers .
these three brain systems -- lust , romantic love and attachment -- don 't always go together .
with orgasm , then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment .
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you 've made love to them .
in fact , you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else .
and these drugs are going generic .
you fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your " love map , " an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .
he 's not greedy . he doesn 't see skin color .
and I CANNOT remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I CANNOT recall a day without it .
housing 550 babies , this was Ceausescu 's show orphanage , and so I 'd been told the conditions were much better .
my husband approached me very cautiously .
wounds are scary , they are nasty , they are icky , it is why most of us look away when we donate blood .
anger is important ; it is the fire that cauterizes our wounds and lets them scar over and heal .
a front @-@ row seat to their torture chamber ?
in all those years , with that guy chained to my side , I got a lot done .
pretty soon , that little posse started to crowd me out of my own body and my own experience .
so these are my illusion glasses .
they 're a little bigger . they 're a prototype .
all we need is a playing card . any card will do .
wake up .
find me when you can . "
well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
and that can be seen directly through a microscope , and I 'm going to show you some of this today .
there 's the stamen and the pistil . but look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope . that 's the stamen .
you have bits of a volcano . there 's a little bit of a volcano there . you have tube worms .
I couldn 't believe it , and I 'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
and I started taking pictures with my three @-@ dimensional microscopes .
so I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals .
and so with flight , it 's very metabolically costly .
so among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception .
this is considered the Five Blessings .
and indeed , in this image , you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats .
now as I said before , bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly . and why is this ?
it 's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out populations of bats , and scientists have estimated that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats .
they 're going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone .
so through natural selection , over time , mutations , variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time .
so this is where we are right now , but what about the future ?
nobody ? one ? how about 10 years ?
some ? how about 30 ?
this bat is myotis brandtii . it 's the longest @-@ living bat .
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , I want you to smile . thank you . ( applause )
pretty much in every case , that 's how a charity starts .
and I started to research that topic , and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it .
we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it , and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks .
so in 2007 , we brought the campaign across here , and it was , it set the stage for the campaign .
( laughter ) And he said , " I 'm doing it for Movember . " and I said , " So am I. " And I said , " Tell me your Movember story . "
so they identified that as a priority , and then they 've got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic , essentially the same topic .
they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries .
this guy is sitting here working on his computer , and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month , wondering what he 's going to have for dinner .
any of those yes responses are what we called mind @-@ wandering .
it 's slow . it 's antiquated . it 's not using the best technology , and it 's not using the best people .
he joins the Army . the Army gives him a rifle .
but you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin , Missouri , they get that sense of community back .
I 'm , among several other things , an electrical engineer , and that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology , and more specifically designing and building electronics .
wouldn 't that be so cool , and that wouldn 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
speed x 4 .
music : DJ Shadow .
( music ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Pretty cool , huh ? we think so .
so , you can 't get a smaller ham .
what if biologists could only study animals that made people go , " AWW . " right ?
they 're just the right tools for the job .
and so people say to me , " How do I know if a word is real ? "
if you love a word , it becomes real .
if that was the map of all the words in American English , we don 't know very much .
and this is a little @-@ known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
so , this whole time I 've been saying , " The dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . "
it wasn 't really what people needed .
thank you very much for your kind attention .
it 's been fantastic .
you just didn 't want to respond to that person that time .
now , the Sock Puppet , on the other hand , is a totally different animal . the sock puppet isn 't about ambiguity , per se . it 's about identity .
but actually , what I 've been finding is very different from that .
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile .
if I were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ?
now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task .
our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it 's not going to be accurate all the time .
this isn 't a deception @-@ detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging .
my outbox for email is massive , and I never look at it . I write all the time , but I never look at my record , at my trace .
first , lying online can be very dangerous , right ?
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do I want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
while he was there , he traveled to Madrid , where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Vel√°zquez .
and it was such a blow that it woke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , I guess .
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night .
time is unstoppable , and it transforms the event .
now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon .
you need first funds .
( video ) Arunachalam Muruganantham : the thing I saw in my wife 's hand , " Why are you using that nasty cloth ? "
democracy will find it difficult to survive such a development because , in the end , democracy is not based on human rationality ; it 's based on human feelings .
( shooting noises ) The name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you , right ?
well , I 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health .
we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is .
guess what ? their vision is really , really good .
it 's better than those that don 't play .
so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
[ " yellow " ] DB : Red . audience : yellow .
audience : Yellow.DB : good .
they switch really fast , very swiftly . they pay a very small cost .
right ? so these kinds of results really makes two main points .
they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks .
in fact , this is better than a wheel , because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach , you will notice it 's very hard to do .
( sound of running air ) Yes !
this is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere .
the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
I mean , you have the typical European cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity .
you don 't plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework .
I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney .
I had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above , as if it was happening to someone else .
and as we held on and we breathed as one , we knew we weren 't on this journey alone .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward , we would never be the same .
I soaked it up and I thought , " How could I ever have taken this for granted ? "
and she said , " You 're going to get depressed . "
and then it no longer matters what you look like , where you come from , or what you do for a living .
how beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island .
but that 's still not reason for us to disengage , because we 've seen that movie before , in Afghanistan .
waited until it was just the right time , followed him very closely behind .
people have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near , so stock up .
let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon kung fu secret .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
the U.S. government decided to take action , and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of airplanes .
people in our countries here in Europe , in North America , were living with HIV , healthy lives .
the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they 'd license their patents or not .
what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can 't see . it 's the way our eyes are built .
and what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path , and compare the two .
so what have we learned from these animals with a brain that 's the size of a grain of rice ?
so my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim , so to , you know , Indians , and Latinos , everyone , if you 're brown -- ( Laughter ) Here 's my advice to my brown friends .
you see , my siblings and I are the first generation to go to university , so for a family of immigrants , this was kind of a big deal .
in fact , I think my kids will be the first Vikings who will have a hard time growing a beard when they become older .
here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies .
it was a 7.6 magnitude . it was fairly big .
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source , and in this case , these guys were New York food bloggers .
these are the ones that are obviously making sense .
so we were able to call Rita , clear the video , make sure that it had been shot , and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried .
so onto Google Maps we go , and we start looking through literally every single bridge .
the bridge looks like it 's crossing the river east to west .
and that , I guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
no one knew what was there . it was utterly unmapped at the time . we knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
who would have thought that two young guys and a start @-@ up would beat out Google Video ? why ?
so I continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
so for me , it 's a collaboration .
but it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate .
so there you have it : the evolution of a headline .
I have to say , this sounds awesome . ( laughter ) I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so when this came up in my local shop , naturally I was curious about some of the research backing these claims .
so I went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products .
so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at MIT figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
well you can see where this is going .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @-@ year @-@ old standing in that exact spot .
you have Palestine @-@ Loves @-@ Israel .
because you 're not in the Middle East .
and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe [ with ] effort , we can avoid it .
now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name .
the American people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issues , to fiscal issues , are moderate , pragmatic centrists .
so gradually raise Social Security retirement age , maybe only on people not yet born .
if you add Democrats , you add Republicans , you 've got the American people .
you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a Keynesian liberal economist , and these people didn 't go to each other 's weddings , they snubbed each other at conferences .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , Jake .
and I 'm going to say a few words about each one this morning .
the verb is the chassis of the sentence .
so which verbs go in which construction -- the problem with which I began -- depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change .
you can also say , " Biff went from sick to well . "
even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied , they can be stretched and extended .
now , mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type , and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward .
on the other hand , you want the damn guacamole .
the mind that we rely upon to be happy , content , emotionally stable as individuals , and at the same time , to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others .
it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
let 's say this is an anxious thought .
if you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth .
and we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time .
and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind .
but of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito .
in fact , probably adding them all together , the mosquito has killed more humans .
and the answer is this thing .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
it 's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you .
so the males will go out , they 'll look for females , they 'll mate . if they mate successfully , then no offspring .
they only live a few days .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it 's actually ready .
and now what we 're doing is we 're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000 , so we can see this work at big scale .
the males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go .
we 've also done this in agriculture .
that actually wouldn 't be such a problem , because if we were really all going to die , we would put aside our differences , we 'd spend whatever it took , and we 'd find a way to deflect them .
of course , the left wants to take action , but the right denies that there 's any problem .
once again , the same process repeats .
now then we get the Great Depression and World War II .
think of it like this .
it plummets . something is going on here .
the moral electromagnet is turning back on , and nowadays , just very recently , Democrats really dislike Republicans .
so there 's a lot we can do , but who 's going to push them to do it ?
rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy .
I realized I 'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level .
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
so my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books .
an author visited our school , Jack Gantos .
so I loved writing so much that I 'd come home from school , and I would take out pieces of paper , and I would staple them together , and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because I loved using my imagination .
now when I was in sixth grade , the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the Worcester public school system .
( laughter ) And a video camera .
my grandparents , they were in the middle of it .
Mrs. Alisch was there . Mr. Shilale was there . Mrs. Casey was there .
Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said , " I taught him how to read . " ( laughter ) And then something happened that changed my life .
and for him , it 's only his second .
and I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights .
and she responded with , " I 'm here . " ( laughter ) That 's true . you are alive , and that 's pretty good right now .
all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving Celine with no alternatives .
now , I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally @-@ funded research .
sadly enough , the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research .
I 'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , so attractive for these HIV clinical trials ?
however , the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries .
public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate .
the final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me , in six seconds .
and I hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , " Do you get free stuff ? "
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
and I think the answer that they 're looking for is , " If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . "
and when we 're backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
and of course , they were right .
now , sunlight , of course , comes into this .
and vitamin D has had a great deal of press , and a lot of people get concerned about it .
my grandmother grew up in Glasgow , back in the 1920s and ' 30s when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in .
and the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great .
anyway , I came back from Australia , and despite the obvious risks to my health , I moved to Aberdeen .
but I also became interested in research , and in particular I became interested in this substance , nitric oxide .
and I started doing research , and we found , very excitingly , that the skin produces nitric oxide .
it arises in the skin .
and I was interested in these really complex systems .
we put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it , we injected things . we couldn 't turn off the nitric oxide .
now , we 're still collecting data .
but certainly in people older than my wife , this appears to be a more marked effect .
so what we 've next done is we 've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation .
this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure , by which you dilate the coronary arteries also , to let the blood be supplied with the heart .
twenty @-@ two people are graduating , and all 22 are going to college .
" you didn 't shave . " " but sir - " " No , don 't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning .
and you know what , they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant .
she 's the one who feeds me .
Oh yeah , when I don 't feel so good down there , she takes care of me .
and so they said , " Look , let 's take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens . "
and that 's the key to success .
it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low @-@ income areas , because they 're not getting the gift of a good start .
it devastated me when my mother did that to me .
this is the last cycle , and you can see it 's pretty much figured out what its self looks like . and once it has a self @-@ model , it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion .
we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , angst @-@ ridden conversations in this hideout , and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , " Are you coming to bed , honey ? "
I don 't think kids ' movies have anything to do with that .
maybe it 's not just the sparkly dress .
she was a young mother . she was someone who liked to party .
she thinks she 's dreaming , but she 's not .
and she remembers struggling with her mother to the front , crowds and crowds of people , " Take my child ! take my child ! "
I learned about compassion .
last April , I went back to a very strange -- what I called a deranged high school reunion .
what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo , and I don 't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot .
and I called him Luca , which means " The bringer of light , " because he does bring light to my life .
a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world .
we perform a million of these a year in the United States alone .
surgeons are not made either .
surgeons are trained one step at a time .
sages does surgery all over the world , teaching and educating surgeons .
so here 's Allan teaching an English @-@ speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
but for this examination , which is really hard , we have a problem .
because for them it 's not a surgery test , it 's an English test .
and we currently have access to eleven language pairs .
aim for the black dots .
the moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins .
unfortunately , at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends .
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it 's a women 's issue .
he kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures .
thank you .
it 's boring , who cares , and it sucks . "
now , the story that I start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story .
because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium .
the next thing is that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA .
because , you see , DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make .
so now you understand how viruses can attack cells .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
if we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier , we could start by saying , " These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium . "
so a professional science writer would say , " That has to go .
why don 't you say , " Listen , let me tell you a story . "
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
it 's found 31 workers .
everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow .
they 're from multiple agencies .
the people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones .
and they 're looking at how many of the people they 've inducted are available each hour next week .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
let 's make it personal .
she may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn 't need them .
what have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last 20 years ?
these mechanisms , these facilities are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo , they 're controlled by the state .
and for that they have to be able to access state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art markets .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisticated I.T. project ?
not necessarily .
it simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed .
let 's call it national e @-@ markets , NEMs for short .
think of it as a regulated public utility .
so this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums .
this kind of data can become routine .
that 's what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges 20 years ago .
we developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations , and then share their creations with one another .
what do I mean by fluent ?
so young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies , but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
let me show you about what it 's like to code in Scratch .
so , of course , making a fish game isn 't the only thing you can do with Scratch .
and it doesn 't just stay on the screen .
so there 's a new block that says how much video motion there is , and then , if there 's so much video motion , it will then tell the balloon to pop .
( crickets chirping ) ( Shouts ) ( chomping ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) As kids are creating projects like this , they 're learning to code , but even more importantly , they 're coding to learn .
and it 's the same thing with coding .
when you learn to code , it opens up for you to learn many other things .
let me show you an example .
he wanted to keep score .
now those are important skills that aren 't just relevant for coding .
it 's probably not so likely , but regardless of what he does , he 'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned .
I get it .
we bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
at sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn 't want to kiss me without outing myself .
three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
[ " what does equality mean to you ? " ] [ " Marriage " ] [ " Freedom " ] [ " Civil rights " ] [ " Treat every person as you 'd treat yourself " ] It 's when you don 't have to think about it , simple as that .
today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
and a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
visibility really is key .
once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
where exactly does one become a second @-@ class citizen ?
we already are all of those things , and we always have been .
so please don 't greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
thank you .
what is it , then ?
may we all be granted a grace of mercy .
welcome to Doha .
that is my job for the next two years , to design an entire master plan , and then for the next 10 years to implement it -- of course , with so many other people .
my mother has an accent that is so different to my father , and we 're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country .
there are about five or six accents in this country as I speak .
let 's look at today .
but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells , with your genes and your environment , and you print your own personal medicine .
the way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it .
we asked people , " Do you want this action , and to have buildings painted like that ? "
the freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city , while the barbarism of the ' 90s brought about a loss of hope for the city .
we demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city , up to eight stories high , the tallest of them .
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
we built the bright new reception hall that made people , Tirana citizens , think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests .
and finally , this raveling can also lead to more and more damage .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
but actually , if you look at how countries come out on this picture , you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity .
but let 's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA , and I 'm giving them a colored bubble now .
what you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results .
this is the blue bar which is driving costs down .
you go to the next country on the list , Luxembourg , and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea , so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does .
Pisa has transformed that debate , and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany .
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did Hungary .
it didn 't fire its teachers . it changed its education policies and practice . very impressive .
but the test of truth is , how do you weigh that priority against other priorities ?
how do the media talk about schools and teachers ?
but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture .
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success .
high @-@ performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive .
you 've seen Finland doing so well on PISA , but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools .
every school succeeds .
they invest resources where they can make the most difference .
that 's where other forms of research need to kick in , and that 's also why PISA doesn 't venture into telling countries what they should be doing .
and the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems .
it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible .
it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent .
but this is different .
but there 's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity .
to explain what this means and what this thing is , please let me quickly take a couple of steps back .
I ended up in physics by accident .
and it gets even better , because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence .
so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which CANNOT be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system .
so if it 's a cell or a termite or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
the nodes in the network are the system 's components , and the links are given by the interactions .
this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics , biology , computer science , the social sciences , but what about economics ?
in this little example , you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted .
and it has implications for systemic risk .
so we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007 .
OK , so now we analyzed the structure , so how does this relate to the control ?
now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs ' value .
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
we want to contract that gap .
and across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
I don 't know in inches how much that is .
wanting them is one thing .
is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize .
committed sex is premeditated sex .
secondly , we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet , and start moving them around .
( applause ) Number seven : particle accelerator mishap .
a lot of very sober @-@ minded physicists , believe it or not , have had exactly the same thought .
secondly , we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth .
this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn .
scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent .
you know , 10 years ago , or 15 years ago , really , you walk into an astronomy convention , and you say , " You know , there 's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy , " and they 're going to hoot you off the stage .
in 1989 , a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth .
so you say , yeah , well , what are really the chances of this happening ?
but we would have lots of time , if we see it coming .
suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle .
it is the only Germanic language that requires this .
what is the average difference here ?
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
now effectively everything I 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families .
does this have cumulative effects ?
you can put it louder if you can .
and what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world .
and the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin .
and that 's exactly what they do .
this is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task .
and yet , they can find them by tactile discrimination , and they can press it and select it .
we had an animal running on a treadmill at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States , producing the brainstorms necessary to move .
well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world .
there 's a group of people in Kenya .
people cross oceans to go see them .
they jump high . they wear red .
the Maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
this was the crossroad .
it was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life .
they were all in a circle .
just tell me how to get there . "
so I went back and I had to go back to the tradition .
so I went to him very early in the morning , as the sun rose .
the first thing he sees when he opens his door is , it 's me .
he gave me a list of another 15 men that I went -- 16 more men -- every single morning I went and visited them .
they all came together .
I found Wal @-@ Marts , vacuum cleaners , and lots of food in the cafeteria .
I was in a land of plenty .
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya .
I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman .
I wanted to do something .
because there had not been any school for girls .
and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she 's walking to school , the mother is blamed for that .
if she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she 's punished .
Angeline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had .
but she was older . she was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade .
we gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
one hundred twenty @-@ five girls will not be married when they 're 12 years old .
( applause ) I want to challenge you today .
be the first . people will follow you .
be bold . stand up . be fearless . be confident .
and corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself -- or , in the case of our context , your friends , your family or your financiers .
okay ? friends , family and financiers .
but we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it , and we have to admit that .
the first thing is that the big myth , number one , is that in fact it 's not really a crime .
that 's the honest truth .
the point I 'm making is that it is a crime .
today , I 'm focusing on public sector corruption , which the private sector also participates in .
we call them petrodollars . the treasury was bursting with money .
we 're standing today in the Central Bank , and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I 'm going to be speaking about .
okay ? we 're talking about irresponsibility in public office .
the then @-@ Prime Minister went to Parliament to give a budget speech , and he said some things that I 'll never forget .
it went right into my heart .
so the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief .
okay ? two thirds of the money stolen or wasted .
they are the Piarco Airport accused .
it was a constitutional outrage of the first order , and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament .
so that is the kind of outrage of the thing .
those of us who are , sometimes you feel like you 're a little bit on your own doing some of this work .
one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
and there was a lady with a sign , a very simple sign , a kind of battered @-@ looking blonde lady , and the sign was made out of Bristol board , as we say in these parts , and it was made with a marker .
it said , " If you 're not outraged , you haven 't been paying attention . "
if you 're not outraged by all of this , you haven 't been paying attention .
what if -- ( Laughter ) But to make it in these wrongs , you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of that stuff , right ? ( laughter ) But what if this wasn 't the first time ?
and I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council , which is a not @-@ for @-@ profit .
let 's understand , because we lack context .
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something .
only here . so what was the reason for the generosity ?
it 's a not @-@ for @-@ profit blog that I run .
the Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
so I plunged into this struggle , and I asked four questions .
so they hit my question with a question .
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country 's history .
you could see what I applied for and what replies I got .
we need to increase the consciousness .
crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways .
imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator .
so here 's the good news about families .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
in agile , workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time .
so instead of having executives issue grand proclamations , the team in effect manages itself .
so what is Agile , and why can it help with something that seems so different , like families ?
in 1983 , Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England .
in Sutherland 's system , companies don 't use large , massive projects that take two years .
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever .
what worked well this week ?
getting over our fear of riding bikes . making our beds .
what didn 't work well ? our math sheets , or greeting visitors at the door .
you know , the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves , and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids .
kick someone , lose desserts for a month .
it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn 't light up their world for many years to come .
my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom .
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto .
we 'll set a few rules and we 'll stick to them .
the truth is , their ideas are stale , whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively .
we 'll make Sunday meals more important . "
it turns out there 's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal .
so move where you sit . that 's adaptability .
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around .
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible .
just yesterday , we were having our family meeting , and we had voted to work on overreacting .
so one of my daughters threw out , you get five minutes of overreacting time all week .
but then her sister started working the system .
now give us a punishment . okay .
to me that is a certified agile miracle .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) And by the way , research backs this up too .
and I said , " But what if they drive into a ditch ? "
Jim Collins , the author of " Good To Great , " told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preserve the core , they stimulate progress .
so agile is great for stimulating progress , but I kept hearing time and again , you need to preserve the core .
we don 't like dilemmas . we like solutions .
this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right .
and suddenly we were worried , like , do we have a mean girl on our hands ?
do you know where your parents went to high school ?
in fact , he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden .
you don 't need some grand plan . you don 't need a waterfall .
in fact , they need to be able to read discerningly .
and so on . so I suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
( laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
I said , " You won 't believe the children who told me and where they 're from . "
the net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
so what 's my wish ?
it will be called the School in the Cloud .
the lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything 's done from the cloud .
and there was this little girl who was following me around .
that number is hard to visualize .
you 're not even close .
so visible or not , we know this molecule very well .
these are the colors we typically use for them .
and there are four atoms in particular that stand apart from the rest as the main building blocks of life , and they are the same ones that are found in epinephrine : hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .
that 's it .
we 're not talking about two cars that are coming off an assembly line here .
so nature 's molecules are everywhere , including the ones that have decomposed into these black mixtures that we call petroleum .
now , our dependence on them for energy -- that means that every one of those carbons gets converted into a molecule of CO2 .
it is , at its core , a window through which the beauty of the natural world looks richer .
we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet .
anyway , once we made it there , then it 's a game park , as I said , an extinct game park .
again , another one , " That 's a monkey . " " that 's a pig , " etc .
you either don 't know what you 're looking for , or you 're looking in the wrong place , " he said .
there were these three people and me , and I am taking the pictures , that 's why I am not in .
how would you feel if you were me ? you have something extraordinary in your hand , but you are in the middle of nowhere ?
the feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement , of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility , of making sure everything is safe .
here is a close @-@ up of the fossil , after five years of cleaning , preparation and description , which was very long , as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide .
and in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism , who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there .
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child , because you don 't leave anyone with this kind of child , even a minister .
so she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species , known as Australopithecus afarensis .
so , this girl died when she was about three , 3.3 million years ago .
that 's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children , so I think the new fossil fixes this problem .
and the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa .
that 's because we Africans concentrate -- I am from Ethiopia , by the way -- we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere , or from outside .
( laughter ) Hello .
and their eyes would say -- " Nobody ever sees me .
thank you . "
( laughing ) And I 'd be , like , " This is my job . "
and meanwhile , I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band , the Dresden Dolls .
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing .
and meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
asking makes you vulnerable .
at the end of the night , I stripped and let everyone draw on me .
I see them as trust .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
now no sooner - this was in the 1950s - and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum @-@ beating people to protect the animals , than the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed .
they did . they agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage .
it made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions .
when I came to the United States , I got a shock , to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa .
this picture is a typical seasonal grassland .
to prevent that , we have traditionally used fire .
when I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much @-@ vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , I was faced with a real dilemma .
I believe I 've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this .
we 've only explored about five percent of our ocean .
this is South Los Angeles . ( laughter ) Liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
because this time it wasn 't coming up .
I use the garden , the soil , like it 's a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that 's my embellishment for that cloth .
I wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet .
see , they asked me what I wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
( laughter ) My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor .
( laughter ) I was crushed , as if by a trash compactor .
( laughter ) Like a boomerang , the thing I loved came back to me .
we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day .
I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship .
and so if we really want , like Buckminster Fuller said , a world that works for everyone , with no one and nothing left out , then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation .
but it doesn 't seem to be working .
why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer , or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city ?
why has poverty remained stuck at 12 percent of the U.S. population for 40 years ?
and the answer is , these social problems are massive in scale , our organizations are tiny up against them , and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny .
we have one for the nonprofit sector , and one for the rest of the economic world .
so in the for @-@ profit sector , the more value you produce , the more money you can make .
but we don 't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service .
we have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
was 232,000 dollars , and for a hunger charity , 84,000 dollars .
some people say , " Well , that 's just because those MBA types are greedy . "
the second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing .
but we don 't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity .
our attitude is , " Well , look , if you can get the advertising donated , you know , to air at four o 'clock in the morning , I 'm okay with that .
people are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply .
that 's an important fact , because it tells us that in 40 years , the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for @-@ profit sector .
so Disney can make a new $ 200 million movie that flops , and nobody calls the attorney general .
moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons .
so how do we ask this question ?
it 's one thing to believe that flies have emotion @-@ like states , but how do we actually find out whether that 's true or not ?
what can we do ? it 's not so easy .
Valence means good or bad , positive or negative .
so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state .
and a final possibility is that there 's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity , but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD .
but in each fly , we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others , and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity .
so what they 're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive , hardy @-@ looking cattle like that Maremmana Primitivo on the top there to rebuild , over time , with selective back @-@ breeding , the aurochs .
you get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes falcons .
everybody thought is was finished .
now there are 880 . they 're increasing in population by three percent a year .
you know , do you want extinct species back ?
I think that 's , you know , part of how it 'll work .
and they say , " No , no , that 's what it says here in our holy book . "
great news . it drives me nuts that most people don 't seem to know this news .
but it 's heart @-@ stopping . it 's mind @-@ blowing stuff .
that 's what the data is telling us . if the trajectory continues , we get to , wow , the zero zone .
I mean , it 's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away .
so why aren 't we jumping up and down about this ?
so inertia versus momentum .
it 's not going to kill you .
could we really be the great generation that Mandela asked us to be ?
some of you know him . he set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo .
you 're full of surprises , if I may say so .
so , the company back then was doing really well , but you were basically a streaming service for other people 's films and TV content .
you 'd persuaded Wall Street that you were right to make the kind of radical shift away from just sending people DVDs , so you were doing it by streaming .
we were like , " Holy ... ! " -- I can 't say that .
RH : that 's the bitch about the internet -- it moves fast , you know ?
everything around us moves really quick .
so then you have a lot of paranoia about what 's coming next , and that 's part of the founding ethos , is really worrying about what 's coming next .
so that 's an advantage .
I pride myself on making as few decisions as possible in a quarter .
then , of course , the market shifted -- in that case , it was C + + to Java .
we do the opposite , which is : everybody gets all the information .
so what we 're trying to do is build a sense of responsibility in people and the ability to do things .
there 's just -- RH : sure , that 's a big symbolic one , vacation , because most people , in practice , do that , anyway .
and we try not to make it intense , like yelling at each other -- nothing like that .
back in the day , you opened up your algorithm to the world and said , " Hey , can anyone do better than this recommendation we 've got ?
RH : yeah , it was super exciting at the time ; this was about 2007 .
so what we 've done is invest a lot on the algorithms , so that we feature the right content to the right people and try to make it fun and easy to explore .
which ones of these are your best movies ? "
everyone would rate " Schindler 's List " five stars , and then they 'd rate Adam Sandler , " The Do @-@ Over " three stars .
and it works out much better to please people to look at the actual choices that they make , their revealed preferences by how much they enjoy simple pleasures .
but aren 't there risks with this , if this go @-@ only @-@ with @-@ revealed @-@ values approach is taken too far ?
other times , people want to watch very intensive film .
ca : but -- yes , indeed .
RH : in practice , you 're right that you can 't just rely on algorithms .
I think you 're right , which is , when people talk about Netflix , they talk about the shows that move them : " 13 Reasons Why " or " The Crown . "
but what we want to do is offer a variety .
instead , we 've seen great viewing across a whole range -- " Black Mirror " -- we 're filming season five now .
and that was a struggling show when it was only in the BBC .
and if we 're as great as we can be , and we have a variety of moods , then more often , people will choose us .
RH : you know , I think we learn .
I mean , you 've done incredibly well with Netflix , you 're a billionaire , and you spend a lot of time and indeed , money , on education .
RH : sure . right out of college , I was a high school math teacher .
RH : it depends on the kid .
think about it as : with multiple kids , there 's all different needs that need to be met , so there 's not any one model .
well first of all , because I am a maker .
we would like it to become a large , collectively generated database of do @-@ it @-@ yourself information on smart materials .
but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
Jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and didn 't work , so others could study and reproduce it .
her project 's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder .
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
we often tackle problems from unconventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the Internet .
there was basically a factory of industrial machines .
and I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it 's actually kind of fragile .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
I 'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
Chris Anderson : Elon , what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all @-@ electric car ?
ca : I mean , this is a beautiful but expensive car .
ca : so that seems like a win for the consumer .
and they have an expected return on that capital .
em : more from solar than any other source .
it was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one ?
and you have to do that .
thank you so much .
I was in the third year of my seven @-@ year undergraduate degree .
and I believe the answer is yes .
and that is exactly what we found .
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation .
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape .
they kill our livestock .
and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
in 2003 , I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship . no call .
what I have here is a cinder block that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
there 's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis , because they 're picking zero or one .
so they 're smart , but poor .
there 's almost no difference .
the bottom players , you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC .
that 's kind of a mistake together .
they play lots of trials with different amounts each time .
this turns out to be something that 's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at Caltech and learn about .
very complicated . the right brain schematic is the uninformed person , and the left is the informed .
that is , it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first , and then it 's followed by activity in the informed brain .
and by the way , these were trials where their deals were made .
here 's the case where the disagreements occur .
that is , the informed brain seems to be deciding , " We 're probably not going to make a deal here . "
okay , so the next part of this study I 'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa .
now we move the payoffs .
we 're actually going to make the left , left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher .
it 's sprinkled around , but if you average the chimps out , they 're really , really close , within .01 .
the chimps are playing better than the humans , better in the sense of adhering to game theory .
and these are two different groups of humans from Japan and Africa . they replicate quite nicely .
none of them are close to where the chimps are .
now there are three things I want you to see now that I 've described Lesterland .
now , what can we say about this democracy in USA @-@ land ?
here 's point number two .
it 's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland .
I don 't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption .
so here 's the model of government .
now , there 's good news and bad news about this corruption .
one bit of good news is that it 's bipartisan , equal @-@ opportunity corruption .
the chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill , and as he reported back to me , the response was , " Hell no !
if we deregulate these guys , how are we going to raise money from them ? "
this is the root .
but we CANNOT ignore this corruption anymore .
grab that issue , sit it down in front of you , look straight in its eyes , and tell it there is no Christmas this year .
so it 's not that mine is the most important issue . it 's not .
turns out , the analytics here are easy , simple .
irrelevant .
when she said that , I scrambled .
I tried to think , " How do I respond to that hopelessness ?
and what hit me was an image of my six @-@ year @-@ old son .
do you have that love ?
all of us have to act to get it back .
it was made of glass , and this building really helped me to do my job good .
the only thing I had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stuffed for the collection .
and it was on June 5 , 1995 , that I heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck .
this is the dead duck . it flew against the window .
but next to the dead duck is a live duck , and please pay attention .
the live duck mounted the dead duck , and started to copulate .
one is dead , one is alive . that must be necrophilia .
I look . both are of the male sex .
so I -- ( Laughter ) I took my camera , I took my notebook , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior .
you can pass it around .
it 's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison .
this is in Montana , 2008 .
these are pigeons in Rotterdam .
it 's been there for three days , and it 's laying on its back .
but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
so this is the motor .
and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently , you can really change things .
it 's involved in every physical interaction you do every day , every manipulation task , anything you do in the world .
we can create very compelling illusions .
we can do this for all kinds of surfaces and it 's really a lot of fun .
and you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work .
you can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills , at least he would have some sense of progress .
people were not curing cancer or building bridges .
what happened in the Sisyphic condition ?
I said , " How many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? "
so there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA .
I can 't say I enjoy the process .
no , the taste was great .
but then we told them , " Look , this origami really belongs to us .
when you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
now think about kids .
and then we embed elastic .
they had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched .
I 'm biased .
in infrastructure , we 're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec .
and we 're developing a new paradigm for piping .
so this isn 't expensive pumps or valves .
the third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win .
there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena .
and I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots , some black dots , that were a different color .
and I realized , this is it .
and I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking .
and I remember thinking , this is it .
I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers .
and it was friggin ' demoralizing . it was terrible .
I 'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers , when we knew our friends ' phone numbers .
there 's so much information out there .
being a Renaissance man or woman , that 's something that was only possible in the Renaissance .
these are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts .
if we have those facts at our mental fingertips , we 're going to be able to make informed decisions .
she was a 10 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Surrey , England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket , Thailand .
what would you do if your 10 @-@ year @-@ old daughter came up to you with this ?
you say where you 're from , and I say , " Oh , yeah . "
it 's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met .
that 's often the advantage of time .
and it 's not effective if you say , " Well , hold on .
that doesn 't work . that 's just annoying .
in the movies , when computers like Watson start to think , things don 't always end well .
things always go terribly wrong .
for the most part , they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them , curious about everything , thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject .
ladies and gentlemen , the choice is yours .
thank you very much .
if I come over here -- ( Laughs ) He 's smart .
thanks , little guy .
so I can see everything that Romo sees , and I get a robot 's @-@ eye @-@ view of the world .
I 've always wanted a picture of a 1,500 @-@ person TED audience .
so there are all of you through Romo 's eyes .
so I can go in and I can say let 's make Romo excited .
okay . awesome .
you can imagine an eight @-@ year @-@ old girl , for example , who has an iPhone , and her mom buys her a robot .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see Romo doing on the left .
so we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home , that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination .
told him my idea , and you know , he is one of the bravest men in the world , as is General Blair , who , in the end , gave me permission to try this experiment .
I picked one unit -- Charlie Company , Third of the 172nd , they 're mountain infantry -- for two reasons .
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars .
gave them about a nine minute response , and there we went .

Michael Moriarty : specialist Michael Moriarty .
it 's unbelievable .

mm : this little kid is in the middle of a war zone .
probably 20 dead , at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis .
twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad .
I hugged him , of course , and I said , you know , " It 's going to be OK . "
you go and see anybody ?
so building community among those students , very important .
they were in the lab working , and they saw the work , not as schoolwork , but as their lives .
it was that connecting .
because so many students are bored in class .
and most important , giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work .
and then he said something that gives me goosebumps .
he said , " Choice , not chance , determines your destiny . "
choice , not chance , determines your destiny , dreams and values .
take control of your health and get on with your life . "
Don 't you in the front row worry or anything .
all right , I GOTTA gel up .
many of us will have implantables that will actually look real @-@ time at what 's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now .
uncoordinated care today is expensive at best , and it is deadly at worst .
it 's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live .
I was optimizing my life for quality of life , and quality of life for me means time in snow .
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans .
so the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist .
and " What proportion of the Earth is covered in water ? "
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet .
fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .
but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget , and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply , which is great ; we all need water .
we ingest nutrients . we excrete nutrients as well .
in Rwanda , they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners ' bowels .
but there are things to worry about .
this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult , and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me .
either one would kill you ; in only one of them will you find a major lesion .
why does this matter ? well first because , for brain disorders , behavior is the last thing to change .
College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year .
Abed could still turn his wheel left so that I would see him whoosh by out my window and I would remain whole .
but Abed did not slow , and on that xeroxed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , I was left without anger .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the infidelity of a parent or spouse , money inherited ?
were we instead our bodies , their inborn endowments and deficits ?
Abed then rose and turned on the TV so that I wouldn 't be alone when he left the room , and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver 's license .
and so I didn 't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash , Abed did not even mention the bus driver .
( laughter ) I realized society didn 't value my passion .
I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil .
( applause ) On the basis of this result , this is now a procedure that 's done throughout the world , and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery .
they shut down . they turn off .
or at least , they shouldn 't if they 're interested in reproducing . that -- ( Laughter ) is not the way any human being speaks casually .
linguists have actually shown that when we 're speaking casually in an unmonitored way , we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to 10 words .
it 's much less reflective -- very different from writing .
that 's what people did then , speaking like writing .
once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message , then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak .
we see this general bagginess of the structure , the lack of concern with rules and the way that we 're used to learning on the blackboard , and so we think that something has gone wrong .
another example is " slash . "
Sally : " for this summer program at NYU . "
and so , there are always - ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) - there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning .
increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial .
take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20 @-@ year @-@ old today .
two @-@ percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years .
in college , we 've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
and that 0.8 is the big challenge .
( laughter ) Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago .
hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century , maybe for a couple of days , in some cases for more than a week , electricity , running water , heating , gasoline for their cars , and a charge for their iPhones .
when you get older , and you 're all freaked out , whatever , the mentors calm us down .
( laughter ) And sort of measure the impact . stuff like this are things I made , just to sort of understand what these things are .
I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss , and sort of really sad things , and so I wanted to think about something happy .
my hair 's clean -- it 's okay .
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
and I wrote this book , " The Laws of Simplicity . "
it 's a very short , simple book . there are ten laws and three keys .
you know the uni is the most challenging , so number ten is challenging .
so enjoy your sushi meal later , with the laws of simplicity .
because that 's what this is about . I have to simplify this thing .
anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie , which cookie are they going to take ? the big cookie .
strangely , not the big pile . so , I think it 's as simple as this .
basically , it always depends .
it 's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world .
and so , this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here , because life is finite .
and then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more -- that 's very good , too .
you see , the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors , but they didn 't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility .
we shape our destiny , and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories , we 're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system .
let 's look at some data .
but there 's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world .
a child 's Playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from 1996 .
lb : this is my first work , created in November 2005 .
but I see a few people out there who are standing , we 've got some over here , and standing takes more work than lounging .
how could you possibly answer that question ? "
and the number of electrons on your device won 't actually increase or decrease .
and that targeting is based not on a profile of who they are , but of determining something that 's directly relevant to their query or question .
imagine this : you 're a woman , you 're married , you have a kid .
do you think you 'd go home ?
do you think you 'd continue doing the thing that you were doing ?
we wanted to see if we could build machine @-@ learning models that could understand the emotional impact of language .
could we predict which comments were likely to make someone else leave the online conversation ?
and that 's no mean feat .
right now I can see you , and I can gauge how what I 'm saying is landing with you .
thank you .
rather , I build body parts , bionic legs that augment human walking and running .
in 1982 , I was in a mountain @-@ climbing accident , and both of my legs had to be amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite .
NeuroEmbodied Design is a methodology to create cyborg function .
a few years ago , my good friend Jim Ewing -- of 34 years -- reached out to me for help .
the answer was Team Cyborg , a team of surgeons , scientists and engineers assembled at MIT to rebuild Jim back to his former climbing prowess .
you don 't reach down like this ; it 's way too awkward .
because of this neurological embodiment , Jim doesn 't feel like a cyborg .
I got D 's and often F 's in school .
during the twilight years of this century , I believe humans will be unrecognizable in morphology and dynamics from what we are today .
( crashing waves ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
and likely , the harmonics of my voice as it went higher coupled with how loud I was singing recreated either the predatory call of an echolocating bat or a bird , and the spider did what it should .
I love this .
the spider 's responding to its external world in a way that we get to see and know what 's happening to its internal world .
try this with me .
( video ) ( Two overlapping voices talking ) ( Single voice ) Intelligent technology depends on personal data .
I could have put the two voices in different spatial locations , I could have made one louder .
you might still see a patch of red on the screen , because we 're showing increases with larger colored clouds , larger colored areas of red .
but it 's a lot different when we changed the creator 's intent .
changing the music and the sound effects completely alter the emotional impact of that scene .
I believe it is the era of the empath .
but I am looking to create a world where we can care about each other more effectively , we can know more about when someone is feeling something that we ought to pay attention to .
let 's face it : driving is dangerous .
but I had no idea that car was stopping , and I think we can do a lot better than that .
I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other .
you can 't really directly sense the world around you .
you and everyone else . this is the safe way to drive .
actually , no . with cars , it 's not impossible .
that guy could be a problem .
before we address the kidnapping , I 'll first address this buzzard / vulture question I get all the time .
like the ladies in Nashville , the detective thinks that vultures circling in the sky will lead him to the body .
so they have to scavenge .
the turkey vulture that you see here is super cool , because it 's one of the few bird species that can actually smell .
the answer : the tradition has been for researchers to exclude animal scavengers from decomposition studies by placing a cage over the decaying subject matter .
why ?
a lot of times at a crime scene when people see a skeletonized body , they think , " Wow , this has been here for a really long time undiscovered . "
and the skeletonized body could have been there for as little as five days if scavenged by vultures .
the failure to account for vulture scavenging can result in forensic scientists inaccurately estimating how long someone has been dead and then searching through the wrong missing person 's files .
therefore , the goal is to get forensic scientists to focus on vulture evidence and to get law enforcement to consider vulture scavenging and a possible recent death when skeletal remains are found .
the detectives write back and say , " We found the body buried in a shallow grave .
we also found the feathers you mentioned . "
you all get your California Technology License .
and yet , I 've taken that idea and made it my own .
whether it 's nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
and second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they 're really not that way .
so I started this talk talking about the tush , so I 'll end with the bottom line , which is , walk and talk .
and this probably is not what you 're expecting .
let 's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works .
and I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world .
so it 's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here .
that 's between , say at an average use , that 's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that .
so thank you guys .
and storytelling is much like what 's happening right now : I 'm standing up here , the unitary authority , and I am talking to you .
and you may disagree with it , you may think I 'm an insufferable fool , you may be bored to death , but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own head .
( laughter ) He didn 't mean it complimentarily , but Joe put it up in the lobby , he was so proud of it .
but there was another side to that , and it 's where I want to end , and it 's the last story I want to talk about .
we know why .
you were so excited , we just let you go . "
I am powerful , and I am strong .
I put a " + 2 " on his paper and a big smiley face .
is this job tough ? you betcha .
I want to start to show just a few pictures to you , and after I 'll speak .
I must speak to you a little bit of my history , because we 'll be speaking on this during my speech here .
there I learned different things .
we made a lot of trips , financed development , economic projects in Africa with the World Bank .
to build our development , we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything .
she said , why don 't you put back the rainforest that was here before ?
it was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park .
we must protect the forest in this sense .
we tried to do a new presentation of the planet , and I want to show you now just a few pictures of this project , please .
India has no more trees . Spain has no more trees .
and we must rebuild these forests .
the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , even if we reduce them , everything that we do , we produce CO2 , are the trees .
so more than just explosions , chemistry is everywhere .
so when I asked him , he told me three things .
he said first , his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure , about what worked and what didn 't work .
she 's going to be four years old , and anyone who knows a four @-@ year @-@ old knows that they love to ask , " Why ? "
we all were at that age .
they don 't need banks . they got no money in the banks .
how many places in America are going to change ? none .
as a profession , we have to stop this . the science is clear .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
you know , they convinced me . I 'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing , the PalmPilot .
that thing lasted all of three weeks . it was over .
when the safety of America is threatened , we will spend any amount of money .
and so we 've figured out that you 've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does .
man , her office was packed .
well , trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable .
you just had to do things sometimes .
but then , they were very surprised when I graduated from high school .
and then I told them , " I want to be a teacher . "
and I am going to be their help along the way .
I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
I was like , " You need to go to a hospital , the school nurse , something . "
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
laptops , computers , tablets -- you name it , they have it .
and so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question .
however , the moral and political choice is still up to us , as citizens and as voters .
over the past few years , I 've been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
tree .
three together , that 's sparkles .
two women together , they have an argument .
so after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
what 's the plan ?
and it 's working beautifully .
it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
what it doesn 't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it , who don 't enjoy it , who don 't get any real benefit from it .
if you 've got two children or more , I bet you they are completely different from each other .
like , " Which one are you ? remind me . "
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
they 're important because they speak to parts of children 's being which are otherwise untouched .
curiosity is the engine of achievement .
now the reason I say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here , if I can say so , has been to de @-@ professionalize teachers .
you know , you 're not there just to pass on received information .
and people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning .
( laughter ) That 's as old as it gets , I 'm afraid .
but if nobody 's learning anything , she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it .
that 's it .
they should be diagnostic . they should help .
" no , I 'm fine . "
that 's one of the problems of the test .
there 's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin .
the system we have today isn 't fair to them .
the U.S. isn 't number one .
it 's because there 's so much variation in the teaching profession .
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best .
for example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
we also had students fill out surveys with questions like , " Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? "
so it tells us we 're asking the right questions .
a peer review day , and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays .
but we still have more work to do .
in other words , you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous .
and quite interestingly , over something like a 60 @-@ year period , we 're seeing the doubling in life expectancy , over that period where the urbanization has trebled .
this building was wired for change .
and again , the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality .
again , coming back to that thing about the lifestyle , and in a way , the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit .
Hubert was saying , absolutely correctly , " These are the new cathedrals . "
we know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30 .
but this isn 't what twentysomethings are hearing .
as a culture , we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood .
( laughing ) isn 't that true ?
do something that 's an investment in who you might want to be next .
last but not least , Emma believed that you can 't pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
that job offer gave her the reason to leave that live @-@ in boyfriend .
my colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives , what kinds of new routines are possible .
and we concluded a very important insight , which was that as people 's relationships to the things in their lives change , so do their relations with other people .
what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now ?
how might we think differently about our relations with technologies , things that effectively become social participants in their own right ?
Hey guys .
and after about 45 minutes , you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue , so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath .
and he 's like , " I don 't know , but I can show you . "
you can make one of these brushes just on the fly .
you guys are facing that way , so I 'll hook it to this one .
you can kind of sketch with Play @-@ Doh and just Google for game controllers .
hover the mouse over the " take a photo " button , and you 've got a little cat photo booth .
and dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways .
I always add humans to any technical -- if you 're drawing a technical diagram , put a human in it .
like this dad who wrote us , his son has cerebral palsy and he can 't use a normal keyboard .
and a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came , and we 're really excited about that .
and I love the carrot on the turntable .
it 's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own passions , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens .
and I 'm talking about the very end .
I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s .
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
we 've learned an amazing amount .
the first walks around the badly injured toddler completely .
she was rushed to hospital , but it was too late . she died .
as I thought , that 's most of you .
I don 't think it does make a morally relevant difference .
each of us spends money on things that we do not really need .
fortunately , more and more people are understanding this idea , and the result is a growing movement : effective altruism .
according to one estimate , the Gates Foundation has already saved 5.8 million lives and many millions more , people , getting diseases that would have made them very sick , even if eventually they survived .
but you don 't have to be a billionaire .
take , for example , providing a guide dog for a blind person .
that 's a good thing to do , right ?
I 've enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student .
so , when I was in art school , I developed a shake in my hand , and this was the straightest line I could draw .
and then when I got home , I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
now , it looks like you 're doing yourself out of a job , but you 're not . you 're actually making yourself more useful .
so we can begin to see the seed of a completely open @-@ source , citizen @-@ led urban development model , potentially .
probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds , the open @-@ source pioneer , which was that idea of , " Be lazy like a fox . "
in order to do that in 20 minutes , I have to bring out four ideas -- it 's like four pieces of a puzzle .
at this time there was a -- the main question was about English .
I think it 's time that the educationists made their own specs , and I have such a set of specs . this is a brief look at that .
so the same Guardian rebuts , " Are video games art : the debate that shouldn 't be .
so it was not very constructive . ( laughter ) So , I 'm making fun of it , but we discussed this for so many days . you have no idea .
so it 's quite a hefty collection .
that 's a good English sentence .
we 've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary , and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence , well , close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain .
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
there 's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men 's violence against women and children , hasn 't there ?
but on a big scale , we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues , and we haven 't seen that yet , have we ?
and some people will say , " He needs sensitivity training . "
my argument is , he doesn 't need sensitivity training .
if we can make this point that I 'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power , it 's going to change the paradigm of people 's thinking .
there 's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes , coaches , administrators , as part of their educational process .
Penn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach .
so the question is , how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using , and start wasting less of it ?
in fact , it already is .
and we 're not burning anything .
that 's 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well @-@ being but does contribute to climate change .
that 's 40 billion -- with a B -- every year in the U.S. alone .
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future , it isn 't on this slide .
so what are we waiting for ?
but my tiger mother said , " No . "
that is me playing my imaginary piano .
an opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
I turned to books .
books banned in China , of course .
but the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : " you shall honor your father and mother . "
" honor , " I said . " that 's so different , and better , than obey . "
( laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
so because of books , I 'm here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness . "
( applause ) And my question is : how did we get from there to here ?
my mother said that she thought I 'd really rather have a blue balloon .
about 20 years ago , I was asked by my editors at the " New York Times Magazine " to write a piece about Deaf culture .
it felt as valid , perhaps , even as American culture .
then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf .
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
the experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood .
one of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of Dylan Klebold , who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre .
we were sitting in the kitchen . sue Klebold was fixing dinner .
so , my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , I wanted to protect my child from illness .
the scoop was quite a very simple story .
this was what many call immersion journalism , or undercover journalism .
so I built a prosthetic baby , and I went into the village , pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity , and here was the guys who do the killing .
they got themselves ready .
in their bids to kill , I got the police on standby , and they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child .
another key story that comes to mind , which relates to this spirit child phenomenon , is " The Spell of the Albinos . "
I 'm sure most of you may have heard , in Tanzania , children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society .
second official : I don 't even know the place called [ unclear ] .
so I 'm surprised .
reporter : when Metro News contacted investigative reporter Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction , he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen .
how did you end up in jail ? this was just a few weeks ago , I believe , yeah ?
now I 'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild .
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin .
they 're outside the dolphin 's normal repertoire , but they 're easily mimicked by the dolphins .
and the dolphins could get in on the game .
this is a scarf toy , and I 'm trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal .
so I 'm reaching over . she 's got the scarf on her right side .
it 's a society really , that looks a lot like the TED Conference .
and the first one is a college @-@ educated professional , creative type , manager , engineer , doctor , lawyer , that kind of worker .
they 're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at , and they 're actually getting so severe that they 're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement .
we could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip .
let me end it with words from politicians who were similarly distant .
but fortunately , Henry Kramer , who put up the prize for -- that was a one @-@ mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the English Channel , 21 miles .
and when all expenses were paid , the debt was handled , and everything was fine .
so this just summarizes it . " over billions of years , on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable , wonderful and fragile .
AA : when they got bored with their father 's project , they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own .
TM : and I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing , or on the other .
they are imaginary musical instruments .
so here they are .
but the thing about fake news is that we don 't always know what is fake and what is real , but we base our decisions on facts we get from the press and social media .
( laughter ) Manipulations are always sexy .
and it 's on us to find a way to rebuild trust , because fake news destroys it .
so if it 's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren 't home , hey , it 's just batter up .
we 're playing against each other .
you may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison , under the baseball , it 's all commands .
now she 's got the robot doing it .
we use something broadly called model @-@ based design .
twenty milliseconds later , the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball .
what happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being ?
democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power , whether it was of tyrants or of high priests , their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth .
I said , " Why ? these are important decisions .
when riot police have to protect parliaments , a scene which is increasingly common around the world , then there 's something deeply wrong with our democracies .
democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating , debating , taking on public responsibilities for public affairs .
average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to decide on critical matters of the day .
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
now , more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels .
I 'm here to talk about very real killer robots , autonomous combat drones .
now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government , autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both .
this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military , but that directive needs to be made permanent .
we have license plates on cars , tail numbers on aircraft .
thank you .
" why do you say such things , Aboody ? "
I looked it up , and he was right .
it was a few weeks later , we started receiving all these " Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive . "
ninety percent said yes , she 's a traitor .
but you learn lessons from these things that happen to you .
it 's about women themselves .
thank you , everyone .
so , as a reflection of this , we started the Financial Crisis Observatory .
consider the financial price time series , a given stock , your perfect stock , or a global index .
the root mechanism of a dragon @-@ king is a slow maturation towards instability , which is the bubble , and the climax of the bubble is often the crash .
perhaps more surprisingly , the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine , parturition , the act of giving birth , epileptic seizures .
we have applied this theory to many systems , landslides , glacier collapse , even to the dynamics of prediction of success : blockbusters , YouTube videos , movies , and so on .
let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles .
this is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble , a factor of three , 300 percent in just a few years .
they told me , " Didier , yeah , the market might be overvalued , but you forget something .
so we invented a new way of doing science .
we created the Financial Bubble Experiment .
we do our work . we write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time .
but with modern encrypting techniques , we have a hash , we publish a public key , and six months later , we release the report , and there is authentication .
it works in the places where they live , and the work is done to improve their health .
and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals -- what were we aiming at ?
if you get a red cross , well , I 've looked carefully around the room and it 's not going to make much difference to this crew .
this is a big deal , so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
ten percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems .
we arrive in the morning with tools , tons of equipment , trades , and we train up a local team on the first day to start work .
that work continues for six to 12 months , until all the houses are improved and we 've spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house .
( applause ) In 2010 , for example , there were 831 , all over Australia , and the Torres Strait Islands , all states , working to improve the houses where they and their families live , and that 's an important thing .
why ? because that flushes the bug out .
we put washing facilities in the school as well , so kids can wash their faces many times during the day .
we wash the bug out .
( laughter ) And the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug .
they could trap the flies , send them to him in Perth .
kanji Maya , she 's a mother , and a proud one .
OK , perfect .
you 're going to park the light right on top of the chambers .
tourists in glass @-@ bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water .
Larry Brilliant : should we feel good , or should we feel bad that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little ?
let 's review them both . first of all , the megatrends .
there have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
we may see the eradication of guinea worm next year -- there are only 35,000 cases left in the world .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome . ( laughter ) It 's an amazing phenomenon .
the European 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 plan is an amazing breakthrough , something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon .
in the last century -- that 's the one that was seven years ago -- half a billion people died from smallpox : more than all the wars in history , more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world .
and that changed , first with ships when we had the Renaissance , the Scientific Revolution and also the Industrial Revolution .
I call them brothers from another mother .
clearly I have a German mother somewhere .
" what are you carrying ? "
the BRCK is our part to keep Africans connected , and to help them drive the global digital revolution .
in the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
but it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
my father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn 't work .
so in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
many people helped me along the way to get here .
while this sound may be maddening to us , perhaps it 's music to a mosquito 's ears .
you may unconsciously point your body or even sit closer to someone you like .
and mosquitoes are no different .
Gg : so he 's flying at around 600 hertz .
HS : the females are at a much lower pitch . they were around 400 hertz .
and the males do , too . that 's kind of interesting .
and studies have found that if she 's pregnant , she doesn 't even bother .
Greg Gage : the octopus is a rather strange @-@ looking animal that exhibits amazingly complex behaviors .
we 've learned a lot about ourselves from studying marine animals .
that is , he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul , to put down the whole story as a pious fable .
including the return of the large predators , like the groupers , the sharks , the jacks .
and that 's not enough .
because the ocean gives us more than half of the oxygen we breathe , food , it absorbs much of the carbon pollution that we throw in the atmosphere .
we need a healthy ocean to survive .
and fishing near the surface targets mostly species that migrate between the high seas and country 's waters , like tuna and sharks .
now I 'm going to show you a map .
let 's create a giant high seas reserve , two @-@ thirds of the ocean .
despite exercising three or four hours every single day , and following the food pyramid to the letter , I 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome .
you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat , whether we burn it or store it .
what if obesity isn 't the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
when we become insulin @-@ resistant , the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state .
we know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don 't have insulin resistance .
" another joke on old white males . Ha ha . the wit .
many of them fade away . some of them stay .
and of course , that is not New Yorker humor .
within that context , we feel it 's okay .
so within this context , " Asshead . please help " is a benign violation .
" it sort of makes you stop and think , doesn 't it . "
thank you .
I do want to test this question we 're all interested in : does extinction have to be forever ?
in the case of the thylacine , regrettably , we shot every one that we saw .
and normally , when water freezes , as you know , it expands , and the same thing happens in a cell .
if you freeze tissues , the water expands , damages or bursts the cell walls .
what we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation .
that was a miracle , but it was workable .
and just last February , the last time we did these trials , I saw a miracle starting to happen .
we haven 't announced this publicly before .
we found the biggest bird in the world , bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar , and it too was a flesh eater .
by the early 1930s , 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered .
have a look at this bit of film footage .
we went into that pup to see what was in it , and we did find thylacine DNA .
it was a eureka moment . we were very excited .
it has to be a different species . what could it be ?
in other words , if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA , it would be able to be recognized .
when the baby popped up , it was filled with blue @-@ green tissues .
this is a key question for everybody .
at any rate , he led us down this bush track , and there , right where he remembered , was the hut , and tears came into his eyes .
there were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night .
so could we put it back ? yes .
I think gradually , as we see species all around the world , it 's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild .
and I 'm positive it wouldn 't .
but no , I wasn 't born there .
( video ) Barack Obama : ... a single standard for all who would hold power .
compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries , I think you 'll find the Party being near the top in upward mobility .
they interview their superiors , their peers , their subordinates . they vet their personal conduct .
does patronage play a role ? yes , of course .
but merit remains the fundamental driver .
now , Westerners always assume that multi @-@ party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy .
I was asked once , " The Party wasn 't voted in by election .
with a few exceptions , the vast number of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes are still suffering from poverty and civil strife .
it CANNOT be exported . but that is the point precisely .
let us stop telling people and our children there 's only one way to govern ourselves and a singular future towards which all societies must evolve .
and the problem , of course , with all of this is that , with all those paper forms -- and I 'm telling you , we have paper forms for every possible thing : we have paper forms for vaccination surveys .
I can tell you , I often wasn 't really paying attention .
and it actually worked great .
and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology , and we need to scale it now .
that 's less than I used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation .
I can 't show you all the beautiful pictures that we 've taken in the last two and a half years , because I simply don 't have the time .
it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the lowlands . so stop and think for a minute .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .
it 's good for your soul .
at Microsoft Applied Sciences , along with my mentor CATI Boulanger , I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
why phosphorus in particular ?
only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant . eighty @-@ five percent is lost .
the solution I 'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time , even before plants existed on Earth , and it 's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious , very simple , and yet also extremely complex .
it can go beyond the root 's one @-@ millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus .
and over time , this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
now let 's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier .
you 'll see that of this 25 percent , most will benefit the plant , more than 90 percent .
a very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil .
that 's completely natural .
if you recall the graphs I showed you earlier , 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil , and the plants are unable to access it .
on the left side , you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture , with a 100 percent phosphorus dose .
mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
in other words , as I already said , I have invented nothing .
in conclusion , I am a scientist and a dreamer .
I 've been up to its front gates .
and there 's Dan Etete .
but does it just happen over there ?
my first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory .
and that 's how my relationship with corruption really began .
in 1993 , with two friends who were colleagues , Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley , we set up an organization called Global Witness .
now , they 're all people we 've investigated , and they 're all people who couldn 't do what they do alone .
so we spoke to sources in country , trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal .
in 2011 , natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa , Asia and Latin America . nineteen to one .
now let 's go back to the oil and mining companies , and let 's go back to Dan Etete and that $ 1 billion deal .
two thirds of the value of the world 's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws . two thirds .
where ? on the table .
she wanted to add soy sauce to everything .
the message from Peru is clear : nothing bad can happen to us ; only good things will occur when we embrace our diversity .
the message in this second story also emphasizes the idea that cooking can be a tool for happiness and well @-@ being if we embrace our multicultural identity .
Amy was a prolific author .
in addition to two groundbreaking memoirs , she published over 30 children 's books .
you look over your options .
we 're at the beginning of a revolution , I hope , in the way we build , because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more .
we 've discovered that our universe is vastly grander than our ancestors imagined and that life seems to be an almost imperceptibly small perturbation on an otherwise dead universe .
let 's talk about our collective journey into the future with artificial intelligence .
now , AI can generate fake faces and simulate your face saying stuff that you never said .
so all this amazing recent progress in AI really begs the question : how far will it go ?
also , shouldn 't those people who don 't want human extinction have a say in the matter , too ?
we are not alone in these abilities .
what was remarkable is , they explored this keyboard on their own . there was no intervention on our part .
so can you please go ahead ?
Terri Cox : hi , I 'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco , Texas , and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei , two of our Bornean orangutans .
they 're not really used to having cameras here at 8 o 'clock at night .
( applause ) A long time ago in a galaxy - oops , wrong script .
the production version , it uses IP version 6 .
but it leads to what is coming next .
all kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system , and I can 't wait to see these experiments unfold .
what that means is that what we 're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
I can hardly wait .
JC : today . this is the first time you 're talking about it .
JC : right , and do you have a web address that we might look for yet ?
what 's special about it ?
the first is the geophony , or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat , like wind in the trees , water in a stream , waves at the ocean shore , movement of the Earth .
whether or not we understand it is a different story .
I want to end with a story told by a beaver .
it was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate balance .
where do you come from ?
means " Where were you born and raised and educated ? "
( laughter ) And if " Where do you come from ? "
but for the fortunate among us , I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities .
and when I got out of my car , the air was pulsing .
if you think about it , the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times .
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention . ( laughter ) Through bowmaking , I came in contact with part of my heritage .
there are lots of music venues on our map .
awesome .
maybe our challenges lie in city infrastructure : public transportation , affordable housing .
next , and this is a very big one , we need leadership , and we need a strategy .
in music cities , from Berlin to Paris to Bogot√° , music advisory councils ensure that musicians have a seat at the table .
they 're volunteer councils , and they work directly with a designated advocate inside of city hall or even the chamber of commerce .
talk about and celebrate what your city has .
and three , you can use your vote .
changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic .
what 's driving it , and what can we do about it ?
and that 's no mere hypothetical example .
it 's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K.
after all , for all its grim , satanic mills , it worked out pretty well , didn 't it ?
( Beatboxing ) Party , party , yeah .
for example , the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound , which gives me that -- ( Trumpet ) -- flavor .
and today I 'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that 's what 's crucial , how and why they set meaningful and audacious goals , the right goals for the right reasons .
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher , and he said to me , " John , it almost doesn 't matter what you know .
the key results have to be measured , but at the end you can look and without any argument say , " Did I do that , or did I not do that ? " yes . no . simple .
what and how .
NUNA is a health care data company .
well , it 's a personal why .
but every quarter since then , every Googler has written down her objectives and her key results .
he was very thoughtful about how he chose his key results .
they 're not going to be a substitute for a strong culture or for stronger leadership , but when those fundamentals are in place , they can take you to the mountaintop .
do it today .
and while insomnia rarely leads to death , its chemical mechanisms are similar to anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression and anxiety .
and I 'm not a DJ , and I 'm not a musician , so I 'm a little bit scared of that .
why consciousness ?
okay , the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us , and that is , all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them .
the disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot , so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing .
but the second one had an incredible influence , and may still be around , and that is , " Well , if consciousness exists , it 's really something else .
their existence is observer @-@ relative .
that 's the only absolute phenomenon .
so the objection that you can 't have an objective science of consciousness because it 's subjective and science is objective , that 's a pun .
your mental states are identical with your behavior ?
and I 'm probably not going to do it proper service here , but my interpretation of how it works is that Bitcoins are released through this process of mining .
so they 're going into convenience stores , stealing Tide , and a $ 20 bottle of Tide is equal to 10 dollars of crack cocaine or weed .
and , you know , as a parent , especially for the first time , why is he not going to be better than us ?
but he did have one thing .
this is Scarlett .
the design process is completely different .
and now we take this material , combine this with a top @-@ down approach , and build bigger and bigger components .
this is an ambucycle .
it has everything an ambulance has except for a bed .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
we were so scared and we just ran away .
we started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs .
it 's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause .
they 're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives .
but when it does work , our hearing is an incredible , elegant system .
this is not for lack of information ; it 's a lack of integration .
that changed everything . from then on , you could not get these engineers back in the boat .
so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success .
here are two organisms that pull water .
Janine Benyus : Oh really ?
OK , so that 's the healing one .
this is a locust . there can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer , and yet they don 't collide with one another .
ca : Janine , thank you so much .
two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
it was like , " Don 't mess with me .
and they put on an opera all night long .
you saw many examples of my work up there , but it 's one that people know .
Stephano : out of the moon , I do assure thee .
Sebastian : draw thy sword .
Prospera : we are such stuff as dreams are made on .
what , if I were to boil it down , would be the one image that I could hang my hat on for this ?
we survive because our theme song is " Rise Above . "
on the race car in front of you here there are about 120 sensors when it goes into a race .
so during a two @-@ hour race , each car will be sending 750 million numbers .
why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital before we started to look ?
the green is us learning what is normal for that child .
so we have a very ambitious program .
if we did so , they 'd strip us of our clothes .
let 's call this the rhetorical model , where you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand .
great cognitive gain .
there 's no magic wand that 's going to make it disappear .
I don 't have an answer .
this will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
one thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
this problem 's been bugging me for well over a decade .
now , for a period of three years , I gathered data , not just me but also some of my friends , and I used to teach in university , so I forced my -- I mean , I asked my students to do this as well .
these people I still do hang out with .
in fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar @-@ powered clocks project from my youth .
here 's three quick ideas I came up with .
now , when we look at these three ideas together , you 'll notice that the five senses theory doesn 't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
at the top is God , at the bottom is man , mankind , and on the left is the sun , on the right is the moon .
it 's a syllabary . it 's not exactly an alphabet .
Africans of antiquity created civilization , and their monuments , which still stand today , are a true testimony of their greatness .
they 've been looking outward for a long time , yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp , right within them .
AO : you did teach yourself to play , and as a consequence , playing the piano for you , Derek , was a lot of knuckles and karate chops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
this one is " English Country Garden . "
and having said to your dad , Nic , that I would try to teach you , I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn 't allowed near the piano .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
( applause ) But Derek , your ear is so much more than that .
DP : g minor .
most pianists would have a heart attack if you said , " Sorry , do you mind playing ' Flight of the Bumblebee ' in B minor instead of A minor ? " as we went on .
and here is Derek 's take on Art Tatum 's take on " Tiger Rag . "
then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
so that was the goal of my design .
because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn 't afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
that was the problem .
but I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
for example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn 't go with the color of the paper tubes .
in 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
and in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
( laughter ) Well , because we 're not monkeys , we 're fish .
you just need to look at your bellybutton that you share with other placental mammals , or your backbone that you share with other vertebrates , or your DNA that you share with all other life on earth .
but we 're always shown evolution portrayed something like this , a monkey and a chimpanzee , some extinct humans , all on a forward and steady march to becoming us .
without understanding evolution the right way .
about three billion years ago , multicellularity evolved .
Richard Branson : thank you very much . the first TED has been great .
so I 've seen life as one long learning process .
and in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline , and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company , I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline .
RB : well , I like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a Virgin company , they -- CA : they are quality , Richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?
how much -- what 's the total revenue ?
ca : OK .
but nowhere else anyway .
ca : OK . so can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...
RB : yeah ? no , he is a -- CA : well , some people found it wonderful , some people found it completely bizarre .
and it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
ca : and you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that .
( laughter ) CA : to do all this , you must have been a genius from the get @-@ go , right ?
here 's a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net .
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they 're too coddled , they don 't know what they 've got , we 're going to raise a generation of privileged ...
( applause ) So seriously , is there a dark side ?
RB : I don 't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works .
what is that ?
RB : yes , I mean , we 've got -- we 're setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word .
and so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important .
but we 're also trying to make them self @-@ sustaining clinics , so that people pay for some other aspects .
so I would like to thank you for that inspiration , and for coming to TED today . thank you .
we throw it away .
Shakespeare again , from -- I won 't say it -- the Scottish play .
and so , therefore it 's -- Sorry .
so I 'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea .
and what 's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep @-@ deprived .
good . we 'll talk more about that later , about what are your tips .
very important .
and the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated , but they are physically linked within the brain .
the other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate , make worse , the mental illness state .
so what have we got ?
stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable , we can certainly make them healthier , but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness .
our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre @-@ industrial age , when we were almost wrapped in a duvet .
we used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep .
this is a pragmatic response to good health .
if you have good sleep , it increases your concentration , attention , decision @-@ making , creativity , social skills , health .
and I can only recommend that you do the same .
on the field of battle , we are brave and noble warriors .
now I wasn 't trying to be smart .
now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers .
( laughter ) Another thing about primes , there is no final biggest prime number .
but the third thing about prime numbers , mathematicians have always wondered , well at any given moment in time , what is the biggest prime that we know about ?
Don 't freak out .
a random odd number is a lot harder to test .
( laughter ) But ( 2 ^ 13 ) - 1 , ( 2 ^ 17 ) - 1 ( 2 ^ 19 ) - 1 , are all prime numbers .
after that point , they thin out a lot .
word up , L @-@ Dog .
but he didn 't know what the factors were .
he took away one and wrote that number on the board .
it took him , by his estimate , " three years of Sundays . "
this is the largest prime number we knew in 1996 , a very emotional year for me .
( laughter ) But I came to a realization about my own ability .
put simply , in a room full of randomly selected people , I 'm a maths genius .
not years ago , not months ago , days ago .
let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful .
this is the CubeStormer II .
it wasn 't my highlight of 2012 .
BMA has expanded .
stereotypes have been broken .
it shouldn 't take minutes or hours to work .
XL : YEP . you heard it right .
do I shake their hand ? do I turn around and run away ?
but the moment we turned on the laser , like you see now , all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode .
SR : now , in the spirit of the third quote , we want to tell you about a recent project that we 've been working on in lab that we 've called Project Inception .
yes we can .
so what would happen here if , while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box , we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks ?
and yes , it 's an acrylic painting of a man , but I didn 't paint it on canvas .
I painted it directly on top of the man .
that also means you 're probably going to end up with an earful of paint , because I need to paint your ear on your ear .
( audience counting ) Stop . stop , stop , stop .
it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage .
and the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support .
and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable .
and the dams they built in the rivers provided habitats for otters and muskrats and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians .
but here 's where it gets really interesting .
it 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark ?
he used to pick people up here every day .
and so these are questions like , " How can a democracy balance freedom and security ? "
you can see the relationships between the different names themselves .
I could have family and friends read me material , and I could then read it back as many times as I needed .
one of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
I 'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory .
( laughter ) I no longer would be censored .
he then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier .
do you love being read to ?
but I wouldn 't give up the technology , because it 's allowed me to lead a great life .
it 's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos , and it 's probably our oldest scourge .
we 've got 300 million cases a year and over half a million deaths .
now this really makes no sense .
these two environments are totally different , but not only that , they 're both utterly hostile .
so the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite , and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off .
and each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other , they have totally different physiology .
we can do more education , we can try to convince these people to use the nets .
OK . so , the first one I was very timid , and I 'll begin .
and actually , he was . I think he 's dead , though I don 't know , maybe he 's not dead .
do you have that ?
this is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like .
today 's cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
let me show you how most malware is now distributed today .
find these resources . apply them .
for me , I like to call him Frank .
do you have an American Express in your wallet ?
if I did it slowly , it 'd be on your shoulder .
do you remember what it was ?
can I show them ? rather bizarre . is this yours , sir ?
and it can be very impressive to watch them at work .
so you can imagine that building a soft robot is a very different process than stiff robotics , where you have links , gears , screws that you must combine in a very defined way .
you see the camera fixed on top .
and here you see the soft robot in action , and it just goes inside .
it goes around .
this makes it possible to reach many different targets , such as tumors , deep inside a solid organ by using one single insertion point .
but of course , we are not even close to what nature figured out in millions of years of evolution .
this is our life with bees , and this is our life without bees .
these people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush .
tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it 's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes .
humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history , mostly to harvest their honey , which is an amazing natural sweetener .
I was 18 years old and bored , and I picked up a book in the library on bees and I spent the night reading it .
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies .
so I went to work for a commercial beekeeper , a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico .
honeybees can be considered a super @-@ organism , where the colony is the organism and it 's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual bee organisms .
now this society has no central authority .
for example , we study hygiene , where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest , from the colony , and it keeps the colony healthy .
and more recently , we 've been studying resins that bees collect from plants .
so seven years ago , when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse , first in the United States , it was clear that there was something really , really wrong .
the very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts , dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans .
and they 're trucked in in semi @-@ loads , and they must be trucked out , because after bloom , the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape .
how much is it going to take to contaminate humans ?
this is a new class of insecticides .
campaign to have them planted in public gardens , community spaces , meadows .
and we need to diversify our farms .
so let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large @-@ scale change .
and we call that the meme @-@ ome .
so from this , we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection , but luckily , computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space .
and I want to kind of zoom in on that and see if we can get a little more resolution .
this is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment .
now often , when we 're faced with this amount of content , we do a couple of things to simplify it .
and so then we might say , well , gratitude , that was last year .
you don 't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather .
they are home .
very different than nation @-@ states , which are abstractions .
you can run for the Senate out of a different state , but it 's hard to do that as a mayor .
and as a result , mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level , and this is the third feature about mayors , than national governing officials .
they work together in climate change , for example .
Bogota , where Mayor Mockus , when he was mayor , he introduced a transportation system that saved energy , that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways , express buses with corridors .
in that journey from polis to Cosmopolis , we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level .
and the only question is , are you ?
and one night , the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal .
and really , that 's where this case should have ended .
well , why ?
but maybe my work has made me different from most people .
[ ... in the dark ] ( Laughter ) So what is the difference , then , between the way I believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived ?
and it 's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don 't know .
so I don 't mean stupidity , I don 't mean a callow indifference to fact or reason or data .
so that 's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today , but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts ?
how can you ever know all of this ?
so I 've been up here a little over 10 minutes , I 've already lost three papers .
so what do we do about this ? well , the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect , if you will .
one is , how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that 's so clear as a pear or a banana ?
and the fellow said , " Absolutely nothing .
and Luria said , " At the North Pole , there is always snow .
and you can get moral argument off the ground , then , because you 're not treating moral principles as concrete entities .
you would probably begin by saying , " To do what ? "
trust is the response .
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
how to do it ?
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted .
so , of course , with lots of programmable computers and robots around , this is an easy thing to picture .
how many of you know what I 'm talking about ?
raise your right hand .
you guys have very insecure computers , OK ?
the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three @-@ dimensional folding .
so I 've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA .
one of my first questions doing this was : how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA ?
so the net effect of all 250 of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape you 're looking for .
and if it 's the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic .
so he says , " All right . "
and acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it , principally having to do with vision .
it might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States .
( laughter ) Well , it turns out that these probably weren 't bad guys .
and as it turns out , timing is also really , really important .
and finally -- there were the photos .
( laughter ) Once I had all of this information , I was able to create a super profile , so it was still me , but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem .
let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances .
did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper ?
now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle .
( laughter ) So that 's all that happens .
I could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey , and that I should rather drink it .
but let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration .
so what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom , burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol .
thank you very much .
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone , but their presence on the moon 's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive , collective effort .
the Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States .
Apollo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
twelve walked on its surface , of whom Aldrin , following the death of Armstrong last year , is now the most senior .
in the middle years of the century , polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated .
you hear it all the time .
silicon Valley says the markets are to blame , in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs .
we could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the outline of a plan .
we won 't go to Mars , because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth .
but 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution .
if you go to an amusement park and don 't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides , there is now a solution .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
in Washington , D.C. , long lines , queues sometimes form for important Congressional hearings .
so now , for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don 't like to wait , there are companies , line @-@ standing companies , and you can go to them .
for two reasons , I think .
one of them has to do with inequality .
so let 's see what -- Some people are in favor , some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement .
and let 's say it 's a foundation . they will provide the funds .
HM : well , the intrinsic motivation should be to learn .
Elizabeth Loftus : I 'm Elizabeth Loftus , and you said worth a try , so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things ?
you 'd measure how many -- EL : how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them .
HM : to be frank , I just think this is , not to offend anyone , a very American way .
now , what this , even this brief debate , brings out is something that many economists overlook .
I know it . I 'm seeing it .
and the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset .
you can remake your streets quickly , inexpensively , it can provide immediate benefits , and it can be quite popular .
when we started out , we did some early surveys about how our streets were used , and we found that New York City was largely a city without seats .
we closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
but the results were overwhelming .
it was like a Star Trek episode , you know ?
you can have fun with paint .
all told , we 've created over 50 pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city .
but I can 't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods .
I love this because it looks so easy .
after this big expansion , you 've seen no net increase in injuries , and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers .
one Brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on Prospect Park West " the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip . "
so if you dig below the headlines , though , you 'll see that the people were far ahead of the press , far ahead of the politicians .
the bikes are being used six times a day .
quite radical .
but even in modern times , relations have been close at times .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evaporated .
the more Iran got isolated , the more peace there would be .
so according to Indyk , and these are his words , the Iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment .
Tehran was not interested .
it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
there are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
how do you test this ?
tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
it 'll pat his brother on the shoulder , it 'll answer the phone when it rings , it 'll wave goodbye .
some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
but that costs millions of dollars .
he had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
he had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn 't move it .
" now , " I said , " now , look , wiggle your phantom -- your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . "
stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
one of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
so , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
so , if there 's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
normal people say , she 's warm like the sun , she 's radiant like the sun , she 's nurturing like the sun .
well , it 's one or two mutants .
now , none of you is a Martian . how did you do that ?
the patient says , " Well , if it 's metallic and shiny , it doesn 't mean it 's gold .
there were many epidemics there .
after 10 years of working overseas , I was exhausted .
and that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed .
and then a bunch of community activities for changing norms .
yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy .
some of them were new stories .
and for a while they were familiar formats , but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium .
it was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
she captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time .
I double checked the newspapers .
he 's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera , but these things just happen in text .
I think in nonfiction real @-@ time storytelling , there are a lot of really excellent examples as well .
they are the bits that we use to create the structures , the frames , that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation .
and they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
first of all , it 's China 's economic performance over the past 30 years .
I want to be able to do what China 's doing .
what this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy , is we 've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way , and that has its roots in economics .
at its very best , the Western model speaks for itself .
but what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more , something that would be better than what we have right now ?
I would argue the same thing that makes you more Sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life , and that 's living in a walkable neighborhood .
so sustainability , which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability .
doing so isn 't easy , but it can be done , it has been done , and it 's being done now in more than a few cities , around the globe and in our country .
now I 'm head of a biomaterials lab , and I 'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body over time .
it 's hard . it 's durable .
and this led him to propose that material as a new material for intraocular lenses .
and bone is actually quite good at repairing .
and we simplified it a lot , so we got rid of a lot of these steps .
so it creates , in essence , an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
this is a histology slide of what we see when we do that , and essentially what we see is very large amounts of bone .
you can see here a very squishy one and now a material that 's also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness , and it 's no longer brittle .
now 60 years later , the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for , like here , where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall .
about eight years ago , people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower .
within the tower , people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower .
designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven 't had any education in architecture or design .
and with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by , this tower becomes like a living city , a place which is alive with micro @-@ economies and small businesses .
today , they live in this area , approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people , who live in this community of self @-@ built multi @-@ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration , Zita Cobb , the founder of the wonderful Shorefast Foundation , based out of Fogo Island , Newfoundland .
I 'm a writer and artist , and I make work about technology .
( laughter ) And I do these things mostly because I find them completely fascinating , but also because I think when we talk about technology , we 're largely talking about ourselves and the way that we understand the world .
I think there 's way , way more of these .
here 's another thing that 's really big on kids ' YouTube .
this is the very first one I could find .
and the more time you start to spend with them , the crazier and crazier you start to feel that you might be .
so the main way people get views on their videos -- and remember , views mean money -- is that they stuff the titles of these videos with these popular terms .
and so there 's autoplay , where it just keeps playing these videos over and over and over in a loop , endlessly for hours and hours at a time .
and this stuff really , really does affect small children .
it 's like , how much do we really understand -- by agency , I mean : how we know how to act in our own best interests .
so all of these things we 're working to address within this are not going to be addressed just by building the technology better , but actually by changing the society that 's producing these technologies .
HW : James , it 's such an important discussion , and I know many people here are really open and prepared to have it , so thanks for starting off our morning .
I 'd pump him for information , I 'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write .
only months later , I discover who he really was .
he was the China representative for the American Soybean Association .
( laughter ) " Travel the world and have lots of kids . "
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn 't do .
and for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
and then more years pass , and the cancer begins to grow .
this time , there 's new treatments on the horizon .
they 're exotic . they 're experimental .
they 're going to attack the cancer in new ways .
I say , " Keep him alive if you can . "
it was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end @-@ of @-@ life care , and of healthcare for all of us .
and they were readily available .
how can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
the medical professionals too , you out there , you 're in denial too .
in the same span of time , computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude .
meaning , in fact , that farmers are rational and profit @-@ minded just like everybody else .
and that business is agriculture .
we know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market , and the risks of transacting in rural , agriculture markets , are extremely high .
in Africa , small farmers bear the brunt of this risk .
this is a tragic example of arrested development , or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks .
this is powered by low @-@ cost VSAT technology , aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market .
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open outcry , because we don 't think the country 's ready for full electronic trading .
ECx is the market for Ethiopia 's new millennium , which starts in about eight months .
we believe that the stakes are high , but that the returns will be even greater .
Ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value .
about 25 years in total , and then three years ago , I found myself talking to IKEA 's CEO about joining his team .
the second number is six : this is six degrees centigrade , what we 're heading towards in terms of global warming .
now there are 500 cities , nearly , with a million people or more in them .
so think about it .
we will go all in .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
we 've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children 's rights .
thank you .
the battle against malaria is being won , with deaths from malaria down 27 percent , according to the latest World Bank data .
this shouldn 't surprise us , because actually , everybody grows .
foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years .
now , that 's completely changed now .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don 't always succeed , but they try and deliver .
very good . I think you 're secretly saying to your head , probably five and a half percent .
and if I lay sub @-@ Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story , it 's remarkably similar .
twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub @-@ Saharan African growth is slightly better than India .
people with hearing loss often hallucinate music or voices , sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony of an entire marching band .
patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels of serotonin in the brain .
but it 's clear that hallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary perception than we once thought .
the war @-@ loving Amazons , " the equals of men " in courage and skill , were familiar to everyone in ancient Greece .
it was long assumed that they were imaginary , like the cyclops and centaurs .
and , because a female mounted archer could be as fast and as deadly as a male , all children were trained to ride and shoot .
this amazed the ancient Greeks , whose women led restricted indoor lives .
but in later representations , they wielded bows and battle @-@ axes , rode horses , and wore pointed caps and patterned trousers characteristic of steppe nomads .
more than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans , or burial mounds , have been excavated , containing skeletons and weapons .
the women 's skeletons show battle injuries : ribs slashed by swords , skulls bashed by battle @-@ axes , and arrows embedded in bones .
is it possible that the mythic realm of thrilling Amazon tales was a way to imagine women and men as equal companions ?
( laughter ) But I think the dry statistics of what 's known as transit @-@ oriented development only tells part of the story .
second : Regulation .
they 're susceptible to human error .
those have such a wide turning radius , that we have to deploy an enormous amount of pavement , of asphalt , to accommodate them .
or take the critically important wheelchair .
so wherever there 's a stair , there has to be an elevator or a ramp .
now , don 't get me wrong , please -- I am all for pedestrian safety , firefighting and certainly , wheelchair access .
it 's a fear of difference , and architects hear this all the time from their clients : " if I try that new idea , will I be sued ?
so what do I mean by that ?
that , to me , only implies that there 's even more congestion on the roads , frankly .
and if you think that 's outlandish , you 'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity .
all of these ideas , to me , are nostalgia @-@ free .
and I just curdled with jealousy that year , until I hatched my devious plan .
and then I did it .
all of those A 's . ( laughter ) And I got ready to return the book to the drawer , when hang on , some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too .
I don 't understand why I felt so great doing it .
I was never caught .
we know primates do . bluebirds are actually very prone .
I don 't know . I think it cuts very close to the bone , because let 's think about what happens when we feel jealous .
jealousy is exhausting .
when Swann is in his jealous throes , and suddenly he 's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress ' servants , he defends these behaviors .
is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
because she 's blameless ; everybody knows it .
take Tom Ripley , her most famous character .
I mean , we 're all good citizens of social media , aren 't we , where the currency is envy ?
in the eye of a theoretical physicist , the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass , but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution .
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
it surrounds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .
and eventually , the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself .
at first , the first thing I thought was , I want to run away .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
thank you very much .
that 's Europe . " but , yeah .
the nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this , because the word itself , nanotechnology , came from within government .
if the state is thought about in this more strategic way , as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism , because that 's what we 're talking about , right ?
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and I was living on the dark side .
all of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen .
night after night , he took me up on the terrace , on his shoulders , and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me .
we can choose otherwise .
my Geiger counter dosimeter , which measures radiation , was going berserk , and the closer I got , the more frenetic it became , and frantic . my God .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
( laughter ) And she said to me , when I asked her the obvious , " Radiation doesn 't scare me . starvation does . "
the power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative .
they have cultivated a brand of professionalism , business acumen and innovation .
they have invented narco @-@ submarines and boats that are not detected by radar .
when they 're entering a new market , they send a family member to supervise it , or , if they 're partnering with a new organization , they create a family tie , either through marriages or other types of ties .
which is why wonderful organizations like Bridges to Prosperity build bridges in this kind of place -- this is in Rwanda .
in our world of construction , the changes seem positively glacial .
it 's in my blood .
concrete gets a pretty bad name sometimes , but in the hands of people like Rudy Ricciotti here , look what you can do with it .
thank you .
immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
and what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone .
they are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings .
they 're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
they even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
but people are brutally honest with the Internet , and when these leaks started , many people were asking me about this .
and when the leaks started , the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how , when you 've been using search engines , you 've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence .
what am I sending to worry about this ? am I sending naked pictures or something ?
let 's look at that last equation .
now I was getting a little anxious .
my training had started .
" go for it , brother . "
in fact , I 've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven 't quite found theirs yet .
maybe a year passes , nothing .
he 's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
that small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
for young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
what if I had been forced into that same state of waithood ?
what makes his story different ?
he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , " Never . "
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
raise your hand . yeah ?
Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable .
there was no bailout on the horizon .
so I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there .
and I weighed 220 pounds .
we had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments for a long , long time .
it was taking place inside the homes , mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids .
and then came the next stage of the equation .
it was time to push what I called MAPS 3 .
it 's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you , the player , the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
so you can see up here .
now , if we had more people in the room , instead of just wrestling in a closed node , we might reach out and try and grab some other people .
and we have to connect both levels , so if you 're up there , you 're going to be reaching down and reaching up .
this is called the Death Star Configuration .
any science geeks , you get that one .
stand up ! it 's easier if you stand up .
everybody , up up up up up !
Don 't start wrestling yet .
creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node .
we had excitement . as you started to wrestle , maybe you 're starting to win or this person 's , like , really into it , so you kind of get the excitement going .
we had joy . you were laughing , smiling . look at your faces . this room is full of joy .
and speaking of physical connection , you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin , you release oxytocin , you feel bonded to everyone in the room .
thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game .
this is what he had to say .
we will not have a vocal chord left , " Sousa said .
it 's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re @-@ creation of their culture . in that sense , it 's read @-@ write .
a culture which is top @-@ down , owned , where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost .
never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized , never before as concentrated .
so , between 1931 and 1939 , they raised rates by some 448 percent , until the broadcasters finally got together and said , okay , enough of this .
so , we need something different , we need a different kind of solution .
we 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon , elephants , and even turtle nests .
that would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests .
to the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
they published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
take for example the case of lions .
so I created this , the Carnegie Airborne Observatory , or CAO .
this is how we see a rainforest , in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another .
we can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red , and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it .
the canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce .
the 2010 mega @-@ drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe .
this area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil , totally unexplored , almost totally unknown scientifically .
look at this 100 @-@ square @-@ kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners .
so what we 've been doing is using the laser @-@ guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest .
my six siblings and I were good kids , but caused our fair share of trouble .
I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute , both for myself and others in my circumstance .
I inspected the solar panels on our roof . ( laughter ) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop .
could we do the same for transportation ?
we 're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake .
compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
if it is a new paradigm , though , there must be other uses for it .
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
half a billion of us live in megacities .
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge .
so yesterday , I was out in the street in front of this building , and I was walking down the sidewalk , and I had company , several of us , and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks .
you up for that ? okay .
okay . what I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight .
so we need to think about it here .
we want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful .
everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
now , if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain , then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities .
maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain , regardless of its size , especially in the cerebral cortex .
so , a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos .
we are primates , so the correct comparison is to other primates .
and it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
that 's the first time I 've ever played it .
in turn , that regulates everything from breathing rate to heartbeat , body temperature , and digestion .
and it 's not just beautiful .
now the chip is really beautiful , but what can we do with it ?
let me show you .
in that tiny chip , you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection .
we didn 't stop with the lung on a chip .
you can see one right here .
now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them .
we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
and we are living in a unique moment in history .
ships have automation now .
not all of them , but some of them were , because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners , it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience .
and if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries ' carbon emissions , it would come in about sixth , somewhere near Germany .
and in fact , shipping has a role to play here , because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures .
and the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent .
they had good salaries , but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element .
in Gando , there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water , and no school .
for this reason , I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family .
today , not so much has changed .
fundraising was not an easy task .
I even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes , but to sponsor my school project .
I started to build a prototype like that .
and see now , we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings , but we often don 't have so much material .
another factor in Gando is rain .
but for us , the rain is good .
around this half of the country , most of your caves are made of limestone .
the second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .
if you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball , it gets really small , hard and dense .
but the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving , because it 's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that 's slowly sliding down the mountain .
he and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we 've been climbing mountains a long time , but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before .
so in July of that year , we went out on the glacier , and we found a big crack in the ice .
we had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole .
well , cave maps aren 't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels .
to make a cave map , you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave , and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations .
then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings .
there was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier .
it was so cold outside , we actually had to sleep inside the cave .
Brent named this cave Pure Imagination , I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined .
well not too much lives in them because they 're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year .
it 's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years , and it 's just now starting to sprout .
not only would it lift , but it might never return .
someone who is , as the Italians say , " gagootz . "
that 's not going to do anything terrible to him . "
( laughter ) Well , they were happy as could be , because he hadn 't said a rational word in the weeks of observation .
and to their amazement , after it was over , he began speaking like he was perfectly well .
and let me tell you this story .
it had to do with death and disease and lots of other things .
that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus .
and they tried everything they had .
well , I was a grown man who had all of these rituals , and it got so there was a throbbing , there was a ferocious fear in my head .
you 've seen this painting by Edvard Munch , " The Scream . "
and he dug in his heels and said , " No . I know this man better than any of you .
well , the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room will remember " Ruddigore , " and they will remember Mad Margaret , and they will remember that she was married to a fella named Sir Despard Murgatroyd .
( laughter ) But I had something better .
every once in a while , I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional .
things change .
something from childhood comes back to haunt you .
there is redemption .
through this act of immense open @-@ heartedness , he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call " ubuntu . "
without you , I 'm just a guy talking to an empty room , and I spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it 's not the same as this .
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet .
I make an instant decision that I 'll never look at that again .
now these studies are ingenious , but they 're simple .
ancient Egypt had such myths , ancient Babylon , ancient India .
and it stays with the idea that I am this body , I am this physical organism .
but again , there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality .
by 2010 , Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis .
between 1950 and 2000 , the region grows by 30 percent .
there are very important people , business and land assets in Detroit , and there are real opportunities there .
on October 14th , before we discovered it , it made its closest approach to the Earth , within about 15 million miles .
well , I could think of a million things , but there 's what you want and what you can have , and ' Oumuamua was moving away and fading very rapidly .
so this is about all the time we were going to have to study it easily .
now I bet most of you don 't have careers that critically depend on whether or not it 's cloudy last night .
in the case of ' Oumuamua , it reflected more red light , making it look very much like the organic rich surface of the comet recently visited by the Rosetta spacecraft .
we 're part of a much larger environment , and in fact , we may even be surrounded by interstellar visitors and not even know it .
this unexpected gift has perhaps raised more questions than its provided answers , but we were the first to say hello to a visitor from another solar system .
will future technologies like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope help us detect these things sooner ?
JI : awesome , thanks so much . let 's thank Karen again .
Einstein said that " I never think about the future - it comes soon enough . "
industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see , hear , feel a lot more than ever before , generating prodigious amounts of data .
of course , electronic sensors have been around for some time , but something has changed : a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and , thanks to advances in cloud computing , a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data .
they are self @-@ aware , they are predictive , reactive and social .
it 's jet engines , locomotives , gas turbines , medical devices , communicating seamlessly with each other and with us .
it 's self @-@ learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss .
or take healthcare .
if all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken , they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster .
and innovation is disruptive .
it makes products more affordable .
second , there is a concern that in the future , there will only be room for engineers , data scientists , and other highly @-@ specialized workers .
there are people who argue that today 's innovation is all about social media and silly games , with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution .
they 've made our lives healthier and more rewarding .
and the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different .
I had two advantages as I went into the fight .
but then I discovered something .
and I get letters , I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what 's worked for them .
I said , " What kind of trouble did you have ? "
I can 't go on this way , and I 've figured out how I 'm going to end it if I don 't get better . "
and major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken .
chances are , if you 're living on less than four dollars a day , and you 're an amputee , you 've lost your limb in a vehicle accident .
it 's also about human performance .
we see that they squat . they kneel in prayer .
so the second thing we learned , and this leads into my second point , which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user @-@ centric .
do they all get there on time ? the supply chain .
( clicking ) Notice anything about it ?
that 's a homemade noise dampener .
we also saw that our users had modified it in other ways .
and if you look at the knee , it 's got those pointy edges , right ?
we did a lot of iterations , not just around this , but some other things .
and this goes into my last point .
our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user .
not only have I tried four times , but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950 , and it 's still never been done .
it 's an expedition of some 30 people .
and the debate has raged , hasn 't it , since the Greeks , of isn 't it what it 's all about ?
of course there are .
it was a very real moment , with that crowd , with my team .
the three things I did sort of blurt out when we got there , was first : never , ever give up .
that allowed us to watch participants ' consummatory behavior .
in one of the studies , we bring rich and poor members of the community into the lab , and give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars .
they 'll never meet that stranger ; the stranger will never meet them .
he approaches as the red truck successfully stops .
there 's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world , showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse .
Hello , TEDWomen , what is up ?
a lot of people with CP don 't walk , but my parents didn 't believe in " can 't . "
( laughter ) Growing up , there were only six Arabs in my town , and they were all my family .
and I 'm from Jersey , and we are really concerned with being chic , so if my friends wore heels , so did I.
( laughter ) But one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
College was imitating life .
my big break came in 2010 .
and she looked at me and she went , " Five , four , three , two ... "
" yo , is she retarded ? "
the disabled are the largest - Yeah , clap for that , man . come on .
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC .
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology .
what are its tendencies over time ? one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms , which we 've heard a lot about .
and the trick that Richard Dawkins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
this is not on another planet . these are things that are hidden away on our planet .
but a more interesting way , the current way to take the long view , is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective .
those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans .
and if we take the long @-@ term trends of life , if we begin to say , what does evolution want ? there 's several things that we see .
we see the movement from a general @-@ purpose cell to the more specific and specialized .
and we see a drift towards complexity that 's very intuitive .
like those chloroplast cells -- they 're completely surrounded by other life .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co @-@ evolution .
and he was the King of England , and that was the entire wealth of England at the time .
in fact , you can buy , for 50 bucks , a stone @-@ age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago .
it 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas .
that 's the definition of " infinite game . " a finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing .
there was no difference whatsoever . and at the Big Bang , what it expanded was the potential for difference .
that 's what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms .
imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints .
we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .
we want a trillion zillion species of one individuals .
maybe in some ways the fact that what we 're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it .
all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology . this is the infinite game .
that 's what we 're talking about .
you see , technology is a way to evolve the evolution .
and if you play that well , you 'll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone .
but really , the question is , why ? right ?
and you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience , and someone else can pick it up at their convenience .
and the mobile phone , in addition , is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it 's convenient .
so we forget , but we 're also adaptable , and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .
it 's where you expect to find stuff .
I 'm sending money back , and it works like this .
they also write them in Hindi .
and China is a country where you get a lot of fakes .
this is how it 's shifting .
and for the next three decades , I was on and off various diets .
that 's what a thermostat does , right ?
five years after a diet , most people have regained the weight .
at worst , they ruin lives : weight obsession leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
what if we told all those dieting girls that it 's okay to eat when they 're hungry ?
my dad 's the guy with the cigarette .
he 's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT , where I also have a position , and we were talking about cancer .
and Andrew had been doing his own bits of research , and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from studying the literature was that there 's actually a big bottleneck .
so we took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open @-@ source license to anybody that wanted it .
and we had a long list .
I happened to look out the window , and hand on my heart , on the night of this conference -- it was the summertime -- and that 's what I saw , a double rainbow .
how do we do that ?
so , it might not be enough .
we need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
so to conclude , we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago .
and were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park , the music would fade to silence , and the play button would disappear .
to the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp , but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye .
let 's consider the big three : HIV , malaria , tuberculosis .
I 'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today 's vaccines , and that is the need to maintain the cold chain .
a key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry , and when it 's dry it doesn 't need refrigeration .
within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all .
and the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting .
but I also had noticed that it wasn 't working .
SS : Oh , yeah . PM : what was that story ?
PM : and in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you 've learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons .
PM : and you did focus in the book -- and the reason , as you said , in writing it , was to create a dialogue about this .
I met one of them , I was in Beijing .
I looked at them , we went around and introduced ourselves , and they all said their names and where they 're from , and I said , I 'm Sheryl Sandberg , and this was my dream .
PM : have you been surprised by the global nature of the message ?
there is a circle that 's been started for rescued sex workers in Miami .
PM : if you were invited now to make another TEDWomen talk , what would you say that is a result of this experience , for you personally , and what you 've learned about women , and men , as you 've made this journey ?
about taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world .
he shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm .
in the end , I accepted the job without actually having been here .
so , it was just before the time that the Leonardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Met , to New York , to see my new domain .
to see what European sculpture and decorative arts looked like , beyond those Renaissance collections with which I was so already familiar .
and I thought to myself : what the hell have I done ?
there was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and , in fact , if there was any emotion going on , it was a kind of repulsion .
( laughter ) So , I started thinking about why it was , in fact , that I disliked this object so much .
where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy .
there was one who would come as a fairy princess .
it was a Dumbo nightmare . ( laughter ) But something more profound was happening as well .
the label had told me that these pieces were made by the S√®vres Manufactory , made of porcelain in the late 1750s , and designed by a designer called Jean @-@ Claude duPlessis , actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned .
but , that tutu for example -- actually , this is a piece that does dance in its own way .
this is an object which is all about escapism .
and that seems fine .
we 've eliminated , in a sense , that constant of the imagination that these vases represented in people 's lives .
I think it 's beginning to happen .
and it 's based , actually , on a more elevated piece of porcelain .
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war , having just finished the washing up . ( laughter ) He seems also to have forgotten his sword .
I really hope that others , all of you , visiting objects in the museum , and taking them home and finding them for yourselves , will allow those objects to flourish in your imaginative lives .
( laughter ) And that 's what my mom was like when I did it .
then the human waits , until it 's their turn again .
but I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player , and more like a doer that just clicks and works together .
and I thought : how can we make an artificial intelligence model -- a computer , computational model -- that will model some of these ideas of improvisation , of taking risks , of taking chances , even of making mistakes ?
what I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot .
when they talked about it after the task , with the adventurous brain , they said , " By the end , we were good friends and high @-@ fived mentally . "
whatever that means .
so let 's look at a few seconds from this performance , where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises .
this is the modern Middle East , where two millennia after the coming of Christ , virgin births are still a fact of life .
marriage is your ticket to adulthood .
I used to play it on the guitar , you know .
a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states , and all the joys and sorrows that can come one 's way .
but there 's also wicked joy , you can rejoice in someone 's suffering .
mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors CANNOT happen at the same time .
usually , when we feel annoyed , hatred or upset with someone , or obsessed with something , the mind goes again and again to that object .
they are real Olympic champions of mind training .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
so it 's my grandmother 's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest .
so , I 'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impacted the health of women , and where we need to do more .
all three were nonsmokers .
and when these genes are over @-@ expressed , it 's associated with improved survival only in young women .
and now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time .
but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates , in fact , to the basic pillars of management .
how do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business ?
plus I have to pay for the middle office .
improve interpersonal feelings , the more people like each other , the more they will cooperate .
integrators are not middle offices , they are managers , existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate .
these rules , they come from game theory and organizational sociology .
you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the buffers that make us self @-@ sufficient .
you simultaneously improve performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both .
just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
now , when you experience fear , your sympathetic nervous system kicks in .
so you have a rush of adrenaline , your heart rate increases , your breathing gets faster .
( music ) Thank you .
it 's also been a real issue in terms of access .
we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
so why are we fighting it in the classroom ?
so here 's what we can do .
so rather than driving our kids into a classroom , herding them out there at 8 o 'clock in the morning -- I hated going to class at 8 o 'clock in the morning , so why are we forcing our kids to do that ?
then they come into the classroom for some in @-@ person interaction .
they can have discussions amongst themselves .
they can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions .
I wasn 't all that smart , and I would be scrambling , taking notes , and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour .
they can rewind the professor .
so this form of self @-@ pacing can be very helpful to learning .
some are never graded .
and these kinds of technologies really help , the blended model can really help revolutionize education .
the Aakash is 40 dollars .
( applause ) Thank you . thank you . ( applause )
the second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Camden , New Jersey police department .
now , at that time , Camden , New Jersey , was the most dangerous city in America .
so basically , they couldn 't be scaled or transferred to other places .
and every single judge in the United States of America can use it , because it 's been created on a universal data set .
well , I 'm a science journalist and multimedia producer , who has always been fascinated by gross stuff .
but then adults step in , and we tell kids not to pick their noses and not to touch the slugs or toads or whatever else they find in the backyard , because those things are gross .
and that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org.
people online , and sometimes even in real life , were disrespectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
how about from Whiteboy77AGS : " people always need something to ( female dog ) about . "
in a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
at the first bend in the line , it left its course , and crashed into a wall .
ideas are opportunities and innovation .
at eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya 's Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya 's Ideas for the Planet .
for most people , these experiences disappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize .
these can be everyday sensations that aren 't inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical and emotional reactions .
that then stirs up the same feelings of panic and helplessness as if they 're experiencing the trauma all over again .
that 's a score of 6 .
so how would you divide a 4x4 , 10x10 , or 32x32 canvas ?
the degrees of expression appropriate to a given situation can , however , vary greatly across cultures .
in one study , both blind and sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emotion when winning or losing their matches .
chimpanzee laughter looks different from ours , but uses some of the same muscle movements .
scientists have a lot of theories rooted in our evolutionary history .
" how much pain medication are you taking ? "
I looked at my wife , Sadiye ; we did some calculating .
" about 115 milligrams oxycodone , " I responded .
I had been given no warnings , no counseling , no plan ...
what happened next really came to define my entire experience of medical trauma .
the result is that I was launched into acute opioid withdrawal .
the result , put another way , was hell .
I would sweat profusely almost constantly , and yet if I managed to get myself out into the hot August sun , I might look down and find myself covered in goosebumps .
we called surgeons and pain docs and general practitioners -- anyone we could find on the internet , and not a single one of them would help me .
I was simply not the kind of patient they were designed to see .
I took the little orange prescription bottle , I set it on my nightstand ...
( applause ) Thanks for that , that was my response , too .
in it , they teach physicians how to taper opioids in the easier cases , and one of the their recommendations is that you never start at more than a 10 percent dose reduction per week .
( applause ) Why do I believe this ?
I am a data nerd , and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar , that the program works , and if it doesn 't work , we should change the plan .
and in the 2000s , over 7,000 .
we were obviously making a difference .
and all of a sudden , he looked at the back of the room , and he saw his daughter , and he called out his daughter 's name , Michaela , and he said , " Michaela , come up here . "
you can 't make that one up .
and one day , I was thinking about how all data has a location , and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face .
the pictures that I was finding were years out of date , and because of that , it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today .
how much oil is stored in all of China ?
today , it 's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks .
and we 've accomplished close to zip .
here 's Mount Pinatubo in the early ' 90s . that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb @-@ like cloud .
but if you do this , it 's quick .
that 's what the world looks like , under one particular climate model 's view , with twice the amount of CO2 in the air .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes -- much longer than before -- because they 're levitated .
the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece , in their labs .
but here 's a case which is harder to reject .
there 's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
it 's using this as risk control , not instead of action .
many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that .
I 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
and I 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization -- I mean , on steroids -- with the small programs , social and economic .
this socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new , inclusive and more equitable land use policies .
they barricaded the place , and the teenagers were evicted , and the teenagers decided to fight back , not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process .
they were also lucky , they said , because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction , between port authority , airport authority , two city districts , and a review board .
seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
it could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
so to us , I think we 're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that 's also got a sort of musical @-@ like quality to it , an instrument .
so here 's a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
and here is a prototype .
it comes out of the idea of a window .
this is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it 's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
this grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
they 're also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
( laughter ) Thank you .
let 's first begin with a thought experiment .
and so , given this one equation , it 's natural to ask , so what can you do with this ?
another important consequence is goal seeking .
and these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda .
whereas my wife , she calls me the star of her life .
but it 's not true ! we only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds .
these teachers call themselves " pick @-@ up artists . "
everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction .
it is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness .
we 've had to clear land .
forty percent food waste is a major problem .
but that 's really big in the U.K.
they 'd say , " Leyla , how do I make it technically efficient ? "
or , " How do I make it green materials ?
because the problem is with use .
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
building on this strength , they attracted investment and started to process , being able to export higher @-@ value products like starch from cassava .
hence , Saminu left to the city , where he soon realized that life was not easy .
but if we can tap into commercial debt , it is a small number -- only 0.1 percent of all the debt in the world today , 10 cents out of every 100 dollars .
I think it 's reckless to ignore these things , because doing so can jeopardize future long @-@ term returns .
they 're economic issues , and that makes them relevant to risk and return .
and they are really complex and they can seem really far off , that the temptation may be to do this : bury our heads in the sand and not think about it .
CalPERS is another example .
we didn 't have the luxury of pre @-@ recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate .
the more speech you have , the better sounding voice you 're going to have .
RP : so that 's speech synthesis .
I met her when she was nine , and since then , my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice .
what we 've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.
who have donated their voices , and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices .
I want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work .
when his mom first heard this voice , she said , " This is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak . "
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
thirteen years ago , we set ourselves a goal to end poverty .
the aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments , which have fallen for two consecutive years .
it 's a common reaction .
but it took an innocent question from my then @-@ four @-@ year @-@ old daughter to make me appreciate that .
I didn 't have any change to give him , and she was disappointed .
so I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon .
the money wasn 't actually physically printed .
that confidence was based on two pillars .
it was the same elsewhere .
well , this is where Dorothy and the Mango Tree charity that supports her comes in .
Governments have been aiming to get aid to 0.7 percent for years , so let 's set the limit at half of that , 0.35 percent of their income .
the thing that I fear , the only thing that I fear , apart from the fact that I 've run out of time , is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one .
today , money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool .
and 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced .
and as you 're looking at this system , if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight , then bioenergy works in a different way . and we 've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels .
the oil price goes through the floor . that company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil price back up .
now interestingly , the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network .
there were no strangers . right ?
I 've even got this little bit from " Vagina Monologues " I 'm going to do .
and this kid looks me dead in the eye , without missing a beat , and says , " My favorite pajamas are purple with fish .
but I am here to tell you , no matter what your walls are made of , a closet is no place for a person to live .
" well , we 've never been there but we 've heard it 's fabulous . "
you are speaking your truth .
or actively trying to avoid it .
so one of the first things we need is we need an aircraft that can take off and land in small spaces and quickly take you where you want to go .
it has multiple redundant motors and batteries , you can lose one , it will continue flying and land normally .
it 's intelligent and has cameras , lidar and radar , so it can detect and avoid unexpected obstacles .
it 's about 40 kilowatt @-@ hours .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : OK , so when these things first roll out -- right now , it 's a single person aircraft , right ?
ca : yours is .
this thing takes off .
could we do a poll here ?
RL : it 's pretty good .
so you can really wrap a business around that .
the technology need to mature in terms of safety , to get to the safety levels that we expect from aircraft .
RL : my personal view is that ride sharing actually allows you to operate that entire business much more efficiently .
you know , there are millennials that say they never want to own a car .
ca : cool . thank you for that .
so it 's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that underly the Internet .
and so it 's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
and it 's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn 't going to be possible in the few months that they had .
they 're looking for answers to questions , and they want to take action when they 're done , which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this .
in one Saturday afternoon , they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions , but more importantly than that , they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government .
I authored this answer , and a few others .
and I 'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation .
they actually love it .
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the House .
they 're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved , besides voting or signing a petition or protesting .
here , I discovered something obvious : wilderness is our natural habitat , too .
we need these last wild places to reconnect with who we really are .
there is no doubt this is the biggest conservation opportunity in Africa in decades .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions .
and it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for .
and so if you do this , then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in English , but what you 're conveying is really a meaning , the meaning of a sentence in English .
let 's take this sentence : " I told the carpenter I could not pay him . "
now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays , and almost all of that is done in the language domain .
and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English @-@ specific .
and that gives another interesting idea .
and that 's evident here with the slower conduction .
John I saw just last week in the clinic .
but actually it does , but it just doesn 't do it well enough .
but I think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist called Yamanaka .
and I see this as the cornerstone of regeneration , repair and hope .
[ " I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist ; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous . " ] So they didn 't think much of him then .
I think there are two ways you can think about this : as a fantastic 21st @-@ century drug discovery tool , and / or as a form of therapy .
drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this .
that 's straightforward , because that 's what pluripotent cells can do .
but crucially , you can then compare their behavior to their equivalent but healthy counterparts , ideally from an unaffected relative .
that way , you 're matching for genetic variation .
and what you 're looking at , and this is amazing , these are living , growing , motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease .
and again there are two ways to think about this , and they 're not mutually exclusive .
so this is a proof of concept .
so I just want to end with the theme I began on , which was regeneration and hope .
so here I 've asked John what his hopes are for the future .
they are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
and as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
and , in fact , if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around this cluster .
so that was very big .
the second things is very hot .
this is in false color .
and the question is , if it 's not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide .
so , it 's very funny .
they don 't understand why it 's expanding at an ever @-@ increasing rate .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
here is a computer simulation .
I listened and thought to myself , " What are these rating agencies , and why is everybody so upset about their work ? "
rating agencies are rating companies .
the customers of these rating agencies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own ratings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul , not just a trimming at the margins .
well , a country has many gardeners , and one of them is the government , so we have to ask the question , how is a country governed ?
a poster child example was the encyclopedia business .
most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen .
and what I 'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third , and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter @-@ Henderson logic that we 've been talking about .
after my neurosurgery , part of my brain was missing , and I had to deal with that .
we are so close to being able to do this .
but they could be out there , very easily .
but even if we don 't run across it in our lifetimes , we can still think there is one out there , and we 're just trying to get closer and closer to it .
instead , apparently , the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma 's software .
this is the managing director of Gamma International .
as I said , it 's a $ 5 billion industry .
what I thought was most fascinating was they 've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year .
in the United States , where I live , there have been no congressional hearings .
neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
so even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
I collect branding irons that were used to mark slaves as property .
I collect shackles for adults and restraints for adults as well as children .
they were in Africa .
there was something else I realized .
thank you very much .
it 's in a shopping mall , and it sells fish eggs .
it 's a caviar @-@ vending machine .
this is the Art @-@ o @-@ mat , an art @-@ vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists , usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes , in limited edition .
I started doing this on my own .
( laughter ) These are people who don 't necessarily regularly engage with science .
you can kind of tell from their reactions .
this is what that looked like .
and it started to make me think about a couple of things .
but when you open them , you have different rarities of the toys .
I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal .
he 's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
and caregiving itself develops patience -- a lot of patience -- and empathy , creativity , resilience , adaptability .
and a 2012 study of employers showed that deep , flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy .
it 's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch .
now , when we go , fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta , reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24 @-@ hour competition .
they 're psychiatrists .
but in fact , the change is actually already happening .
this is a picture I Instagrammed earlier .
and the difference today is that the gold of today is mobile .
there 's another great African that you 've heard that 's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world .
so , people like to call Africa a mobile @-@ first continent , but actually it 's mobile @-@ only , so while everybody else is doing all of those things , we 're solving the world 's problems .
males have a spiked , barbed penis that they literally stab into the female , and they don 't stab it anywhere near her vagina .
from flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second .
I mean , imagine putting a penis into another penis .
it looks and feels like it sounds : wormwood Scrubs .
was there a neurological cause for their condition ?
the heavy metal door slammed shut behind me .
( laughter ) Over the subsequent months , we tested Joe and his fellow inmates , looking specifically at their ability to categorize different images of emotion .
at the age of 12 months , most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others .
so for example , your mother raises her hands to stretch , and you imitate her behavior .
if you doubt this , try , as I 've done , to renege on a promise you 've made to a four @-@ year @-@ old .
you will find that the mind of a four @-@ year old is not na√Øve in the slightest .
that 's not to say it 's impossible .
it is now clear that the amygdala of mammals , including primates like us , can show neurogenesis .
when you think about it , it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth .
the evidence is actually the other way .
the garter snake , which dines on neurotoxic salamanders , has evolved resistance to salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes as the salamanders themselves .
but the travel options are very limited ; plane tickets cost nearly half of their monthly salary .
that 's two @-@ thirds of all trips taken around the world .
the internet exists in a restricted , arguably manipulated form within China , yet it is massive and has vastly improved the lives of its citizens .
those situations don 't really define themselves more until the second decade of life .
in other words , one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other .
but once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm , they look beautiful .
Jackie , on top of it , was , by virtue of skeletal markings , destined to be six feet five .
now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only 14 , that male puberty is early in this family , because he looks more like a 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
SP : but is this necessarily a bad thing ?
time and again , a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible , irrational , inconsistent with values already held .
few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children .
companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line .
well , imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company .
imagine if this data were open and free , accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike .
and yes , this is ambitious , but there is momentum on this issue , and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum , and it 's just starting on this issue .
you really can make this change happen .
now , a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word .
global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
and I want you to help me do that in this next clip .
now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .
but it didn 't even slow down the animal .
the leg is acting as a foot .
and in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot .
look carefully : this is slowed down 100 times , and watch what it 's doing with the rest of its leg .
you can see it here well on this debris .
when you touched the cockroach leg , what did it feel like ?
they assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) A little better than nature .
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot , and here 's RHex , now , going over those steel -- those rails . no problem !
so here 's RHex with paddles , now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot .
we discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone .
and here is RiSE .
Chris Anderson : the rights of citizens , the future of the Internet .
you 've been called many things in the last few months .
ca : so just to give some context for those who don 't know the whole story -- ( Applause ) - this time a year ago , you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA .
as a sysadmin , you had access to their systems , and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June 's revelations .
when I really came to struggle with these issues , I thought to myself , how can I do this in the most responsible way , that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks ?
they were only tried by a secret court .
the NSA was previously asked by Congress , was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted .
ca : ed , there was a story broken in the Washington Post , again from your data .
in another event , they intercepted all the calls in Washington , D.C. , by accident .
and she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it , but had never seen this before that .
we have a right to privacy .
ca : some people are furious at what you 've done .
the prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe .
our economy is not the enemy .
ca : but it 's alleged that you 've stolen 1.7 million documents .
ca : come here , because I want to ask you about this particular revelation .
I mean , this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months .
we shouldn 't be threatening dissidents .
it 's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here , but I see them .
( applause ) I mean , The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you .
and even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 , 74 shuttle flight , the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so -- one in 35 , one in 40 .
you get lighter and lighter , the force gets on us heavier and heavier .
until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we 're weightless .
we knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times .
and so we protect those .
so I think absolutely , folks do have a right to privacy , and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected .
I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance .
now what you 'll see people say publicly is there is no " but for " case , and so there is no case where , but for that , the threat would have happened .
this is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government , and President Madison would have been proud .
we use the standards , we use the products that we recommend , and so it 's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people 's need to be .
I have this friend who really would like to expand his business .
when people have the knowledge , they can find solutions without having to helped out .
and I went and searched , and this is what I found .
you 're working because you want to change the world .
we 've had a more rapid turnover of companies .
and the microbiomes that have a lot of microbes in common are close to each other .
now , we did study some other species of primate .
and the final group that we studied , all the way on the right , is people living in the USA .
( laughter ) But the other way to think about it is that Americans are like super @-@ captive monkeys .
I 'm looking forward to a future where we have the tools that we need to restore and replenish our microbiomes , and in that world , the monkeys will live happier and healthier lives , and so will we .
in many patriarchal societies and tribal societies , fathers are usually known by their sons , but I 'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter , and I am proud of it .
the neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father .
until the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life .
but when she enters her teens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort .
she is confined under the four walls of her home .
so this brother , he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so @-@ called honor .
she is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them .
yes , I must mention it .
and all these good values , I tried to inculcate in her personality .
the shrimp are just one step on its journey .
is it maybe protecting its siblings ?
Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon .
now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
this is Toxoplasma gondii , or Toxo , for short , because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname .
estimates vary a lot , but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains .
now typically , this doesn 't lead to any overt illness .
the parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time .
he was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who , together with his contemporaries , invented American modern art , and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the 20th century .
it didn 't look all that special from the outside , as I said , but when we walked inside , I was immediately struck by three things : first of all , it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside .
but I wondered , what about when it rained ?
take the Oculus of the Pantheon .
the wireless technologies developed for mobile devices , with some minor modifications , are completely suitable to solve this .
we 'll start off easy .
Bionics has defined my physicality .
technology is inadequate .
I made my height adjustable .
technology had eliminated my disability , and allowed me a new climbing prowess .
next , dynamic interface .
how do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone ?
Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats .
and that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb .
indeed , Bionics is making a profound difference in people 's lives .
we the people need not accept our limitations , but can transcend disability through technological innovation .
the story of Adrianne Haslet @-@ Davis .
Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack .
it is her expression . it is her art form .
we will not be intimidated , brought down , diminished , conquered or stopped by acts of violence .
so a chip , a poet and a boy .
we could call it cluefulness .
he wasn 't sharing in my celebration .
and I said to him , " You know , Aaron , it 's not my field , not my field . "
I had to focus on , what was I going to say to you ?
she started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington , D.C.
I 'm not going to fail that .
and as we have marched , people around the country have begun to say , " Can we do the same thing in our state ? "
and so they developed a platform , which we are announcing today , that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform .
and the basic way this works is this .
now I 've asked you .
thank you very much .
so when I became a fashion model , I felt that I 'd finally achieved the dream that I 'd always wanted since I was a young child .
in my case , for the last nine years , some of my neighbors , some of my friends , colleagues , even my agent , did not know about my history .
here is mine .
many are not so fortunate .
so when I was eight years old , I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries .
Geena Rocero : sure . well , first , really , I 'm so blessed .
[ " give Your Talk : a Musical " ] ( Music ) [ " My Talk " ] ‚ô™ Procrastination . ‚ô™ What do you think ?
now it 's been 14 billion years since that Big Bang , and so it 's got faint and cold .
and those small , little , inhomogeneities , 20 parts in a million , those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos .
but the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger , roiling pot of universal stuff .
Melinda Gates : with those big glasses , huh ?
ca : so , given that this vacation led to the creation of the world 's biggest private foundation , it 's pretty expensive as vacations go . ( laughter ) MG : I guess so . we enjoyed it .
at this stage , we were talking about the poorest , and could you have a big impact on them ?
there was a lot we didn 't know .
our na√Øvet√© is pretty incredible , when we look back on it .
Ma : yeah , in ' 97 , we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world , and we kept saying to ourselves , " Well that can 't be .
I don 't tell them who I am . pair of khakis .
and I kept hearing from women , over and over and over , the more I traveled , " I want to be able to use this shot . "
and I would come back and talk to global health experts , and they 'd say , " Oh no , contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world . "
and so condoms were stocked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.
( applause ) CA : bill , this is your graph . what 's this about ?
we go from 20 million not long after I was born to now we 're down to about six million .
that was eradicated , so that got down to zero .
measles was killing a couple million a year .
that 's down to a few hundred thousand .
we can actually accelerate the progress .
ninety @-@ eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters , and yet , people 's charity , when they see a natural disaster , are wonderful .
these causes have been a bit invisible .
ca : maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big , sad face to get engaged .
you shouldn 't just say , okay , because of that , because we don 't have a perfect record , this is a bad endeavor .
mg : yeah , I 've had a lot of women say to me , " I really don 't think I could work with my husband .
he 's going to listen and be really interested .
but we don 't every minute together , that 's for sure .
I was actually really excited .
mg : that 's what I said , the employees , it went away for them three months after you were there .
Sunday , 11 o 'clock , you 're away from work , what comes up ? what 's the argument ?
BG : because we built this thing together from the beginning , it 's this great partnership .
she 's got a lot of insight .
ca : so , in vaccines and polio and so forth , you 've had some amazing successes .
we do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you 're going to have different failures .
it took three more years to get it than we expected , and then there was no way it was going to get out there .
ca : you 're spending , like , a billion dollars a year in education , I think , something like that .
and we stayed with their family , and we really , really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania .
their children , their six children , the two in the middle were twins , 13 , a boy , and a girl named Grace .
and when we 'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do , Grace was not a child , she was an adolescent , but she wasn 't an adult .
ca : I mean , this is another pic of your other two kids , Rory and Phoebe , along with Paul Farmer .
ca : you 've easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires .
I mean , the beauty of philanthropy is this mind @-@ blowing diversity .
there are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people .
thank you .
so here you see a familiar sight .
they not only look desolate , they feel downright dangerous .
but architects love them .
there 's nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .
our city couldn 't possibly handle any more cars .
and if we had to go up , we had to go up in places where you wouldn 't need to own a car .
well , this was an unbelievably ambitious idea , ambitious because communities had to approve those plans .
my mission was always to create great public spaces .
but I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans .
where Broadway traffic used to run , there are now tables and chairs .
at the other extreme , there are things that move too fast for our eyes , but we have technology that can look into that world as well .
with high @-@ speed cameras , we can do the opposite of time lapse .
we think we know most of the animal kingdom , but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered .
what civilization creates this society ?
the big challenge in front of us .
even , I think , we copy our way to reproduce , you know what I mean , and something of -- oh no , forget it .
and this territory is fantastic .
and here is something : nobody is obliged to be a genius , but everybody is obliged to participate .
that means intelligent people are in this angle . that is intelligence .
from this to here , that , it 's genius .
Ptolemy , Eratosthenes , Einstein , things like that .
because at the vertical of us , if you look like that , " Ah ! my God , there is God . Ah ! God ! "
that means , when your brain is not enough big , when you don 't understand , you go , " Ah , it 's God , it 's God . " that 's ridiculous .
out , more of the horizontal . you are an intelligence .
what , what else we can say about that ? why do that ?
it 's OK . we are in the light .
that 's why we must adapt .
no , you must really understand that .
however , Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade @-@ long rebel war in the ' 90s when entire villages were burnt down .
people don 't realize that .
Gabby Giffords : yes .
she didn 't have much other information .
every injury is different . it 's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable , which is another TBI kind of injury .
PM : after you got married , however , you continued very independent lives .
( laughter ) MK : yeah , you know , legislation is often at a colossally slow pace , but my wife , and I have to admit , a lot of other members of Congress that I know , work incredibly hard .
you 've got to find a replacement for me . "
PM : this is a picture of family and friends gathering , but I love these pictures because they show the Gabby and Mark relationship now .
and Gabby , what 's on the agenda now ?
MK : that 's our political action committee , where we are trying to get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country , and to try to pass some reasonable legislation .
it 's not too difficult to do that .
mountains . gorgeous mountains .
in March of 2006 , police interrogated Brendan Dassey , a 16 @-@ year @-@ old high school student with an IQ around 70 , putting him in the range of intellectual disability .
OK ? you 're nodding .
P2 : and she 's behind you 100 percent no matter what happens here .
P1 : that 's what she said , because she thinks you know more , too .
so by honesty , they meant a confession , and his confession would definitely not end up setting him free .
and I know many people are going to struggle with that term , " false confession , " and with believing that false confessions actually occur .
and I get that .
and the fact is , we can never know precisely how often false confessions occur .
these cases are crystal clear because we have the DNA .
juveniles are more suggestible and susceptible to social influence , like the intense pressure accusations and suggestions coming from authority figures in interrogations .
Brendan : like , if his story is , like , different , like I never did nothing or something .
but it 's certainly possible .
of course , cheating is far from murder , and I know that .
other studies tell the same story .
therefore we must be saved by that final form of love , which is forgiveness . " thanks .
there are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home .
but taken together , I am sorry , I do not see help when I look at that shelf .
specifically , I don 't think we know what parenting is supposed to be .
well , for starters , there has been a major historical change .
now add to this problem something else : we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce .
( laughter ) Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world , couples fight , and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes .
happiness and self @-@ confidence can be the byproducts of other things , but they CANNOT really be goals unto themselves .
these two guys shared a similar vision .
which is more than twice the size of your average novel , and we had to put every single one of those letters in the correct order , without a single typo .
our approach was to think of the genome as the operating system of the cell , with the cell containing the hardware necessary to boot up the genome .
because of the robustness of these technologies , we found that we could readily automate the processes and move the laboratory workflows out of the scientist 's hands and onto a machine .
four hundred parts per million : that 's the approximate concentration of CO2 in the air today .
that 's the challenge we 're facing when capturing CO2 directly out of the air .
turns out , it 's actually significant .
if we make the edges of those petals exactly right , if we control their shape , we can control diffraction , and now we have a great shadow .
that , of course , has to be bigger than my thumb .
it starts wrapped around a hub .
there was an issue at that time with the size of the fonts , the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory .
this looks more like bricklaying than type design , but believe me , this is a good bitmap O , for the simple reason that it 's symmetrical in both x and y axes .
for a certain kind of temperament , there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that CANNOT be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability .
that 's a victory . that 's good , right there .
will they outlive the now @-@ obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market ?
I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray .
I learned so much from her .
there were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life .
one of the works , in fact , so didn 't meet her mark , she had set it out in the trash in her studio , and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value .
in that moment , my view of success and creativity changed .
and he said , " You learn how little you know . "
now , it 's very energy @-@ dense , it produces solid , reliable power , and it doesn 't make any CO2 .
it makes lots of energy .
what should I do ? what can I do ?
it 's a big ring of magnetic coil , superconducting coil , and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this , and the hot gas in the middle , which is called a plasma , is trapped .
you see the laser beam and the pellet in the center .
now , that 's not quite good enough , because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that , but it was pretty good .
now this is ITER , pronounced in French : EE @-@ tairh .
actually , the science to make those machines was really in time to produce fusion during that curve .
however , there has been a bit of politics going on , and the will to do it was not there , so it drifted to the right .
for example , it took them about three years to decide where to put it .
but you have to compare that to the cost of making Moore 's Law .
so those have a couple of very good advantages .
so when you compress that , the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed , so you 're trying to compress it , but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing .
so finally , most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen , but as a matter of fact , fusion is getting very close .
they said these are pathological curves , and we don 't have to discuss them .
let 's see , first iteration , second , third , fourth .
so in Manghetu sculpture , you 'd see this recursive geometry .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
anywhere you go in the Sahel , you 'll see this windscreen .
he said , " but wind and dust goes through pretty easily .
and then you take this symbol , and you put it back in so it 's a self @-@ generating diversity of symbols .
so all these little PDAs and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa .
we 've started a pilot program in Ghana .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self @-@ organizing algorithms .
science starts with observation , but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence , isolate them , and test them with scientific rigor .
we 're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water .
from the perspective of Shark Attack Mitigation Systems , we 're a biotechnology licensing company , so we don 't make wetsuits ourselves .
and that 's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley .
even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago , we 've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I 'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now .
and the image on the left is from our satellite , and we see buildings are being built .
from water security to food security .
we 'll see crops as they grow in all the fields in every farmer 's field around the planet every day .
if you took the difference between today 's image and yesterday 's image , you 'd see much of the world news - you 'd see floods and fires and earthquakes .
we want to ensure everyone can see it .
in short , we want to democratize access to information about our planet .
you see , this will be an entirely new global data set .
the coldest materials in the world aren 't in Antarctica .
they 're not at the top of Mount Everest or buried in a glacier .
under most circumstances , the energy in a laser beam heats things up .
but why would you want to cool atoms down that much ?
I failed at getting published for almost six years .
imagine trying to use words to describe every scene in a film , every note in your favorite song , or every street in your town .
you need context to tell whether you 're hearing Russian , Spanish , or English .
which is fitting , seeing as today , one in five soldiers develop depression , or post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or both .
and yet , despite how commonplace these disorders are , our current treatments , if they work at all , only suppress symptoms .
thank you .
and she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit , and were helping people learn in a social way .
so I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface .
with this interface , we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games , where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible .
but autism is not a single condition .
in addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism .
and I remember many nights , I would be sitting at home , just , like , concentrating and focusing , trying to feel the Force , and I didn 't feel anything , don 't worry .
but if it were just radar , then we would have this 50 years ago .
you 're going to fry them like if they were in a microwave .
the second thing : machine learning .
they are his heartbeats .
so this white box that you see here is the device , and Zach is turning it on ...
and indeed , today we are working with multiple doctors in different disease categories .
now we all have this feeling that we 're somehow just getting better as a human race , inexorably progressing , but it 's not like we 've evolved into a new species in a century .
Usain Bolt passes him , and as the runners come to the finish , you 'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line .
and then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible .
now , 530 is a lot more than one , and that 's partly because there are many more people training today and they 're training more intelligently .
the record is always trending downward , but it 's punctuated by these steep cliffs .
and because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe , with the galaxies flying away from one another , the scientists who discovered it call it " The Big Bang of Body Types . "
suddenly , anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be , and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships .
the average NBA player is a shade under 6 ' 7 , " with arms that are seven feet long .
these men are seven inches different in height , but because of the body types advantaged in their sports , they wear the same length pants .
okay , and what we 're looking at here , this is Sam 's optic nerve , which is a direct extension of her brain , so I 'm actually looking at her brain as we look there .
that is a huge challenge .
we can look at the fluxes .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
all of those things are emergent properties .
if it does , it 's skillful .
this is the impact of the ozone hole on sea level pressure , so low pressure , high pressures , around the southern oceans , around Antarctica .
we can look at other examples .
the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 put an enormous amount of aerosols , small particles , into the stratosphere .
models are successful at modeling lake outbursts into the North Atlantic 8,000 years ago .
we can look at this across the world .
or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business @-@ as @-@ usual type of attitude .
I was tired of faking normal .
it 's not nearly enough .
so what 's the play if you 've landed here and you 're 50 or 55 or 60 ?
I have had to get off my throne .
if you need to get food stamps , get the darn food stamps .
do what you need to do to go another round .
first of all , for those of you who are not familiar with my work , I create multicultural characters , so characters from lots of different backgrounds .
okay .
obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED .
you guys are a @-@ mazing , by the way .
okay , well , I 'm just gonna answer this really fast , as , like , three or four different people .
AB : yes ?
and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of applause .
what year was it , first of all ?
of course , I could just make up an answer and you wouldn 't know , so I come prepared for that .
I brought with me a book of calendars .
( laughter ) I didn 't mean to look at you , sir -- you were just sitting there .
what year was it , first of all ?
audience : April . AB : April what ?
( laughter ) Good , thank you very much .
there was a gentleman up here who had a 10 @-@ digit calculator .
where is he , would you stand up , 10 @-@ digit guy ?
OK , what I 'm going to try and do , is to square in my head a five @-@ digit number requiring a 10 @-@ digit calculator .
so you can actually , honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size .
now , I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green .
Oh , I did this row already .
six .
Yuck .
( laughter ) Thank you .
let me explain what that is .
( laughter ) Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right , because this is my big finish , OK .
so , without any more stalling , here we go .
next , I do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , so I can say , three billion .
thank you very much .
thank you .
my mother looked at me and she said , " How did they treat you ? "
now , color blindness , in my view , doesn 't mean that there 's no racial discrimination , and there 's fairness .
he is the first person to develop a mathematical calculation for diversity .
now , I also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands that this progress will help them , because they 're expecting us to be great role models .
you see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave , it 's woven into the fabric of America .
so right now , what I 'm asking you to do , I 'm asking you to show courage .
accidents are inevitable .
Mt : sorry . now , one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
much as the Victorians faked their mechanical marvels , we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends .
we give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice .
and now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
( applause ) ( Music ) MT : and that 's it . thank you very much , and thank you , EDI . EDI : thank you , Marco .
why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person ?
it 's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn 't .
but what we found is we had to change .
and he says , " They 're their personnel records . "
the fact that I know something has zero value if I 'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it .
so as a consequence , what we did was we changed the idea of information , instead of knowledge is power , to one where sharing is power .
HW : thank you so much . thank you .
but once your appliances can talk to you , who else are they going to be talking to ?
I can now tell you that the only thing worse than getting a terrible night 's sleep is to have your smart bed tell you the next day that you " missed your goal and got a low sleep score . "
we were seeing what the ISP could see , but more importantly , what they could sell .
SM : so true .
and I had someone write in , I 've had people write in about , can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart 's broken ?
it 's been sampled 547 times .
I do hope that comes back soon .
it runs a risk of being completely bland .
Rockists , who are racist but only about rock music , constantly use the argument to - That 's a real word . that is a real word .
they constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop , and these arguments completely miss the point , because the dam has burst .
so what happens when operating costs are low ?
I think they use interactions to assess density , so when they 're really crowded , they meet more often , and they search more thoroughly .
so the most familiar resource for ants is a picnic , and this is a clustered resource .
they were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up .
now , we 've seen this before in the savings and loan debacle , and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders , and that no honest lender would ever inflate the appraisal , because it 's the great protection against loss .
so we knew again about this crisis .
the Fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals .
and so , while lions are roaming the campsite , the FBI is chasing mice .
thank you very much .
what would you say ?
but I asked him , " What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance ? "
he said , " You listened .
this is what suicide does .
horrible , absolutely horrible .
I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
and my initial conclusion was that they 're just better people .
but that 's completely wrong .
it could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
all she was telling me is that she doesn 't trust her leaders .
we want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
that 's a sane response to war .
that 's what 's so complicated about war .
and trust me , if a room full of peace @-@ loving people finds something compelling about war , so do 20 @-@ year @-@ old soldiers who have been trained in it , I promise you .
it 's hormonally supported .
half a second later , I heard dut @-@ dut @-@ dut @-@ dut @-@ duh .
" Ma 'am , I miss almost all of it . "
he 's not a psychopath .
and he was thinking , " I 'm not dead . "
ordinary people matter .
journalists , scientists , philosophers matter .
fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy doesn 't cook the way that they like their food prepared .
and so we were very happy , thus far .
one of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month .
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren 't making their own .
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water .
that 's the best way to do it .
thank you .
tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you 've worked on .
and what do they do ?
" this is the way it ought to be . "
and B , we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce , then they would embrace it .
what Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying , " This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce . "
right now , we don 't have the option to choose the virtuous t @-@ shirt over the non @-@ virtuous one . so what would it take to do that ?
and we found out that he was Hispanic , he didn 't speak any English , he had no money , he 'd been wandering the streets for days , starving , and he 'd fainted from hunger .
the hour for those past thirty ... "
Rives : my roommates would have the TV on , and this would happen .
( music : Seinfeld theme ) ( Video ) George Costanza : Oh boy , I was up til four in the morning watching that Omen trilogy .
I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap .
half a globe away , a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me , a stranger .
once those images are collected , another expert physician then diagnoses those images and talks to the patient .
these information packets included colors , pixels , geometry and rendering of the disease on the medical image .
then remember those billions of information packets ?
and what happens after the lights go out ?
as I 've traveled around the world , I 've met many thoughtful people who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth for humans to enjoy .
but how could these bright lights have benefited some proto @-@ Firefly ?
we can actually see the gift - it 's shown here in red - as it 's being passed from the male to the female .
his own female responds , " Maybe . "
you might not notice when the first few flames flicker out , but in the end , you 're left sitting in darkness .
now , that 's not to say that smell is not important to people .
he basically went through systematically , showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males , not all the others .
it 's all about culture .
well , we really ought to talk about armpits , and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones .
they simply don 't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits .
it 's going to be difficult , it 's going to be embarrassing , but we need to look .
her nipple is completely hidden by the baby 's head , but what you 'll notice is a white droplet with an arrow pointing to it , and that 's the secretion from the areolar glands .
it 's a very interesting secretion .
and this is a big problem . it 's continuing .
how many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas ?
so we asked ourselves , how many countries do we need to focus on , keeping in mind that the European Union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy ?
this is a slide that shows the herring population in Norway that was crashing since the 1950s .
the fishery comes back .
and it 's not just in Norway .
but in the oceans , we don 't have that war .
in the oceans , biodiversity is not at war with abundance .
didn 't anyone get that ? ( laughter ) Illegal fishing .
illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management I 'm talking about .
what were you eating ?
are you sure that 's what it was ?
we don 't know how to read the sentences .
if you 're going to do a study like that , you can imagine you 'd like to look at lots and lots of people .
so you must be going , " Huh , did you find any unexpected heroes ? "
identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community , and to give strength there , too .
forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right .
which is to say , you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell .
but I was at war with myself , and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche .
we don 't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities , but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences .
one of the artists I met said to me , " We were in training to be not artists but angels . "
and that 's what they did .
( laughter ) But its time has not yet come .
in Russia , the anti @-@ propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets .
in Saudi Arabia recently , two men who had been caught in carnal acts were sentenced to 7,000 lashes each , and are now permanently disabled as a result .
so who can forge meaning and build identity ?
Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights , and for the millions who live in unaccepting places with no resources , dignity remains elusive .
and yet , every step forward is so sweet .
in 2007 , six years after we met , my partner and I decided to get married .
marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence .
in October , it was my 50th birthday , and my family organized a party for me .
I 'm glad we all get cake .
thank you .
so it was the fall of 1902 , and President Theodore Roosevelt needed a little break from the White House , so he took a train to Mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called Smedes .
a few days later , the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in Washington .
wild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters , and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs .
the one brought to Taft 's table weighed 18 pounds .
but even with all this marketing , the life of the billy possum turned out to be just pathetically brief .
the toy was an absolute flop , and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year , and what that means is that the billy possum didn 't even make it to Christmastime , which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy .
our imagination has become an ecological force .
so a brief history of technology in the NFL .
more people watched the game because it was more exciting .
the ball comes off track .
there really wasn 't a whole lot going on .
they signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it .
they signed up because their family said this was important .
and now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts .
I just said it because it sounded right .
" thank you for your service . "
when I first came back from Afghanistan , I thought that if you make it back from conflict , then the dangers were all over .
it keeps playing out in all of our minds .
it plays out in all of our memories .
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me , " What did you do ? "
what I wanted to better understand was what 's behind that , and why " thank you for your service " isn 't enough .
we signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right .
these are the people who I served with , and these are the people who I honor .
these questions are almost universal .
we knew we needed to reimagine what a doctor 's visit looks like , to get kids out of poverty and to give them a fair shot at a healthy life .
in the first two , we returned 1.6 million dollars to 750 families in Boston alone .
this year -- ( Applause ) This year , we 've expanded to nine sites in four states .
or think about medical care .
one mom used her refund for her son to study abroad in Spain .
because here 's what it does well .
it broadens your pool of potential dates beyond your existing social and professional circles .
so , when things aren 't working out , I tend to take a step back , apply my business toolkit to figure out why , and to fix it .
the zero date also gave me a chance to see how they responded to me asking them out .
I figured not everyone would dig my moxie , and I was right .
but we had agreed to meet on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade with a flask of whiskey to watch the sunset , and honestly , it was two blocks from my apartment .
plus , this guy had a podcast , I have a podcast , worst case scenario , we can talk about our podcasts .
he was a lawyer and a writer , and his eyes twinkled when he laughed and they squeezed tight when I kissed him and at some point in the evening , our zero date became a first date .
Don 't treat it like a game , and don 't treat it like a resume review .
it 's finding your person .
good luck .
look at these images .
so let me tell you how we got here .
( video ) Hologram : how did I survive ?
I survived , I believe , because providence watched over me .
SS : turns out these answers were prerecorded in a studio .
so I saw this and began to wonder , can we create a model like this for anyone ?
if you can leverage this kind of passive information , just photos and video that are out there , that 's the key to scaling to anyone .
and here 's the same output model from different angles .
it turns out this problem is very challenging , but the key trick is that we are going to analyze a large photo collection of the person beforehand .
( video ) Daniel Craig : right , but somehow , we 've managed to attract some more amazing people .
George W. Bush : it 's a difficult bill to pass , because there 's a lot of moving parts , and the legislative processes can be ugly .
and what I did exactly was , I let a computer watch 14 hours of pure Barack Obama giving addresses .
SS : so what 's being synthesized here is only the mouth region , and here 's how we do it .
thank you .
basically what this syndrome causes , is that I CANNOT gain weight .
a lot of people think , " Lizzie , how in the world are you saying there are benefits when you can only see out of one eye ? "
I was my parents ' first child .
I credit pretty much everything that I 've done in my life to my parents .
can you guess what that is ?
it starts with a ' B ' . can you guys guess it ?
( laughter ) I am a fun kid , and she 's the one missing out .
what did I do ? why don 't they like me ? "
they sat me down and said , " Lizzie , the only thing different about you is that you 're smaller than the other kids .
you have this syndrome , but it 's not going to define who you are . "
they said , " Go to school , pick your head up , smile , continue to be yourself , and people will see that you 're just like them . "
and so that 's what I did .
I can 't see out of one eye , but I can see out of the other .
( applause ) I wanted to graduate college , and I just finished college .
I wanted to have , lastly , my own family and my own career .
now I want to end , with asking you again .
( laughter ) But being an artist is also a daunting job .
( laughter ) Or a slight sense of unease or maybe downright panic .
and when I wake up from that , I have the most terrible taste in my mouth .
( laughter ) And so , what I like to do is , I like to take images from really remote cultural areas and bring them together .
( laughter ) Literally .
( applause ) What I want to do is create an aha moment , for you , for the reader .
your interaction with an image , your ability to read , question , be bothered or bored or inspired by an image is as important as my artistic contribution .
but there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic .
I 'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father 's cremation .
I 'd watch those same men walking back home every night .
I was infected .
if they launched the first probes just after midnight one August day , then before breakfast same day , they could have colonized the galaxy .
habitability -- that 's the first barrier .
a 2010 study showed that an octopus in captivity can recognize different humans .
evolution doesn 't have space travel as an end goal .
the moon is just the right size : big but not too big .
in his book on primitive culture , he says the heart of religion is what he called animism , that is , the belief in spiritual agency , belief in spirits .
come back when you 're a teenager . "
and it isn 't just ephemeral things like values and personality .
for example , name your best friend , your favorite kind of vacation , what 's your favorite hobby , what 's your favorite kind of music .
I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
the bottom line is , time is a powerful force .
thank you .
now , how do I know that I 'm right about this somewhat confusing poem ?
now , this next poem is older than Armantrout 's , but a little younger than A. E. Housman 's .
[ Wallace Stevens ] Now , the sun in this poem , in Wallace Stevens ' poem , seems so grave because the person in the poem is so afraid .
even nature 's most disgusting creatures have important secrets , but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them ?
remarkably , cockroaches can self @-@ stabilize running over rough terrain .
they 're certainly incredibly damage resistant .
let me tell you a story .
we can see your thoughts create your brain , which is really key to how it works .
well , computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex .
I 'd better think of something clever to say .
SM : vote for 6 , okay ? man 2 : I got you .
it was a complete turnaround from that night in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed .
it was , and feels , monumental .
I just want to read what he said at that inauguration : " we the people declare today that the most evident of truths , that all of us are created equal .
we 're not real people . we are there to inspire .
they are not things to do with our bodies .
nor the unadulterated truth of their mission .
for the past three years , I 've had the privilege of codesigning with my neighbors a space in New Orleans known as Under the Bridge .
( cheers ) ( Applause ) We will be bridging time , we will bridge memory , we will bridge disparity and injustice , and we can 't wait to see you all on the other side .
Oh , they wanted her bland .
Unspirited , un @-@ African , uncultured , under siege in the streets .
Oh , but if they knew .
they would bow every time they saw her .
be their best selves when she was around .
more than used up , walked on , driven through , shot up .
Oh , who can understand her , this winding Niger river of a woman one who is unafraid to tear away only to roam and then become the wind .
she who speaks in gusts and cyclones blasting us back to high ground , high consciousness , she turns and so does the world .
I had done some activism in college , so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing .
I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive , but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever , and we were all arrested .
less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House .
but the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all .
I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk , so let me save you the effort .
but it would be difficult for you to find me in it , because I 'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side .
they are now shaping the world 's stage .
thank you very much .
it 's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of .
and we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10 .
from playing with it , they learn some basic principles about fire , about intake , combustion , exhaust .
let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me , they 're going to learn things that you can 't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys .
these kinds of target @-@ based practices also help kids develop attention and concentration skills , so those are great .
take it apart with your kid , or send him to my school , and we 'll take it apart with them .
( laughter ) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case , digital media .
you 've just broken a law .
this is a great stage for a kid .
and that really gives them a handle on a world in a way that they don 't often have access to .
find a big empty lot , make sure there 's nothing in it , and that it 's on private property , and let them drive your car .
in the middle of my Ph.D. , I was hopelessly stuck .
every research direction that I tried led to a dead end .
that 's called blocking .
we have just 17 links between us .
we 're part of the same family .
so it 's really a fascinating time in the history of family , because it 's changing so fast .
when I teach the history of the English language , I require that students teach me two new slang words before I will begin class .
at some level , we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries , but we 're really not sure who those hands belong to .
to give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting , it occurs right before happy hour .
in the past , some of the winners have been " tweet " in 2009 and " hashtag " in 2012 .
and we have made some questionable choices , for example in 2006 when the word of the year was " Plutoed , " to mean demoted .
here is Samuel Rogers in 1855 who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations that he finds offensive , and he says " as if contemplate were not bad enough , balcony makes me sick . "
in response , the American Heritage Dictionaries include usage notes .
usage notes tend to occur with words that are troublesome in one way , and one of the ways that they can be troublesome is that they 're changing meaning .
American Heritage has that as the first definition .
( laughter ) And then they include a usage note , which is worth looking at .
Ah , the Usage Panel , that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more lenient about this .
now , what I hope you 're thinking right now is , " Wait , who 's on the Usage Panel ?
and what should I do with their pronouncements ? "
but who looks at the front matter of dictionaries ?
there are about 200 people on the Usage Panel .
( applause ) Here 's what we can do for you .
we can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage .
I will be honest with you : I do not like the word " impactful , " but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether " impactful " is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose .
so to be responsible , what I do is go look at usage , which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Books .
it gets in because we use it and we keep using it , and dictionary editors are paying attention to us .
if a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means , it 's real .
that word might be slangy , that word might be informal , that word might be a word that you think is illogical or unnecessary , but that word that we 're using , that word is real .
think of a hard choice you 'll face in the near future .
it might be between two careers -- artist and accountant -- or places to live -- the city or the country -- or even between two people to marry -- you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita .
or whether to donate your life savings to charity .
chances are , the hard choice you thought of was something big , something momentous , something that matters to you .
what makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate .
in any easy choice , one alternative is better than the other .
we shouldn 't think that all hard choices are big .
let 's say you 're deciding what to have for breakfast .
there are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher , and all from the comfort of an armchair .
well , that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity .
if only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers , I 'd be set .
it wasn 't who I was .
suppose the bank , wooing you , adds 500 dollars a month to your salary .
a higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before , but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist .
that 's not the case with options in hard choices .
so now we 've got a puzzle .
the weight of one is greater , lesser or equal to the weight of the other .
you might say that we become the authors of our own lives .
now , people who don 't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are drifters .
and that 's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend .
these were the men I looked up to .
for the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father 's actions .
even as a little kid , I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents ' house in California .
some people go to black @-@ hole resorts where they 'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival .
it 's an art at the frontier between art and science .

and the life of the architect is also amazing .
and this is not easy at all .
they are .
and this is another site in Japan , building the Kansai Airport .
and society is never the same .
and , you know , in some way , you create the essence of the city .
it 's flirting with sound .
this building is the California Academy of Sciences .
the roof is a living roof , actually .
and this is actually New York .
making libraries , making concert halls , making universities , making museums is good , because you create a place that 's open , accessible .
in London : the Shard of Glass .
on this picture on the left , you have the Menil Collection , used a long time ago .
well , this is playing with transparency .
( laughter ) Well , there is very little I can do about that .
in Greek , " beautiful " is " kalos . "
it 's a little older than TED .
and we did . we built her an amazing suit .
she now wants to walk in high heels .
with 3D printing , complexity is free .
these are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper @-@ local manufacturing .
( laughter ) He tells me I 'm in the default option .
question three relates to the concept of engagement .
it is not well known that the tobacco industry significantly relies on child labor .
everywhere else is younger .
in the past year alone , major tobacco @-@ free moves have been made by leading financial organizations in eight different countries .
I think e pluribus unum is global .
the world of community gardens -- most of you have probably seen a community garden .
the next example ? empathy .
twenty @-@ five years ago , when I was a young pup , very optimistic , we wanted to design a park in downtown Oakland , California for the homeless people .
and we said , homeless people can be in the same space as people who wear suits .
and everyone was like , " That 's never going to work .
big scribbles .
and color in the owl for me .
okay , great . so we have a cobalt horse , amber owl , a silver ox , yes , okay , a red donkey , and what was the emerald color ? a rooster .
twenty @-@ three years ago , at the age of 19 , I shot and killed a man .
( applause ) Now , I have some mini TED Prizes , this is the Philips Bodygroom , one for our leader .
NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose , but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others . "
however , when we looked at the survey data , we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords , and the long passwords were a lot more usable , and in some cases , they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords .
they ran the code .
so we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually 1.8 times stronger than those affiliated with the business school .
here 's the number of countries over time that have decriminalized homosexuality .
here is where we would expect everyone to be better off than the richest person alive today .
was Rome 's first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed his civilization 's place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values ?
find out in History versus Augustus .
and Augustus didn 't seek power for his own sake .
as winner of the civil war and commander of the most troops , it was his duty to restore law and order to Rome so that other factions didn 't continue fighting .
and you forgot to mention the intrusive laws regarding citizens " personal lives - punishing adultery , restricting marriage between social classes , even penalties for remaining unmarried .
it makes it harder for women to get pregnant .
they work by stimulating nicotine receptors in the brain and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms , without the addition of other harmful chemicals .
so why should we believe the science ?
can we observe them taking place in the natural world ?
and that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun .
but also because in the ideal case , it 's about laws .
so just because the prediction comes true doesn 't actually logically prove that the theory is correct .
and I have a good example of that too , again from the history of science .
today we would draw the picture more like this , this comes from NASA , and you see the Earth 's orbit is actually quite small .
it wasn 't until the 19th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax .
( laughter ) And Cadell wanted to answer the question , how are mountains formed ?
well , scientists can model it using a computer simulation .
and by that he meant it 's organized because they do it collectively , they do it as a group , and skepticism , because they do it from a position of distrust .
scientists can say no , it 's false .
most of us trust our cars .
it 's not because of the genius of Henry Ford or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk .
we benefit not just from the genius of Benz and Ford and Musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car .
thank you very much .
their target : England , home to more than a million people .
and the churches built in Palermo combined Latin @-@ style architecture , Arab ceilings , and Byzantine domes , all decorated with exquisite golden mosaics .
so if the Normans were so successful , why aren 't they still around ?
now , a number of people just stop talking to me right then and there , and the rest who are left usually have this blank look in their eye , as if to say , what does that mean ?
I 'll bet you 'll be able to come along on this .
first thing I 'm going to do is to make a sine wave oscillator , and we 're going to called the sine wave generator " Ge . "
I 'm not sure why that would be .
the human voice : it 's the instrument we all play .
we speak not very well to people who simply aren 't listening in an environment that 's all about noise and bad acoustics .
but after 30 minutes of work as a defense contractor , I soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off .
suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building , and he wants to do this again and again in the future .
you 've got the music you listen to .
the biggest question was , what do we want to translate it to ?
when I gather up enough of these sequences , I begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be .
most importantly for me , this is what the code on your cell phone looks like .
so I know what English looks like at a binary level , and I know what its visual abstraction looks like , but I 've never seen Russian binary in my entire life .
so this is really nice and helpful , but all this tells me is what I 'm looking at .
the next thing I need to find is the code that controls the battery , but we 're back to the needle in a stack of needles problem .
if you look at the downside of globalization , it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming .
and this is a question we need to ask ourselves .
it exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons .
we probably wouldn 't still be here today if we weren 't so resistant to change .
and this is where I discovered something quite important .
I can now say , and often do , to any government , in order to do well , you need to do good .
I swear that as I get older , my ideas become simpler and more and more childish .
it 's not the same thing as good , better and best .
( applause ) According to the data here , no country on Earth , per head of population , per dollar of GDP , contributes more to the world that we live in than Ireland .
that word , " good , " and the number 6.8 and the discovery that 's behind it have changed my life .
( applause ) Yasmine and I have collaborated with over 1,500 young people , 750 from STEAM fields , and over 750 grassroots makers and scrap dealers from Agbogbloshie and beyond .
I sat by her bedside but looked anxiously at my watch , and I knew something that she didn 't .
but more importantly , it helped me reexamine my life .
my mother had dementia and no longer recognized me , and my children had grown up .
and with all the newfound wealth , should we not also make labors of love into careers and let elderly accompaniment or homeschooling become careers also ?
thank you .
why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves ?
( applause ) Rick Perry : absolutely , I think it 's - Paul Bloom : each of the people onstage agreed with the premise of her question , which is as Americans , we should care more about Americans than about other people .
and in fact , in general , people are often swayed by feelings of solidarity , loyalty , pride , patriotism , towards their country or towards their ethnic group .
residents of other countries feel the same about their nation , and we feel the same about our ethnicities .
now some of you may reject this .
now , this distinction is natural enough and often moral enough , but it can go awry , and this was part of the research of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel .
Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919 .
he left to go to university in France , because as a Jew , he couldn 't go to university in Poland , and then he enlisted in the French military in World War II .
and in fact , when the war ended and he was released , most of his friends and family were dead .
their answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee .
this bias seems to show up very early .
so one of the puppets might like green beans .
but the question is , does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets ? and it matters a lot .
they tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes that they have , and worse , they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste .
the ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands .
one avenue is to appeal to people 's emotional responses , to appeal to people 's empathy , and we often do that through stories .
psychologists have explored this .
so this raises the question : would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger ?
and this last part is what is often described as the principle of impartiality .
I remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us .
what would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps .
my parents worked hard to get back on their feet .
he told me that American democracy is vitally dependent on good people who cherish the ideals of our system and actively engage in the process of making our democracy work .
and he also told me about young Japanese @-@ Americans during the Second World War .
they even took the word " citizen " away from us , and imprisoned them for a whole year .
all men are created equal .
they fought with amazing , incredible courage and valor .
there is one battle that illustrates that .
it was a battle for the Gothic Line .
the Germans thought an attack from the backside would be impossible .
I 'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend .
that 's more in a single day than all three major U.S. networks broadcast in the last five years combined .
let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean .
so anyway , there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse , and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch .
here 's how the experience works today .
before , only 20 percent of people were sending the message , and now 60 percent were , and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result .
it 's both art and science .
so we decided to simplify into an up @-@ down kind of voting binary model .
now , when you set a goal to design for the entire human race , and you start to engage in that goal in earnest , at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you 're living in .
now , in San Francisco , we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can 't use our phones to navigate to the new hipster coffee shop .
designing for low @-@ end cell phones is not glamorous design work , but if you want to design for the whole world , you have to design for where people are , and not where you are .
so then , step two ...
that is what I need for my characters in my books : a passionate heart .
and of brothels where children are forced to receive five , 15 clients per day , and if they rebel , they are tortured with electricity .
she 's sexy , slim and tall , with a deep tan .
now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles ?
( laughter ) Well , she didn 't say that exactly .
so here 's a tale of passion .
the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo .
outside , there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated .
women are 51 percent of humankind .
they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the voluminous Botero style .
I fear abuse of power , and the power to abuse .
we need a critical number of women in positions of power , and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men .
I 'm talking about men with young minds , of course .
not better , but to make it good .
and I would suggest that this has something to do with the Internet . it 's not a fluke .
so remember before the Internet ? ( laughter ) I call this B.I. Okay ?
so , in B.I. , life was simple .
this is the Before Internet , B.I. , innovation model .
we do all kinds of things .
what was happening there was you would have these manufacturing devices , and they weren 't making prototypes or PowerPoints .
the factory was in the designer , and the designer was literally in the factory .
so I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex , what you need to do is very simple .
scores of Somali @-@ American kids came out to embrace sport despite the fatwa against it .
the first is in the strength of her family and all the other families to continue telling their stories and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism .
so what I 'm going to show you is , in retrospect , a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time .
three reasons : one was they were low @-@ resolution .
so these are the things we were saying in those TEDs .
so we informed our audience that what they will just now hear will be a random paper , a mixture of the two papers which we didn 't know what each was writing .
now for me , a question often is why we still embrace this idea of a self @-@ made man on which capitalism relied from its beginning ?
thank you .
and we now have over 200 satellites in orbit , downlinking their data to 31 ground stations we built around the planet .
in total , we get 1.5 million 29 @-@ megapixel images of the Earth down each day .
a deep stack of data , documenting immense change .
and lots of people are using this imagery .
consumer @-@ mapping companies are using it to improve the maps you find online .
or helping to find the refugees fleeing Myanmar .
anyone can go online to planet.com open an account and see all of our imagery online .
or you can create a time lapse through the 500 images that we have and see that change dramatically over time .
and you can share these over social media .
OK , so humanity now has this database of information about the planet , changing over time .
what we 're doing with artificial intelligence is finding the objects in all the satellite images .
the same AI tools that are used to find cats in videos online can also be used to find information on our pictures .
and if you could do that for all of the millions of images coming down per day , then you basically create a database of all the sizable objects on the planet , every day .
this is Beijing .
and let 's look here in the port of Vancouver .
so , we zoom in on Vancouver , we select the area , and we search for ships .
and it outputs where all the ships are .
but we frequently find ships that are not doing that .
the pictures don 't lie .
in time , we could get more sophisticated browsers that people pull in from different sources .
but ultimately , I can imagine us abstracting out the imagery entirely and just having a queryable interface to the Earth .
so , Planet 's Mission 1 was to image the whole planet every day and make it accessible .
it has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you .
consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
I can 't be certain that you guys are conscious .
science , by its nature , is objective .
in the time remaining , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise .
the first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
no , not like that .
okay , so this panpsychist vision , it is a radical one , and I don 't know that it 's correct .
ominous music playing in the background , beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon 's face .

have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized that there was a loose sock Smushed up against your thigh ?
have you ever tried to guess someone else 's password so many times that it locked their account ?
have you ever woken up blissfully and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you ?
I mean , I would call him , and I 'd be like , " Listen , Grandpa , I really need this camera .
you don 't understand . this is , like , I want to make movies .
and it let me make things , which , to me , was sort of the dream .
the thing is , we 'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen 's Magic .
because I 'm not a pack rat .
so , you know , I love Apple computers .
well , it 's not . " E.T. " is about divorce .
when you look at a movie like " Jaws , " the scene that you expect -- we have the screen ?
you 're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster .
this is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience .
what I 've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid , everyone has access to now .
JJA : OK , now .
and the mystery box , in honor of my grandfather , stays closed .
let 's meet some of them .
actually , nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall .
by the end of the course , they take the final exam , get a grade , and follow to the next course .
this is true off the playing field as well .
the end result is that we mess up .
we showed that performance was slower and more error @-@ prone when we drew their attention to the step @-@ by @-@ step details of what they were doing .
when the pressure is on , we 're often concerned with performing at our best , and as a result we try and control what we 're doing to force the best performance .
social media plays a big role here , too .
fast @-@ forward from my high school soccer game to my freshman year in college .
I was in the chemistry sequence for science majors , and boy did I not belong .
even though I studied for my first midterm exam -- I thought I was ready to go -- I bombed it .
if you could 've looked inside my brain during that first midterm exam , you likely would 've seen a neural pain response a lot like the math @-@ anxious individuals I study .
it was probably there during the stressful study situation as well .
but when I walked into the final , my mind was quiet , and I actually got one of the highest grades in the entire class .
you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses .
why ?
because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard .
we are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they 're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures .
when the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945 , it immediately expanded there , and soon it started to train the German Communists to build up their own secret police .
in 1989 , more than 90,000 employees worked for the Stasi .
thirdly , the Stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor .
last but not least , the Stasi had its own armed forces .
it was founded to crash down protests and uprisings .
please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented .
telephones were wiretapped , including the phone of the German chancellor in the West , and often also the apartments .
the Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took .
contrast that with Snowden , for example .
but the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation .
the agent who shadowed me didn 't know who I was or why I was surveyed .
and in a way , the minister was right , because technical instruments can only register what people are doing , but agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking .
this guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens .
sometimes it 's said that informants were pressured to becoming one , but that 's mostly not true , because a forced informant is a bad informant .
the officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant , and to be honest , the example of the Stasi shows that it 's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others .
we took those who were around you . "
this reminds me of the novel " 1984 " by George Orwell , where the only apparently trustable person was an informer .
that 's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime .
it was called Zersetzung , and it 's described in another guideline .
instead , he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central .
so that makes a fundamental difference .
as you can probably gather , S 's and T 's , together or independently , are my kryptonite .
singing for me is sweet relief .
but I am actually pretty good at a couple of things .
I earn 1,000 times the median wage , but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff , do I ?
now the orthodox reaction , of course , is raising the minimum wage costs jobs . right ?
why ? because the fundamental law of capitalism is , when workers have more money , businesses have more customers and need more workers .
there is no evidence for it .
it 's not that they don 't have good entrepreneurs in other places , even very , very poor places .
it 's just that that 's all that those entrepreneurs ' customers can afford .
once upon a time , there was a woman named Miss Margaret .
so much so that she marched down to that human @-@ resource department to see if she was eligible for an early retirement .
and everybody knows what bad data does .
I wanted to talk about biases , the unconscious ones and the conscious ones , and what we do .
because now I know that when you engage people in the why , it challenges their perspective , and it changes their attitudes .
now I know that teaching people transitional change instead of shocking them into change is always a better way of implementing change .
thank you .
as a kid I always loved information that I could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers .
I always wanted to know , what are people trying to hide with numbers ?
well , we had data that told a different story .
in fact , we could probably pretty accurately estimate conception .
so why this temperature jump ?
well , think about when a bird sits on her eggs .
until a couple of days later I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow , and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage .
when it gets too cold in the house , your thermostat kicks in and says , " Hey , we need to blow some heat around . "
if it gets too hot , your thyroid cools you down .
we 're looking at each other , and I looked at the doctor , and I said , " Why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition , but this previous doctor wanted to order an EKG and a CAT scan ? "
we house the parents of almost three million of our community 's children , and we 've become the new asylum , the largest mental health provider in this nation .
he was a Vietnam veteran . corrections suited him .
I was not so much any of those things , and I 'm sure that worried him about me .
and just in case you wondered , they shared one toilet in those small confines .
hundreds of men streamed out of their cells .
even in prison , it 's no small thing to lock someone up .
out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments .
inmates and staff started interacting more often and openly and developing a rapport .
to be honest with you , preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions .
and I find myself thinking a lot about that last point , tell your truth .
that 's all bioluminescence . like I said : just like fireflies .
there 's still 97 percent , and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises .
this is a Giant Australian cuttlefish .
here we 're going to see one backing into a crevice , and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in , makes them look just like algae .
that big brown makes his eyespot very big .
and power governs how any form of government operates , whether a democracy or a dictatorship .
this is why it is so fundamental for us right now to grab hold of this idea of power and to democratize it .
we begin to opt out .
think about the change that you want in your city , and then think about how you would get it , how you would make it happen .
could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know ?
this is the challenge and the opportunity for us .
think about how experiments in participatory budgeting , where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation of city funds .
Ted is 30 .
and I partnered with the School Nutrition Association , and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day .
there is Ms. Brenda in California , who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss .
and they made thank you pizzas , where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza .
for me , I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies , because one woman said to me , she said , " Before this day , I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school .
we 're gonna do an original tune right here .
( applause and cheers ) Lumar LeBlanc on the snare drum .
those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards .
we were actually very lucky , and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening .
and finally , this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed .
both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most Kenyan farms , which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm .
on the way back to the ministry in the car , she turned around to me and said , " Rose , you 've always been interested in finance .
they said , " Wow , that 's great , but that 'll be late .
no more years of the cup .
it 's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress .
in other animals , we have YouTube .
lots of creatures - this horse is just one example - develop self @-@ destructive behaviors .
and it turns out we 're actually so much more complicated than that .
a week later , Ping was discovered in the apartment alongside the body of her owner , and the vacuum had been running the entire time .
I don 't think , though , that that 's a problem .
today , however , we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects , but they 're giving them these drugs as patients , both in ethical and much less ethical ways .
we get ever more vulnerable .
at 19 , I helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage .
so throughout my life , I 've seen women - family , friends , colleagues - live through these experiences , and they seldom talk about it .
so in simple words , life in India is not easy .
so in the months that followed , I covered a trail of events in Bangalore which had no space in the mainstream news .
walking to the fruit seller 's or the tailor 's , I got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece . "
it was on news channels across the world .
small changes allow us to make discoveries , like the planet found by Herschel .
science can , in our lifetimes -- even in a decade -- transform what it means to have a specific illness .
but not for all illnesses .
but that , too , became too complicated .
that drug makes the voices somewhat quieter , but it didn 't restore his bright mind or his social connectedness .
it 's a strategy that has worked again and again and again .
and that challenge is that we 'd like to learn from the brains of hundreds of thousands of living people .
and today , it 's increasingly possible to make progress on a scale that was never possible before .
now , the creation and elimination of synapses is a normal part of human development and learning .
there are hundreds of places in our genomes that shape risk for brain illnesses , and any one of them could lead us to the next molecular insight about a molecule that matters .
these projects bring together people with diverse backgrounds and training and interests -- biology , computers , chemistry , math , statistics , engineering .
what 's the future that we could hope to create ?
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you 're reading , there 's something really soothing and easy .
what you find at the store at the corner , without going to any kind of fancy store , is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated .
and you see IDEO there .
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul .
sadly , the frequent overuse of the word " awesome " has now replaced words like " great " and " thank you . "
Woodstock , 1969 : rolling Stone Magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll .
that 's how powerful God is .
God made it .
he said , this model is just equations .
why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth ?
it 's stupidly constructed , it 's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles , and what the hell is dark energy ?
this is an ethical conception .
anyway , so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality , various special realities .
they 're infinitely removed from nothingness , but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness .
and as for the special reality of nothingness , we wouldn 't be having this conversation .

if you don 't like the 24 / 7 all Kardashian all the time programming , you 've got to stop clicking on the stories about Kim Kardashian 's sideboob .
clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it .
well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing , which meant he 'd gone and would not come back .
when our father did speak to us , it was from the pulpit of his mind .
the children became the parents to the parent .
although there 's still the kind of temporariness that our parents felt about being here , but we children knew that the game was up .
I think there was a feeling that they would not be able to continue with the ideals of the life that they expected .
having started the process , my father did not continue .
it was left to my mother to educate me , and as George Lamming would say , it was my mother who fathered me .
now I also had a 10 @-@ year @-@ old son , and turned my attention to Bageye and I went in search of him .
but we sat down , and he had a Caribbean friend with him , talking some old time talk , and my father would look at me , and he looked at me as if I would miraculously disappear as I had arisen .
this will close the generation gap , perhaps .
quality of air became better , and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house .
today , we are making forests in houses , in schools , even in factories with the corporates .
we have strong theories about how these common galaxies form and evolve .
but we don 't understand how rare galaxies form and evolve .
that 's interesting , right ?
small details on our body , like a scar or wrinkles , tell the story of our lives .
this discovery tells us that we still have a lot to learn , and we should keep looking deeper and deeper in space and keep searching for the unknown .
this is Nevada 's Black Rock Desert , about as far as you can get from the galleries of New York and London and Hong Kong .
and here , for just about 30 years , at Burning Man , a movement has been forming that does exactly that .
since its early anarchist years , Burning Man has grown up .
really , the entire encampment of Burning Man could be thought of as one giant interactive art installation driven by the participation of everyone in it .
and if necessity is the mother of invention , here , absurdity is its father .
( laughter ) They zigzag from artwork to artwork like some bizarre , random public transportation system , pulsing with light and sound .
the results are normal , so here 's some pain medication , and follow up with a primary care doctor , but if the pain persists or if it worsens , then come on back . "
when she came to our clinic , though , we tried a different approach .
our approach started with our medical assistant , someone who had a GED @-@ level training but knew the community .
our medical assistant asked some routine questions .
" let 's get your vital signs " - measure your blood pressure and your heart rate , but let 's also ask something equally as vital to Veronica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles .
" Veronica , can you tell me about where you live ?
she looked a little bit relieved , because for the first time , she had a diagnosis , but I said , " Veronica , now let 's talk about your treatment .
she told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent .
it 's a term many of you are familiar with .
you jump right in along with your friends .
she 's in the water . she 's swimming away from them upstream , rescuing children as she goes , and they shout to her , " Where are you going ?
in healthcare , we often pay for volume and not value .
we pay doctors and hospitals usually for the number of services they provide , but not necessarily on how healthy they make you .
it 's not that doctors don 't know these are important issues .
first , they sit down and they say , let 's identify the clinical problem among a certain set of patients .
let 's say , for instance , let 's try to help children who are bouncing in and out of the hospital with asthma .
the root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings to the table is to say , let 's look at the living and the working conditions in your life .
it 's clear to me that there are so many stories of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things .
by some estimates , we need one upstreamist for every 20 to 30 clinicians in the healthcare system .
in the U.S. , for instance , that would mean that we need 25,000 upstreamists by the year 2020 .
these stories are compelling because not only do they tell us that we 're this close to getting the healthcare system that we want , but that there 's something that we can all do to get there .
doctors and nurses can get better at asking about the context of patients ' lives , not simply because it 's better bedside manner , but frankly , because it 's a better standard of care .
health is a common good .
no , you seem to be thinking clearly , and your vision is perfectly sharp .
and everything looks normal except the children 's faces .
so this picture 's nice , if I do say so myself , but it shows only anatomy .
brains are like muscles .
is it really specialized just for face recognition ?
to tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function , you need to mess with it and see what happens , and normally we don 't get to do that .
so it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area .
imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that .
I drove my Honda 350 across the United States in an " Easy Rider " kind of way .
I dove horizontally through glass ; on the way , I punched a hole in it .
that hurt .
we might need to get a little hurt , just not too hurt .
something like that .
( applause ) ( Music ) Thank you . thank you . thank you .
it 's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space .
and so what our nickname ended up becoming , and what ended up sticking , was the Lowline , so the Lowline was born .
what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel , and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible .
so , like a crazy person , I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project .
here 's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology .
so what we 're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community @-@ driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area .
and right now , we 're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way .
and in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film -- the Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler 's hosiery mill .
it was a brutal beating . and midway through that brutality , one of Mr. Teszler 's sons , Andrew , looked up and said , " Is it time to take the capsule now , Papa ? "
and once for an interdisciplinary class , I was screening the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman 's " The Seventh Seal . "
this is what I 'm passionate about . it is precisely this .
so this is what inspired me .
I am trying , or will try to convey this inspiration .
we also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity .
while many believe it , few know it .
if you go out there , in this marsh , you 'll be amazed at the -- You can barely see the animals .
I 'll try to use an approach that 's slightly materialistic , but it also attempts to convey that , in nature , there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony .
we 'll start by thinking that water is like blood .
this is an image of rain in motion .
what phenomenon -- if it 's not a desert , what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
they use sunlight to do this process .
so , in a typical sunny day in the Amazon , a big tree manages to transfer 1,000 liters of water through its transpiration -- 1,000 liters .
any idea ? a really big kettle .
a gigantic kettle , right ?
look over there , in the southern hemisphere , the Atacama ; Namibia and Kalahari in Africa ; the Australian desert .
where are the arteries ?
there is a new type of river , which originates in the blue sea , which flows through the green ocean -- it not only flows , but it is also pumped by the green ocean -- and then it falls on our land .
there is another fractal analogy .
like endocrinal glands and hormones , there are those gases which I told you about before , that are formed and released into the atmosphere , like hormones , which help in the formation of rain .
the desert is trapped in this condition . it will always be dry .
and he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation .
well , I 'm now a trustee of the university , and at my installation ceremony I said , " I 'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation .
I said , " Well , I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there . "
that good food 's not for rich people -- good food 's for everybody on the planet , and there 's no excuse why we all can 't be eating it .
let me show you what these people do .
he was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the Lord .
in 1986 , I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I was building it .

and Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said , " God 's picked you , man , to do this work .
and I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy .
so , we 've become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the United States of America ( Laughter ) in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .
that 's the place all filled up with Republicans .
and this is our new facility , which is all video technology .
and that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson , who recorded that album at our school last Christmas .
and there 's the fountain .
and Mellon Bank 's a tenant .
( laughter ) The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and I 'll tell you where I made my big mistake .
this is in a place called San Francisco .
I want one of those . "
and that weekend , I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night -- first time I 'd met him .
he said , " Well , that 's the electronic commerce network . "
( laughter ) And Jeff and I did become friends , and he 's organized a team of people and we 're going to build this center .
and after about 10 pictures they all settled down .
and I promised these people that I was going to build this thing , and we 're going to build it all right .
and my hope is that I 've made a few here tonight .
the world has been much , much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this , you know .
well , it 's very clear that poverty here was almost halved , and in U.S. , when we asked the public , only five percent got it right .
of course they think so , because they don 't even know what has happened .
that 's basically what I will do .
now , the next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very , very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters .
the Western domination is over , as of today .
do you see the big hump ? did you see how it moved ?
they have a forecast for the next five years of GDP per capita .
the artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies . "
this is our kind of pharmacy section .
it was going to be the highlight of our store .
mammoth chunks . these things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield , not under your arms . ( laughter ) And these are robot emotion chips , so robots can feel love or fear .
it 's almost as old as storytelling itself .
for me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
and here 's just one example .
so here 's a letter . it says , " Dear people , I bet you 10 bucks you won 't send me a blue whale .
he 's got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
so this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I 'll play you some of Nico 's message .
MB : I actually got Nico , I hadn 't heard from in 18 months , and he just left a message two days ago .
but Nico 's the best reader I could hope for .
for instance , a female patient with breast cancer doesn 't succumb to the disease simply because she has a mass on her breast .
and fortunately , I work for someone who is open to running with my crazy ideas .
which we did , in preclinical animal models .
this was a significant finding , because currently , there aren 't any FDA @-@ approved therapeutics that directly target the spread of cancer .
there has to be another way of doing this .
on the right , we reconfigured it : the office buildings form the base , and then rising 75 stories above , are apartments .
there 's a street in the air on the 25th level , a community street .
and that 's all I can tell you in five minutes .
thank you .
China was getting serious about market economics and about university education , so they decided to call in the foreign experts .
it 's doubled over those 25 years , more than doubled , from 10 million to 20 million .
hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty .
now , the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I 've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing .
fifty percent now in urban areas .
this is profound structural change .
and let me start with cities .
when the visibility dropped to [ less ] than a few meters , they stopped the buses and I had to walk .
we have to invest strongly in energy , we have to use it much more efficiently , and we have to make it clean .
take the example of California .
do the first one well , the structural , the second one on the climate becomes much easier .
over the last few years , actually more than a few , Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly .
again , I think it 's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one .
and technology is changing very rapidly .
how do we know it ?
it allows us to see better .
so what is new about big data ? what is the big deal ?
well , to answer that question , let 's think about what information looked like , physically looked like in the past .
there is , if you will , a liquidity to information .
take , for example , Martin Luther .
three of the traits were ones that people didn 't need to look for , but that the machine spotted .
we now need to recast our gaze at the I , the information , which is less apparent , but in some ways a lot more important .
my work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions , and created a lasting stigma for me and my family .
in front of a police compound in Gaza City during the first war in Gaza , an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound and break my nose .
for a moment , all I saw was white , bright white , like these lights .
some of us will see it coming .
early in my career , I faced this dilemma by simply lying .
as I assessed him , I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him , and like so many other cases , he looked me in the eye and asked that question : " am I going to die ? "
in that moment , I decided to do something different .
I decided to tell him the truth .
his reaction shocked me to this day .
whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret , their guilt is universal .
and who does the emptying ?
as you can see , there 's no protective equipment , no protective clothing .
from them , Minty learned about the secret communications that occurred along trade routes , information that would prove invaluable later in her life .
looking down below , she saw the path to liberation .
and one night , lying flat on my back , I felt for my phone to write a blog , trying to explain how I should respond .
you need to get yourself as far away from this as possible . "
he dreamed of a world of empty wheelchairs .
it was like the formal medical system was canceling hope in favor of acceptance alone .
big problems need big solutions , sparked by big ideas , imagination and audacity , but also solutions that work .
here in the United States , where we have healthcare reform , we don 't have the professionals we need .
the subjects are familiar - basic and clinical sciences - but there are major differences .
third , they learn public health : to assess their patients ' drinking water , housing , social and economic conditions .
they need the chance to be the doctors their patients need .
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing , and I am an expert on this person , and so I write about it .
and I won it -- I reached all of these people , and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day .
and why are they reading this ? "
you have your Google search , where you say , " What is Mena Trott ? "
and then you find these things and you 're happy or unhappy .
I would spend hours looking at the connections , saying , " Oh , the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there . "
I have this record , this 1910 census , of another Grabowski -- that 's my maiden name -- and there 's a Theodore , because there 's always a Theodore .
if you look at my driver 's license , I have the same look , and it 's a pretty disturbing thing , but it 's something that is really important .
then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time .
it 's obviously a very big commercial company , and so this little , " Shh -- it 's not really them , " was put on the side of the imagery .
but you can also show two things : first , the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality .
but it will be very difficult to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model , so you need a story where people also care about wealth accumulation for other reasons .
and then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
now , what could be done ?
Thomas Piketty : well , you know , I think if you look back through time , the history of income , wealth and taxation is full of surprise .
when inequality gets too extreme , then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low mobility .
look , the reason why I put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that we can have an open and transparent debate about this .
now , with my students , I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks .
now , it 's basically a fun thing we developed in our class where they map out what risks they 're willing to take .
it 's OK . that risk didn 't work out .
at the end of the flight , we exchanged contact information .
so I invited him to come down , and he and his colleagues came to Stanford and met with the students , and afterwards , we had lunch together .
each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible , and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant .
they all started out as crazy ideas .
apparently , all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this , and it got me thinking : when did I stop doing this ?
because apparently we don 't .
but what 's leading them to do this ?
they 're under pressure to be online and available at all times , talking , messaging , liking , commenting , sharing , posting - it never ends .
what 's a highlight in someone 's life versus what 's normal in the context of everyday .
airbrushing is now routine .
seventeen percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren 't feeling confident about the way that they look .
now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this .
it is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their haircuts or the size of their breasts , or to infer that the determination or the success of an Olympian is down to her not being a looker .
we can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks .
giving them the airtime , because only then will we create a different world .
this diagram shows the body 's lymphatic system , which has evolved to meet this need .
it 's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body .
I mean , the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared .
it was ingenious , but it was also beautiful .
thank you .
I choose to be called Mary .
my mother was his second wife , married to him at the age of 16 .
my half brothers were his first priority .
with an education , you can survive .
but I was missing something : my mother .
I was 13 years old .
boarding school was heaven , but it was also so hard .
OK , I keep telling students in my class , " It 's not about the A 's ; it 's about doing your best . "
girls and women have a part to play in this just as much as men .
when I finished my high school career , I moved my sisters to Nairobi , where they live with my stepsister .
back here , we all played together .
soon , my mother learned that many Somalis found refuge in a small town in Minnesota .
so I made studying my top priority and soon started flourishing within the classroom .
when I first started wearing it , I was excited .
but when I started middle school , the students teased me about not having hair , so to prove them wrong , I started showing them my hair -- something that goes against my beliefs , but something I felt pressured to do .
so the question I 'd like to raise here , and I do believe it 's the most important question we need to answer , is this one : if Internet is the new printing press , then what is democracy for the Internet era ?
I 'm not saying it 's easy .
I live in Washington , D.C. , but I grew up in Sindhekela , a village in Orissa , in India .
when the opportunity came , I crossed two oceans , with borrowed money for airfare and only a $ 20 bill in my pocket .
in the U.S. , I worked in a research center , part @-@ time , while taking graduate classes in economics .
these are people who live in a country other than their country of birth .
that would be larger , in its size of the economy , than France .
by 2005 , a decade later , at a time of political crisis , economic crisis , the share of poor people went down to 31 percent .
in El Salvador , the school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances .
and then there is the case of Venezuela , where , because of exchange controls , you send 100 dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even 10 dollars .
of course , nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel .
first , relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars .
the remittance arrives .
that means that for the two years or three years of his life , he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees .
we must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper .
my parents are not there anymore .
it 's the sense of , " This is something I 'm willing to do only if no one else is watching . "
but by contrast , good people are people who go to work , come home , raise their children , watch television .
there are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched , the behavior they engage in is vastly more conformist and compliant .
it renders off @-@ limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it 's happened .
we can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable , but the constraints that it imposes on us do not become any less potent .
at what point will you think , well , actually , we 've succeeded in moving the dial ?
and I 'm sure many people in the room are wondering the same question .
in developing countries , one third of that population is living in slums .
in some American cities , voter turnout was close to five percent .
the city of L.A. , a city of four million people , elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes .
this is Leblon .
this is where over 70,000 of the city 's poorest residents live .
that is higher than Norway , Switzerland or Sweden .
Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools , the Pressure Cooker , the same one that Bia and Jovita used , and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve .
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from lifebuoy brand .
iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
most of these discussions are still happening online .
unlike DNA , which is mainly fixed , microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time , telling us which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment .
it is the uncontrolled regulation of genes .
( applause ) Another important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud , so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information .
today , cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear .
it not only costs us billions of dollars , but it also costs us the people we love .
it will give us the chance of detecting it early , understanding it better , and finding a cure .
two years ago at TED , I think -- I 've come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion .
I had this company that I 'd spent 15 years building . it 's called Future ; it was a magazine publishing company .
and 15 years later , there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times .
it took eight years of blood , sweat and tears to reach 350 employees , something which I was very proud of in the business .
I was going around with this big sign on my forehead : " loser . "
and the reason I 'm telling this story is that I believe , from many conversations , that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster -- emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years .
and at about the same time , and I think partly because of that , I started doing something that I 'd forgotten about in my business focus : I started to read again .
it 's connected ; it all hooks into each other .
and so , it 's the profound thing that Richard talks about : to understand anything , you just need to understand the little bits ; a little bit about everything that surrounds it .
you 're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . "
there 's a year to do this , and already -- I hope to show you a bit later -- there 's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year .
and one key way that we 're going to do this is to introduce this book club .
it only has four million citizens , and there are one million Syrian refugees living there .
it was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan .
every day , on average , by the end of this day , 32,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes - 32,000 people .
this is a blessing . "
despite his extreme physical state , he was completely present with me , guiding , nurturing , and being my father as much if not more than ever before .
I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable , but my father insists that there are no dead ends .
why ?
and it means questioning disciplines like demographics .
no . it 's science , not magic .
thank you .
then , at the age of eight , we moved to Botswana .
six years later , I returned to the country .
how could a country go so bad so fast ?
we 've had three generations of leaders , in my mind .
the first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent .
Laetitia 's a young woman from Kenya who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school because her family couldn 't afford to pay fees for her .
today , we have 700 of them that are being groomed for the African continent , and over the next 50 years , we expect to create 6,000 of them .
so today , I 'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy .
we 're building 25 brand new universities in Africa that are going to cultivate this next generation of African leaders .
( applause ) Over the next 50 years , this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent .
well , why did I spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor ?
the real irony is , for every 100 dollars worth of assets this program gave someone , they spent another 99 dollars to do it .
what if , instead , we use technology to put cash , whether from aid agencies or from any one of us directly into a poor person 's hands .
that 's what we 've started to do at GiveDirectly .
so far , we 've looked for the poorest people in the poorest villages , and in this part of the world , they 're the ones living in homes made of mud and thatch , not cement and iron .
so let 's say that 's your family .
something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we can now do efficiently and free of corruption .
I believe in aid .
there was a paper published in the medical journal The Lancet in England a few years ago called " A man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for 5 years . "
most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash , some money .
it fits 1,100 people , it 's jammed to the gills , and up on the stage , waiting to shake your hand , waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize , are a bunch of Nobel prize winners .
he looked through the records , and he discovered that a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts .
thank you .
for us , it 's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone .
we had never seen that before .
my father , " How can people protect what they don 't understand ? "
humanity takes center stage at TED , but I would like to add a voice for the animals , whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us .
as animals blessed with the power of rational thought , we can marvel at the intricacies of life .
Linda must be either married or not married - there are no other options .
researchers presented participants with a news article that showed no weapons of mass destruction had been found .
in the course of discussion , you 'll be exposed to counter @-@ arguments and rebuttals .
that 's not how it works in Afghanistan .
so , after hours of talking and tracking them down , and about 30 cups of tea , they finally agreed that we could sit down for a second jirga , and we did .
with every case that I take , I realize that as much as I 'm standing behind my clients , that they 're also standing behind me , and that 's what keeps me going .
law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us .
we live in a different world .
they used pliers to take out her fingernails .
and so we decided to take this case to the Supreme Court .
so this leash has some additional electronics .
now , I can tell you that it 's easy a lot , but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it .
and it was here that fate brought Frank into contact with a journalist and geologist named Charles Maclaren .
its position at the southern entrance of the Dardanelles strait would 've made a formidable strategic location for both defense and trade .
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fuel @-@ efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
and the social benefits : the rate of single @-@ occupancy vehicles is , I told you , 75 percent ; I think we can get that down to 50 percent .
we 've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982 .
and why is this going to happen ? because we 're going to do congestion pricing , we are going to do road tolls , gas taxes are going to become road pricing .
what you can do with that tool : we can create an economic engine .
panties . no , seriously , google it .
it was at that point where I felt like , oh my God , this is just taking over my life .
Don 't let it claim you .
we all know that the way to cope with trauma , with loss , with any life @-@ changing experience , is to find meaning .
but here 's the thing : no one can tell us what our experience means .
so what about you ?
what it means today may not be what it means a year from now , or 10 years from now .
claim your experience .
sometimes there 's a payoff .
so I got down to the lobby , and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was NED : no Evidence of Disease .
and to her credit , she could talk about her reasons for embracing and then clinging to this identity .
it was pushing people away .
so this is Anna Hazare , and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting @-@ edge digital activist in the world today .
and in 2011 , he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in India , a topic that Indian elites love to ignore .
but then he decides , " Let me tweak my tactics a little bit . "
so a note for a dating tip here , in some cultures , if you want to please your lover , you call them and hang up . ( laughter ) So why do people leave missed calls ?
so when Hazare asked people to leave him a missed call , let 's have a little guess how many people actually did this ?
thirty @-@ five million .
I cofounded Avaaz , which uses the Internet to mobilize people and now has almost 40 million members , and I now run Purpose , which is a home for these kinds of technology @-@ powered movements .
so what 's the moral of this story ?
so Henry Timms and I - Henry 's a fellow movement builder - got talking one day and we started to think , how can we make sense of this new world ?
because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society .
new power is the deployment of mass participation and peer coordination - these are the two key elements - to create change and shift outcomes .
and we see new power all around us .
this is Airbnb , which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without owning a single square foot of real estate .
new power works like a current .
old power is held by a few .
they 're not affronted by differences , they 're fascinated by them , and that is a huge shift in mindset , and once you feel it , you want it to happen a lot more .
that guy could teach it .
about 12 years ago , I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place .
they inundated our campaign with their propaganda , that as you know , links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy .
so , I thought a lot about the first word I 'd say today , and I decided to say " Colombia . "
she had the balls to get out . I need to do the same thing . "
" yeah , right , if he doesn 't do that , he 's going to get killed . "
this picture that I have here , you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees , and that man you see there with the three stars , he 's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez .
I call it benjoin in the local vernacular , and the botanical name is Terminalia bentzoe , subspecies bentzoe .
while we may not be sure , one thing is certain : we will not want this plant to disappear .
so who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide to reveal all its secrets .
so we asked ourselves : does the typical office building help us in that sense ?
go to the Open House and express your options .
twenty @-@ five fishermen work for me .
so what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands , without a master plan and like a giant work in progress .
unfortunately , during that time , another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs .
( applause ) And at the end , the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment .
and this is the model , how it 's going to work . so , it 's the same system ; the vehicle is different . and that 's the model .
so , in a city , you have to work fast .
and I think creativity , innovation is starting .
and we CANNOT have all the answers .
at the end , I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song .
( applause ) But here 's the good news .
there 's probably never been a drug @-@ free society .
it 's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform .
that 's my drug education mantra : safety first .
what are you doing right ? "
they lived in a poor rural community in the state of Puebla , in central Mexico .
they made beautiful handmade products .
one night , seven years later , I was out with some friends and we were talking about the life of the entrepreneur .
and we called it Fuckup Nights .
we feel that we need something else to be a good entrepreneur .
in fact , econometric research has proved that if the process of declaring bankruptcy takes less time and less money , more new firms will enter the market .
when a firm dies , some people will lose their jobs .
being aware of the lessons learned .
and being aware of the responsibility to share those learnings with the world .
how , maybe , is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema ?
and actually , why do we record ?
we started to publish every week sessions on the Internet .
we published all those films for free on the Internet , and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way .
how could I edit my films in a bus crossing the Andes ?
my desire was to make it as a trek .
well , when I arrived in Peru , actually , I had no idea about what I would do there .
this is important to record that whole person .
what 's the point of that ?
to reinvent life today , we have to make new forms of images .
and it 's very simple .
BG : you told me that most of the videos you have made are actually one single shot .
I mean , you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length , etc .
otherwise , you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning , and so is that the case ?
VM : " H√≠bridos " is - I really believe Brazil , far from the cliches , is the greatest religious country in the world , the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities .
so they gave Albert Alexander , this Oxford policeman , the drug , and within 24 hours , he started getting better .
his fever went down , his appetite came back .
second day , he was doing much better .
day five , they ran out of penicillin , and the poor man died .
now , what did that lead us to ?
basically , the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria that resistance is now a problem , because we 've now selected for just the resistant bacteria .
this is serious .
Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug , and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug .
they 're related , because if we invest heavily in new oil wells , we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil in the same way that 's going to happen for antibiotics .
and if you thought that these two were entirely , fully balanced between these two options , you might consider the fact that this is really a game that we 're playing .
the game is really one of coevolution , and coevolution is , in this particular picture , between cheetahs and gazelles .
now , this is clearly not a game that can be sustained , or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead .
we 've got to slow the pace of coevolution down , and there are ideas that we can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well .
if you look at the price of penicillin , the cost per day is about 10 cents .
and so we stand at a crossroads .
what I saw behind every excuse was deep fear , and what I learned was that to become a doctor , we have to put on our white coats , put up a wall , and hide behind it .
what if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients ?
you knew what he was about , and he had no need to hide from you .
the ICU doctor looked at me in the eye , pointed at my then 16 @-@ year @-@ old sister , and said , " Do you remember when you were that age ?
can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don 't do everything for her ? "
they ask me how I could be so brave .
his name was Simon Kuznets and the report that he delivered was called " National Income , 1929 @-@ 1932 . "
it 's dry as a bone .
on page seven he says , " The welfare of a nation can , therefore , scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above . "
it 's not the greatest sound bite in the world , and it 's dressed up in the cautious language of the economist .
do I have rights ?
but I believe that we 're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution .
not indicators of effort or intention , but real achievement .
here 's the United States - considerably richer than New Zealand , but with a lower level of social progress .
so this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress .
and with more and more of the world 's population living on this part of the curve , it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development .
a couple of years ago , I put a video on Youtube , and in the video , I acted out every terrible conference call you 've ever been on .
it 's kind of funny .
tell them you 're very excited to support their work , ask them what the goal of the meeting is , and tell them you 're interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal .
but that 's not just with autistic people , either .
it 's like I 'm walking in two worlds most of the time .
and my parents thought it was cute , so they didn 't bring it up , but when I got into school , they didn 't really agree that it was cute .
so at the end of their talk , the panel , they had questions and answers , and boom , my hand went right up , and I get the microphone , and I look at them and I say , " Thank you .
and not only that , where 's the flip chart with the action items and the follow @-@ up and the accountability ?
it was in a phase III trial .
it was interesting .
all she said was , " Jaw @-@ dropping . "
and my family 's favorite video ?
bill Gates .
because the night Pete was diagnosed , he told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates , and he did it .
because he wants them to see what the reality of this is , and how he 's never , ever going to give up .
so now , everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells .
and it actually turns out that the extracellular matrix is different from every single part of the body .
so now , this has a whole bunch of applications , but basically the idea is , wherever you put this product , you 're able to reassemble into it immediately .
now , some diplomats and development experts and specialists , they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century .
fact is , we 're living in the most peaceful moment in human history .
Steven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all @-@ time low .
now , Gaza , Syria , Sudan , Ukraine , as ghastly as these conflicts are , and they are horrific , they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a 50 @-@ year @-@ long secular decline .
Manuel Eisner and others have shown that for centuries , we 've seen this incredible drop in murder , especially in the West .
but consider this one fact : in the 1800s , one in 30 people lived in cities , today it 's one in two , and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there .
so urban geographers and demographers , they tell us that it 's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence , no .
I call this turbo @-@ urbanization , and it 's one of the key drivers of fragility .
we can 't only focus on those cities that work , the Singapores , the Kuala Lumpurs , the Dubais , the Shanghais .
one way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones , kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices , of what works and what doesn 't .
place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities .
if I have one single message for you , it 's this : there is nothing inevitable about lethal violence , and we can make our cities safer .
folks , we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime .
but then I realized , " No , this is exactly what the grasses want us to do .
it 's a very elaborate and beautiful dance , but I 'm going to just give you a close @-@ up on one piece of it , and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens , his laying hens .
the Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens .
so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they 're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs , and in the process they 're spreading the manure out .
now , I want you to just look really close up onto what 's happened there .
well , look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
again , give each species what it wants , let it realize its desires , its physiological distinctiveness .
people did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face .
that was the most frequent response that we received .
so dieters , for instance , see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories .
so how is that possible ?
people 's states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment .
how far away was the finish line ?
however , in reality , these cars are the same size , but that 's not how we see it .
it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues , it has now expanded .
and let me show you what it looks like today .
this is their perception of why you shouldn 't mess with uncontacted Indians .
these are Indians , trained as indigenous park rangers , patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay .
( applause ) But let me conclude by saying , this work can be spiritually rewarding , but it 's difficult and it can be dangerous .
we gave them cameras and training .
the success of this project got me thinking how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world .
the second thing I learned is that we have to enable them to film in a safe way .
unfortunately , I can 't show you the hidden cameras we 're using today - for obvious reasons - but these are cameras we used before .
we are checking maps , looking at maps , double @-@ checking the information , and looking also at the metadata of the material .
they are trying to change the behavior of the community from inside .
this is a much more powerful and much , much more effective weapon .
but we have to use its power wisely .
so you can imagine that 's a transition that hasn 't been entirely seamless .
one of the interesting side effects seems to be that my short @-@ term memory is entirely shot .
or , " Oh cool , did you go there for the marathon ? "
how come this has remained the high @-@ water mark ?
you 've heard that the average American spends 90 percent of their time indoors .
we didn 't go indoors for nearly four months .
it was 24 @-@ hour daylight .
living conditions were quite spartan .
it 's 110 miles long ; most of its surface is what 's called blue ice .
planes can 't land here , so we were at the most risk , technically , when we had the slimmest chance of being rescued .
Tarka took this photo of me one evening after I 'd nearly passed out with hypothermia .
we both had repeated bouts of hypothermia , something I hadn 't experienced before , and it was very humbling indeed .
I remember just wanting to lie down and quit .
I 've put on 30 pounds in the last three weeks .
the hospital 's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day .
the red area , so the potential working @-@ age population in 2030 , is already set in stone today , except for much higher migration rates .
that 's where it gets tricky .
let 's take Germany again .
as a matter of fact , the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades , in spite of robots and automation .
there 's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us .
and four , for how to retain the best people , or in other words , how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture .
now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban .
well , today 's human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology .
but it turns out , this " new " human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
they may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
but here 's one from the vets : what do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
thank you .
there were lines of bodies laid in the street .
and there was blood all over the pavements .
there is no story line , no script , no drama , no climax , and it 's called Slow TV .
so we sent the Listening Post 's Marcela Pizarro to Oslo to find out what it is , but first a warning : viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing .
( laughter ) Thomas Hellum : and then follows an eight @-@ minute story on Al Jazeera about some strange TV programs in little Norway .
then a new tunnel .
he 's watched all the program , and at the end station , he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage , and his head hit the curtain rod , and he realized he is in his own living room .
and it 's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program , and together with thousands of others along the route , they made the program what it became .
so on our next project , we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater , and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show , he liked that .
( music ) ( Video ) Jimmy Kimmel : even the people on the show are falling asleep , and after all that , the knitters actually failed to break the world record .
one of the key technologies driving mass location tracking is the innocuous @-@ sounding Automatic License Plate Reader .
Mike hasn 't done anything wrong .
license plate readers aren 't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today .
thank you .
I draw to better understand things .
I 'm going to talk about Rome .
not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home , driving into RISD everyday , driving back .
I 've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years .
here 's a little map . and I thought of maps at the beginning ; maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome .
here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways .
over the Spanish Steps we go .
over the Pantheon and the 26 @-@ foot diameter Oculus .
they bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo , that little spiral structure you see there .
they continue without their tablecloth , looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch .
Marcello , on the other hand , is sort of a lazy guy , but he 's not due at work until about noon .
right through the Piazza della Rotonda , in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work .
and if you want the information , so that we complete this cycle of understanding , all you have to do is read these paragraphs .
today , I want to show you a new kind of map .
men are my default .
who is your default ?
who do you implicitly feel connected to ?
the implicit association test , which measures unconscious bias , you can go online and take it .
seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white .
fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white .
I 'm going to suggest to you , no .
so in fact , what the scientists are telling us is , no way .
( laughter ) Look at them directly in their faces and memorize them , because when we look at awesome folks who are black , it helps to dissociate the association that happens automatically in our brain .
why do you think I 'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me ?
just stare at them , right ? ( laughter ) But these are the things . so go looking for your bias .
please , please , just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong .
and we were outside , it was late at night , and we were sort of wondering where we were going , we were lost .
and I saw this person across the street , and I was thinking , " Oh great , black guy . "
I was going toward him without even thinking about it .
I 've got a 6 ' 5 " black guy son . I was married to a black guy .
who 's missing ?
like , I don 't think this is going to work for me .
I 'm sure I 'm going to blow this . "
so go away from your comfort into a bigger , brighter thing , because that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening .
many of us , anyways , will be in holidays , and you 've got to listen to the conversations around the table .
( laughter ) " Uncle Joe is racist . "
because we 're not saying anything .
we 've got to be willing to say , " Grandma , we don 't call people that anymore . "
" uncle Joe , it isn 't true that he deserved that .
so then we found out something which was very amazing for us .
I 'd like to think that 's why mathematicians don 't really bother going on nights out anymore .
so what that means then is that if some people think that you 're attractive , you 're actually better off having some other people think that you 're a massive Minger .
that 's much better than everybody just thinking that you 're the cute girl next door .
now , I think this begins to make a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages .
now if you do this , it can be mathematically proven , in fact , that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances of finding the perfect partner .
( laughter ) than everybody that you 've seen before .
a Valentine 's Day card like this .
( laughter ) OK , so this method doesn 't give you a 100 percent success rate , but there 's no other possible strategy that can do any better .
OK , so that was Top Tip # 2 .
now , I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce , apart from , I don 't know , Piers Morgan 's wife , maybe ?
now , you can be forgiven , perhaps for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation .
now of course , it takes a bit more than just a low negativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship .
so those are my top three tips of how maths can help you with love and relationships .
it was the marijuana march , a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis .
so in the following week , I was back in the streets , but that time , I wasn 't a member of any media outlet anymore .
but we had a very solid and clear conviction , that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the country .
but then something happened , something that wasn 't predicted , that no one could have anticipated .
they were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city .
if you could read it , you would understand me .
but that was also useful , because we were still at the web , so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country .
now , programming , for those of you here that haven 't done it yourself , requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal .
so from this vantage point , I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past , can do today , and what it could do in the future .
it shows that computers can listen and understand .
the similar images actually have similar backgrounds , similar directions of the faces , even some with their tongue out .
here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday .
with our deep learning algorithm , it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images .
in the last 25 years , as capital productivity has increased , labor productivity has been flat , in fact even a little bit down .
I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty , so I gave 10 @-@ year @-@ olds problems that were slightly too hard for them .
they understood that their abilities could be developed .
so what do they do next ?
and in study after study , they have run from difficulty .
and we got more effort , more strategies , more engagement over longer periods of time , and more perseverance when they hit really , really hard problems .
and we can actually change students ' mindsets .
I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
my art contributes to fundamental change by encouraging an audience to address big questions from that perspective .
some of the people said , " I 'm a German girl .
" I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage , i.e. , the jungles of Africa , and then he can shovel manure in his artistic way . "
there were demonstrations of veterans in front of the Art Institute of Chicago .
that action and the subsequent legal and political battle led to a landmark First Amendment decision that prevented the government from demanding patriotism be mandatory .
it wouldn 't have been safe for me to be there , to say the least .
thank you .
and it lets us look at our world in a completely new way .
and we can do that not just to visualize the pulse , but also to actually recover our heart rates , and measure our heart rates .
and as new parents , we all want to make sure our babies are healthy , that they 're breathing , that they 're alive , of course .
so I too got one of those baby monitors so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep .
we can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies .
maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions .
she wanted to see if there 's any difference in the way her classmates move .
so here are two examples .
( applause ) I call it the visual microphone .
that 's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras .
but at some point , they banded together to hunt bigger game .
more protein than a hunter 's family could eat before it rotted .
let 's also do it for ours .
this is the future of travel , and I invite you to join me to do that , to change your travel .
I have a confession to make .
most of you , if not all , have .
shared memories -- that 's where the old BBC building was ; and personal memories -- that 's where I gave my first kiss .
many couldn 't use cursive , could barely print .
that moment made me think a lot that for most of them , it was surely the very first time that someone applauded them for something they had done .
thank you very much !
but the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us , the police , the military , are the ones that committed most of the crimes .
now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999 .
he graduted from Iowa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country .
so then we said , how many people were executed on March 29 , 1984 ?
so we 're going to focus on Grave 15 .
or the children remain with their family and the child welfare system provides help and support .
but it 's also a confusing and traumatic exit from the family .
and although there are several reasons why , I want to discuss one reason today : implicit bias .
but here 's the distinction : when they present to the committee , they delete names , ethnicity , neighborhood , race , all identifiable information .
on this particular day , she couldn 't believe her eyes .
that was a bit more inspiring .
these are game @-@ changing nations , and will be hugely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic .
Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules with ten impossible tasks that pitted him against invincible monsters and unfathomable forces .
the second target was the Lernaean Hydra , a giant serpent with many heads .
the Ceryneian Hind was a female deer so fast it could outrun an arrow .
Hercules was to retrieve the belt given to her by her father Ares , the god of war .
deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end of the ' 90s and the beginning of the 2000s .
so supermarkets , the slaughterhouses , and so on that buy products from illegal clear @-@ cut areas , they also can be liable for the deforestation .
but more importantly , it avoided the emission of three billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere .
what we see here , those brown trees , these are really dead trees .
in the world , 60 percent is energy .
actually , no .
it pays for itself within one year .
let 's go to Nairobi to find that out .
unlike in the West , Megaffic doesn 't rely on roadside sensors , which are very expensive to install in Nairobi .
third principle is : think and act horizontally .
even if we keep their DNA in some fridge , that 's not going to be reversible .
( laughter ) Unfortunately , I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes , on Fox News , saying exactly the same thing , but seriously .
there is not a single sociological study , psychological study , that 's ever shown that .
my friend , Daniel Batson , spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations .
he does it . there is a choice , but it 's obvious , it 's immediate .
with Tania Singer at the Max Planck Institute of Leipzig , we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving @-@ kindness are different .
now , 15 years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics said yes , our brains change when you train in altruism .
it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love .
we have 25,000 kids in school , four percent overhead .
we need sustainable harmony . I love this term .
what emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America .
for many , it is their first time interacting with Islam on such an intimate level .
and why have we , as Americans particularly , become a nation that strives for security above all else ?
they have grieved it , they have died into it , and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine .
the government finally made a decision that " The Vagina Monologues " could not be performed in Uganda .
there 's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota .
thank you very much .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : and how are you doing ? are you exhausted ?
we need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion , and we need the sensors , power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi @-@ intelligent ant robot .
and it survives , bounces on the table , it 's incredibly robust , and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it 's very tiny .
so this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier .
we all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run .
but ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
and you 'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off , and the robot tumbling through the air .
what is it ?
so now we know that our number must contain at least three zeroes - which also means that the leading digit must be 3 or greater .
they made some astounding discoveries .
for about 300 years after its founding in 283 BCE , the library thrived .
it 's possible the fire destroyed part of the sprawling collection , but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit the library for centuries after the siege .
but I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding .
this is in a village where most of the people are even illiterate .
so there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
I 'm standing there thinking , " This is very confusing . I don 't know what 's going on . "
we settled and we liked it .
I did it for your own good .
so I came home once again and said to my mom , " Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure , that I should be having orgasms , and that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris . "
apparently , white men have a problem finding the clitoris .
culture should not be a defense for child abuse .
it could be your daughter , your sister , your cousin .
the aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them , because every child has a right to pleasure .
weeks later , we met at the local Starbucks , and I started right in with the tough @-@ love budget conversation .
I know that we can break free from the grips of money shame , because I did .
in order to uncover the painful parts of your money story and your money history , you can 't be numb .
but what we had in common was our money belief .
are you from California ?
( music ) Interpassion , ( Music ) ( Music ends ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
OK , you know your pelvis is the center of your body and this is the intersection that makes you really strong , alright ?
so please stand up .
nowadays , a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign .
now , I believe so .
I believe that the rule of thumb is : easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains .
today , it would be so much easier .
now , I want to be clear : the magic is not in the mimeograph .
and politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles , because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial .
so he sat down with the local chiefs , and he listened .
when communities come together with health care workers , work together , that 's when this disease can be stopped .
MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment center , as many of you know , in the area .
in that situation , ladies and gentleman , a virus like Ebola takes advantage .
and they started to ask , how well do we really know this virus ?
we know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus and probably sickened by it .
this is a very dangerous , debilitating , and deadly disease .
it was stopped in Senegal , where it had spread , and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus , in this outbreak .
the first of those is complacency , the risk that as this disease curve starts to bend , the media look elsewhere , the world looks elsewhere .
in fact , the average man can throw a ball further than about 98 percent of all women .
but let 's have a look at the size of this difference .
yeah , a few people .
now , it isn 't true per se that left @-@ handed people are more creative than right @-@ handed people .
the idea is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter and improves your performance on IQ tests .
and then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast that goes all the way back to the store .
most drawings have nodes and links .
now , what 's also really interesting , that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it .
movable cards produce better systems models , because we iterate much more fluidly .
and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes .
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
and so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the THEREMIN the way it is now .
that is the power of single @-@ mindedness .
OK , so first up ...
so we have to do something about the scatter so we can see the tumor .
it 's amazing .
seems impossible but it isn 't .
but we treat this skull with great respect at our lab and here at TED .
Red light is all around us .
a system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost , higher resolution and smaller medical imaging .
( applause ) Oh , thanks !
no , literally -- we use sound .
so .
only two beams of exactly the same color can make a hologram .
and then we move on to shift the sonic focus to another spot .
we scan fast .
our system may be extraordinary at finding blood .
here 's a beaker of blood .
so with our system , you can imagine detecting cancers early , when intervention is easy , or tracking the size of your tumor as it grows or shrinks .
about two and a half years ago , I watched this movie called " Her . "
her name is AIVA , and she 's an artificial intelligence that has learned the art of music composition by reading over 30,000 scores of history 's greatest .
now of course , humans , we are creative . right ?
we have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases .
now we know that there 's a lot of animals out there that can do it too .
the problem with infectious diseases , as we all know , is that pathogens continue to evolve , and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy .
it shortens their lifespan , it reduces their ability to fly , it can even kill them before they 're even adults .
as part of my job , I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants , and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters .
and then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime .
these caterpillars didn 't do anything for their own welfare .
so then we moved on to adult butterflies , and we started asking the question whether it 's the mothers that can medicate their offspring .
so I said , I 'm going to do something else .
and you say , ah , I need some leisure time , and so forth .
it 's a very crowded thing that we do .
so we started this about 30 years ago , and we started dealing with this very issue .
instead of going mountain climbing when you 're 82 , why don 't you do it next week ?
why are we building these headquarters ?
so , come have your interviews .
and so if they don 't have 70 , 80 percent of a grade , they don 't stay , which is probably the reason why I haven 't been CEO for more than 10 years .
what do they need to know ?
we have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17 .
so there 's a place for music and literature , etc . , but also for grammar .
and so the courses are World Cup Soccer , or building a bicycle .
one , it freed our five kids from following in our steps , our shadow -- They don 't know what I do .
( laughter ) The five kids know nothing , which is good .
but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon .
I was awkward , insecure , and I hated it .
that 's huge .
this is a nice building .
on the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new typologies , new solutions for the way that we live today .
and we push and we push and we push until we completely alienate all of you .
okay , 30 years ago we were coming out of the ' 70s .
( laughter ) We 're all hanging out in malls and we 're all moving to the suburbs , and out there , out in the suburbs , we can create our own architectural fantasies .
now , how is it possible that these forms -- they 're wild and radical -- how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world ?
we created an emotional reaction to these forms .
it means that a parking garage in Miami Beach , Florida , can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night .
it means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little reindeer pavilion that 's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it 's designed to observe .
it doesn 't matter how we build , it matters what we build .
growing up in a family with three generations , I 've always been very close to my grandfather .
when I was four years old , my grandfather and I were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost .
motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom .
therefore , I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance .
I 've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now , and it 's had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wandering .
one thing I 'll never forget is when my device first caught my grandfather 's wandering out of bed at night .
after discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis , I remember my chief resident said to me , " Okay , take a deep breath . wash your face .
I would like you to pay attention to something .
this indirect protection that the unvaccinated people within a community receive simply by being surrounded by vaccinated people , is called herd immunity .
even more , it was fraudulent .
when the first cases began to come to light , we , here in Argentina , were entering the winter season .
we knew absolutely nothing .
we arrived at the hospital ; it was crowded .
we all had face masks in our pockets .
a theorem -- that really is forever .
( laughter ) The Pythagorean theorem is still true even though Pythagoras is dead , I assure you it 's true . ( laughter ) Even if the world collapsed the Pythagorean theorem would still be true .
who doesn 't have a truncated octahedron at home ? ( laughter ) Even a plastic one .
so , if you want to tell someone that you will love them forever you can give them a diamond .
a hostile artificial intelligence called NIM has taken over the world 's computers .
you could continue like this all the way to level 25 .
rural and suburban areas decay more slowly , but in largely unsurprising ways .
a toroid , for those who don 't know , is the surface of a doughnut or , for some of us , a bagel .
the toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building : every beam in this building is the same radius , all laminated wood .
( applause ) In 1976 , I was asked to design a children 's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem , which you see here the campus .
and so I made a counter @-@ proposal : I said , " No building . " there was a cave on the site ; we tunnel into the hill , descend through the rock into an underground chamber .
and so , you know , it 's one of those things that you don 't take too seriously .
let 's get back to the town and walk to the site . "
and that was a lot of heat to deal with .
and this is where it is ; it 's sort of evolving .
arrogance is incompatible with nature .
we all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene , right ?
but what do we know about maintaining our psychological health ?
why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health ?
we missed each other terribly , but international phone calls were really expensive then , and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week .
we decided to splurge , and that week , we would talk for 10 minutes .
I knew he would call in the morning , but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life .
loneliness won 't just make you miserable ; it will kill you .
I once worked with this woman who , after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce , was finally ready for her first date .
shocking , right , that a friend could be so cruel ?
but it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn 't the friend who said that .
it 's what the woman said to herself .
because we don 't prioritize our psychological health .
the problem is , the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important , so it 's a difficult habit to stop .
and that 's the world my brother wants to live in as well .
but Zen Buddhists practicing throughout China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question - why do we need an explanation ?
since these are intentionally unexplainable , it would be misguided to try and decipher these stories ourselves .
but one popular reading suggests that despite never having physically carried the traveler , Ekido broke monastic law by mentally " clinging to " the woman .
one such example finds three monks debating a temple flag rippling in the wind .
two things : number one , ACEs are incredibly common .
this isn 't science . this is just bad behavior . "
it turns out this is exactly where the science comes in .
so there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high @-@ risk behavior , and that 's important to know .
and that is wonderful if you 're in a forest and there 's a bear .
what I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement .
as an Arab female photographer , I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences .
( laughter ) Naughty Umm El @-@ Saad .
regarding her country , which treasured what has been called the Arab Spring , she said , " I 've always dreamt of discovering a new bacteria .
be who you to want to be , not who they want you to be .
but let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission .
now , in this project , I 'm using a cocreation approach , which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many artists .
more importantly , our studies showed that we could eliminate the possibility of this dangerous virus being transmitted into humans .
upon first arriving there , the first goal that I had was for me to identify an apartment , so I could bring my wife and my new baby , Melanie , out to join me in Idaho .
I said , " You mean he rented all five of them in one hour ? "
she 'll be with us as we drive , she 'll help us manage the children .
when I walked inside , the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks , some other people were coming in behind me .
and she reached over and turned the light off .
five of the grandchildren are boys .
I have master 's , Ph.D. , undergrad , one in medical school .
( laughter ) He doesn 't have a degree yet , but he wants to be a comedian .
because you never know , just because you 're funny at home , does not make you a comedian , right ?
and my response to that is this : " I don 't have the luxury of being angry , and I also know the consequences of being enraged . "
pretty interesting , right ?
we have lots of questions .
but if you want to get somewhere quickly , you now know to set your alarm for 4 : 45 in the morning and you 're all set .
here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents .
have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF and make sense of it ?
more of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo . I like that .
this is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years .
we can standardize our addresses , and if we do , we can get more maps like this .
and I thought to myself , typical government response , all right , moved on with my life .
it 's amazing . and a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog .
she and her patients experienced something that goes by a number of names-- imposter phenomenon , imposter experience , and imposter syndrome .
it 's not a disease or an abnormality , and it isn 't necessarily tied to depression , anxiety , or self @-@ esteem .
even simply finding out there 's a term for these feelings can be an incredible relief .
it 's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
( laughter ) So the question was , can it actually find marijuana in students ' lockers ?
it 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
and that , in fact , turns out to be true .
my name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya .
and I can already see a higher peak .
there 's no time to settle down .
yes , it may be hard to find talent .
and they were going up , and they finally made it to the peak .
as these digital tools find their way into medical rooms , and they become digitally ready , what happens to the digitally invisible ?
and so there was a big movement to put all this information online , to track all the ownership of these plots of land , put them in the cloud , and give them to the communities .
thank you .
there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere .
it 's the second highest contributor to climate change .
it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut .
but if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones , it could be pretty cheap .
then , you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself .
actually , what I 've shown here is a highly simplified picture .
well , first of all , we need to support a different business model for the Internet , one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth .
I have a playing card in my hand .
audience member : 10 of hearts .
not only that , but I will impose myself a time limit of one second , something that would look like this .
Hg : the king of spades , indeed .
audience member 3 : yes . Hg : yes ! perfect .
Hg : seven .
these C.O.s play a big factor in these young people 's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case .
you just have to choose words at random .
thank you very much .
he finds some clothes and gets dressed .
they could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other .
and what it also means is you can win .
( laughter ) But I loved it , and I got involved in these slams , and I became the U.K. slam champion and got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris , which was unbelievable .
( applause ) According to five French strangers .
a proper poor economy where so many are proper poor , but while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars .
there 'd been times when he 'd tried to hide his brightness , You see , every star hits periods of hardship , It takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness .
yes , the Sunshine Kid was bright , with a warm personality , And inside he burned savagely , Fueled by the fire inspired across galaxies By the girl who showed him belief .
this took place in my childhood , 1957 @-@ 65 .
that 's the 130 @-@ foot diameter library .
that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship .
that 's July ' 58 .
military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet .
so , they had a lot of fun doing this .
they got quite serious about the engineering of this .
well , here we have a little problem , the radiation doses at the crew station : 700 rads per shot .
so this is what NASA did , getting an eight @-@ man version that would go to Mars .
you know , it was going to be a nice , long trip .
the sort of artist conceptions .
it 's about discovery @-@ driven learning where you act , as opposed to plan , your way to the future .
experiments are usually about learning .
but to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the Build it From Scratch team , Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next @-@ generation system .
my job is to nurture the bottom @-@ up and not let it degenerate into chaos . "
we 've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you 'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens .
at HCL technologies , like at many companies , the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction and making sure that no one deviated from it .
what he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do .
so they began to work on that .
so I don 't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed .
and for this service , they were murdered , their families torn apart , and their story largely forgotten .
but they are also haunting the dark street of my mind .
so we were careful .
but darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal .
the consequence was moderate : he threw the food into my waste .
I would always long for the last song .
Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met .
sometimes that 's the only difference you make -- one individual , one family , a small group of individuals -- and it matters .
every life matters , or every life should matter .
we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself .
I know I 'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for .
there is a price for this type of life .
and yet , only a hundred years later , three quarters of us get cremated .
we wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die .
aid is not doing too well .
the Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model , which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge @-@ sharing .
perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition .
if you examine newspaper or magazine articles , you 'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS .
I 'm not saying women don 't get some of these symptoms .
when people respond to a woman 's anger with the thought , " Oh , it 's just that time of the month , " her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited .
interestingly , though , both websites say that the success of medication in treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman .
but it gets strange , because even at that slice of reality that we call home , we 're not seeing most of the action that 's going on .
but we 're not seeing all the waves out there .
now , across the animal kingdom , different animals pick up on different parts of reality .
so we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fifth day .
and this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a cochlear implant , which opens up this technology globally , even for the poorest countries .
now , we 've been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution , but what we 've been thinking a lot about is sensory addition .
so we 'll report on that later to see how well this goes .
we 're also expanding the umvelt of pilots .
okay , just like the movies .
oxygen inhibits that process .
so light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view , and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen , we could control this process .
or digital dentistry , and making these kinds of structures even while you 're in the dentist chair .
these are amazing microscale structures .
they can 't etch wafers that well .
but that wasn 't my fate .
that meant we could access all the information we wanted , when we wanted it , anytime , anywhere .
in 1998 , I lost my reputation and my dignity .
the landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine , whether or not someone actually made a mistake , and now , it 's for both public and private people .
sweet , sensitive , creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate while being intimate with another man .
a meta @-@ analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time , cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying .
millions of people , often anonymously , can stab you with their words , and that 's a lot of pain .
with every click , we make a choice .
changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs .
public shaming as a blood sport has to stop , and it 's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture .
she might still have a lot to learn about this world , but she 's already an expert at one very important task : to make sense of what she sees .
Raisuddin feels millions of bees stinging his face .
soon he was homeless and 60,000 dollars in medical debt , including a fee for dialing for an ambulance .
six years ago , I returned to America and realized something : the American Dream was thriving , but only in India .
he found a man who taught him database administration .
he 'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him back when he attended his trial .
and sent him on a journey of introspection and betterment .
he recalled promising God , as he lay dying in 2001 , that if he lived , he would serve humanity all his days .
America today is a sprightly young body , hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side , while leaving the other worryingly perfect .
here is an excerpt from their phone call .
thank you from my heart .
go back further , and it 's even more striking : since the 60s , the middle class has shrunk by 20 percent , mainly because of the people tumbling out of it .
what I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life .
and that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie " The Secret . "
once I bought the building for about 18,000 dollars , I didn 't have any money left .
and so I was trying to wake them up using culture .
we found that that was so exciting for folk , and people were so responsive to the work , that we had to then find bigger buildings .
they used to call me softy , meaning the soft , harmless boy .
like every other human being , I avoided trouble .
we had a president , Moi , who was a dictator .
we traveled the country and showed the images , and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path , where I decided to become silent no more , to talk about those things .
we have delivered live pigs to Kenya 's parliament as a symbol of our politicians ' greed .
it has been done in Uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
( applause ) Tom Rielly : it 's an amazing story .
so we package our activism and we package our message in art .
I was taken completely by surprise .
so I thought about it , I wrote my 50 words , and a few weeks later , Chris called and said , " Go for it . "
this is the picture of us at that interview .
he passed away very suddenly a few days later .
every day , people come up to me and say , " I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother , but I waited too long . "
now , no one has to wait anymore .
I hope you 'll help us make this wish come true .
interview a family member , a friend or even a stranger .
" what is England and why am I going there ? "
my interests were scientific , the market was commercial -- things such as payroll , which I found rather boring .
if I had the opportunity , honestly , I wouldn 't go back to being sighted .
we have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly 40 countries .
what do you have that we don 't have ?
it works through surfaces .
he said it was something like having x @-@ ray vision .
it 's interesting . when people make a sound , when they laugh , when they fidget , when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever , I hear everything .
no one to figure out what tools should be used .
and these things are really a global failure .
the first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers .
if it had gotten into a lot more urban areas , the case numbers would have been much larger .
the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola , or it could be bioterrorism .
one of those cities is called Washington , and the other is called Beijing .
( laughter ) I 've been called Kevin all my life .
[ in Chinese ] There was a big pause on the other side of the room .
this guy is an American . his name 's Graham Allison .
it could never happen again . "
there 's another country too , and that 's called the U.S.
and worldwide , act further , like you 've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart .
of course , all that happens if you 've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above .
this is what our head tells us we need to do , but what about our heart ?
the important thing -- ( Applause ) The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology .
it was extraordinary to see , for example , old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents , like this lady here .
but the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America @-@ China relationship , and the possibilities of China 's future engagement in the world .
I think it 's time , across the world , that we 're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind .
Kevin Rudd : well , what we Australians do best is organize the drinks , so you get them together in one room , and we suggest this and suggest that , then we go and get the drinks .
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them , blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us .
together , this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky , like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System , and also how much light they receive from their parent sun .
2014 was the hottest year on record .
these planetary @-@ scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course .
but I 'm not a climate scientist , I 'm an astronomer .
you could say that I look for choice alien real estate .
each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Solar System .
Mars is small and rocky , and though it 's a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler .
indeed , it 's possible that Mars was habitable in the past , and in part , this is why we study Mars so much .
our rovers , like Curiosity , crawl across its surface , scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it .
private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars .
consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet , places that are lush by comparison with Mars .
even in the driest , highest places on Earth , the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests .
it is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves , but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together .
thank you .
I got into the field very young : I was seven years old .
that gyro @-@ power sends him over 100 feet at top speed .
I didn 't want to be a storyteller when I grew up , I wanted to be stuntman .
I started making music videos .
( applause ) Let 's talk about film now .
and we 've done incredible things with those rectangles .
it asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it .
and when he stops in front of a house , he stops in front of your house .
and I 'm essentially taking a piece of your history and putting it inside the framing of the story .
I asked my father if I cried when I was a baby and he says I did not .
and when you 're sitting there in her room , watching her , you 're not watching it through a television screen , you 're not watching it through a window , you 're sitting there with her .
and that 's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality .
and it can change people 's perception of each other .
and ultimately , we become more human .
the next group , 14 percent of the wealth , 21 , 22 and 32 .
but the fact is , it 's because I didn 't draw them on the same scale .
so what about other outcomes of wealth ?
we asked , what about things like health ?
what about life expectancy of infants ?
we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency -- basically , young kids and babies , because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation .
how do we get people to think differently about what we really want ?
and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life , and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us .
BF : you know , sometimes when people do those , they go all the way down .
BF : ... without a MacArthur grant .
DH : a type of juggling I actually invented , right after I saw another juggler do it .
( applause ) I 'm now pushing my luck : I 'm skipping right to six cups .
( audience : once on purpose ! ) DH : how about if I try first and then decide ?
BF : good idea . ( laughter ) Let 's leave that . we 'll leave that door open .
BF : that 's all right , he does that . all right .
BF : yeah . and so we 've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this .
he actually assumes more of the danger in this .
DH : Jesus Christ . Richard , please stand in front of me .
RW : in all past years I 've rehearsed with them , the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what 's going to happen and that 's the truth .
( laughter ) BF : no , come stay up with him .
OK , hold on .
( laughter ) DH : so Richard , what were we on the list ? like 1,020 ?
( laughter ) What happened there ?
BF : I think we were just outside .
RW : do I get to hold them ?
( laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) One more try . man , I don 't want to get too close .
so to do that , I will juggle these three razor @-@ sharp sickles .
DH : true . Barry ...
BF : up and over his shoulders .
( laughter ) Still juggling . ( laughter ) Impossible , you say ?
DH : why bother , you say ?
DH : I think so , that 's right .
DH : all right , we 'll do this trick , but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect .
DH : it 's not that difficult , we just don 't like to practice that much .
BF : over the top , over the top .
DH : how you feeling , Barry ? you feeling all right ?
DH : do you feel everything 's OK ? the atmosphere , the ...
DH : everything up here 's OK ?
we had to do eight maneuvers , and you see here , some of them were really big .
I won 't bore you with all the details of all the instruments , but it 's got everything .
nobody had expected this body to look like this .
here , you see the whole sequence again , but from a different perspective , and you see three blown @-@ ups from the bottom @-@ left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet .
it had departed again .
now , on a bit of a comical note here is that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce .
at that red line , there is a change .
so we 've been rather lucky that we are where we are .
I will never forget -- absolute madness , 250 TV crews in Germany .
he killed 63 percent of the Hazara population .
we found out that our three roommates -- Nawroz , Jaffar and Shabbir -- were also among those .
they were screaming .
the captain told us that we are not going to make it , we have to turn back the boat .
but luckily , the memory card survived .
when my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline , many of my friends came to know about my situation , and they tried to help me .
they don 't sleep in a quiet space .
and you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
the building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
this is society . this is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
( laughter ) They keep running .
( laughter ) My point is don 't control them , don 't protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
and this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
when I was 27 , hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was about to be sold to a brothel made me angry .
the whole night , I was angry .
let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself .
so I was very impressed with the leaders of my town who were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of Gandhian ideals .
I said , " Look at these leaders , they are so great , they are against untouchability .
by 8 o 'clock , we kept on waiting , because it 's not very uncommon that the leaders become late , for an hour or so .
so I thought that the dinner will take place , though not at that large a scale .
I went back to the venue , which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park .
it was 10 o 'clock .
then I sat down where the food was lying .
I kept my emotions on hold .
and she told me , " Kailash , why are you crying ?
it was total nonsense , and I refused to accept that punishment .
I was barred from entering into my own kitchen and my own dining room , my utensils were separated .
and then , later on , I gave a new name to myself : Satyarthi , that means , " seeker of truth . "
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 children , and 50 more will join , that 's not done .
( applause ) I knew that we needed global policies .
and the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down by one third in the last 15 years .
thank you so much .
fortunately , I was good enough that by the time I was 30 , I was able to move into the upstairs world of money management , where I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader .
[ " U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO @-@ to @-@ Worker Compensation Ratio " ] Now , higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth .
for anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that , right ?
so , we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability , but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on Earth .
all record is gone , erased by plate tectonics and erosion .
beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from .
this picture was sent by the Curiosity rover only a few weeks ago .
well , actually , it is .
it has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution , but also its habitability potential .
all together , they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway , and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end .
you can catch laughter from somebody else , and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them .
in our evolution , we have developed two different ways of vocalizing .
they seem to be different things to us .
for example , I could never pitch my voice that high to sing .
it 's very unambiguous , and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds .
and I think what that means is , even if you 're having your brain scanned , which is completely boring and not very interesting , when you hear somebody going , " A ha ha ha ha ha , " you 're trying to work out why they 're laughing .
the real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue .
so you 've got the two of them in there , and he 'll say to the husband , " Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you . "
he 's not laughing yet .
and now they 're all off .
it 's not something specific to humans -- it 's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better .
at the same time , the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed .
what makes blazars so special is that they 're some of the universe 's most efficient particle accelerators , transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy .
some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet , shown here in white .
we 'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context .
beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out , one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest @-@ energy jet emission comes from .
in this image , I 'm interested in where this white blob forms and if , as a result , there 's any relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material .
my research shows that in some instances , these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought .
who knew that chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth .
then again , when do we ever know where love 's first flutter will truly take us .
and now , a few years later , I 've led several expeditions to the ultimate far @-@ flung corner on this planet , the Sahara .
but that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years .
my fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria , a place called the Kem Kem .
there 's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara .
again , this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water , it 's useful for buoyancy control in the water .
to be honest , by personality , I 'm just not much of a crier .
I 'm a civil rights lawyer , and I 've seen some horrible things in the world .
it turns out that tears just aren 't much help when you 're trying to investigate a genocide .
and the things that I saw and experienced in Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering , it did , in moments , move me to tears .
it 's a cause that probably has involved all of us here .
I don 't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most jarring .
she sat down with me for hours , just ushered me in to the world of poverty .
when that last drop of cooking oil finally ran out .
she had to watch her youngest son , Peter , suffer from malnutrition , as his legs just slowly bowed into uselessness .
thirty @-@ five years ago , when I would have been graduating from high school , they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty .
moreover , the number of people in our world who are living in extreme poverty , which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day , that has fallen from 50 percent , to only 15 percent .
see , Griselda had every opportunity to go to school , it just wasn 't safe for her to get there .
these transformations are actually possible and they 're happening today .
and I want to urge you , when you get a chance , to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs .
the WorldWide Telescope takes the best images from the world 's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space , and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe .
I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I , in astronomy and in education , are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it 's truly transformative .
so , what you 're seeing here is a wonderful presentation , but it 's one of the tours .
and the tours are all totally interactive , so that if I were to go somewhere ...
growing up , I didn 't always understand why my parents made me follow the rules that they did .
like , why did I really have to mow the lawn ?
why couldn 't I put jelly beans in my oatmeal ?
and it 's not that they didn 't want me to think critically .
over the course of the past several months , the world has watched as unarmed black men , and women , have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante .
and it 's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it 's simply because they wanted to keep us alive .
now , genetic modification is not new ; virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner .
I went to the greenhouse and I saw that the conventional variety that was flooded for 18 days had died , but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered , called Sub1 , was alive .
in the 1950s , this virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii .
he took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it into the papaya genome .
that 's because these insecticide sprays are difficult to find , they 're expensive , and they don 't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants .
in the genetic approach , scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eggplant genome .
will this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh ?
how do we know that there isn 't a big risk of some unintended consequence ?
it 's making something that 's pure dangerous in some way , and I think you 're saying that that whole model just misunderstands how nature is .
PR : thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Isadora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue curtain , and she would stand with her hands over her solar plexus and she would wait , and she would wait , and then , she would move .
blue curtain .
( music ) Where are we ?
( laughter ) This is the normal way for things to be .
another way to look at this is to think of world GDP over the last 10,000 years , I 've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph .
so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we 've achieved , and everything we care about , depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind .
so rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features , we create algorithms that learn , often from raw perceptual data .
now of course , A.I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful , cross @-@ domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has .
but in computers , signals can travel at the speed of light .
so at one end we have the village idiot , and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten , or Albert Einstein , or whoever your favorite guru is .
suppose we give an A.I. the goal to make humans smile .
another example , suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem .
they certainly had reasons .
or maybe you could pretend to malfunction , and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you , they look at the source code -- Bam ! -- the manipulation can take place .
sooner or later , it will out .
making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that .
and so in order to be able to access the brain , you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools .
a few years ago , we started a company called Backyard Brains and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight , and I want to do some demonstrations .
let 's take a look at it as well .
I want you to move your arm as well .
and I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer .
most of us think of motion as a very visual thing .
( audio ) Mary had a little lamb ! little lamb ! little lamb !
so at this point , a lot of people see this work , and they immediately think about surveillance .
so here 's an object , and in this case , it 's a wire figure in the shape of a human , and we 're going to film that object with just a regular camera .
but all in all , it 's a pretty good path .

is it a hookup , a love story , paid sex , a chat room , a massage with a happy ending ?
today , monogamy is one person at a time .
( laughter ) We used to marry , and had sex for the first time .
I 've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference .
( laughter ) It applies to you .
so because there is no universally agreed @-@ upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity , estimates vary widely , from 26 percent to 75 percent .
and alchemy is the key word here , because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving , can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking .
as Marcel Proust said , it 's our imagination that is responsible for love , not the other person .
and I am it : I 'm chosen , I 'm unique , I 'm indispensable , I 'm irreplaceable , I 'm the one .
infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love .
but if throughout history , infidelity has always been painful , today it is often traumatic , because it threatens our sense of self .
" can I ever trust anyone again ? "
and Heather realizes these are not for her .
she also tells me that her father had affairs , but her mother , she found one little receipt in the pocket , and a little bit of lipstick on the collar .
they feel alive .
and they often will tell me stories of recent losses -- of a parent who died , and a friend that went too soon , and bad news at the doctor .
so for the partner who had the affair , for Nick , one thing is to end the affair , but the other is the essential , important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife .
what were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me ?
what is it about us that you value ?
in other words , the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage .
I am not French .
the main question that I 've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about infidelity is , for or against ?
that 's the way it is .
RM : it 's that extra " lol " that makes it sound weird .

I mean , to me , this was it . life could not get any better .
there was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot , where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site .
but to me , that trip was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches .
we were in this tiny , remote fjord , just inside the Arctic Circle .
it had a greater population of sheep than people , so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found .
you traveled all this way , and this is exactly what you 've been waiting for : freezing cold conditions with perfect waves .
but that was the point that I felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me , and what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full @-@ on blizzard , and I started to lose perception of where I was .
actually , I was totally freaking out -- ( Laughter ) -- and I was borderline hypothermic , and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water .
and I don 't know if it was delirium setting in or what , but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time .
in 2011 , during the final six months of Kim Jong @-@ Il 's life , I lived undercover in North Korea .
when I arrived , they became my students .

they had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs .
I started with a game .
we played " Truth and Lie . "
these students , however , were simply told what to think , and they obeyed .

Mr : correct . I would say in some ways I change my gender about as often as I change my hairstyle .
I wore down their resistance , and they had no hope this drug would even work , by the way , and they tried to tell me , " You 're just wasting your time .
but finally , for 25,000 dollars and agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get , they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug .
they said , " Oh , Martine , there 's no medicine for Jenesis .
come and join Martine here .

ILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits .
because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system , we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that , and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon .

AE : hi there !
( laughter ) So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video , but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release .
it 's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us .
and the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets .
this is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years .
so , please don 't email me one of your crazy theories .
well , I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said , " Sure , come and talk to me . "
and that theory was that life produces all small molecules , so many molecules .
so working on the models and thinking about biochemistry , it 's all well and good .
how are we going to find these planets ?
and this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope .
it 's about tens of meters in diameter .
now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
and in this case , I just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space .
well , in the best case , we will find an image of another exo @-@ Earth .
here is Earth as a pale blue dot .
but there 's more .
Fred Jansen : you mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet .
actually , what we expect is what we call our next @-@ generation Hubble telescope .
you have this immense curiosity , this stubbornness , this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say .
but I didn 't start out wanting to be a part of somebody 's crime reduction strategy .
I wanted a 15- , 20,000 @-@ member church .
I wanted my own clothing line .
and something needed to be done about that .
you would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night , and to the untrained ear , it sounded like fireworks , but it was gunfire .
and I was doing funerals , but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who 'd lived a long life and there 's a lot to say .
I was doing funerals of 18 @-@ year @-@ olds , 17 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact .
you all have heard of rap music , right ?
RAP music ?
and he said , " Don 't do that again , Rev. "
( laughter ) But I preached and I built these programs , and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference .
they met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester , and they were killed .
I mean , isn 't this a law enforcement issue ?
and as a result of that , we said to them , " How do you see this church , how do you see this institution helping this situation ? "
the Boston Miracle was about bringing people together .
we had law enforcement partners .
I believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now .
I 'm not accusing anyone , bias is not an accusation .
what does that tell us ?
and the cool thing about it is that it 's pretty entertaining .
( laughter ) And I was like , " Thanks , guys . "
now , in 2010 , The Australian National University did an experiment where they sent out 4,000 identical applications to entry level jobs , essentially .
and the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they 've acknowledged it , but I 'm not really sure what they 're doing about it .
but also , I 've been blessed with amazing mentors who 've opened doors for me that I didn 't even know were there .
how are we going to feed everybody , get water to everybody , provide power to everybody , avoid the worst impacts of climate change ?
how lame is that ?
you probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger , or arresting corrupt politicians .
I 've spent years pouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in the United States , and I 've come to the conclusion that the FBI is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists .
after 9 / 11 , the FBI was given an edict : never again .
to do this , agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 informants nationwide , all looking for anyone who might be dangerous .
the FBI 's informant was Robert Childs , a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid 90,000 dollars for his work on the case .
Osmakac also had schizoaffective disorder .
but here 's what 's interesting : the lead undercover agent -- you can see him in this picture with his face blurred -- would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on .
and he got a Hollywood ending .
he 's one of more than 175 so @-@ called terrorists , for whom the FBI has created Hollywood endings .
it 's really just theater , a national security theater , with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac unwitting actors in a carefully choreographed production brought to you by the FBI .
( applause ) Tom Rielly : so , those are some pretty strong accusations , pretty strong charges .
how can you back this up ?
Trevor Aaronson : my research began in 2010 when I received a grant from the Investigative Reporting Program at U.C. Berkeley , and a research assistant and I put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during the first decade after 9 / 11 .
and we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups , whether an informant was used , and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur by providing the means and opportunity .
so my story in The Intercept , which was just published today , tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting and goes into much greater detail .
in this talk , I could only highlight the things that they said , such as calling him a " retarded fool . "
but it was much more elaborate , they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac 's hands , which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent .
Ta : well so far , we only know what 's come out in the court file , but they seem to suggest it 's another example of the same .
these types of sting operations have moved from flavor to flavor .
there 's a big family , there 's a very beautiful tree , and I make these pictures with this very large , extremely cumbersome , very awkward technical plate film camera .
I 've got the family , spent the better part of a day talking with them .
I 'm setting it up and I 'm setting up , and the light 's just about to go , and I want it to be golden , I want it to be beautiful .
and they start screaming , and then one of the men turns around and starts screaming , shouting , and the whole tree collapses , not the tree , but the people in the tree .
what 's your story ? who are you ? "
I mean , I have teenage kids . I should know .
it was about a boyfriend . the girl on the top , she 'd kissed the wrong boy , and they 'd started having a fight .
it wasn 't just about turning up . it wasn 't just about shaking a hand .
it wasn 't about just saying , " I 'm Jimmy , I 'm a photographer . "
I had to get to know every single one of them , right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who .
I need something for the eye to look at . I need a white goat in the middle . "
I wanted to put these people on a pedestal .
until , it was quite amusing , about a year ago somebody said , " You 've been invited to do a TED Talk . "
he said , " No , a TED Talk . " I said , " But who 's Ted ?
I thought , lessons , okay , well , what did I learn ? good question .
( laughter ) And I thought , three lessons , well , I 'm going to think about it .
I traveled enormously as a child .
I was very nomadic . it was actually very exciting .
so I kept running and I kept running , and I sort of got somewhere and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought , well , where do I belong ? where do I fit ?
what am I ? where am I from ? I had no idea .
and it was only until I went on a journey , a journey that was so extreme , I still get shivers when I think about it .
it 's 13 hours ' flight from Moscow .
when we arrived there , after a month of traveling across the ice , and we 'd got to them , but then I was not allowed to photograph them .
they said , " You CANNOT photograph us . you have to wait .
and I thought , okay , chief dying , right , you know , look up at the stars again , look at the campfire .
and somebody said , " You have to show them the picture of the Nenets . the Nenets . "
I 'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks .
they see a few rubber ducks and learn that they float , or a few balls and learn that they bounce .
let 's find out .
it doesn 't get better than that .
all right , it 's nice that babies will generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls , and it 's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us , but we 've known those things about babies for a very long time .
this time , we 're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls , and guess what ?
you [ probably won 't ] randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls .
( video ) HG : two , three . go ! ( music ) LS : one , two , three , go !
of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can 't make them work .
( video ) HG : two , three , go ! ( music ) Let me try one more time . one , two , three , go !
folks , human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data .
human minds generate research and discovery , and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater , and human minds take care of other humans : our old , our young , our sick .
in the years to come , we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even envision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .
it has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you .
LS : I think so . you 'll have some machine learning folks up here .
now we 're trying to ask , " Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
we 're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we 've never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
( laughter ) They laughed more than you guys are . ( laughter ) And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
when we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there 's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we knew there 's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here 's an example of it : there 's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
these organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
here 's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically .
these are pictures over about a six @-@ second period .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple ; it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
with bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
here 's the pull part .
Uber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too .
we all know what he 's talking about .
well that 's great , we can get in and out of the store quickly .
you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
you just wanted to dive in .
I simply picked up the piece of fruit , dug at it with my nails , tried to flick it off , and then wondered , " Was there another sticker ? "
your hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel , looking at every single object out there -- the cars , the lights , the pedestrians .
so much so , that I couldn 't even talk to anyone else in the car and I couldn 't even listen to music .
but then something interesting happened .
it started to become fun and second nature .
it was a cold , wet , snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar .
now probably , most of those passengers just thought , " It 's a fact of life , he 's got to open the window to clean it .
why ?
well , it 's seeing the invisible problem , not just the obvious problem , that 's important , not just for product design , but for everything we do .
he looked at me , puzzled , and said , " Why doesn 't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail ? " ( laughter ) I was like , " That 's a pretty good question . "
because she had saved me .
I think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking .
I spent time in jails and brothels , interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement , NGO workers .
you probably think about a young girl or woman , who 's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp .
that is real suffering , and that is a real story .
we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl .
that story lets us off the hook .
forced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking .
and it 's found in cotton fields , and coltan mines , and even car washes in Norway and England .
it 's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan .
it 's found in Thailand 's fishing industry .
but what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp ?
Thai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants onto fishing boats .
the scheme in that case was incredible .
they then located winners of the green card lottery , and they told them , " We 'll help you out .
all you have to do is take this young girl with you , say that she 's your sister or your spouse .
so what have we done about it ?
they 're migrants , people of color .
having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty , leave abuse , or leave prostitution , if that person so desires .
I 'd like to add one more element to that .
but once they were brought over , their passports were confiscated .
they worked so hard they fainted in the fields .
they finished one meal with this plate of perfect , long @-@ stemmed strawberries , and as they handed them to me , they said , " Aren 't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the States ?
and don 't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you ? "
I found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor , and God knows who else .
and all of this had been hidden to me , before I had tried to understand it .
that 's not how it works .
this is the decision to change a system that is broken , and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long .
but that is not my experience of them .
these Indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post @-@ Hurricane Katrina reconstruction .
the story as I 've told it to you is messy and unfinished .
a confession : I am an archaeologist and a museum curator , but a paradoxical one .
communities around the world don 't want to see their culture in distant institutions which they have no control over .
yet these claims pale in comparison to those made by Native Americans .
in the 1880s , anthropologists began to collect them as evidence of American Indian religion .
they came to be seen as beautiful , the precursor to the stark sculptures of Picasso and Paul Klee , helping to usher in the modern art movement .
for Zunis , the War God is not a piece of art , it is not even a thing .
its necklace had once been stolen .
he said , " We give all of the objects to the world . "
shortly after I walked into my new school , a huge fight broke out among the girls .
after things were quickly under control , I immediately called a meeting in the school 's auditorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal .
shortly as I approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter , and found the door locked with chains , I could hear Ashley 's voice in my ears going , " Miss ! miss !
we took the chains off the front doors of the school .
we got the lightbulbs replaced , and we cleaned every classroom to its core , recycling every , every textbook that was not needed , and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture .
that brings me to my second slogan : so what ? now what ?
I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too .
I know what it feels like to go to a school that 's not a school .
I insist on it , and because of this , we can accomplish things together .
they are clear about my expectations for them , and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system .
the mystery is this : what is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences , such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet ?
then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe , again because it looks that way .
hence if the living creature were removed , all these qualities would be annihilated . "
well , neuroscientists tell us that they are creating , in real time , all the shapes , objects , colors , and motions that we see .
they lose all interest in the real females .
the same is true of the train .
then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way .
thank you very much .
so I think that we 'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it .
right . class , let 's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin .
so class , hopefully you 'll recognize what you just heard me say as the -- ?
very good , the cellular phone announcement .
right ? this was also known as a mobile phone .
( laughter ) So the format of today 's class is I will be presenting multiple BERT modules today from that period in history , right , so starting circa 2016 .
remember , these early modules in these people 's full identities were protected , and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic , which for many of them was taboo .
but you see the sign ? you get it ? P @-@ I @-@ E @-@ C @-@ E. No justice , no piece of us .
right . so that , that is the unique part of it for me , right , is that I ended up in both , first in the convent , and then in the prostitution after . that 's right .
well , surprise , surprise , I fell in love with another fella much older than me , and I always say I was just so happy because he didn 't drink , I married the bastard .
yeah , this kid , I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points .
we were , like , 10 , I think .
no , I don 't think I said anything , I just finished playing and went home .
I will see you for " Sell / Buy / Date . "
what if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly , just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would ?
and the valence is actually quite negative , so you must have been a big fan .
women in their 20s smile a lot more than men the same age , perhaps a necessity for dating .
we are expressive when we 're emailing , texting , shopping online , or even doing our taxes .
in education , imagine if your learning apps sense that you 're confused and slow down , or that you 're bored , so it 's sped up , just like a great teacher would in a classroom .
thank you .
those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world .
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biologist , I didn 't like that at all .
so I 'd like to draw a little car here -- I 'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him .
if I want to make a little script to do this over and over again , I just drag these guys out and set them going .
so what if I click this down to zero ?
by the time my generation walked the streets , disinvestment at the local , state and federal level , eroded infrastructure , and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community .
called me by a name I did not recognize , said " lesbian , " but I was more boy than girl , more Ken than Barbie .
my mother fears I have named myself after fading things .
so what are you gonna do ? "
" let 's let that big old cloud of blood dissipate a bit before we have to surface through all of these sharks . "
so it turned out , I 'd broken off a tip of the urchin spine in the joint itself , and that 's why it wasn 't getting better .
so the orthopedist says , " You know , we should get this out .
nothing too urgent , not an emergency . "
we have a wonderful 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter , who did all my illustrations .
you don 't need to worry , though : that I am not fully human is one of the things that my family loves the most about me .
they 'll come sing some songs , sprinkle some fairy dust , it 's great .
we get there at 10 o 'clock , the scheduled start time , and we are handed number 59 .
( laughter ) There were cardboard cut @-@ out snowflakes covering the floor , glitter on every flat surface , and icicles all over the walls .
( laughter ) I mean , the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing .
there is no middle , there is no gray , just polarity .
polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other ; a diametrical opposition .
but if we are pulled in these two directions , but it 's not really where we exist -- polarity is not our actual reality -- where do we go from there ?
those are the people I know , those are my friends and family , that is the majority of our society , that is you , that is me .
but the question is : can we own our duality ?
can we have the courage to hold both things ?
her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico .
( laughter ) That line actually went the other way .
but we were united by our similarities , not separated by our differences .
those were the things that brought us together .
and he said , [ in Spanish ] " A girlfriend ? ! ? "
and his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect , grabbed his plate , walked off , went back to work .
she never made eye contact with me .
she left , did the same thing -- it was a 10 @-@ second conversation , such a short interaction .
and a little bit later , they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish , that had nothing to do with me , and that is duality .
it wasn 't Jesus or Ash .
it 's broadly considered a test for empathy , and the groups that scored highly on this did better .
or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective ?
so how does this play out in the real world ?
and the problem the engineer confronted was , what quantity of waste to cater for ?
Arup believes that the culture of helpfulness is central to their success .
now that sounds so obvious , and we think it 'll just happen normally , but it doesn 't .
at Idexx , a company up in Maine , they 've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business can work together and get to know the whole business that way .
what matters is the mortar , not just the bricks .
now , when you put all of this together , what you get is something called social capital .
not a bad return on social capital , which compounds even as you spend it .
so I went and I sat in on the auditions at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London .
it 's just , they don 't last very long .
it 's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers , because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves . "
I have passionate opinions about gender equality , but I worry that to freely accept the label of " feminist , " would not be fair to good feminists .
Oh , so I call myself a Bad Feminist .
( laughter ) So , what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation , has become a thing .
let me take a step back .
there are many ways in which I 'm doing feminism wrong .
( laughter ) Think about it .
I think of them , and suddenly , the better choice becomes far easier to make .
and in my other , I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman .
but when our story begins , he was better known as Johnny " Bull " Walker .
he was a heel ; he was a hero .
one night , The Terrible Turk 's big toe scratched a scar like Capone 's down the side of his face .
it took too long , so he started organizing group meetings over lunch .
so over the next eight years , Bonica would talk about it .
the goal wasn 't to make patients better ; it was to make patients feel better .
I think most of you do , but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism .
for most of the 20th century , clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered , but that story turned out to be wrong , and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health .
Kanner knew about this competing paper , but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work .
clarity or mystery ?
the four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system , which has significance within the story .
and then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors , which basically he does later on in the story .
what does this mean ?
this is using all the same elements .
( laughter ) And if there 's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk , I hope it 's this : Blih blih blih blah . blah blah blih blih . [ " ' judge This , ' Chip Kidd " ] Blih blih blah blah blah . blah blah blah .
and this group was no different .
bacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes .
but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me .
and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality .
now , that 's a big number , so let 's put it in perspective .
he doesn 't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around .
now , conventional wisdom would say that we 'll just take these driver assistance systems and we 'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them , and over time , they 'll turn into self @-@ driving cars .
the better the technology gets , the less reliable the driver is going to get .
now , if we look at the bottom left corner here , this is your classic car .
we just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two .
they 'll happen , but very low frequency .
but let 's look at it from a different direction for a moment .
so if you compare the distance between these two , it 's about 10 to the eighth , right ?
and then once you have that problem solved , the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction .
similarly , the orange box on the side here , it 's a school bus , and we have to treat that differently as well .
and when a police officer stood in the road , our vehicle should understand that this means stop , and when they signal to go , we should continue .
how soon can we bring it out ?
my oldest son is 11 , and that means in four and a half years , he 's going to be able to get his driver 's license .
audience : save it !
Capt A : I haven 't got a clue . does it matter ?
Capt A : listen ... saving that kid is all that matters .
DC : OK , we are not going to learn anything from this guy .
we need to do something .
maybe there 's something we can learn here .
g : you 're my bestie , we 'll always be together !
I need to deal with thousands and thousands of variables , conditions and possibilities .
as a four @-@ year @-@ old child , it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine .
I made my mind up there and then that one day , somehow , I was going to sail around the world .
age 10 , it was saving my school dinner money change .
every single day for eight years , I had mashed potato and baked beans , which cost 4p each , and gravy was free .
I felt like my life depended on that moment , and incredibly , he said yes .
just like in my dreams , there were amazing parts and tough parts .
after three months at sea , age just 24 , I finished in second position .
she was a multihull .
if we didn 't sail fast enough , we 'd be engulfed by that storm , and either capsized or smashed to pieces .
it 's not too stressful . we can concentrate .
take that 50 , 60 , 70 , accelerate through to 80 , 90 , 100 miles an hour .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation , even as a passenger .
you 're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in , and you have to make every single decision on board .
but out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs .
it 's hard to explain , but you enter a different mode when you head out there .
no experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word " finite . "
materials would be defined as either technical or biological , waste would be designed out entirely , and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term .
all of this sounds amazing , but these aren 't just ideas , they 're real today , and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy .
so how would you shift from linear to circular ?
well , the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world , with leading businesses within the world , with the biggest convening platforms in the world , and with governments .
I believe yes .
when I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
so what have we taught the machine to see ?
the pick @-@ and @-@ roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players , two on offense and two on defense .
so we go to the machine and say , " Good morning , machine .
please find a way to tell the difference . "
it turns out in modern basketball , this pick @-@ and @-@ roll is perhaps the most important play .
and knowing how to run it , and knowing how to defend it , is basically a key to winning and losing most games .
the guy guarding the ball can either go over or under .
it would make our lives a lot easier , but it turns out movement is very messy .
coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations .
and it 's very exciting , it 's much more than the pick @-@ and @-@ roll .
can it know more than person could know ?
and it turns out the answer is yes .
until now .
what are their angles ?
we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances ?
( laughter ) Those are NBA players .
the size is the size of the player and the color is the position .
on the x @-@ axis , we have the shot probability .
people who are good are at the top , bad at the bottom .
Miami was down by three , there was 20 seconds left .
a gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie .
and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second , and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before .
the only difference is , instead of the professional players , it 's us , and instead of a professional announcer , it 's me .
down three .
[ calculating shot probability ] [ Shot quality ] [ Rebound probability ] Won 't go !
tie game with five seconds left .
( laughter ) That 's roughly how it happened .
and on this journey , I started to learn who they are , and they began to learn who I am .
and the anchor said to me , " But don 't you think it 's our job as journalists to sensationalize a story ? "
you know what the women said to me ?
you do not respect the traditions of our society , of our community . "
( applause ) In my community , that was the first time a community , they had to call the bylaws , the first bylaw that protected girls in our community .
( applause ) So when the bill passed , we texted them back , " Thank you for supporting the bill . "
now , in Malawi , 18 is the legal marriage age , from 15 to 18 .
I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation .
and trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways , they really embody this human desire for order , for balance , for unity , for symmetry .
we can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain .
we can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people .
this is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Perl developers .
Perl is a famous programming language , and here , you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files , and working together on a given project .
and these are actually 15 different typologies I 've been collecting over time , and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor .
you probably couldn 't find more disparate topics , yet they are using the same metaphor , the same visual model , to map the never @-@ ending complexities of its own subject .
but networks are not just a scientific metaphor .
as designers , researchers , and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems , they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields , like painting and sculpture , and influencing many different artists .
Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement , and she creates these striking , imaginary landscapes , where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization .
this is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement .
and I think the title really says it all -- it 's called : " galaxies Forming Along Filaments , Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider 's Web . "
thank you so much .
how would I know what the right decision was ?
coming of age on the beaches of Southern California , I grew up in the middle of our nation 's abortion wars .
I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade .
everyone was pro @-@ life .
and then I did .
it was a step towards the unknown .
abortion is common .
but as much as abortion is hotly debated , it 's still rare for us , whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people , to talk with one another about the abortions that we have .
between what happens in politics and what happens in real life , and in that gap , a battlefield mentality .
and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life .
the first thing we did was create a talk @-@ line , where women and men could call to get emotional support .
" God . "
and researchers can even make the materials release different signals over time .
I thought that would lead to cultural and social change .
Jeanie , Will and Adina are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship .
( laughter ) The trio set out on a daily adventure to coffee and doughnut shops , bus stops and street corners .
we often think that as we age , we lose the desires held in our youth .
but beyond challenging sociocultural norms about the elderly , the trio sheds light on fear of remoteness .
I didn 't do it as well , but we managed to get Youssou N 'Dour , Sting , Tracy Chapman , and Bruce Springsteen to go ' round the world for Amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
at first , we were safe in the camp .
but later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot .
they kept telling us , " Tell the truth ! " as they beat us .
no , not at all , no problem , take your time .
you can say a person is lying .
well , you have to remember that TV was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal .
OK . so there is the pressure @-@ sensitive display in operation .
so it 's not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it 's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn 't be presented before .
and it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium .
narrator : this is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red .
the two @-@ headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds , in forward or reverse .
NN : I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language .
he says , " Well , reading is this junk they give me in little books to read .
the child read beautifully , it turned out , and was really very competent . so it actually meant something .
and it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing .
participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling , things like , " If you could be any kind of animal , what would you be ? "
he 's from England , and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn .
this is Carl .
the physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior .
there 's nowhere where that 's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests -- sex .
so that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive , and females are passive and coy .
but that 's just not the case .
so for example , take katydids , which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers .
( laughter ) Okay , they would not be able to do that very often .
people have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia .
and the idea is that what 's true for a person will also be true for the white rat .
and females as a kind of variant -- something special that you only study after you get the basics down .
because they assumed that the world 's stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor , walk @-@ on roles .
but when we do that , we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like .
well , the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them .
now , you know , people write fiction and talk about parallel universes .
the allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal .
people would admit shameful secrets about themselves , and other people would say , " Oh my God , I 'm exactly the same . "
voiceless people realized that they had a voice , and it was powerful and eloquent .
advertisers would withdraw their advertising .
I think they were clueless : I think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasingly horrific reality .
when a woman gets shamed , it 's , " I 'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus . "
before that , she worked with adults with learning difficulties , and was apparently really good at her job .
Justine was fired , of course , because social media demanded it .
and of course , that 's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for , like having children out of wedlock .
word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco .
what 's true is that we are clever and stupid ; what 's true is that we 're grey areas .
isn 't it nice ?
( laughter ) The key phrase is " was , " phew .
these are the " Can I ? " questions : can I work while I have cancer ?
of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
for example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for La Cura .
in 2012 , when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gab√©s , in the south of Tunisia , I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city .
it was a universal call for peace , tolerance , and acceptance coming from the side that we don 't usually portray in a good way in the media .
you don 't need to know the meaning to feel the piece .
I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets , and I learned that iambic Pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears .
everything is out of context , and that means context allows for everything : self Parking , Events Center , Shark Reef .
but , you might ask , why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model , alongside well @-@ known particles like electrons and photons and quarks , if it hadn 't been discovered back then in the 1970s ?
and you find this whether it 's world history , or mathematics , or science , or whatever it is .
imagine what it would be like if the English alphabet had four letters .
would life with more letters be able to tell different stories , maybe even more interesting ones ?
the last thing I want to say to you , the most important thing that I want to say to you , is that the time of semisynthetic life is here .
( laughter ) I remember watching , in 2003 , an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then @-@ US Defense Secretary , Donald Rumsfeld .
and Rumsfeld 's answer is , " Well , we don 't do body counts on other people . "
I don 't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras , which are recording what I 'm saying .
so now give me this banana . "
no chimpanzee will ever believe such a story .
human rights , just like God and heaven , are just a story that we 've invented .
it is actually worth 10 bananas . "
and if I believe it , and you believe it , and everybody believes it , it actually works .
that can work .
( laughter ) To conclude , then : we humans control the world because we live in a dual reality .
I also went fishing .
my poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew , but they weren 't bluffing about their social beliefs .
the St. George 's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration , and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become .
I rented this place for myself , also by phone .
given the conservatism of these cops , there 's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture .
when I rented a gun , the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind , until I showed him my New York City driver 's license .
in North Idaho , in my red pickup truck , I kept a notepad .
and in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people .
( laughter ) Indeed , most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists ; in fact , they 're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all .
( laughter ) The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church , a megachurch that 's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus .
the reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind .
( laughter ) And yet , some things haven 't changed .
it 's a devastating irony , how we have gone forward as individuals , and backwards as communities .
one of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042 .
as such , will there be more Whitopias ?
( laughter ) I didn 't expect to learn so much about myself .
I don 't expect I 'll be living in a Whitopia -- or a Blacktopia , for that matter .
I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get .
I have a few insights to share , but first : a little history .
Oracy , literacy and numeracy were great developments in communication .
nearly 3,000 years later , the first proper writing systems took shape .
shortly after , Charles Minard charted Napoleon 's march on Moscow , illustrating how an army of 422,000 dwindled to just 10,000 as battles , geography and freezing temperatures took their toll .
( laughter ) Sometimes I produce code to quickly generate graphics from thousands of data points .
a policy that clearly says , the company prohibits sex @-@ buying during work , with company resources or on company time .
my teachers insisted that I would go for an eye test .
and as we 've shown , it doesn 't make just a health and social difference , it creates huge economic benefit .
and for Mama Jane , it wasn 't just restoring her sight , it meant the opportunity to restore hope , to restore joy and to restore dignity .
but since its creation in the early 1980s , Hezbollah has also set up a political party , a social @-@ service network , and a military apparatus .
they build schools , they run hospitals , they set up vocational @-@ training programs or micro @-@ loan programs .
and the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated , the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state .
I 'm going to go right into the slides .
I don 't want you to see what I 'm doing up here .
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings I liked or not .
and after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sketches on napkins .
and the client said , " Why no fish ? "
three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings saying we 'd won the competition .
couldn 't find it .
and when I got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail .
I said , " If I can 't get the craft that I want , I 'll use the craft I can get . "
it 's copper and galvanize .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
and I call it , " David and Goliath . "
I just joined the points .
the reality , with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad .
it 's kind of like a whole built town .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
you go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there 's another bridge here .
and I struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner .
these are the models for it .
and then this kind of twist , with this balcony and the skirt , kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer .
it 's like a drug addict .
I say , " I 'm not going to do it anymore -- I don 't want to do it anymore -- I 'm not going to do it . "
we 've had a lot of fun working together .
see , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
and the plan of this -- it 's a concert hall .
you have to then try and get that back in some way .
that 's the idea .
time goes on .
( laughter ) I can do things like read and write music .
I am a very visual thinker .
my personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm .
my family finally rescued me , but by that time , I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks , as well as developing severe anemia , and was on the verge of suicide .
the app Podium , released by my company , AutismSees , has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills .
in addition , we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world , in real time .
we were hungry .
we all feel the same things .
however , engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial .
and that 's when the emails started pouring in , sometimes as many as a thousand a day .
thank you for giving me a voice . "
in a few early success stories , a leading French hospitality company , Accor , has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020 .
in the first two stages , moderate stress can actually help experiences enter your memory .
it would be nice if some stress also helped us remember facts , but unfortunately , the opposite is true .
the reason for this inhibition is so the fight / flight / freeze response can overrule slower , more reasoned thought in a dangerous situation .
during the winter , struggling to get warm , my neighbors would have no choice but to bypass the meter after their heat was shut off , just to keep their family comfortable for one more day .
in the US , the average American spends three percent of their income on energy .
look -- given our rockets to Mars and our pocket @-@ sized AI , we have the tools to address these systemic inequities .
cost of renewables , insulation , microgrids and smart home technology are all decreasing .
our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities , utilities and government agencies alike to provide equitable access to clean energy , energy efficiency and energy technology .
we 're connecting neighborhoods to community solar and spearheading community @-@ led smart home research and installation programs to help families bring down their energy bills .
and these programs do help millions of people , but they 're only able to help a fraction of those in need .
in fact , there is a 47 @-@ billion @-@ dollar home @-@ energy affordability gap , so assistance alone is not sustainable .
and I know high energy burdens are a tremendous barrier to overcome , but through relationships with communities and technology , we have the paths to overcome them .
thank you .
you swallow an aspirin .
but for this pill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stomach , intestines and various other organs first .
now , all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment , which is a life @-@ long treatment that must be swallowed by patients .
one day , I sat and thought , " Can we deliver anti @-@ HIV directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? "
before you even know it , the induced hole becomes immediately repaired .
but one day , if successful , this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body .
so , after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call -- anytime , anywhere -- you might imagine that government officials are not very happy .
what that means is that if the drug dealers ' telephone calls or the terrorists ' telephone calls can be intercepted , then so can the rest of ours , too .
and so , my message to you is this : we need to use these tools .
and what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood .
and by and large , factors that we know are required for the development of tissues , for the maintenance of tissues -- they start to decrease as we get older , while factors involved in repair , in injury and in inflammation -- they increase as we get older .
we had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings 20 to 89 years of age , and we measured over 100 of these communication factors , these hormone @-@ like proteins that transport information between tissues .
and what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group , about half the factors changed significantly .
and the way this looks is shown in this graph .
so in our lab , we 're trying to understand these factors better , and many other groups are trying to understand , what are the true aging factors , and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age @-@ related diseases ?
so to summarize , we find the old mouse , and its brain in particular , are malleable .
young blood factors can reverse aging , and what I didn 't show you -- in this model , the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old .
it 's efficient , it 's fast , it can disappear -- a proton can disappear from one place , and reappear on the other .
and those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds -- protons , that act as the glue between the two strands .
zoom in a bit more .
watch the two white balls .
we still don 't know yet how important it is ; this is still an open question .
it 's an object that behaves like a wave , so that it doesn 't just move in one direction or the other , but can follow multiple pathways at the same time .
two quantum @-@ entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth 's magnetic field .
we don 't know if it 's the correct explanation , but wow , wouldn 't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate ?
it 's an extreme form of dengue fever , a mosquito @-@ born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine , and kills 22,000 people each year .
we fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola .
we 've known what it 's capable of .
and in fact , we 've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade .
why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now ?
it 's simply too commercially risky .
well , partially , because it was really difficult -- or thought to be difficult -- to weaponize the virus , but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it .
it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well @-@ known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine .
and I 've been in the business for over 25 years .
I knew there was a way that we could do this , probably , different or better .
a way that preserved dignity and guaranteed justice .
and that we know , in order to have great relationships and relationships built on trust , that we 're going to have to have communication .
so the new way of delivering it is through what we call neighborhood coordinating officers , or NCOs .
at a community meeting , there was a bar , up in Washington Heights , and the neighbors were complaining about outcry and noises .
and of course now they have relatively quieter bar nights .
that 's why the NYPD , along with other departments throughout the United States , are training all of their officers in implicit bias .
this is critical .
that 's another key component .
and we know this because the NYPD 's neighborhood policing philosophy is grounded in the coproduction of public safety .
Tracie Keesee : now , that 's better , alright .
and number three : we must also make sure that truth and telling facts is painful .
and agree ?
TK : so we do know there is a better way .
these are the UAVs .
these are two types of UAVs : a rotorcraft , or hummingbird ; a fixed @-@ wing , a hawk .
and they 're used extensively since 2005 -- Hurricane Katrina .
let me show you how this hummingbird , this rotorcraft , works .
but it 's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this .
you 've got things like this fixed @-@ wing , this hawk .
in seven hours , going from Arlington , driving from the Incident Command Post to the site , flying the UAVs , processing the data , driving back to Arlington command post -- seven hours .
well , why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very , very important ?
and a great example of that is Bujold .
unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small , so Bujold -- ( Laughter ) Say hello to Bujold .
the biggest problem is not making the robots smaller , though .
what are the odds that the experts , your chemical engineer , your railroad transportation engineers , have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have ?
the problem becomes : who gets what data when ?
it 's a little narrative thing .
that 's her hand that she 's spitting into .
because , basically , I work as a theoretical physicist .
and they weren 't used to that .
we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS .
and I 'll just show you one .
and I 'll let her take it from there .
and after AIMS , Shehu wanted to do high @-@ energy physics , and he came to Cambridge .
she 's a physicist , and somehow stays smiling , in spite of everything going on back home .
well , it 's not my TED wish ; it 's our wish , as you 've already gathered .
and our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this .
easy to remember the basic rules we need .
it 's very remote , it 's very dry and it 's very beautiful .
we have an array of existing telescopes already , in the Andes mountains in Chile , and that 's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability .
and then there will be telescopes in space .
the cosmic dawn .
and if you can imagine this tiny area , it 's only one @-@ fiftieth of the size of the full moon .
( applause ) It also includes a number of institutions across the United States , including Harvard University , the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions , and the Universities of Arizona , Chicago , Texas @-@ Austin and Texas A & amp ; M University .
this happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona .
it 's tucked away under 52,000 seats .
it 's what allows us to have the precision that we will have .
so , what does that precision buy us ?
that 's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope .
we 'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail .
you mentioned different facilities .
the same profile in Japan .
let 's watch the race .
it is the essence of human efforts : how we work together , how each effort contributes to the efforts of others .
and we are quite effective at that -- failing .
what gets measured gets done .
there is no metric on earth that will give us the answer .
this is what is killing productivity , what makes people suffer at work .
did you throw it , or did you pass it effectively ?
best wishes , Drugsheaven . "
the community came up with a solution , called multi @-@ signature escrow payments .
but then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin , because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger .
Chris Anderson : you were something of a mathematical phenom .
what I 'm going to show here was originally observed by [ Leonhard ] Euler , the great mathematician , in the 1700s .
ca : can we take a look at this ?
but these things fade after a while ; anomalies can get washed out .
so you have to keep on top of the business .
and I 'd say , " One and 20 . "
JS : we charged the highest fees in the world at one time .
JS : well , it 's not just mathematical .
I don 't think we should worry about it too much .
and in fact , bringing science into the investing world has improved that world .
this is your wife , Marilyn .
next year , it 'll be 1,000 and that 'll be 10 percent of the math and science teachers in New York [ City ] public schools .
( applause ) CA : Jim , here 's another project that you 've supported philanthropically : research into origins of life , I guess .
JS : well , I 'll save that for a second .
now , every year in our Milky Way , which has 100 billion stars , about two new stars are created .
so , in steady state , there are about two million stars in formation at any time .
working with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable .
so , we wouldn 't work if we didn 't get paid , but that 's not why we do what we do .
workers who do this kind of work , whether they do it in factories , in call centers , or in fulfillment warehouses , do it for pay .
and what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live .
it doesn 't say anything about odd @-@ numbered boxes , so we can just ignore the box marked with a seven .
the protocol says that if a box has an even number , then it should have a red top .
there are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness , and into ever older age .
the need for cover , fashion .
but sometimes it can produce an un @-@ constructive response .
it 's happening in Kenya and Tanzania , where millions of people who haven 't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones .
they were expected to know the lingo , the vocabulary .
I know , because when I wrote this book , I talked to 150 people , many from the science and tech side , who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids ' table .
the risks associated with 9 / 11 will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent .
( applause ) So you can have a law , but it 's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it .
so both men and women got a lot out of it , but different things .
now with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative , you 're taking on an even bigger cause .
but what you 're talking about is even bigger than that .
BJK : no , well , if we want to talk -- OK , I 've been doing my little mini @-@ survey .
and she burst into tears .
( laughter ) Once inside , you can order some Algiers jerk chicken , perhaps a vegan walnut burger , or jive turkey sammich .
not directing -- not even empowering -- but just fueling their initiative .
if you need some inspiration to jog your memory , read Octavia Butler 's " Parable of the Sower . "
let 's use some of our substantial collective power toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us .
( laughter ) So every week , 11 women and me got together .
all women are similarly situated in patriarchy , and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood . "
so the black woman says to the white woman , " When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror , what do you see ? "
privilege is invisible to those who have it . "
now remember , I was the only man in this group , so when I witnessed this , I went , " Oh no . "
I had to start thinking about them , and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long .
it was a quote from one of the men , and the quote was , " A Black Woman Stole My Job . "
( laughter ) So let me be very clear : white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world .
so it is good for business .
we could not figure this out .
no problem . just like that .
they want to be able to balance work and family with their partners .
now , it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships , the happier both partners are .
their children have lower rates of absenteeism , higher rates of achievement .
they are less likely to see a therapist , less likely to be diagnosed with depression , less likely to be taking prescription medication .
the goal was to have a one @-@ to @-@ one ratio with every one of these students .
so we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
it 's right off the library . and there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
so the store actually did really well .
but it brought in so many people -- teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody -- because it was street level . it was open to the public .
so they opened this place . inside , it 's like a Costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form .
personally , I think it 's a problem .
because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
and then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . so he 's there every day .
he 's evangelical about it . he brings his cousins in now .
I know that for a fact . so , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
we created a website .
there are a million ways .
so , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . so , visit the site .
if you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who 's our director of national programs . he 'll be on the phone .
and he 'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
number 12 : if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability , what would it be ?
by yourself ?
so the article was published online on a Friday evening , and by Saturday , this had happened to the traffic on my blog .
I understand that this is part of the deal .
how do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship , or even harder , how do you live with your partner 's doubt ?
I don 't remember making a single speech on climate change .
that is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about .
( laughter ) It 's an issue for all of us , and it 's an issue where we need more and more momentum .
and we have to build on that .
and that 's what we have to do .
and I 'd just come back from living in Spain for a while , and I 'd joined this Fortune 500 company . I thought , " This is fantastic .
within two weeks , I was out of there , and I left with one intention : to find something that I could screw up . that 's how tough it was .
either way , we start to believe it .
the things is , everything was impossible until somebody did it .
and then what happened ?
and I got total popsicle head , if anyone 's ever swam in the Bay , and I 'm trying to just thaw my face out , and I 'm watching people finish .
this was not fatigue .
that 's not a clich√© anymore .
how can a human being come from a concept ?
" I 'm not a national , " I proclaimed onstage .
he loves going to Nigeria -- the weather , the food , the friends -- but hates the political corruption there .
even that most glorious expression of countryhood , the World Cup , gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players .
( laughter ) It 's possible that without realizing it , we 're playing a power game , especially in the context of multi @-@ ethnic countries .
and here 's the day that it finally worked : [ video : ( Mac Stone narrating ) After setting up the platform , I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails .
in the Everglades , they are the very architects of the Everglades , because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season , they start excavating these holes called Gator holes .
and now this isn 't just affecting them , other animals also depend on this relationship , so they become a keystone species as well .
we don 't do things like that .
a similar poll taken in the United States in November 2014 found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos , and a further 23 percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown .
each man 's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd .
history tells us we won 't , and the killers know it too .
let 's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things .
FL : thank you .
I do not feel diminished by Parkinson 's ; I feel distilled by it , and I actually very much like the woman I 'm distilling into .
it demands colossal patience , all this growing small : your diminished sleep at night , your handwriting , your voice , your height .
find what I 'm trying to tell you .
( applause ) ( Applause ends ) And this one 's called " The Ghost Light . "
but I digress .
more and more these days , digression seems the most direct route through from where I 've lost or found myself out of place , mind , turn , time .
" this Dark Hour " Late summer , 4 A.M.
the rain slows to a stop , dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden 's dark .
my father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a businessman .
day to day , I watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
he was 80 years old .
finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his compound , the word spread all over .
and you know , Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . "
and one day , with four trainers and one bodyguard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
my bodyguard got out , said , " I can answer you .
every day you go up north here and there .
and if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
( applause ) Thank you . thank you .
for 13 long years , that was my reality .
most of us never think twice about talking , about communicating .
the doctors weren 't sure what it was , but they treated me the best they could .
however , I progressively got worse .
while in hospital , I desperately wanted to go home .
my parents were told I was as good as not there .
a vegetable , having the intelligence of a three @-@ month @-@ old baby .
my parents , in fact my entire family 's lives , became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how .
I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one .
my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis .
I would never talk to a friend .
no one would ever love me .
I had no dreams , no hope , nothing to look forward to .
well , nothing pleasant .
I was a silent , invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching .
the first time it happened , I was shocked and filled with disbelief .
how could they do this to me ?
hurt , sadness and anger flooded through me .
there was no one to comfort me .
all I knew was that I would never be the same .
as I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed , I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home .
an aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week .
as simple as this may sound , it was amazing .
I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message .
just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life , I met Joan .
I started to feel whole again , a man worthy of love .
I began to reshape my destiny .
over our lifetimes , we 've all contributed to climate change .
it can cause upset , it could cause cost .
there 's a famous story about the great rabbi , Hillel , the older contemporary of Jesus .
between 1914 and 1945 , 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict .
today we know they 're made from protein molecules .
that 's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer 's patients .
but Alzheimer 's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves .
this pattern caused me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons .
I worried that there was something wrong with this , and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything .
I 'll tell you where you learned it : you learned it from the culture .
why ?
all they hear is that they 're going to have to choose .
you might feel like you don 't have a purpose .
it 's a mouthful to say .
( laughter ) It 's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome .
one : idea synthesis .
Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography , data visualization , travel , mathematics and design , when they founded Meshu .
Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically @-@ inspired jewelry .
he 's even more valuable because he can take on various roles , depending on his clients ' needs .
as a society , we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves .
you came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon .
( laughter ) In fact , some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together .
so with that said , if there is one thing you take away from this talk , I hope that it is this : embrace your inner wiring , whatever that may be .
you might think this is not much , compared to the billions of neurons we have .
so why are these new neurons important and what are their functions ?
and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus , then we block certain memory abilities .
and this is especially new and true for spatial recognition -- so like , how you navigate your way in the city .
but moreover , if you just block neurogenesis , then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant .
are we ready ?
yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
( laughter ) Yes , you are right , it will increase the production of new neurons .
I will let you judge that one by yourself .
so this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors , Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute , showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons .
ST : no , you don 't !
Sandrine Thuret , thank you so much .
whether he ruled anyone , or even lived at all is , unfortunately , less clear .
the centerpiece of this tome was King Arthur .
a few of his sources contained mentions of Arthur , and some others were realistic accounts of battles and places .
you 're going to be really excited .
your early investors are going to be really excited .
I was a first @-@ time founder .
and I think it inspires a tough question : what 's our goal with entrepreneurship ?
for the first time , ICOs had raised more money for young startups than venture capital had .
it was the first week of the program .
we should do an ICO that combines the value of all of our companies and raise money as a group . "
and we decided to cooperate , rather than compete .
and I believe that 's way more exciting than just trying to invest in the next billion @-@ dollar startup .
thank you .
what 's nice about this scheme , this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards , is that it allows us to think about illness as well in a somewhat different way .
can you build this as an organ outside the body ?
could we implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing ?
how could we implant those memories back in ?
so let me end with some thoughts about model building .
but perhaps what 's really at stake are three more intangible M 's : mechanisms , models , metaphors .
there 's a lot of talk in technologyland about the personalization of medicine , that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically , your genome , your current context .
it 's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity .
why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago ?
we live in a very special time in history , a rare time , a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we 've never had access to before .
together with my long @-@ term 3D printing collaborator Stratasys , we 3D @-@ printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells , and I 'll show more objects like it .
but is nature ideal ?
the land created a world made of parts .
the second @-@ most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin , and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shrimps , crabs , scorpions and butterflies .
the first is cyanobacteria .
what if we could create personal microbiomes that would scan our skins , repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies ?
I call this material ecology .
we placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this 3 @-@ dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon .
we then created holes , or apertures , that would lock in the rays of light and heat , distributing those silkworms on the structure .
and this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision @-@ free manner .
and in a minute you 'll see it enter our lab , which is recognizable by the clutter that you see .
( laughter ) And I want to show you an example .
but because the robots interact with each other , they sense their neighbors , they essentially follow .
in the next video , you 'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot .
this is easily discernible from imagery , not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery .
the target was to take from a baseline of 1990 , when 36 percent of the world 's population lived in poverty , to get to 18 percent poverty this year .
the highest performing country , Norway , scores 88 .
so there 's our target , 75 out of 100 .
and in there , I 'm now going to put all the countries of the world , each one represented by a dot , and on top of that I 'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship .
so here is the world in 2015 .
( laughter ) Just 62.4 . just a tiny increase .
so what 's going on ?
but as you saw already , there is actually lots of noise around this trend line .
and that 's really important , because it tells us two things .
if we rely on economic growth alone , we 're going to get to 62.4 .
so let 's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress -- the Russia , China , Indias -- just up to the average .
and now let 's be even bolder still .
what if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica in prioritizing human well @-@ being , using its wealth for the well @-@ being of its citizens ?
well then , we get to nearly 73 , very close to the Global Goals .
it grades our performance on the Global Goals on a scale from F to A , where F is humanity at its worst , and A is humanity at its best .
let 's choose the world that we want .
Michael Green : this is a really important point ; it 's a big shift in priorities -- it 's no longer about poor countries and just poverty .
even , I 'm sorry to say , Bruno , Switzerland has got to work to do .
BG : thank you very much .
but the parish clerk is also lusting after the wife , and comes by every night to sing outside her house .
it was used between the 12th and 15th centuries , and evolved from Old English due to increased contact with European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066 .
if not for their pilgrimage , many of these figures would never have had the chance to interact .
some have been around for centuries , like the world 's largest , Wadi al @-@ Salaam , where more than five million people are buried .
this area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks .
what this is doing is merely telling us that we are scratching the surface .
this awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women .
good morning .
and we have so many examples of this : the Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments to the pitches of the birds in the forest around them .
it was my first language , the language of my parents , one of the main languages of Ethiopia .
and this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played for four minutes and 33 seconds .
he told me that he had just visited what he thought was an abandoned warehouse where the Detroit police department was storing evidence .
and unbeknownst to all of them , all 11,341 , those kits were never tested .
on January 2 , 1990 , Natasha was at home and a man knocked on her door .
he raped her with his mouth , his fingers and his penis .
Pamela , 19 years old -- I 'll call her Pamela , that 's not her real name -- nineteen years old , was walking down the street after she had come from visiting her boyfriend .
but not only that .
as we began to study and investigate how this possibly could have happened , we discovered there were other issues besides just financial ones .
and we knew where that rape kit was .
in one city , in one state .
ups was one company , as I said .
prisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race , their religion or their political beliefs .
but the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs .
their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls .
it 's right at the southernmost tip of Norway .
out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones .
but the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit .
so it became a cold case .
disease and infections are widespread .
about half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year , and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais .
this is 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria .
so we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him , and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz 's closest relative who now lives in Jordan .
but at some point , he must have given up all hope .
the last night we know he was alive , he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk .
out of a population of 150,000 , only 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk .
BG : are you planning to go back ? and continue the reporting ?
a few years ago , with my colleague , Emmanuelle Charpentier , I invented a new technology for editing genomes .
( laughter ) A big mouthful -- you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR .
the technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell 's DNA affect either a tissue or , in this case , an entire organism .
so , genome @-@ engineered humans are not with us yet , but this is no longer science fiction .
( applause ) ( Applause ends ) Bruno Giussani : Jennifer , this is a technology with huge consequences , as you pointed out .
yes , your happy place , I know you 've got one even if it 's fake .
any plastic tables ?
so let 's start there -- with the idea that good design should feel natural .
and then you might revisit those moments later , and add context to them online .
most of all , we wanted to create an intimate , beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved .
basically , it 's virtual reality circa 1955 .
so let 's recap .
yet .
TBD , to be decided .
can you please follow along with me ?
and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
one man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder , nine months old -- Malek .
it was very frightening .
the Academy of Athens , one of Greece 's most prestigious institutions , gave her an award of bravery , and she deserves all that praise , and she deserves a second chance .
she wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice .
but in reality , our gut is extremely vulnerable to all kinds of wishful thinking and biases .
but geologists have estimated that what is still missing , to be discovered and mapped , is something around 10 million kilometers .
that means that for each meter of a cave that we already know , that we have explored , there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages .
but nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame .
and so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs , the Auy√°n @-@ tepui , which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls , which is the highest waterfall in the world -- about 979 meters of vertical drop .
there are strong winds , and there are almost 4,000 millimeters of rainfall per year , so it 's really , really difficult to find good conditions .
that means , in the Pem√≥n indigenous language , " The House of the Gods . "
and , really , everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the mineralogical world .
so they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation .
it 's always dark . they have to do science . they have a lot of tasks .
but when I look at these pictures , I wonder : there is zero light down there , and yet they look incredibly well @-@ exposed .
how do your colleagues , the photographers , take these pictures ?
FS : yeah . they are working in a darkroom , basically , so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment .
we 've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner .
as they do it , in the upper left is a display that 's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
but I want to leave with you the big question .
in fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
( laughter ) And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
now , you all know what the postmortem is .
they weren 't using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
for your passport , a particular drawer .
if you designate a spot and you 're scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
remember , when you 're under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
but actually , medical practice doesn 't work that way .
we haven 't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
but GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
but wait a minute .
now , I 'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
medical ethics requires it , it 's part of the principle of informed consent .
you don 't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
you might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you 're practiced with this kind of thinking .
there 's an evolutionary reason for this .
the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
we couldn 't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being , and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate , so personal .
so we launched Crisis Text Line , very quietly , in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market .
( applause ) Text is unbelievably private .
no one hears you talking .
we get things like , " I want to die .
I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me . "
and they go back and forth for a while .
I was diagnosed as bipolar , and I think I 'm going to be OK . "
so how do we use the data to make us better ?
( laughter ) We have the data to know what makes a great counselor .
we know that if you text in the words " mg " and " rubber band , " there 's a 99 percent match for substance abuse .
on the day that Robin Williams committed suicide , people flooded hotlines all over this country .
because I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders , so that they can plan meals and guidance counselors to be there on Mondays .
( applause ) Data , evidence makes policy , research , journalism , policing , school boards -- everything better .
I don 't think of myself as a mental health activist .
I get really excited about this data , I 'm a little nerdy .
and growing up , I found out that adults make a mess , and they 're not very good at cleaning up after themselves .
( laughter ) And so it 's sad to say , but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them .
so with my students , ages six to 15 , we 've been dreaming of inventing a better way .
so we 've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop .
and so , back to plastic .
so we 're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots , kids get very excited .
and the next thing we do -- we do what we call " rapid prototyping . "
what was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem , and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it .
so they were very shocked , because this is the water they drink , this is the water they bathe in , this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live .
so we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer , and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums , so that can help you identify what 's in the water .
and today , I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean .
well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
so I 've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident , and I measure independently and with other scientists , on land , in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids .
they showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin , even though they wouldn 't be soft with them .
and we 're not the only people with this problem ; this problem touches the whole of the Western world .
loneliness is like a collective relational challenge , and it can 't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response .
I wanted to know what we could do differently .
and this is interesting from an artistic point of view .
the opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order and always subject to a specific regulation .
" NSA Agents , Do the Right Thing ! blow the whistle ! "
what interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side .
we have European passports , visas and air tickets .
after dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones , men , women and children are detained by Australia without trial , sometimes for years .
on the floor , a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center , accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility .
emotions ran deep . many wept .
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants .
my eureka moment was to find a bilingual solution for Arabic education , because effective communication and education is the road to more tolerant communities .
yes , both use upward and downward strokes , but have completely different baselines .
the idea is to simply create a fun and engaging way of learning Modern Standard Arabic through LEGO .
but what is it that a conservationist does ?
next , we must disseminate what we learn .
and it 's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tapir is .
the destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early 1500s , when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil , beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America .
this is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world , an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America .
this camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it .
I am not alone .
and I 'll keep doing this for Ted , a baby tapir we captured in December last year also in the Pantanal .
and I will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that I 've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others I know I will encounter in the future .
and the answer to that is yes , we can .
but next I would like to activate the streaming of the video .
so now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way , and in a way that you can 't recognize with your eye , because the changes are too fast to recognize .
but in order to prove the point , I can block the light of the solar cell .
this means , despite the blockage , there 's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell , so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information , in this case , a high @-@ definition video .
and we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide , and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet .
pretty good indication it 's actually her on there .
and that picture was published all over .
but then , a couple of years go by , and the world 's most @-@ Googled Anders , Anders Behring Breivik , did what he did .
he 's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media , on his blog and Facebook .
he told all of his readers the following , " Go out there on the Internet , find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks -- find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks -- publish them in your feeds , on your websites , on your blogs .
I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
kids . kids is what I 'm going to talk about -- is that okay ?
it says kids over here , that 's what I 'd like to talk about .
I 've decided that , for me at least , I don 't have a big enough head .
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
and I said , " Well , I 've taught graduate -- I 've had graduate students , I 've taught undergraduate classes . "
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
pulls out a gun . goes boom !
I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
I pop up the top , and there 's a cupola .
in truth , I wondered if they were right .
Lisa Dazols : I had similar notions .
when we spoke to activists , they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality , where the women 's status is established in society .
LD : there we met Prince Manvendra .
whether we are gay , we are lesbian , we are transgender , bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from , we have to all unite and fight for our rights .
JC : while getting my hair cut , the woman cutting my hair asked me , " Do you have a husband ? "
he became Kenya 's first openly gay political candidate .
sure , they had their struggles .
when Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination , India pushed harder .
one year after returning home from our trip , marriage equality came to California .
the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones .
it 's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down .
in 2011 , the last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released , at a retail of 160 dollars , it sold out globally in minutes .
( laughter ) That 's an " I love Dad " T @-@ shirt .
in the case of sneakers , that someone is Nike .
that means that Nike 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor .
so it 's really just supply .
they sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars .
Nike lines happen 104 times more often .
protesters : Hey hey ! Ho ho ! Obamacare has got to go !
why do we agree on health ?
and here on Earth , amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch , life that might be very different from the DNA forms we know .
it doesn 't . it 's actually the opposite .
I mean , first of all , the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total .
in up to 11 dimensions , featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination .
and that influence affects all of us , every day , regardless of your own belief .
despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today , we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society .
I have eight siblings , a stay @-@ at @-@ home mother .
some of the rules we had were strict , but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed .
I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church , including myself .
this was where I felt safe . this is certainty and clarity about life .
I had help raising my little daughter .
and I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets , disciplinary councils , in decision @-@ making capacities , and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it .
until I stopped , and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men .
and I faced this contradiction in myself , and I joined with other activists in my community .
the first thing we did was raise consciousness .
we were attacked in social media and national press .
we received death threats .
most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council , and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better , because we believed that they could be .
" Don 't pay attention to religion . "
for example , during Prop 8 , my church raised over 22 million dollars to fight same @-@ sex marriage in California .
but I 'll tell you what my people have done .
but not one woman in that line will forget that day , and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day .
before you move on , I encourage you to actually think about a possible answer to this question .
for this species , it is simply a matter of where a larva happens to randomly fall on the sea floor .
for humans , that system is a genetic XY system .
Hamlet : " then I would you were so honest a man . "
once again , adding dramatic tension to the scene .
well , they all are of course , and that 's what my elementary teachers were trying to tell me .
but 10 , just like one , just like a dozen eggs , just like an egg , 10 is a unit .
the first thing to remember is : our brain is inherited .
no one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed .
far from being the thing that makes us human , human empathy is far from perfect .
we round up empathic creatures , we kill them and we eat them .
they have the same structures .
he 'll get the job done , and it will feel good . "
but in the park , park rangers did that in the 1920s , and then 60 years later they had to bring them back , because the elk numbers had gotten out of control .
a pack is a family .
the alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family .
we cause so much pain to them .
the seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat .
why can we trust them around our toddlers ?
she was nursing , and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool , smoking .
the fractions dealing with life and intelligence and technological civilizations are ones that many , many experts ponder , but nobody knows for sure .
so far , we only know of one place in the universe where life exists , and that 's right here on Earth .
in this phase , roughly 50 percent of those who reach the surf will perish .
it was something that existed , but that we never spoke about .
so , this trauma -- what is it ?
a human being should not have to face the void of death .
they suddenly don 't want to sleep , because when they do , they have the same nightmare every night .
for example , a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him .
it can be the voice of a friend calling , and they 're being slaughtered and there 's nothing you can do .
you CANNOT work anymore , you CANNOT love anymore .
you go home and don 't recognize anyone .
you don 't even recognize yourself .
and no one understands .
we 're just not ready to listen .
no , it 's extremely common .
in 1939 , there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals .
in 1987 , the US government identified 102,000 -- twice as many -- 102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide .
the only way to heal from this trauma , from this encounter with death that overwhelms , petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it .
because these people feel excluded from humanity .
they feel dirty , defiled , ashamed .
and then one day , they sent him to a psychiatrist .
the horror needs to be put into words -- human words , so we can organize it and talk about it again .
and if we can do that , if we can talk about these things , then step by step , by working it out verbally , we can reclaim our place in humanity .
but trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality .
for the first decimal place of my number , I 'll look at the first decimal place of your first number .
this means that , once you have one infinity , you can always make a bigger one by making the set of all subsets of that first set .
some of the greatest mathematicians of Cantor 's day were very upset with this stuff .
taken together , these results mean that there are unanswerable questions in mathematics .
of course , architecture is about function , but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi , and I want to propose a completely different quality .
our buildings are real ; they 're being built .
and they 're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building .
his name was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro .

as soon as I heard that audio , I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks .
let me give you an example .
and " Hunger in LA , " well , it 's helped start a new form of doing journalism that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future .
either of you could move your cart towards the other to sell more ice cream .
but you know , this is the kind of question that I 'm trying to answer with my research .
imagine a microscopic @-@ sized ladder contained in the part of our brain that we 'll label our subconscious .
on the seventh and final rung , we take action based on our adjusted beliefs .
but those broken walls had one last gift .
those are a collection of deep brain regions that regulate movement , through a neurochemical called dopamine .
makes it more and more difficult to initiate actions .
D1 : what ?
look again at how it moves . stiff legs , long stance , These aren 't Parkinsonian movements , Parkinson 's patients take short , shuffling steps , and the posture 's all wrong .
patients who suffer degeneration from this region , something called Spino @-@ cerebellar ataxia , show a lack of coordination that results in stiff legs , wide stance , and a lumbering walk .
D2 : touch√© . OK . so we 've nailed its motor problems .
D2 : ( laughs ) I mean , you could try , man , but I 'm going to stay on this side of the glass .

a journey that takes place between two breaths -- the last one before diving into the water , and the first one , coming back to the surface .
and that 's why I 'm here today , to share my journey with you and to take you along with me .
it ends with a special technique called the carp , which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs by compressing it .
when I leave the surface , I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs .
and what 's extraordinary is that we share this instinct with marine mammals -- all marine mammals : dolphins , whales , sea lions , etc .
and , of course , it works much better for them .
my lungs reach residual volume , below which they 're not supposed to be compressed , in theory .
thanks to this phenomenon , which we also share with marine mammals , I 'm able to continue with my dive .
we resist , we go against it .
100 meters -- the magic number .
below that , they said , the human body would implode .
he 'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon , just like in the movie .
that 's how I feel when I 'm at the bottom , at 123 meters .
nowhere else on Earth you can experience this -- looking all around you , and seeing the same thing .
first , because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom .
I 'm not alone any more .
once at the surface , I have 15 seconds to take off my nose clip , give this signal and say ( English ) " I am OK . "
but eventually , we realized the monsters did not lie out there , they reside inside of us .
he hadn 't done his homework the night before , and felt more unprepared than the ambushed World War II soldiers he was supposed to write about .
a sudden rush of panic swept over his body , leaving him with sweaty palms , a foggy mind and a racing heart .
there was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning .
( laughter ) CA : now , a core part of your nation 's identity is fishing .
we don 't have a lot of livestock , so it 's fish that we depend on .
there had been some indications that some of the species , in particular the bigeye , was under serious threat .
and so there 's been that significant increase .
and so we 've started doing that , and we have to restructure the industry .
so I am a fisherman , very much , and I used to be able to catch yellowfin .
ca : so here 's a couple of beautiful girls from your country .
I mean , as you think about their future , what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world ?

I want to show you the one who really changed my life , and this was the performance in MoMA , which I just recently made .
they are observed by the other people , they 're photographed , they 're filmed by the camera , they 're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves .
so you have to be there .
that 's my subjective way .
it 's something so old @-@ fashioned , but if you don 't respect your own word of honor and you leave before -- that 's not my problem .
but it 's six hours , the experience .
and then after you finish , you get a certificate of accomplishment , so get home and frame it if you want .
so what you do here , first you start slow walking , you start slowing down .
in the long duration chairs , you 're transported to the big place where you 're going to see the work .
right now , I am just making my institute in Brazil , then it 's going to be in Australia , then it 's coming here , to Canada and everywhere .
and this is to experience a kind of simple method , how you go back to simplicity in your own life .
( laughter ) You know , if you count rice you can make life , too .
how to count rice for six hours ?
and then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished -- or counting sand in the desert .
you do things in life -- it 's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way .
anyway , the musketeers were called to action to save the Land of Pi from the voracious dragon .
parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead .
then , it was Multiplication , Division , Addition , and Subtraction , each in turn , always the same order .
Don 't forget , there can be parentheses inside parentheses .
and that tricky exponent .
AlHazen 's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek 's couldn 't easily explain : why it gets dark sometimes .
but , that doesn 't happen .
they can be seen when two objects disturb the surface of a still pond , and also when two point @-@ like sources of light are placed near each other .
not so fast !
in the 20th century , scientists did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle .
for instance , when you shine light on a metal , the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal in discrete packets called quanta .
this result , that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes behaves like a wave , led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum mechanics .
it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their bookshelves .
what do my bookshelves say about me ?
well , when I asked myself this question a few years ago , I made an alarming discovery .
and so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel , short story collection or memoir from every country in the world .
then it was friends of friends .
and pretty soon , it was strangers .
and when I tweeted at it about my project , it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan .
and he said that nothing had been published , but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel " The Golden Horse . "
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way .
the books I read that year opened my eyes to many things .
and it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world .
these days , when I look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e @-@ reader , they tell a rather different story .
so we have all this , so why don 't we have the personal robot ?
how do we do that ? well , the first step , before we even start designing and getting our hands dirty , we have to come up with rules , kind of the laws , rules of conduct .
so we have to lay the boundaries , the rules of engagement , before we actually start designing .
and then we have to come up with tools .
so I believe that the way to make robots smarter is to mimic people .
I never thought I 'd have to understand things like child psychology , infant development .
you know , we want to get strong .
and then , lastly , is creativity .
and these are the things that allow us to figure out new things .
and isn 't it so cute ?
so , I 'm all for robots and smart robots .
basically , OkCupid 's matching algorithm helps us decide whether two people should go on a date .
a computer without an algorithm is basically an expensive paperweight .
if both people in a relationship are saying yes to this , they 're going to have massive problems .
that worked really well .
some questions tell you more about a person than others .
the algorithm crunches the numbers and gives us a result .
let 's call that set of common questions " s . "
basically , you 're a neat freak .
and let 's say B is a little bit different .
you 've answered " no , " you want someone else to answer " no , " and the question is only a little important to you .
the second question the algorithm looks at is : how much did you satisfy B ?
so your answers were 10 out of 11 equals 91 percent satisfactory to B.
I hope this will help you do that .
this is me rock climbing for the first time .
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident .
it was a revolutionary moment for the blind .
EV : take the two doors to go out . the door is on your right .
EV : Nick is approaching . looks so happy .
( Chieko and Nick laugh ) Man : hi .
EV : you arrived .
the frontier is the real world .
of course , your matrices have to be the same size , but that 's pretty intuitive anyway .
it 's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it .
now do the next ones : 3 times 3 is 9 .
-4 plus 0 is -4 .
not all that bad , is it ?
look at these two matrices .
3 times wait a minute , there are no more rows in the second matrix .
we ran out of room .
though , why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me .
there are thousands of images like these .
a woman wrote to me to say , " I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks .
emotionally , I was a wreck .
so we choose to look at , and believe , this image .
choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies , so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices .
but that stance ignores a fundamental truth , which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional .
so now you 're thinking about unpaid leave .
because of the way it 's structured , all kinds of exceptions , half of new mothers are ineligible for it .
I had to return to work before my baby was a month old , working 60 hours a week .
a teacher told me , " I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born .
I was allowed to bring my baby to work .
I thought , there 's just something wrong with me that I can 't swing this . "
all of this is to America 's shame .
if we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first , we might stick with one kid . "
not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work , their needed work and their needed parenthood , is their problem alone .
but all of us have voices .
it should not matter .
when we think about learning , we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall , books open on their desks , listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room .
in the 1890 's , a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs .
they learned to expect food at the sound of a bell .
so we could have all these possible combinations : round yellow peas , round green peas , wrinkled yellow peas , wrinkled green peas .
some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads .
to understand the rest of the story , you have to understand that our brains are slow .
if you 're moving just at one meter per second , which is fairly slow , then in a tenth of second , you 've moved 10 centimeters .
but let me finish by saying , how exactly does this explain this particular example ?
imagine it 's a cathedral doorway , to make it more concrete -- it 'll be helpful in a second .
if I can , I 'll quickly show two .
here are the cues of motion , the kinds of cues that you get on your retina when things are moving .
and we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic .
think back to the most difficult job you ever did .
it all depends on the context of what you 're looking at .
Albert Einstein used non @-@ Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space @-@ time becomes warped in the presence of matter , as part of his general theory of relativity .
these discoveries could never have been made without gifted , progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside of what they 've been taught .
over the past century , particle physicists have been studying matter and forces at higher and higher energies .
instead , the universe consisted of a swirling sea of subatomic matter .
further back still , and the energy was too great even for the quarks to stick together .
the human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet .
since then , photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science .
mathematicians have used photos to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip the crack sound comes when the whip is breaking the sound barrier .
as mathematicians have since realized , it is possible to add up infinitely many finite @-@ sized terms and still get a finite answer .
while we 're doing this , let 's keep track of the areas of the pieces .
great things happen at intersections .
there 's freedom in that in @-@ between , freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not @-@ quite @-@ here , not @-@ quite @-@ there , a new self @-@ definition .
I am also an astrophysicist .
I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since I was 12 years old .
this thrust my mother , my sister and I out of the relative comfort of middle @-@ class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet .
once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations , I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD .
( laughter ) It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space .
stem itself is an intersectional term , such that its true richness CANNOT be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines .
hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can 't even imagine .
we as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity .
the reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories , the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race , gender and innovation .
thus , we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience .
this is not a request born out of a desire to fit in .
they are gorgeous in their complexity , delicate in their construction , and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air .
what good is half a wing , festooned with half @-@ feathers ?
at the same time , the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs , turning from sparse patches of fuzz into dense plumage , which even extended down to their legs .
some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads , and others had long , dramatic tail feathers .
a woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop .
an ostrich stretches its wings over its nest to shade its young .
eventually , their arms stretched out into wings .
only then , perhaps 50 million years after the first wiry feathers evolved , did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky .
it represents an amount of digital information , which is uncomfortable to store , transport , or analyze .
big data is so voluminous that it overwhelms the technologies of the day and challenges us to create the next generation of data storage tools and techniques .
and there 's something pretty mysterious about antimatter : there 's way less of it out there than there should be .
if you concentrate a huge amount of energy in a tiny space , new particles will come into existence .
the next morning , I just took all the pieces , assembled them together in my hotel room , and this is actually the skirt that I 'm wearing right now .
I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials , and then bring them home to experiment on .
( laughter ) So I decided to move on to working with big machines , ones that didn 't fit in my living room .
so you guys , you want to see what it looks like ?
the ancient Greeks had a great idea : the universe is simple .
carried high on the shoulders of these slaves , the girls look out through the curtains to see the crowded streets below them .
it was built by Livia , the wife of the first emperor Augustus , on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio .
all the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium and await the arrival of their master .
the next most consumed seafood in America , and also throughout the West , is tuna .
this is my home state of Connecticut .
unfortunately though , the sandwich came in at 30 cents .
tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago .
so that is a potential .
other possibility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bivalves , particularly mussels .
great .
as it turns out , the amount of fat we eat doesn 't impact our weight or our cholesterol or our risk of heart disease nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat .
one is length .
the first is like this , where both hydrogens are on same side and both carbons are on the same side .
they don 't go rancid , they 're more stable during deep frying , and they can change the texture of foods in ways that other fats just can 't .
pancake mix is only 11 % fat .
the point is this : it 's not how much fat you eat , it 's what kind of fat .
and what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy is its shape .
that would be pretty bad .
scientists think asteroids might have killed off most of the dinosaurs .
the radiation that does get through creates things like the Aurora Borealis .
gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites and electrical equipment , but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim .
if an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight @-@ line motion and she pulls her arms in , she keeps on gliding at the same speed .
this is called the conservation of angular momentum .
after this period , Gyotaku was not as popular and began to fade away .
then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board to dry .
it exploded an arms race .
and that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere .
sometimes it increased very rapidly , then there was a plateau , then it increased rapidly .
to do that , we need to charter a research boat .
you can see an array of big lights on the top .
we go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships .
four thousand years is a long time .
we go in for these fossil specimens .
uranium is a very poorly regarded element , but I love it .
so here we are .
take Sean , who prefers blue tasting food , such as milk , oranges , and spinach .
the gene heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and the color area further back .
you would then have the ability to link seemingly unrelated things , which is the definition of metaphor , seeing the similar in the dissimilar .
but why do the rest of us non @-@ synesthetes understand metaphors like " sharp cheese " or " sweet person " ?
movies , likewise , can convince us that the sound is coming from the actors ' mouths rather than surrounding speakers .
the worst part is , when we take a look at some of the numbers , it 's pretty scary .
how that actually works is that right now we 've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin , as you see in blue .
and then also , that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets .
I didn 't have the money to go out and buy a plane , so I decided to build a computer instead .
it 's pretty disgusting .
and when we take a look at that from the side , you 'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin .
the first thing I thought was , " This is no good . "
take a look at that from the side as well , you see a very efficient system .
thanks .
first thing , we need to understand that there really is only one ocean , consisting of five component basins that we call the Pacific , the Atlantic , the Indian , the Arctic , and the Southern .
quickly , here are four of the most notable .
the ocean contains the world 's largest mountain range , the mid @-@ ocean ridge .
first , Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren 't perfect circles or spheres .
and then , Newton proposed the theory of universal gravitation , demonstrating that all objects are pulling on each other .
eventually , we had to let go of the idea that we were at the center of the universe .
maybe we 're farther from the center than we ever realized .
what would happen if you set a table like this ?
it doesn 't look good , and you have to clean up the mess before you can even start .
this is more about looks than etiquette , but it 's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you 're eating at a picnic table .
start with utensils for the main course , putting your dinner fork on the left and your dinner knife on the right @-@ hand side since these are the hands we use them with .
next we 'll anchor our setting with the plate .
set the wine glass to the upper right , and then place the water glass to the left of it at an angle .
density is defined as mass divided by volume .
the men in Apollo 10 reached a record @-@ breaking speed of around 25,000 miles per hour when the shuttle re @-@ entered the Earth 's atmosphere in 1969 .
what happened ?
it doesn 't matter if your arms are strong enough to catch her body without breaking your bones .
if this boy lives for 30,000 years , a year to him could feel like a day .
if you 're the only person who is immortal , while everyone else keeps evolving , generation after generation , you will eventually look quite different than the people who surround you .
( Beatboxing ) NP : all right , pops , pops , pops , chill out , chill out .
( laughter ) NP : now you can put y 'all hands down .
( cheers ) NP : sorry ? I can 't hear you .
( Beatboxing ) ( Applause ) ( Beatboxing ) ( Beatboxing ends ) ( Applause ) NP : I 'm getting ready to go !
as of 2012 , the world record for fastest short @-@ distance sprint speed is roughly 27 miles per hour .
his fastest recorded speed is less than 5 miles per hour .
Nah , I don 't think so !
okay , well , let 's say you want to fly just a few meters above the ground where you can still see the road signs and breath oxygen with ease .
Ha , right ?
to move around undetected by other people , you would have to be totally naked .
dust consists of dead skin cells from humans , soil particles , and fibers from clothes made from cotton and other materials .
gross !
the reason you can 't see in the dark is because there is no light .
if it is , how can you receive medical treatment from a doctor if you 're injured ?
the doctor wouldn 't know where to apply ointments or bandages because they CANNOT access your injury .
and what if everyone is permanently invisible ?
it has a couple buttons and a system for detecting motion and distance .
you might have an optical mouse that makes these measurements with lights and sensors , but older ones did this with a hard rubber ball and some plastic wheels .
when you click the button on your mouse , it sends a message to the computer with information about its position .
in this case , the I / O subsystem decides that your mouse click is pretty important so it generates an interrupt to the CPU .
" but oh my gosh there 's a very important mouse click coming through now !
so , how does orbiting work ?
let 's take a page from Isaac Newton .
well , you can imagine if you shot it really , really , hard , it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom ! -- and hit you in the backside or something .
let 's zoom way back and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up .
so you would burn up due to atmospheric friction .
a gene doesn 't want anything , and there 's no outside mechanism that selects which genes are best to preserve .
commas are tricky things , especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved .
you can easily remember the conjunctions by remembering the acronym fanboys .
because they 're so small , more often than not , they require the help of a comma but not always .
they are words that connect two unequal things , dependent and independent clauses .
Bartheleme loves engaging in political debate even though he usually loses .
so , the comma continues on .
they might not want to admit it , but this time the subordinates do need help .
so about half a million people die in the UK each year , and of those , around a quarter will want to be buried .
they first thought about making a caravan park , but the council said no .
but what if I 've got a piece of land and I just want to bury a few people , like five or six ?
well , then -- actually , I don 't need permission from anyone !
Leonardo wasn 't just thinking about Vitruvius , though .
mankind can fill whatever shape he pleases geometrically and philosophically as well .
frustrating ?
it occurs on a continuum .
this means , when they read a word , it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe .
the higher up on the staff a note is placed , the higher the pitch .
the beat of a piece of music is , by itself , kind of boring .
this is a quarter note .
it 's the most basic unit of rhythm , and it 's worth one beat .
( music ) Eh , sounds okay , but maybe a bit thin , right ?
or if you have two feet , then why don 't you read two beek instead of books .
twenty @-@ five hundred years ago , English and German were the same language .
being able to use words meant not just knowing their meaning but what gender they were , too .
sometimes it was like sheep is today - where , to make a plural , you don 't do anything .
in a word , Vikings .
in the 8th century , Scandinavian marauders started taking over much of England .
after a while nobody remembered the real kind any more .
( laughter ) JF : you ain 't seen nothing yet .
I exist because I have my women friends . they -- You 're one of them .
and most of them are a good deal younger than me , too .
( laughter ) LT : well , you are and you have .
PM : well , as we grow older , and as we go through different kinds of life 's journeys , what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive ?
and a long string of other descriptive phrases , and I want to get to you as soon as possible , I want you to know that I 'm there for you .
JF : you spell it right out -- LT : I spell it , every letter .
you know , as I 've gotten older , I 've understood more the importance of friendships , and so , I really make an effort to reach out and make play dates -- not let too much time go by .
what are the differences , in your opinion , between men friendships and women friendships ?
JF : women 's friendships are like a renewable source of power .
it sounds like a Stephen King movie , but it 's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis , and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life .
during a normal REM cycle , you 're experiencing a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream , and your brain is unconscious and fully asleep .
you take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small blockage of your airway .
since building these sites , we 've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results .
well , sure , sort of , but the biggest benefits of the space program had nothing to do with one country beating another .
during the space race , funding for research and education , in general , increased dramatically , leading to many advances that may not have otherwise been made .
he 's loud , he spills his drink on you , and he makes fun of your team .
days later , you 're walking in the park when suddenly it starts to pour rain .
who should show up at your side to offer you an umbrella ?
certain types of learning don 't seem to lead to this sort of negativity bias .
let 's go back to that football game .
in other words , the brain seems to be tracking low @-@ level , statistical properties of behavior in order to make complex decisions regarding other people 's character .
let 's talk about the Arctic first .
but despite being inhospitable , the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is .
both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers .
since the establishment of the United Nations , wars of aggression have been outlawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war .
one way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed .
who would they fight ?
and would their retaliation be considered an act of war ?
the computer programmers who wrote the code ?
the hardware engineer who created the computers , knowing that they were intended to enable an attack ?
over the last century , these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe .
but when we look around us , we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff , full of stars , planets , trees , squirrels .
the question is , ultimately , why does all this interesting stuff exist ?
this contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics , and in the next few years , we may find out whether we 'll ever be able to solve it .
at the heart of this problem are two numbers , two extremely dangerous numbers .
these are properties of the universe that we can measure , and they 're extremely dangerous because if they were different , even by a tiny bit , then the universe as we know it would not exist .
on July 4 , 2012 , physicists at CERN announced to the world that they 'd spotted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent collisions at the LHC : the Higgs boson .
if you 've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap , then you 've felt the effect of a field .
and the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field , except it has a constant value everywhere .
it 's all around us right now .
we can 't see it or touch it , but if it wasn 't there , we would not exist .
relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings , a bit like a light switch .
and this value is crucial .
the universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy .
you find that dark energy should be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy .
well , even that one won 't do here .
Einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics , and physicists have kept at it ever since .
now , the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while , but in the last few years , we 've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out .
if so , then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature .
so you have to rely on people 's ingenuity , that they will solve the problems , but it may be a decade or more down the line .
( laughter ) It sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that .
but I mean , seriously , it 's great news .
are you paying attention ?
for example , just now you focused on the fork and didn 't observe the tablecloth or the falling waiter .
the next time you get d√©j√† vu , take a moment to think about it .
is your brain just acting slow ?
but this explanation doesn 't cut it .
this must be some kind of optical illusion .
but in fact , pilots and sailors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion .
the moon appears a certain size .
and the first question is very simple : why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months ?
the World Food Programme was forced , for lack of resources , to cut by 30 percent food support to the Syrian refugees .
and Lebanon ? struggling , of course , but it 's managing .
AG : my country is supposed to receive four thousand .
four thousand in Portugal means nothing .
Turkey has now two million three @-@ hundred thousand or something of the sort , if you count all refugees .
and the idea is that nobody is taking care of it -- this is happening without any kind of management .
BG : but there are villages in Germany with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees .
so , what 's your position ?
the truth is that for Afghans , the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for , at the time , six million Afghans that came .
so I would say that even today , the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open .
now , today this doesn 't make any sense , because they are providing a global public good .
and , of course , if you look at today 's situation of the indicators in these countries , it is clear that , especially their poor groups of the population , are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing .
BG : who should be providing this support ?
we have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying , for instance , that Muslims refugees should not be received .
seriously , though , what is it ?
a universal truth ?
an ideal ?
there 's no shortage of answers .
it conquers all .
it 's all you need .
or sanity ?
would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency ?
that 's my point .
but if love is a thing that we can define , then how can it mean opposite things for so many people ?
thus , some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology 's way to make you continue our species .
probably pretty low .
as it turns out , that 's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light .
when we see , it 's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the retina .
radio waves have long wavelengths , while x @-@ rays have short wavelengths .
to see the universe in its full spectrum , we need to have the right eyes , and that means using special telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light .
and the coolest thing of all , no matter the wavelength or energy , the light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can experience and study here on Earth .
in 1977 , the physicist Edward Purcell calculated that if you push a bacteria and then let go , it will stop in about a millionth of a second .
it releases a chemical that thins out the surrounding mucus , allowing it to glide through slime .
on Facebook , on Twitter , on Google , all sorts of places where millions of people , myself included , were talking about the events and saw images like this , the emotional , poignant image of a baby with " Je suis Charlie " on its wrist .
and this turned into a weapon .
the divide between physical and digital domains today ceases to exist , where we have offline attacks like those in Paris appropriated for online hacks .
a week later , they beheaded a young girl .
on social media , they said , " We will release information that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel . "
and so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue .
and the question still remains : what can individuals , organizations and governments do ?
individuals have more power than ever before to affect national and international security .
or in another generation , some kid in his basement in Estonia ?
indeed , Kabuki was even considered a popular form of entertainment amongst American troops stationed in Japan despite initial U.S. censorship of Japanese traditions .
that core is surrounded by negatively charged particles called electrons .
the identity of an atom is determined only by the number of protons in its nucleus .
we can 't see protons , neutrons , or electrons .
and another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous .
they became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors , one President of the United States .
( laughter ) So what have we learned ?
unlike in " R.U.R. , " though , our robots haven 't risen up against us , and here 's hoping it stays that way !
you aren 't especially tired , yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out .
let 's take a look at a few of the most prevalent ones , beginning with two physiological hypotheses before moving to a psychological one .
our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning is triggered by a specific stimulus , an initial yawn .
scientists believe that this chameleon effect is possible because of a special set of neurons known as mirror neurons .
this study was set up to show that dogs would enact a yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn .
we were calling collectively for actions , and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know .
the euphoria faded , we failed to build consensus , and the political struggle led to intense polarization .
and fourth , it became really hard to change our opinions .
fifth -- and in my point of view , this is the most critical -- today , our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements , posts over discussions , shallow comments over deep conversations .
this is so important .
for a moment , it sits there innocuously .
if your ideal cookie is barely browned , like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation , you could have set your oven to 310 degrees .
without them , plants would lose a pollinator .
" if you don 't get a new piano , Keith can 't play . "
so , now let 's talk about what the other 95 % is .
eventually , the universe will run out of gas to form stars , and the stars themselves will run out of fuel and burn out , leaving the universe with only black holes in it .
one out of every fifty of your genes is dedicated to it .
as they dissolve , they bind to the olfactory receptor cells , which fire and send signals through the olfactory tract up to your brain .
a dog 's olfactory epithelium is 20 times bigger than your puny human one .
olfactory neurons are always fresh and ready for action .
this is different from how sight and sound are processed .
if the olfactory epithelium gets swollen or infected , it can hamper your sense of smell , something you might have experienced when you were sick .
in ancient Greece , cicadas were considered luxury snacks .
why have we lost our taste for bugs ?
and in Mexico , chopped jumiles are toasted with garlic , lemon , and salt .
bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal or ground into flour , powder , and paste to add to food .
what you have to overcome in " ick factor , " you gain in nutrition and taste .
pop that insect into your mouth , and savor the crunch .
here are some questions and methods I 've used to help build the worlds in which those books take place .
whether that 's a fantasy world or a futuristic setting in the real world , it 's important to know where you are and whether you 're working in the past , present , or future .
what rules are in place here ?
what do people believe in here ?
and what does this society value most ?
where do the inhabitants live and work and go to school ?
what kind of technology exists ?
access to information ?
there 's so much to think about !
some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars .
it 's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car 's headlight .
our NSF @-@ funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit .
so I 'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life .
ice on a planet 's surface is also important for climate .
only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom .
thank you .
when you travel in a car , your body gets two different messages .
you 're at the movies , and the camera makes a sweeping move .
this time , your eyes think you 're moving while your ear knows you 're sitting still .
but why does this conflicting information make us feel so terrible ?
a man walks into the hotel and asks for a room .
luckily , he remembers that around the year 300 B.C.E. , Euclid proved that there is an infinite quantity of prime numbers .
so , the person in seat number 7 on the first bus goes to room number 3 ^ 7 or room number 2,187 .
this continues for all of the first bus .
the passengers on the second bus are assigned powers of the next prime , 5 .
the following bus , powers of 7 .
square root rooms , like room radical 2 , and room pi , where the guests expect free dessert .
maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night 's sleep .
how fast are you moving right now ?
" how fast are you moving ? "
at the start of the voyage , speeds are given relative to the launchpad .
Ah , of course !
speed is a relative quantity .
this is basic relatively talking .
Galileo seems to have been the first person to realize that there is no such thing as an absolute speed .
this means that speeds only have meaning when they are referred to a reference frame .
we imagine Spaceship Earth plowing through the ocean of space as it orbits the Sun .
cooking frees up time and provides more energy than if we ate food stuffs raw and so we can sustain brains with 86 billion densely packed neurons .
for maximum efficiency , between 1 % and 16 % of cells should be active at any given moment .
your brain is already smart and powerful .
so hop to it !
so in other words , he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here .
so the pressure is on , and of course it 's also the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this , so Roy Price does not want to take any chances .
they record when somebody presses play , when somebody presses pause , what parts they skip , what parts they watch again .
( audience : " alpha House . " ) Yes , " Alpha House , " but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it didn 't turn out that great .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) " House of Cards " gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be .
you have 200 years of statistics to rely on .
the least you could expect is good TV , right ?
and that 's not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems doesn 't know what to do with data .
so whenever you 're solving a complex problem , you 're doing essentially two things .
it moves all the time as you move through the day , based on how your body is positioned .
when you bend forward , your center of mass is located below your bent belly in a place where there is no mass at all .
look at the jumper 's center of mass as his body bends backward .
it was about 75 percent hydrogen and almost all the rest was helium .
and , finally , there is the lipid layer , an oily outer film that keeps the surface smooth for Iris to see through , and prevents the other layers from evaporating .
but one day , she meets a girl named Onion .
so , Iris invites Onion to her house for dinner .
a similar drama is playing out today in S√£o Paulo , Brazil , where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in 2010 , to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics .
we like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns .
I think that there 's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think that 's to open up four new local sources of water that I liken to faucets .
if we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years , we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we 'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought .
now , if you told me 20 years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water , I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer .
this figure here shows the stormwater park that they 're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems , or storm sewers , and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry .
after the water 's been through this two @-@ stage process , it 's safe to drink .
so there 's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses .
" it 's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil , not a lot of water and you don 't care about climate change . "
the capsaicin and piperine , found in black pepper and chili peppers , are made up of larger , heavier molecules called alkylamides , and those mostly stay in your mouth .
mustard , horseradish , and wasabi are made up of smaller molecules , called isothiocyanates , that easily float up into your sinuses .
the race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle , but two peppers generally come out on top : the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper .
nobody really knows when or why humans started eating hot peppers .
and some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates where microbes also happen to be more prevalent .
they just seem to like the pain more .
instead of switching to jam , you investigate the reason for the price hike .
the number of domesticated honeybees in the US has been decreasing at an alarming rate .
pesticides used both on commercial beehives and agricultural crops to ward off parasites could be getting into the food and water that honeybees consume .
so we have a file full of clues but no clear leads .
if someone called you scum , you 'd probably be offended , but scientifically , they might not be far off .
living plants shed dead body parts : fallen leaves , broken branches , and even underground roots .
scientists are learning that this detritus is an unexpectedly huge energy source , fueling most natural ecosystems .
you probably don 't eat rotting things , poop , or pond scum directly , but your food sources probably do .
the answer lies in how many different arrangements of 52 cards , or any objects , are possible .
as a general rule , the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one .
even sugar 's tricky nicknames have nicknames .
but just what is sugar ?
fructose , on the other hand , is metabolized primarily in the liver , and when your liver gets overloaded with sweet , sweet fructose , the excess is metabolized to fat .
fresh fruits actually contain fructose , but it 's naturally occurring and doesn 't cause an overload because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption .
a few years ago , I got one of those spam emails .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) He said , " What do you do for a living ? "
I thought about it for a long time .

I was like , oh ! -- that Winnie Mandela .
she sent me this , which is hysterical .
[ ( but I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY ) ] ( Laughter ) Thank you .
but we said we 'd get rid of that stinkin ' thinkin ' , so we talked to our communities .
and we 've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and serve .
and because we are a proud profession , it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes .
because every one of us makes up a community .
( applause ) And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action .
it was those guardians , it was that village mentality .
we 've lost it with one another .
so we came up with some incredible initiatives , engagements for our community and police to build that trust back .
forty @-@ year crime low , so much so , I had other commanders call me , " Hey Mel , whatcha doin ' , man ?
for the first time in 30 years , we fell , Baltimore city , to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact .
and we celebrated , because we had learned to become great servers , become great servers first .
but somehow , we went back to business as usual .
in 479 BC , when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea , the tide retreated much farther than usual , leaving a convenient invasion route .
these factors that can affect results , in addition to the factor being studied , are known as confounding variables .
all the shapes I knew had perimeters .
but that space @-@ time diagram represents Andrew 's perspective .
so let 's start again .
on the other hand , something strange has happened .
yes , no , it is , and you do .

that 's when its functions become apparent as medics get to observe the motion of the heart 's valves .
this makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached .
so place your hand above your own and feel its rhymic beat .
well , maybe not ; it depends on how you handle pain .
pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience , associated with actual or potential tissue damage .
this is your Grey matter .
traditionally , medical science has been about testing treatments on large groups to determine what would help a majority of patients .
more recently , the Internet has multiplied the amount of information and viewpoints , with social media , blogs , and online video turning every citizen into a potential reporter .
the ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance .
these are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun 's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower , kind of like an eager beachgoer .
in solar panels , photons from the sun 's rays hit the surface of a panel , and electrons are released to get an electric current going .
for instance , even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays .
but as it turns out , we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet , the very lifeblood of Mother Earth .
now , a lot of people will tell you that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors .
it 's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks .
this technology enables us to go deeper than we could 've imagined even 10 years ago .
now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication .
but one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan .
but in a larger area , with less ants , where such meetings happen less often , they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground .
other ants will then follow this pheromone trail , renewing it each time they manage to find food and return .
but you can observe these fascinatingly simple , yet effective , processes directly through some simple experiments , by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior .
tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads .
but have you ever wondered how tattooing really works ?
so , how come the tattoo doesn 't gradually flake off along with them ?
and it is this very process that makes tattoos permanent .
as these cells travel through the lymphatic system , some of them are carried back with a belly full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis .
dermal cells , however , remain in place until they die .
but with time , tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts to the alien pigment particles , slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system 's macrophages .
but since the dermal cells are relatively stable , much of the ink will remain deep in the skin for a person 's whole life .
technically , yes .
for this reason , removing a tattoo is still more difficult than getting one , but not impossible .
so a single tattoo may not truly last forever , but tattoos have been around longer than any existing culture .
and their continuing popularity means that the art of tattooing is here to stay .
you 've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth , but how does it work ?
well , not entirely .
this is where we enter the quantum realm .
every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons .
to shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level , a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy .
no more , no less .
it gets that energy from light , which comes in more energy levels than you could count .
one that doesn 't appear to be emitting light at all : Earth .
if you 're wondering why our planet doesn 't seem to be glowing , it 's because the Earth doesn 't emit visible light .
it 's the same energy , but at a higher or lower level .
the hotter an object gets , the higher frequency the light it emits .
when you heat a piece of iron , it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light , and then , at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius , its light will reach the visible spectrum .
95 % of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes .
just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons , carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons .
song : before God destroyed the people on the Earth , he warned Noah to build an Ark .
so we 've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ...
and so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab , we created this new high @-@ resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch @-@ input device to a phone .
so with that , I will leave you .
but keep looking . get weird and stare at it .
those eyes look like most eyes I 've seen before , nothing weird going on here . "
in his " Meditations on First Philosophy , " Ren√© Descartes tried to answer that very question , demolishing all his preconceived notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations .
the second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically , according to methods that I 'll describe a little bit later on .

so Gertrude Stein , who 's a human , is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer .
this has led me to understand that the human is not a cold , hard fact .
rather , it is something that 's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time .
so my final insight is that the computer , more or less , works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it .
this is an essentially philosophical idea , and it 's one that can 't be answered with software alone , but I think requires a moment of species @-@ wide , existential reflection .
on September 1st , 1953 , William Scoville used a hand crank and a cheap drill saw to bore into a young man 's skull , cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube .
partial lobotomies had been used for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas .
H.M. ' s seizures virtually disappeared , with no change in personality , and his IQ even improved .
after immediate sensory data is temporarily transcribed by neurons in the cortex , it travels to the hippocampus , where special proteins work to strengthen the cortical synaptic connections .
so , why does music rely so heavily on repetition ?
one part of the answer come from what psychologists call the mere @-@ exposure effect .
to investigate , psychologists asked people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition .
in this way , repetition can open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing .
this mode of listening ties in with our susceptibility to musical ear worms , where segments of music burrow into our head , and play again and again , as if stuck on repeat .
critics are often embarrassed by music 's repetitiveness , finding it childish or regressive , but repetition , far from an embarrassment , is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience we think about as musical .
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to expand into general pop culture .
it says that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism to sports commentary .
the real origin is much deeper and more amazing .
wavelength is essential for quantum physics because an object 's wavelength is related to its momentum , mass times velocity .
small things , like atoms or electrons though , can have wavelengths big enough to measure in physics experiments .
we can know a particles position very well , but it doesn 't have a wavelength , so we don 't know its momentum .
by combining waves with different wavelengths , which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different momenta .
the result has regions where we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all .
both position and momentum are now uncertain , and the uncertainties are connected .
if you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet , you need to add more waves , which means a bigger momentum uncertainty .
that 's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , first stated by German physicist Werner Heisenberg back in 1927 .
this is the situation that 's predicted to happen in 2050 .
much of Africa , in fact , much of the world , is going to be in trouble .
we 're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food .

you and I are 65 percent water -- we lose one percent of that , we die .
most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss .
and probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals .
annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies .
up the west coast of my country , for much of the year you don 't see much vegetation growth .
seeds are energy @-@ rich so there 's a lot of food calories , you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine , but there 's a downside .

what we 're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some 10 to 40 million years ago .
the Romantic poets of the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more deeply understand other profound emotions , like beauty and joy .
Singapore 's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism , spectacular growth , while politics remains democracy @-@ free .
am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer ?
but above all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy .
( laughter ) BG : indeed , and possibly we are too , now .
it 's because we have confined , as I was saying in my talk , democracy to the political sphere , while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy @-@ free zone .
in a sense , if I am allowed to be provocative , China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century .
they were simply interested in crushing our government , just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone .

" come on , Your Honor , we all learned it in school .
" Hmm . why is celebrating this Columbus so important to you , anyway ? "

Don 't we deserve a hero to remind everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants ? "
" and what about the struggles of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from poverty and discrimination ?
how can you make a hero out of a man who caused so much suffering ? "
people back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization across the world was a moral duty . "
" in some Latin American countries , they celebrate the same date under different names , such as D√≠a de la Raza .
" so , why not just change the name if it 's such a problem ? "
traditions and holidays are important to all cultures , but a hero in one era may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands and our values evolve .
it 's only when the box is opened that we see a single definite state .
until then , the cat is a blur of probability , half one thing and half the other .
we don 't see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases as the momentum increases .
if we took a single atom and blew it up to the size of the Solar System , the wavelength of a cat running from a physicist would be as small as an atom within that Solar System .
a tiny particle , like an electron , though , can show dramatic evidence of its dual nature .
block one of the slits and the stripes go away .
a single electron isn 't choosing to go left or right but left and right simultaneously .
as you add more atoms , the electrons spread out more , shared between vast numbers of atoms at the same time .
understanding how electrons are shared among atoms allows us to precisely control the properties of semiconductor materials , like silicon .
in standard notation , rhythm is indicated on a musical bar line , but there are other ways .
remember that ticking clock ?
we can mark the beats at different positions around the circle using blue dots for main beats , orange ones for off beats , and white dots for secondary beats .
or a three beat rhythm with a main beat , an off beat , and a secondary beat .
we can then add an outermost layer consisting of an additive rhythmic component , reinforcing the main beat and increasing accuracy .
now let 's remove everything except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top .
in all of these examples , the underlying rhythm reinforces the basic one @-@ two , but in different ways depending on arrangement and cultural context .
so it turns out that the wheel method is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms .
since ancient times , mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics was discovered or invented .
are numbers , polygons and equations truly real , or merely ethereal representations of some theoretical ideal ?
they called the number one , " the monad , " the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation .
but while our brain is busy dreaming , it 's letting plenty of signals slip by .
first , liars reference themselves less , when making deceptive statements .
for example , a liar might say something like , " Sorry , my stupid phone battery died . I hate that thing . "

one ancient theory was an idea called vitalism , which claimed that living things were unique because they were filled with a special substance , or energy , that was the essence of life .
though his experiments were discredited , much like the rest of vitalism , traces of his theory still come up in popular culture .
and research into cryonics hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people and reviving them later when newer technology is able to help them .
but when white captains came offering manufactured goods , weapons , and rum for slaves , African kings and merchants had little reason to hesitate .
they viewed the people they sold not as fellow Africans but criminals , debtors , or prisoners of war from rival tribes .
and the increased competition and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability that continues to this day .

knowing that your own brain is lying to you while not being able to resist its commands can be agonizing .
the trick was in the spin .
too fast and it hooks too late .
the ball 's spin creates a pressure differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it in the direction of the spin .
and here 's a question .
there are no reflective surfaces , all water is in opaque containers , and most importantly , they 're not allowed to communicate among themselves .
it might help to realize that the amount of prisoners is arbitrary .
let 's simplify things by imagining just two , Adria and Bill .

a semicolon 's job is to reunite two independent clauses that will benefit from one another 's company because they refer to the same thing .
in these countries , it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation .
worse than that , countries like India , Russia , South Africa , Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and , in many cases , actually regressing .
without growth , countries contract and atrophy , not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived .
economic growth matters powerfully for the individual .
there are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what 's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth .
and to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term , we 're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance .
when in practical experience , capitalism is much more of a spectrum .
and only after they 've maximized their utility do they then decide it 's important to provide support to other social contracts .
but nevertheless , this framework -- this two @-@ stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model .
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge .
more recently , of course , the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society .

in medieval times , alchemists tried to achieve the seemingly impossible .
indeed , today we can manufacture gold on Earth thanks to modern inventions that those medieval alchemists missed by a few centuries .
but to understand how this precious metal became embedded in our planet to start with , we have to gaze upwards at the stars .
gold is extraterrestrial .
stars are mostly made up of hydrogen , the simplest and lightest element .
however , at that point nuclear fusion no longer releases enough energy , and the pressure from the core peters out .
the outer layers collapse into the center , and bouncing back from this sudden injection of energy , the star explodes forming a supernova .
so it makes sense that the body should screen embryos carefully to find out which ones are worth the challenge .
this is where menstruation fits in .
as it slowly dies , it could leave its mother vulnerable to infection , and all the time , it may be emitting hormonal signals that disrupt her tissues .
finally , it needs to understand the semantics , what the different parts of the sentence actually mean .
morphology can also pose a problem .
now , fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind .
information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available .
protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids .
if you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence , would you ?
that 's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the Experience Machine .
is there inherent value in real experiences , whether pleasurable or painful ?
you see , race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference .
thank you .
vertebrates like us have a rigid skeleton to support our bodies , with joints that allow us to move .
cephalopods , on the other hand , have no bones at all , allowing them to bend their limbs at any point and in any direction .
other promising treatments , like transcranial magnetic stimulation , are being investigated , too .
it 's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies .
you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he 's increasing his intracranial pressure .
but when you eat foods high in fiber , like vegetables , fruits , and whole grains , those indigestible beta bonds slow the release of glucose into the blood .
those foods have a lower glycemic index , and foods like eggs , cheese , and meats have the lowest glycemic index .
this often occurs when aggregated data hides a conditional variable , sometimes known as a lurking variable , which is a hidden additional factor that significantly influences results .
but dividing the cases by the race of the victim told a different story .
the two sides of your brain look similar , but function differently .

that same day , we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school .
emotions were so raw , understandably , and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims , or people who were perceived to be Muslim , being pulled out and beaten in the street .

it turns out that this is actually a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination inside your brain .
these neurons encode various characteristics of the object : spiky , fruit , brown , green , and yellow .
but this principle doesn 't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations without ever seeing them .
the neuronal ensemble for a dolphin balancing a pineapple doesn 't exist .
if the neuronal ensembles for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time , we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image .
if the neuronal ensembles are turned on at the same time , you experience the composite image just as if you 'd actually seen it .
this conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis .
the problem is that some neurons are much farther away from the prefrontal cortex than others .
you can 't change the length of the connections , but your brain , especially as it develops in childhood , does have a way to change the conduction velocity .
and fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones .
in 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper .
he said , well , why don 't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney -- that was slang for a nickel .
and within one year , by 1915 , there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle , 45,000 rides per day in Kansas and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles .
and so these are the trolley guys , the existing transportation monopoly at the time .
and there were all kinds of regulations .
in other cities , they required two jitney drivers for one jitney .
( laughter ) All right . so what happened ?
well , within a year this thing had taken off .
that 's unfortunate ...
we even have skyscrapers built for cars .
now , cities have been dealing with this problem for decades .
well , it 's because mass transit hasn 't yet figured out how to get to everybody 's doorstep .
we saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place .

how do we get that to a million ?
well , we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE .
how would our cities be different today ?

and so what we did was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car .
ca : OK , that 's cool .
I mean -- who are you ?
it 's now in many cities , half the price of a taxi .
and so what that means is more trips per hour , more minutes of the hour where they 're productive and actually , earnings come up .
and we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down .
so I think there 's a lot of good .
but even though she has never seen color , Mary is an expert in color vision and knows everything ever discovered about its physics and biology .

in mythological ancient Greece , soaring above Crete on wings made from wax and feathers , Icarus , the son of Daedalus , defied the laws of both man and nature .
to witnesses on the ground , he looked like a god , and as he peered down from above , he felt like one , too .
preceded by his storied reputation , Daedalus was welcomed with open arms by Crete 's King Minos .
as he strapped the wings to his son Icarus , he gave a warning : flying too near the ocean would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use .
until then , chocolate only existed in Mesoamerica in a form quite different from what we know .
beyond dryness , tardigrades can also tolerate other extreme stresses : being frozen , heated up past the boiling point of water , high levels of radiation , and even the vacuum of outer space .
they live on every continent , including Antarctica .
in the process , tardigrades could even help us answer a critical question : could life survive on planets much less hospitable than our own ?
diet , too , is emerging as one of the leading influences on the health of our guts .
dietary fiber from foods like fruits , vegetables , nuts , legumes , and whole grains is the best fuel for gut bacteria .
lower fiber means less fuel for the gut bacteria , essentially starving them until they die off .
these foods contain polyphenols , which are naturally occurring antioxidant compounds .
so lightly steamed , saut√©ed , or raw vegetables are typically more beneficial than fried dishes .
there are also ways of preparing food that can actually introduce good bacteria , also known as probiotics , into your gut .
originally used as a way of preserving foods before the invention of refrigeration , fermentation remains a traditional practice all over the world .
yogurt is another fermented food that can introduce helpful bacteria into our guts .

that 's a route that visits every point within it exactly once .

Matcha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged .
and in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty , the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea .
this gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world .
that spread began in earnest around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantities .
all were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits .
this triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug .
the war weakened China 's global standing for over a century .
so they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation .
what do fans of atmospheric post @-@ punk music have in common with ancient barbarians ?
not much .
but the Western Empire would never be united again .
this shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Abbey of Saint Denis in France in 1137 .
with the Italian Renaissance 's renewed admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome , the more recent style began to seem crude and inferior in comparison .
but time marched on , as did what was considered fashionable .
as far back as the 4th century BCE , the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make the brilliant white pigment we know today .
in humans , lead is directly absorbed into the body and distributed to the blood , soft tissues , and mineralized tissues .
yet the practice of using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures .

Curie soon found that the element thorium emitted similar radiation .
they also coined the term radioactivity along the way .
and so both of the curies and Becquerel shared the 1903 Nobel Prize , making Marie Curie the first female Nobel Laureate .
some are political , therapy @-@ based , focused on self @-@ improvement , or otherwise .
some play on our natural inclination to mimic social behaviors or follow orders .
if you 're like most people , you 'd probably be paralyzed by this task .
in fact , researchers know that an overload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy , or CTE .
yes , these men and women were the stars of the show for me .
and my hand gripped firmer , so I wouldn 't be the one left in the field .
I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come , who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment , who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now .
I had believed .
now what ?
and now , where there was once a mountain of certitude , there was , running right down to its foundation , a spring of doubt , a spring that promised rivers .
and from that graveyard , I began the search once more , not because I was brave , but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die .
under a full @-@ size replica of a whale , I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds .
there was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars .
I had been duped , hoodwinked , bamboozled .
we speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems .
the gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing , it asks that you believe a new thing : that it is possible not to believe .
and so impeachment was adopted in the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers , up to and including the president .
but let me tell you right off the bat , we are not Shangri @-@ La .
economic growth is important , but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment .
so today , the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood .
that is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year .
a few years ago , a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below .
we are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles .
but what we do not discuss is how ill @-@ equipped our prosecutors are to receive them .
we rarely , if ever , talk about the prosecutor .
Christopher 's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such , but I didn 't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer .
we stick to an outdated method , counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want , and that 's safer communities .
they have little appreciation for what we can do .
the more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system , the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again -- all at tremendous social cost to his children , to his family and to his peers .
as an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens , I knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system .
you deserve it , your children deserve it , the people who are tied up in the system deserve it , but most of all , the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it .
which means that there are a lot of family events .
and then , when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table , it struck me , this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land , how does he climb a staircase ?
and then ...
that may be why people with a moderate amount of experience or expertise often have less confidence in their abilities .
so , this is a story about how we know what we know .
( applause ) This is Azuri .
more of that file downloaded ? - the system groups these interruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait .
you wouldn 't even know it was there , if not for the red lump that appears , accompanied by a telltale itch .
our bodies are teeming with leukocytes : there are between 4,000 and 11,000 in every microliter of blood .
as soon as the leukocytes detect them , it takes only minutes for the body 's protective immune response to kick in .
first , phagocytes trigger the immune response by sending macrophages and dendritic cells into the blood .
that allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders they just ingested and transmit this information to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense , the lymphocytes .
b @-@ cells can produce millions of these , which then cycle through the body and attack the invaders until the worst of the threat is neutralized .
that 's how you can develop immunity to certain diseases , like chickenpox .
they supported me all the way through it .
it wasn 't their dream .
it stems from a lifelong interest of mine in , believe it or not , poverty .
and it was like a lot of you , kind of a prosaic example , kind of trite .
or to people just like him all over the world ?
there 's no other way .
so how are we going to do it ? how are we going to do it together ?
if you 're a conservative , be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor .
and this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders .
meaning , there 's a 99 percent chance that they 'll get away with it .
this means there 's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States .
so this , to me , is a tragic but a solvable problem .
we started by talking to college survivors .
thank you .
so I 'd start off light , and I 'd bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
I know that if you 're not a trained brain expert , it 's not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
( laughter ) There is a difference .
( laughter ) And to the Monkey , humans are just another animal species .
literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
these are people who were nurses , bankers , painters , engineers and lots and lots of PhD students .
these people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
and when there 's deadlines , the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved .
and it 's this long @-@ term kind of procrastination that 's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier , short @-@ term deadline @-@ based kind .
tense muscles and inflamed , sensitive nerves cause varying degrees of discomfort in each headache .
patients report stress , dehydration , and hormone changes as triggers , but these don 't fit the symptoms quite right .
but thankfully , pharmacologists and neurologists are hard at work cracking these pressing mysteries that weigh so heavily on our minds .
I 'd like to talk to you today about this problem , and how we can fix it with neuroscience .
turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception -- that 's the sense of our body parts in space .
it 's the activity that seems to accelerate people 's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community .
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on .
this premieres in Monaco -- it 's in September 2009 . if by any chance you can 't make it , another idea with this project -- here 's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
this is by far the farthest he 's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital , I can tell you that , because he 's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music .
so , turned out he 's a fantastic composer , and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours . he has made many , many pieces .
so , you want to say a little bit about how you guys work ?
but what about expression ? what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ? you know , do our technologies allow us to express ?
and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen .
so , in hearing this piece , as I mentioned before , the most important thing is the music 's great , and it 'll show you who Dan is .
the eponymous moonshot .
here 's our moonshot blueprint .
vertical farming uses 10 times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming .
the radical solution ?
if there 's an Achilles ' heel in one our projects , we want to know it now , up front , not way down the road .
with 1.2 million people dying on the roads globally every year , building a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take .
and they came up with a beautiful , new perspective .
you tell the car where you want to go , you push a button and it takes you from point A to point B by itself .
and now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines .
and the longer it survives that pressure , the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world .
we 're trying to make balloon @-@ powered Internet .
we made balloons the size of a blue whale .
so we 're going to keep going .
" what will happen to me if I fail ?
we have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects , from teams as small as two to teams of more than 30 .
it 's optimism 's perfect partner .
choking is common in sports , where performance often occurs under intense pressure and depends on key moments .
here , the logic goes that once a skill becomes automatic , thinking about its precise mechanics interferes with your ability to do it .
from self @-@ driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head , machines are becoming capable of understanding our world .
six hundred million humans watched them on grainy , black @-@ and @-@ white televisions .
thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today .
thank you .
that 's my question for a hologram .
in fact , by the end of that week in July , the hashtag # ifafricawasabar would have garnered around 60,000 tweets , lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world .
we all together build Humanae .
so your work has a very special place in my heart and it 's very important for me . "
and it made it so much more .
going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal -- to me .
well , I mean , maybe it is if you 're -- ( Laughter ) If you want to sell your result then it 's a huge deal -- don 't get me wrong .
but if you 're interested in the technology and you 're interested in the project , the big part was getting the community .
then the community grew gradually .
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
Lt : so one of the issues we had , and this took a while to start to appear , is when you ...
there 's a lot of people who make small , small changes .
Lt : yeah , I think I was the prototypical nerd .
I was not a people person back then .
like , before I stepped into the room she would say , " OK . that 's so @-@ and @-@ so ... "
and that 's not the kind of person I am .
was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built ?
shall we say , " myopic " when it comes to other people 's feelings , and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people .
I 'm not a people person ; it 's not something I 'm particularly proud of , but it 's part of me .
I can 't do UI to save my life .
it 's this idea called taste .
and I 've just got a couple of images here .
what is the difference between these two ?
Lt : so this is -- How many people here actually have coded ?
but this is simple code .
good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowing what 's the right way to do things .
and I am not a visionary .
and I think it 's really -- I mean -- I 'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying , " I want to go there . "
I mean , there are people who name their companies after him .
so , what do we do about it ?
it 's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it 's a radical departure from the status quo .
sadly , that 's what often happens .
so within less than three months of our team being on the ground , we were already able to push our first products to production .
this is on us , all of us , together , because government is not an abstract institution or a concept .
and so I decided to study computer programming in college .
as you can see , we can create any world that we want inside the computer .
but we are not beholden to it .
this guy , WALL @-@ E , is a great example of that .
( laughter ) Now , glassy @-@ eyed is a fundamentally awful thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he 's capable of falling in love .
we tried turning them down , we tried blocking them , nothing was working .
now we recognize WALL @-@ E as having an eye .
maybe because unlike normal , we were basing it on something in real life , or maybe just because we had lost our way .
I came in one morning and checked the previous night 's work .
and then the production designer started clapping .
imagine -- the cell effectively spits out the drug .
siRNA are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene .
but if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues , it degrades within seconds .
first , let 's start with the nanoparticle core .
the two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction , and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream .
and guess what ? our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object .
second , this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell .
planets don 't get much bigger than Jupiter .
this means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth .
this is truly remarkable .
and so what was happening had to be astrophysical , meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight .
there are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky .
I want you to imagine that you get a text from a friend , and it reads , " You will not believe what just happened .
( laughter ) " People who walk too slowly . " that one 's mine .
we can feel angry at the same time that we 're scared or sad or feeling a host of other emotions .
the reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry , so there 's got to be something else going on .
there are all these written and unwritten rules of the road , and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you , usually without consequence .
( laughter ) So you 're driving somewhere , thus teed up to be angry , and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit .
five minutes I 'll spend just because it 's interesting . just because it 's fun .
like Wikipedia , like the Open Directory Project , you 're beginning to build platforms , and you see that as a model .
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .
let 's call them OncoSearch .
every day was about creating something new .
we all know that exploration is risky .
small children , they explore all day .
for example , " How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company ? "
we discover something , but we don 't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work .
so instead of staying with it , we create something new .
but the same goes for that , then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated .
and any company that 's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future .
riding into Rome on the carriage , they always had a companion whispering in their ear , " Remember , you 're only human . "
how about a few weeks ?
build space elevators , or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet ?
let 's say , hypothetically , what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth @-@ derived nutrients ?
well , it turns out we 've already done things like this .
but then again , what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious ?
OK , so , confession : I 've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising .
but then , all of that suddenly changed on February 23 , 1997 , when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building .
and that comes down to finding common ground , where what I want overlaps with what you want .
and you might be surprised to learn , when it comes to gun violence , just how much common ground there is .
and that 's exactly what 's happened here .
and a lot of those people are children .
enough .
and yes , Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal to her 35 million Twitter followers for expanded background checks .
we 're marching across the country , state by state , marriage @-@ equality style .
it 's estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion US dollars a year .
so you can freeze sperm , you can freeze eggs , you can freeze fertilized eggs .
there have been at least 33 versions of hominids that have walked around this Earth .
some people will choose to alter all .
now , Minesweeper is awesome , but it 's not the driver of the effect , because if you play the game first before you learn about the task , there 's no creativity boost .
they just manage it differently .
a lot of people think they will .
why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times ?
thank you .
think of the planet like a human body that we inhabit .
the skeleton is the transportation system of roads and railways , bridges and tunnels , air and seaports that enable our mobility across the continents .
this continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka contains more than 80 million people and most of Japan 's economy .
but in China , megacity clusters are coming together with populations reaching 100 million people .
in the Middle East , Greater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran 's population .
and in the gulf , a necklace of city @-@ states is forming , from Bahrain and Qatar , through the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman .
and yet , our global stock of financial assets has never been larger , approaching 300 trillion dollars .
now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies .
China and Japan have an even longer history of rivalry and have been deploying their air forces and navies to show their strength in island disputes .
but first , a few fascinating facts about where we 're going .
the atmosphere on Mars is really thin -- 100 times thinner than on Earth -- and it 's not breathable , it 's 96 percent carbon dioxide .
it was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans , and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon .
so getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question ...
maybe they can .
10 years ago , SpaceX had not launched anything , or fired a rocket to anywhere .
private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy to take you to Mars .
and if you look at Mars , it looks really dry , it looks like the entire planet is a desert .
in fact , if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted , most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water .
next we have to worry about what we will breathe .
I love this thing .
it 's a reverse fuel cell , essentially , that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen .
but the secret to this -- and that 's just for testing -- the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get @-@ go to be scalable by a factor of 100 .
at first we can use inflatable , pressurized buildings as well as the landers themselves .
so we really have to go underground .
when that happened , people looked at each other and said , " If we can do this , we can do anything . "
and so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more .
we were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila .
we needed a sustainable movement , not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic downturn .
indeed , the powerful American politician Tip O 'Neill once said , " All politics is local . "
it has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
and he 's one of my favorites , even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause .
and in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man 's impact on global warming .
so , why don 't we hear more about the world ?
far above the world , Planet Earth is blue and there 's nothing I can do . "
if I could find them , I could assemble them into a narrative .
menstruation .
I think you all must be aware of it , but I 'll still list it for the few who don 't .
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member 's bed .
he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society .
we are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries .
and then came the long ...
the continents drifted . the mammals rose .
and then , in East Africa , an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought .
thus , multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of fossils , each one a small miracle , but collectively , inevitable .
but over geological time , improbable , nearly impossible events do occur .
along the path from our wormy , Cambrian ancestors to primates dressed in suits , innumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular reality .
those two streams -- they look identical .
that 's not how to think of a TED Talk .
here 's Haley .
ideas come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic .
Sir Ken Robinson -- creativity is key to our kids ' future .
( video ) Sir Ken Robinson : my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . "
if the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I 'm sorry to say , it 's probably not worth sharing .
most of us are like my mom .
they are not trusted .
and people are using them the same way that we do .
they 're texting their friends , they 're looking up directions , they 're browsing the Internet and they 're even making financial transactions .
Jenipher answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device .
so for one , we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda .
we could also see that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day , she actually had pretty regular travel patterns , and she was either at home or at her food stall .
we could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network .
our job now is to open the world to Jenipher and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted .
but there is an art form that 's been around for a very long time that 's really about using information , abstract information , to make emotionally resonant pieces .
these things are systems that are designed to unfold over time , to make us feel .
and what it really shows you is the history of editing in Hollywood cinema .
you can think of this as a quantified selfie .
sometimes you do this data and this work with real @-@ time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city .
there 's a wire going through to the trigger , and the computer in the box is online .
it 's listening to the 911 feed of the New Orleans Police Department , so that anytime there 's a shooting reported in New Orleans , ( gunshot sound ) the gun fires .
now , there 's a blank , so there 's no bullet .
when you do it right , it 's illuminating .
that 's 17,000 a day , and I have them all .
( laughter ) These are some of them with their eyes centered .
simply , I live in Gaza , there is no airport .
on some days , we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours .
we have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes .
I do have terrible nightmares because of all that I witnessed during war times , especially these lifeless bodies of young children .
and the funny thing is they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza .
( laughter ) I hope one day , I will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women , all other amazing women I know in my country .
and there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing -- uncontrolled money printing -- leading to hyperinflation .
but here -- here 's the intriguing part .
and they remain unused today .
so here 's an idea .
what you end up with is a collective , global action aimed -- and it 's controlled global action -- aimed at a global good .
and , as we 've learned with the money @-@ printing schemes , whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules .
that 's important because it would allay well , let 's say , the ridiculous concerns that the US might have that the SDR could ever challenge the dollar 's dominant role in international finance .
so what could we do with 300 other pay @-@ for @-@ performance climate projects like that , organized on a global scale ?
and those are the times they 're most productive .
it 's very well known . I 'm not going to spend a lot of time on those .
we currently have three locations in the Caribbean , and we 're planning a fourth one .
Africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to Africa .
what amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human ?
now , after 15 years -- 15 years after we read the first sequence -- this October , we started to see some signals .
we certainly don 't do it for predicting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your blood .
that 's a fractional precision of 0.000000004 .
objects of this size hit the Earth every 50 years or so .
I wrote a letter that started out , " Dear Researcher . "
we met Arupa and her staff , and Arupa said that when I told her not to feel guilty , that it was a relief , and that she hadn 't seen it from our perspective .
( laughter ) But it 's not only about convenience .
thank you .
this was the golden age of piracy , where pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas .
but I picked design , because I believe it 's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life .
and that 's exactly what happened .
an undergraduate can do it .
so thank goodness , they can 't be used to engineer viruses or bacteria .
OK , so where does this leave us ?
so when you hear about gene drives in the coming months , and trust me , you will be hearing about them , remember that .
that would be a game @-@ changing technology , right ?
and to explain to you what is neural entrainment , let me first explain what is physical entrainment .
so if we take Jim O 'Grady and scramble the words , we 'll get a list of words .
and right on ... pie man ... potentially ... my stories UH : and you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas , but not more than that .
( audio ) JO : and they recommend against crossing that line .
in this , I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate .
when I showed this work recently in Miami , a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul .
worldwide , over two @-@ thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today .
I 'd say , " I don 't know ! "
in particular , textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school .
they 're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system .
and I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk is that there 's an impending cut @-@ out @-@ the @-@ middle @-@ man disintermediation , that 's going to be happening in the publishing industry .
that was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B + . ( laughter ) What I 'm going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create .
and it wasn 't bad , but it wasn 't really creative .
and they 're the same ones that I have today .
it was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . and she said , " Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . "
and what I need , in effect , is a focus .
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
do you see me up on the screen ?
audience : yes .
this is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read about relevant theory .
and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential .
if you did , could you please raise your hand ?
and today , I 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made .
but to begin , I 'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina , who is my friend and an elementary school principal .
the caller says , " Mr. Messina , my son Johnny will not come to school today because he 's sick . "
we adults can easily detect their lies .
we have been playing guessing games with children all over the world .
and before we leave the room , we tell them not to peek at the cards .
and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age .
as it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
are you ready ?
their performance is around chance .
can they detect children 's lies ?
what about , can parents detect their own children 's lies ?
let me illustrate this with my own son , Nathan .
so in the last five years , we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions .
the lights were too bright .
I kept having panic attacks , but they eventually went away .
they should be going in the same direction , but they 're going in different directions .
everyone understands the situation they 're all in .
race relations are terrible .
and I was working on an article for " Forbes , " entitled " Wells Fargo and Millennial Whistle @-@ blowing .
and as I was working on this piece and reading about the case , I became outraged .
with that , I want to leave you with one additional name : Peter Buxtun .
how many of us have ever used the term snitch , rat tattletale , snake , weasel , leak ?
police and prison guards in Cambodia , for example , have been documented subjecting sex workers to what can only be described as torture : threats at gunpoint , beatings , electric shocks , rape and denial of food .
but we 're also vulnerable if we choose to break the law by working together .
you 're working together , this place is illegal . "
can you afford to take the risk ?
and even if it 's possible in principle , getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money .
if prohibition is this harmful , you might ask , why it so popular ?
I don 't think this is an accident .
well , lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking .
the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections , allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest .
that 's true of prostitution , but it 's also true of agricultural work , hospitality work and domestic work .
there 's no call to ban rich people from hiring nannies or getting manicures , even though most of the people doing that labor are poor , migrant women .
if we get fixated on the abolition of sex work , we end up worrying more about a particular manifestation of gender inequality , rather than about the underlying causes .
here in the UK , I 'm part of sex worker @-@ led groups like the Sex Worker Open University and the English Collective of Prostitutes .
but we need more allies .
this distinction between victim and empowered is imaginary .
I 'm just one sex worker on the stage today , but I 'm bringing a message from all over the world .
in it , he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran .
I 'll tell you .
I was a misfit .
they weren 't mainstream women writers , but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories , I like to think , kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon .
see , now most people , especially TED people , would have run to the mailbox , right ?
and I 'm a writer .
the modules can self @-@ assemble into a large 3x3x3 cube , with each individual module placed anywhere in the cube , and at any orientation .
you 've painted a total of 54 faces red at this point , so you 'll need the same number of faces for the green and purple cubes , too .
that 's 162 faces , which is precisely how many the cubes have in total .
it rearranges itself to be red in deep space , purple as it enters RH @-@ 1729 " s atmosphere , and green when it flies through the electric storms .
and let me show you what it is that he found .
that is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
he , like Einstein , was in search of what we call a unified theory .
so Kaluza said to himself , Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more precise .
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn 't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
( laughter ) But it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
in the remaining time , I 'd like to tell you two features of them .
first is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics , theoretical science .
and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .
and just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
and we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia .
my process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change .
I draw with soft pastel , which is dry like charcoal , but colors .
she and I were in the early stages of planning , as we had intended to go together , when she fell victim to a brain tumor .
so it 's no wonder that some men don 't want to be bothered and skip going to the doctor altogether , especially if they feel fine .
but for just a second , my eyes glow white , and I hold this thing for I could speak to the good @-@ for @-@ nothing in a language he maybe understands .
( beat ) And the good @-@ for @-@ nothings become good @-@ for @-@ disappearing into whatever toxic waste , chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of .
and he ain 't looking my way , but I hear him mumble two words to me : " I 'm sorry . "
if you look up high enough , you could see me .
he dresses up in old shining armor , mounts his skinny horse , and leaves his village in search of glory .
early on , Don Quixote is joined by a villager @-@ turned @-@ squire named Sancho Panza .
and astonishingly enough , occasionally even people born without a limb can feel a phantom .
neural pathways carry this sensory input through the spinal cord and up to the brain .
the patient places the phantom limb into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb in front of the mirror .
and phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize prosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively .
and on his left , my sisters : Mary Catherine , Judith Ann , Theresa Marie .
they 're afraid their baby will die .
how can that be ?
I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better .
they were so weak from the treatment I had given them .
but here 's the thing : we 're already doing this in a limited way , and it 's already starting to make a big difference .
what if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world ?
this is where we need to make our voices heard .
that 's when I heard , maybe not for the first time , " Stifle yourself , Jeanette , I 'm going . "
and my mother was selling the furniture , because we were leaving -- she didn 't want to stay in that state of shame , in Chelsea , Massachusetts .
NL : benefit in that it gave me that springboard .
( laughter ) So ...
the first time I ran into an understanding that there were people in this world that hated me because I was born to Jewish parents .
and lots of little parades .
the truth was my grandfather took me to parades , we had lots of those .
the truth is he would write an occasional letter , and I did pick up those little envelopes .
NL : an impact on him -- I was hesitating over the word , " change . "
eh : I want to talk about -- NL : well , then do it .
NL : here 's where my mind goes when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished .
which we 're trying to save and it requires saving .
anything I may have accomplished is -- my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in Newington , Connecticut .
how old do you feel ?
( applause ) NL : we out of here ?
each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes .
I know it has for me .
I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air , and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day .
and I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata , an event that 's actually been taking place since 1498 .
the fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs .
so this is the photograph I created of Yosemite .
this is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic .
and I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape .
the best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night .
you can see Michelle waiting with the children , the president now greets the crowd , he takes his oath , and now he 's speaking to the people .
( applause ) I 've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work .
they would walk up , take a picture , and then walk away .
it keeps on occurring again and again , from many theories and many experiments , as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathematicians .
( Board shaking ) This is a bit of a sport , because we need to resolve some traffic jams in there .
at that time , I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton -- for many years , the home of Albert Einstein and arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world .
and together with my former student and main collaborator Cl√©ment Mouhot , in Paris at the time , we had been working for months and months on such a proof .
the world is filled with incredible objects and rich cultural heritage .
what might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage , the beautiful locations and the art in this world ?
but imagine this accessibility for a kid in Bombay who 's studying architecture , who hasn 't had a chance to go to The Guggenheim as yet .
Oh , perfect .
coming back to gold very quickly , I wanted to search for gold and see how the machine tagged all the gold .
Chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies .
as a Pig , I need to be careful with a Snake .
but they just don 't make them like they used to -- which is another sign of the decline in America .
hungry , extreme poverty : these often seem like gigantic , insurmountable problems , too big to solve .
and then at lunchtime , I watched with an increasingly sick feeling as the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch .
she has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet .
anybody can give , but we need more leadership .
if you 're interested in these ideas , check out this website .
humanity has put people on the moon .
we are an exceptional people .
we just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody .
let us deliver an end to extreme poverty in this lifetime .
in America , even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance .
Paul 's daughter followed in his footsteps , but with one difference : when she graduated five years ago , it was with a whopping debt .
but that 's where the rubber meets the road .
even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013 .
the worst of times can be the best of times , because certain truths flash up in ways that you can 't ignore .
your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry .
with all that money to be made , are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising , in bait and switch ...
many years ago my teacher wrote , " When students are treated as consumers , they 're made prisoners of addiction and envy . "
just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone , so also people can be sold more and more education .
people can be upsold on certifications and recertifications , master 's degrees , doctoral degrees .
so you can be the object of envy of others .
and it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt .
there is such a thing , by the way .
what if there was an app for that ?
who then , by the way , goes on and earns more money .
we know about statistics , right ?
years ago they held a protest .
what if we could reimagine ways to help make your medicine @-@ taking easier ?
and of course , we 're in the age of genomics .
so instead of taking six medications , for example , I could integrate them into one .
and when we hit print , you print your combination of medications that might be needed by you on any individual day .
I can now -- The automated process would rotate and cycle through , to make sure the micromeds are loaded .
and this could evolve , I think , into an incredible way to improve adherence in medications across the globe .
how long is it until , say , that nursing @-@ home patient that you mentioned is able to print their pills in their home ?
these aren 't going to evolve and start with printers on your bathroom counter .
I 've been tagged in a photo .
what do you think makes more money in the United States than movies , game parks and baseball combined ?
how is this possible ?
you 're either on , and you 're connected and distracted all the time , or you 're off , but then you 're wondering , am I missing something important ?
we 're going to need design help .
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation .
and it was the most amazing meeting .
and they subtract from those positive hours the amount of time people spent on the website , because that 's a cost to people 's lives .
now to do this you also need a new system , because you 're probably thinking , today 's Internet economy -- today 's economy in general -- is measured in time spent .
we solved it with organic , when we said we need to value things a different way .
we solved it with LEED Certification , where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustainability .
and what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that 's driven and run entirely on time spent , to world that 's driven by time well spent .
so she said to us , " Look , I 've been heading this department for the last two years .
and addressing these non @-@ obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
small things being done by NGOs , being done by foundations .
and hence , it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has .
I 'll give you an example .
how do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers ?
and what 's interesting is , it 's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions .
often with innovative techniques .
in the context of education , it 's very difficult to see results quickly .
but where are we now ?
similar to this early stage of this medium , in VR , we also have to move past the spectacle and into the storytelling .
composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you .
so I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see .
let 's hope it works .
and when I was perfectly above -- you know , with the wind , we had to redo it a few times -- then I kept shooting .
please bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones .
Chris Milk : how was it ?
and we started seeing this all over Instagram .
let 's see where this leads them .
now despite this history of distrust , I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research .
my vision is to make genetic research more native , to indigenize genome sequencing technology .
and for those on the outside , just as Father Damien did , the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying .
as the leader of the NGO there , I spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities .
I saw the potential that it had for the issues I faced , so I decided to go back to school and get my master 's in social design .
this is an OXO potato peeler .
so without even realizing it , my solution was to take the muffled sound I heard , that was the beat , and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read .
all this complexity , all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe .
one of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we 've discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
( laughter ) But what he meant was that what we 've done , really , is stamp collect there .
it 's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
this equation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
I 'll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn 't be possible without an extra bit .
well , we had a long time to come up with good analogies .
Higgs particles , if you will .
there 's another issue , which is that the forces in nature -- it 's quite beautiful , actually -- seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
but in the last few minutes , I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology .
and I 'd say that it deserves , in the spirit of Wade Davis ' talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north .
the story goes like this : we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago , in an immensely hot , dense state , much smaller than a single atom .
gravity separated away from the other forces .
it was big enough to be transparent to light , and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God .
after about 400 million years , the first stars formed , and that hydrogen , that helium , then began to cook into the heavier elements .
and built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
to a psychologist .
( laughter ) And I thought you might like to know who you are .
I 'm in the field of research known as personality psychology , which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum , from neurons to narratives .
so , " O " stands for " open to experience , " versus those who are more closed .
the conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines , to persevering , as well as having some passion .
( laughter ) Those are the extroverts .
let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion , because it 's consequential and it 's intriguing , and it helps us understand what I call our three natures .
second , our sociogenic or second nature , which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives .
they all gather together .
it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation .
but it 's a misconstrual .
I should say , before getting to this , something about sexual intercourse , although I may not have time .
extroverts , when they interact , want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness .
they like to have a lot of eye contact , or mutual gaze .
or it could be your mom .
Don 't follow me .
it reminds me that the world 's in flux , and we have to respond to those changes .
so these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs .
if hospitals are making people sicker , where are the architects and designers to help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal ?
I was there to design and build a new type of hospital with Dr. Farmer and his team .
designing it is one thing ; getting it built , we learned , is quite another .
we worked with Bruce Nizeye , a brilliant engineer , and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school .
and on this job site , 15 years after the Rwandan genocide , Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds , and that half of them be women .
our two teams have worked together over the last year to design this memorial .
so let 's pretend that this is just a simple formula , x " x " w = y .
I 'm glossing over the very difficult part , of course , which is how on earth do we figure out the w , the brain that can do such a thing ?
and that zero -- let 's think about it as an error .
what if w = 1 ? the error is 4 .
this is what happens if Alex uses his own face as a guide image during that optimization process to reconstruct my own face .
and they give us both the ability to understand our own minds better and to extend them .
for nationalists , our modern societies are built on national grounds : we share a land , a history , a culture , and we defend each other .
nationalism is not going away anytime soon .
Buddhism , imported from India .
and of course , no perfect pizza Napoletana -- how would you make it without the tomatoes of the New World ?
around the same time as Egyptians were incubating eggs , Phoenician merchants introduced chickens to Europe , where they quickly became an essential part of European livestock .
sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time .
so along with my collaborators , we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound .
you will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume .
( digital hum and whistling sound ) The ( whistles ) is frogs at home , don 't pay attention to that .
twenty @-@ six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone , and I was almost one of them .
so this issue became very personal to me .
the scout is the one going out , mapping the terrain , identifying potential obstacles .
to illustrate these mindsets in action , I 'm going to take you back to 19th @-@ century France , where this innocuous @-@ looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history .
which makes you wonder : what does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man ?
future software engineers , entrepreneurs , craftsmen , musicians and artists .
have no fear for atomic energy ' cause none of them can stop the time .
some say it 's just a part of it , we 've got to fulfill the book .
( video ) Comment : great job .
these are all products of microbes .
and we can get to a type of vertical agriculture .
if we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers , then we wouldn 't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume .
hi . my name is Marwa , and I 'm an architect .
there were many reasons that had led to the war -- social , political and economic .
our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point .
yet , if you look at the structure by high @-@ resolution electron microscopy , and you ask yourself , what is it made of , surprisingly , it 's made of sugar .
so scientists all over the world believe that nanocellulose is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry .
the reason : there is a lot of it .
so for everybody , it 's an environmental problem , and for us , it 's a gold mine .
we can do a lot of things with the material .
so this can be used for making amazing things , like super @-@ fabrics for industrial and medical applications .
( laughter ) Why ? because they are jumpy .
( laughter ) But now , it 's actually enough to catch one .
but sometimes they are too strong , and therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit their surrounding tissues .
the reason is that in nature , there is no one there that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck , or takes my skin and glues it onto my body .
they develop into organs , and together bring life .
why collagen ?
also , the quality .
yeah , of course , I can take those bricks and build a new wall .
and many solar system bodies don 't have liquid water , and so we don 't look there .
Venus and Mars don 't have that .
atmosphere hasn 't been able to escape .
the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
we 're trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way .
but we 're working on it . how are we working on it ?
some of them are orbiting now , including the Maven spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars , which I 'm involved with and which is led here , out of the University of Colorado .
we have similar measurements from Venus and Earth .
once we have that answer , why should you care ?
we have the observations of those planets , but we just don 't know which ones are habitable yet .
I 'm really glad we 're here .
I have a forest in the backyard of my own house .
it attracts a lot of biodiversity .
( bird call ) I wake up to this every morning , like a Disney princess .
then we built up our cities on those forests , like S√£o Paulo , forgetting that we belong to nature as well , as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet .
nature , on the other hand , works in a totally opposite way .
and this was the first time I worked with nature , rather than against it .
we survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since Alia was six months old .
this is also about being in the present .
today , I have two senior women on my team , and I see making them successful as key to my own success .
my company , Kaggle , operates on the cutting edge of machine learning .
we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia .
can you imagine how long it took ?
so , we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .
it 's a country of 45 million people . it 's an economy that 's emerging .
it 's beginning to grow tremendously .
they have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa .
we 're concentrating our attention on four locations .
so what about Mars ?
we now know more than a dozen of them .
so what are we going to do now -- now that we see the water ?
in its past it had perhaps two @-@ thirds of its northern hemisphere -- there was an ocean .
Cassini was there since 2006 , and after a couple years looked back after it flew by Enceladus and surprised us all .
now , the only thing that we can think of that does that here on Earth as an analogy ...
another moon that we 're looking at is Titan .
now , let 's just take North America , for example , since that 's where we 're meeting .
every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there .
in a way , I feel like this is the choice that faces us .
( laughter ) So I went back to my favorite material , the gateway drug for making , corrugated cardboard , and I made myself a suit of armor , replete with the neck shields and a white horse .
( laughter ) This is a masterpiece , and one of my all @-@ time favorite films .
but this doesn 't go very well , and so he ends up going on kind of a rampage until Chihiro saves him , rescues him .
and we 're making it our own .
but one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information .
that 's friction .
and these companies have the right to say " no . "
in a digital world , money can reach much farther and is much faster , but we 're at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions .
all of these computers are collectively confirming who owns what Bitcoin .
this is very close to what these computers are all actually doing .
the path , it 's not easy .
so when I decided to create an art piece in Manshiyat Naser , the neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt , I never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that I would ever live .
the building number 3 was the house of Uncle Bakheet and aunty Fareeda .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) I think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt .
the calligraphy , actually -- I used a white glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark paint for the calligraphy so at the end of the project , we rented some black light projectors and lit up the whole neighborhood , surprising everybody around .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) The goal was to leave something to this community , but I feel that they are the ones who left something in our lives .
maybe someday we could read out a memory .
this is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient .
sometimes , it 's even guesswork .
thank you very much .
one misconception is that fire is a plasma , the fourth state of matter in which atoms are stripped of their electrons .
eventually , though , even the hottest fires run out of fuel or oxygen .
they ate away at my confidence , my leadership , my capacity to innovate .
and first , just knowing what they 're going through .
all of us .
at your company , on your team , in your city or town .
know my pronouns -- he , she , they .
and say no to panels without underrepresented speakers .
if you 're a person with privilege , it 's easier for you to advocate for allies .
it might remind you of a sort of intelligence .
they were giants .
so grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog .
but I persevered , and I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest , 25 years ago .
and fir was saying , " Yeah , can you send me some of your carbon ?
so with this in mind , I want to leave you with four simple solutions .
we need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests .
( laughter ) It 's all I got . ( laughs ) So , in this suburb , the poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community .
this approach is called Integrated Water Management , or holistic or closed @-@ loop .
each one of us is pooping and peeing something that could fertilize half or maybe all of our food , depending on our diet .
imagine how much energy we could save .
and get this : if we change our approach to sanitation , we can start to slow down climate change .
remember that carbon in the poop ?
their wash water , their shower water , is going underground to a series of mulch basins , and then watering that orchard downhill .
when they went to get this permitted , it wasn 't allowed in Oregon .
that was Recode 's -- my organization 's -- first code @-@ change campaign .
well , their wash water is getting reused to flush toilets , cool mechanical systems , water the landscape .
this was the first permit of its kind in Oregon .
( laughter ) " Let 's do it . "
we now have sources of power like the sun that don 't vary with our earthly dramas .
we encourage our best and brightest to work on this issue -- better solar panels , better batteries , everything .
so let 's talk about where our drinking water is coming from , where our poo and pee are actually going .
if you don 't know , find out .
it includes a lot of different behaviors , from mocking or belittling someone to teasing people in ways that sting to telling offensive jokes to texting in meetings .
take texting while someone 's speaking to you .
what put him there was work @-@ related stress .
and what we found is that those that experience incivility do actually function much worse .
look at you ! how do you expect to hold a job in the real world ? "
but we were very sneaky .
well , that patient died .
sooner or later , though , most uncivil people sabotage their success .
civility lifts people .
in doing this , it will save lives .
in an uncertain global environment , commodity prices have fallen .
I never knew that the Brexit could happen and that it could be one of the things that would cause global uncertainty such as we have .
so now we 've got this situation , and I think it 's time to take stock and to say what were the things that the African countries did right ?
the other thing was that conflicts decreased .
we didn 't create jobs for our youth .
youth unemployment on the continent is about 15 percent , and underemployment is a serious problem .
and I think we will need to get a handle on it , particularly how we educate girls .
we also need to be wary of new conflicts , new types of conflicts , such as we have with Boko Haram in my country , Nigeria , and with Al @-@ Shabaab in Kenya .
but that 's had consequences .
now , I 'd spent from age 26 to 52 being a boutique hotel entrepreneur , and so I guess I 'd learned a few things along the way and accumulated some hospitality knowledge .
there have been a number of European studies that have shown that age @-@ diverse teams are more effective and successful .
and it doesn 't mean we are perfect , and it doesn 't mean we don 't have contradictions .
it shaped the narrative , the narrative of a small country with big ideas , and it was very empowering to grow up with that narrative .
remember , this is the country where electricity comes from water in our rivers , heat from volcanoes , wind turbines , solar panels , biowaste .
that 's what they tell you .
no , we made a very brave choice , and that choice made the whole difference .
we don 't want cities that are built for cars .
it craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues , especially in developing countries .
how do we get people to own this ?
these people disagree on almost everything except on renewable energy and clean transportation and clean air .
growth has actually declined for the last 50 years .
in the world of scale customization , consumer proximity is the new norm .
I 'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine : a paradigm of care for this population , grounded in what they value .
we live in the United States , it has the greatest health care system on the planet .
" OK , we 'll bring the care to you . "
not because they couldn 't .
" Richard , what is it that you hold sacred ? "
( laughter ) " Alright !
we have the honor and pleasure of Jonathan and his father joining us here today .
living based on our values , what we find sacred and how we want to write the chapters of our lives , whether it 's the last or the last five .
thank you very much .
in July of 1911 , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old Yale graduate and professor set out from his rainforest camp with his team .
it has amazing Moche pottery of human figures .
as a respected Peruvian archaeologist and former vice @-@ minister , Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate and share the data with archaeologists so they can explore these sites on the ground .
these women were unbelievably inspiring , and what 's great is that SPI will help us transform communities near some of the sites that you help to discover .
I don 't give a damn about the revolution .
the problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box , and there is collateral damage .
today I 'd like to talk about how I was able to feel so comfortable and how I overcame my fear .
I carefully balanced my way upward , shifting my weight back and forth between the small smears .
I was surrounded by people talking on cell phones and having picnics .
I was disappointed in my performance , because I knew that I had gotten away with something .
I actually took the next year or so off from free soloing , because I knew that I shouldn 't make a habit of relying on luck .
I needed everything to feel automatic .
climbing with a rope is a largely physical effort .
this is what I mean by a poor handhold : an edge smaller than the width of a pencil but facing downward that I had to press up into with my thumb .
what if I was wasting my time and I would never feel comfortable in such an exposed position ?
thank you .
but when I saw them playing soccer -- that was amazing .
they had a dirt field , rusty goalposts and broken nets .
that night when I went to sleep , I began to dream about the next day 's game , imagining what could happen , how we would play .
he joked that since he doesn 't have legs , some days he tries to walk on his hands .
he 's illiterate , and he communicates with voice messages .
but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab .
( laughter ) Luckily , three decades ago , humans started to invent tools that can find any specific line of genetic information .
and the same is true for personal DNA technology today .
( laughter ) But we 've definitely reached a point in history where every one of you could actually get hands @-@ on with DNA in your kitchen .
how many of you here made it through anatomy ?
anatomy was caught in a struggle between science , art and culture that lasted for over 500 years .
his serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor .
when you were a child , did you ever wish that your toys could come to life ?
London @-@ based SHOK @-@ 1 paints giant X @-@ rays of pop culture icons .
street artists believe that art belongs to the public .
and I could have gone to Twitter with the hashtag , as many people did , # WheresNatasha .
and yet , this began for me months of pain and depression and anger and confusion and silence .
it would criminalize revenge porn .
they exclude billions of people from the global economy , for example , people who don 't have enough money to have a bank account .
one of them is that you can build smart contracts .
thank you .
they have no semantic meaning .
they were unexpected pleasures .
when you think about it , using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done .
if you can do that , it 'll help other people see you that way , too .
I 'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now , but shoes are fabulous in general .
and they 're pretty neutral as far as giving compliments goes .
and some of these solutions are inspired by concrete 's natural self @-@ healing mechanism .
what I dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them , namely that we 're all screwed because the problems are unsolvable and our governments are useless .
see , Indonesia 's religious parties , like similar parties elsewhere , had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption .
now , of our three stories , this one probably surprised me the most , since as you all know , the country is still struggling with so many problems .
as I mentioned earlier , Indonesia 's democrats were clever enough to steal many of the Islamists ' best campaign promises for themselves .
so what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability , and it 's not circumstances .
imagine just two robo @-@ ants crawling toward each other .
to see that this works , imagine an ant anywhere else in the habitat .
there 's no way that could go wrong !
RW : well , I 'm a little nearsighted , but yeah .
RW : once I thought I saw Bigfoot but it was just a German shepherd .
RW : an epic win ?
( laughter ) " A new store is opening , but there is no celebration planned . "
( laughter ) " I 'm sorry you 're disappointed . "
( laughter ) I said , " Not to worry .
through inspired local leadership , they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening .
say , home @-@ building .
it makes them realize that if you got 20 percent wrong on something , it doesn 't mean that you have a C branded in your DNA somehow .
students see an explanation at their own time and pace ?
one , the students can actually master the concepts , but they 're also building their growth mindset , they 're building grit , perseverance , they 're taking agency over their learning .
I think that vote is occurring right now .
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions , using fungi , and these solutions are based on mycelium .
most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms .
I 'm going to show you six , if I can , solutions for helping to save the world .
these are a species that we need to join with .
so my dad grew up answering the door for debt collectors and pretending his parents weren 't home .
that 's right -- we 've spent decades trying to fit women into a work world built for company men .
but they were told that success meant leaving the village behind and pursuing that iconic symbol of the American Dream , the white picket fence .
that means the brain has been stretched to 50 percent of its original length , the tissue in that particular area .
now , what 's there at the bottom of this fissure ?
this stuntman does not have a helmet .
similarly , it 's not going to tell you is this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not ?
so I hope to come back in a few years with the final story , but for now I will tell you , please don 't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion .
thank you .
but the data says something different .
we don 't have backup ; we don 't have all the natural gas .
and while nuclear kind of edges out coal , the thing is , people don 't really fear coal in the same way they fear nuclear , which really operates on our unconscious .
and the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel , there 's always going to be some fuel left over .
so these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they 've never met and may never meet .
in a 2011 report from the Institute for Women 's Policy Research , the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent .
so you don 't have to make signs for all of your employees to wear around the office .
when I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy in 2010 , my goal was simple : open a school to close a prison .
and if they 're not learning , where would they end up ?
he wasn 't even registered .
one of them was a poem written by nine students in an ESL class , all of them Hispanic migrant workers from nearby Hartville , Ohio .
I can stand up and do something . "
when politics becomes just a presidential election , we yell and we scream at our screens , and then we collapse , exhausted .
voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had .
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined , and can be reimagined .
but I turned to my aunt when I got that letter and said , " You know , I think this just means that for the first time in my life , being poor has paid really well . "
this trauma , this chaos in the home , is our culture 's very worst gift to our children , and it 's a gift that keeps on giving .
things turned up for me .
well , one thing that happened is that my grandparents , the same grandparents of setting someone on fire fame , they really shaped up by the time I came around .
but she was also this incredibly perceptive woman , despite not even having a middle school education .
it can 't be traced to any one moment .
and when they 're transmitted through the water , unlike the first two modes of transmission , these pathogens don 't rely on a healthy host for transmission .
and the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it 's so harmful .
but there 's another really interesting aspect of this , and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence , evolution of harmfulness , then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance .
if you 've got a harmful organism , a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic , a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics .
but that 's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness .
but as I said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire , and I 've been able to watch who 's naturally drawn to whom .
but technology is producing one modern trend that I find particularly important .
today 's singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed .
but one of the questions was , " Would you re @-@ marry the person you 're currently married to ? "
in fact , the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology .
we are right now in a marriage revolution .
I 'm not a Pollyanna ; there 's a great deal to cry about .
thank you .
( applause ) Kelly Stoetzel : thank you so much for that , Helen .
( applause ) So Esther , when you were watching Helen 's talk , was there any part of it that resonated with you through the lens of your own work that you 'd like to comment on ?
so we 've created what I call this thing of " stable ambiguity . "
and then comes ghosting .
( laughter ) Yeah ?
and that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times and changing beliefs .
and in terms of the paradox of choice , there 's no question about it that this is a pickle .
finally , we don 't stand on a peak of intelligence , or anywhere near it , likely .
we would feel a little more urgency than we do .
another reason we 're told not to worry is that these machines can 't help but share our values because they will be literally extensions of ourselves .
I think we need something like a Manhattan Project on the topic of artificial intelligence .
now would be a good time to make sure it 's a god we can live with .
going blind cast them into focus .
well , that 's what I thought .
it was difficult and exhausting to see .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
I knew it .
what kind of specific challenges do you have , and how do you overcome them ?
last I heard , there are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English .
in his way , he speaks English as well .
suddenly these characters that you 've fallen in love with become husks of themselves , they 're shadows of themselves .
other than that you had books that didn 't work , that 's just the way it was .
I highly recommend the lesser known Glossika as well .
I take some " Dilbert " in various languages every single morning ; it can increase your skills .
thank you very much .
I was born in India , the world 's largest democracy , and when I was four , my family moved to Belize , the world 's smallest democracy perhaps .
five months after that election , the newly elected mayor appointed me the first Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs for this newly established office .
and most of us , when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods feel curiosity , if not concern .
we have fought to be here .
it 's our country , too .
it was April , last year .
we live in an incredibly interconnected world with the proliferation of social media , which is of course a fantastic resource for igniting social change .
and just like we got back on our tubes , we can 't let our platforms for interconnectivity and community be the places that we settle for defeat .
it was calling them out on the effect they had caused .
everywhere , " People wish to be settled , " Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us , " but only insofar as we are unsettled is there any hope for us . "
but at some point , knowledge gives out .
" when are we ever going to get world peace ? "
we 're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer .
so this is a PET / CT scan , and what you 'll see in this PET / CT scan is the CT scan will show you where the bones are , and the PET scan will show you where tumors are .
that 's because the bladder is the thing that 's clearing the sugar away from our body .
so as miraculous as this might seem , unfortunately , well , it 's not that great .
so I 'm going to show you an example now .
and so this tumor is now growing in this mouse 's brain , and then we 've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient , and take out piece by piece out of the tumor .
and I think where medical imaging is heading to is the ability to look into the human body and actually see each and every one of these cells separately .
but at least I am hopeful that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques in the way that is not blind .
if I owned the Internet , Napster , Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website .
( laughter ) Heck , if I ran the Web , you could email dead people .
now follow me , OK ?
but Tod couldn 't come and the project is sort of somewhere , I 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought , or not .
well , a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff .
( laughter ) And juggling -- the balls cross and all that .
I have no idea how computer @-@ oriented or three @-@ dimensionally @-@ oriented you are , but let 's try something .
enough of a clue ? so , you get the pattern , right ? OK .
white .
( music ) ( Applause ) Talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run " S @-@ Curve music ? "
I make large @-@ scale figurative paintings , which means I paint people like this .
she died on October 26 , 2012 .
I thought , I 'll try that , going outside .
I started to be as curious as I was when I was a student .
these are important and they can be energizing to leaders , but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization .
well , early days , Microsoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture -- clear evidence of Microsoft putting people first .
but doing so does not have to be exhausting .
and this blew our minds .
this isn 't the present .
this doesn 't represent how we think today .
but at night I would hear him shouting obscenities from his room down the hall .
I wouldn 't have a name for my grandfather 's condition until I was in my 20s .
wow . that 's a lot of you .
to put that in context , that 's more passengers than the Eurostar or JetBlue airlines carry .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) I 'll do it with you .
trust became institutional and commission @-@ based .
so that could be a property title .
so as we began to build these types of systems , we began to test them on ourselves in our research group .
what that means is , we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data .
but somewhere along the line I 'd learned about nuclear weapons , and I 'd gotten really concerned with the ethics of science .
we have no such anchors and benchmarks for decisions in messy human affairs .
it 's just that the algorithm wasn 't showing it to me .
it was a great player .
I began to dare to face the truth , to think , to face the hard questions .
I got in touch with my soul .
when we ignore the realities , we discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection .
and we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives .
thank you .
three years down the line , we simply must admit we 're seeing limited action to really , really address this as an inclusive , collective , universal package .
nobody has ever tried to really analytically combine the Sustainable Development Goals with planetary boundaries .
now , how do we do this ?
there was a day , about 10 years ago , when I asked a friend to hold a baby dinosaur robot upside down .
it was this toy called a Pleo that I had ordered , and I was really excited about it because I 've always loved robots .
and this one has really cool technical features .
( laughter ) And we can design robots specifically to evoke this response , using eyes and faces or movements that people automatically , subconsciously associate with states of mind .
when we behave violently towards robots , specifically robots that are designed to mimic life , is that a healthy outlet for violent behavior or is that training our cruelty muscles ?
and so they wondered if there was anything I could do .
as long as these predator @-@ free circumstances last , the birds thrive , but they are vulnerable to changes in their environment .
for instance , human settlers bring dogs , cats , and stowaway rodents to islands .
so the striatum detects emotional and sensory motor conditions and it knows to trigger whatever behavior you have done most often in the past under those same conditions .
so I was really excited when my mice developed this compulsive behavior , where they were rubbing their faces and they couldn 't seem to stop , even when they were wounding themselves .
there are naturally occurring opioids in your brain that are deeply linked to social processes .
social media doesn 't so much encourage us to share , as it does to compare .
so that 's not quite right either , because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use , which was the word " muraqib " which means " a controller . "
" yes , we understand the definition .
others project an energy that they can hardly contain , like New York or Hong Kong .
so , what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us ?
no , they 're shared .
what if in this train you didn 't have to stop ?
in this train , wagons can detach dynamically while you 're moving and become express , driverless buses that move on a secondary road network .
they 're trying to learn traffic rules , which is relatively simple , and coping with human unpredictability , which is more challenging .
so instead of rigid traffic rules , flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic and constantly self @-@ improving algorithms .
( laughter ) And after 10 years of this , my wife said , " You 've got to do this thing you 've been talking about , and build the vending machine . "
but the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows .
basically , what happens is that we put this out in a field or someplace where there 's lots of crows .
well , it depends how it 's used in each film .
Acousmatic sounds -- well , the term " acousmatic " comes from Pythagoras in ancient Greece , who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years , not revealing himself to his disciples .
so thanks for listening .
I was determined not to be excluded from the performance , so I turned to my mother and loud enough for everyone to hear said , " Mom , I don 't need a tutu .
far from it .
and these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our body @-@ shaming culture .
people were skeptical .
it 's a civil rights problem .
I mean one of the boys has a bottle of liquor in his hand , he 's 14 years old and it 's a school day .
four in the morning on a school day , we 'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van , and the bottles would break .
how about this ?
" Hey , I 'm here for you whenever you 're ready . "
he told us his story .
we refined his story to go from being the story of a victim to being the story of a survivor that has overcome adversity .
we placed high value on it .
wealth was never the primary ambition in our house .
all of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wreck that I was saved from through a bus ride .
and then I want to talk about what we think right here in the United States and in New York .
so what happens going forward ?
look , there are three reasons why the Middle East has had stability such as it is . right ?
no , the Kurds will do better , and Iraq , Israel , Iran over time .
OK , how about this guy ?
let 's turn to Europe .
you see Brexit and you see the concerns of populism across all of the European states .
but the periphery , countries like Greece and Turkey and others , will not look that good at all .
those countries can fall off the map .
well , I want our organizations to remain human .
you might not always realize it , but when you cut the unnecessary , you cut everything .
the risk to be ugly .
they put them on boards , moved them all into one room , which they called " the ugly room . "
but we 've all been ugly once .
it 's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens .
and I can actually recommend this book , it 's a very nice book .
it has to be like this . this is a beautiful pattern .
OK , so why am I doing all this ?
this is a square pyramid .
I 'm telling one story in different ways .
( applause ) Pat Mitchell : I 'm not letting you go yet .
you made a reference to it earlier . I 'd love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill .
and then what you may not know because our American media did not report it , the Icelandic women walked out again on Monday . right ?
he asks me to come over and comb his hair in preparation for his wedding photo shoot .
he cups my face and says , " Suzanne , I am who I am because of you .
as she was moving in , he told Yusor and her mom that he didn 't like the way they looked .
I look around expectantly .
she looks down and realizes what she said was wrong , and in front of the entire team , she apologizes and says , " I should know better . I 'm Mexican @-@ American .
I receive this kind of treatment all the time . "
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
( laughter ) And what 's more interesting are people 's comments .
and having a low floor also means that we 're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project .
but things have changed .
why is that ?
it 's just that the probability of encountering them compared to combat is astronomically lower .
and when I spoke with him a year after treatment had finished , he told me , " Doc , this is the first time in 43 years that I haven 't had nightmares . "
JH : that 's right .
but I think this is the thing , especially in Europe and for us , too , we need to be looking at .
we 're really , really good at justifying ourselves .
economists have been exploring people 's behavior for hundreds of years : how we make decisions , how we act individually and in groups , how we exchange value .
we had some informal constraints in place , but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions .
it would rule out the rival theories , but not rule out yours .
indeed , Thomas Edison famously said , " I have not failed , I have found 10,000 ways that won 't work . "
read and listen to people you flagrantly disagree with .
as Aristotle said , " The mark of an educated man is the ability to entertain a thought without necessarily accepting it . "
some banks suffered from groupthink , where staff were too afraid to challenge management 's lending decisions , contributing to the financial crisis .
but the simplest thing CANNOT be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already . "
but what they 're also telling me is that they have fears .
if you look at these crises , you realize that they 're urgent and they need to be addressed now .
it 's a tragedy .
every seven minutes , an adolescent boy or girl somewhere in the world is killed by an act of violence .
and sadly , they 're right , too .
six hundred and fifty million .
and maybe you 've never faced violence , or prejudice , or discrimination .
young people themselves have named it .
so with Gen @-@ U , they 're going to be in the driver 's seat , steering us all along the way .
but these are a chance to see their own livelihoods .
it doesn 't matter what you once were ; you can 't do it anymore .
patients can live for decades with the physical function of someone with congestive heart failure .
in the 1950s , a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater studied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria .
in the US , we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient , 250 dollars per MS patient and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient .
so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms .
and recently , we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress , until we discovered that H. pylori was the culprit .
and slowly I added five percent here , five percent there , until eventually , on a good day , I was able to leave my home .
I still don 't know if I will ever be able to run again , or walk at any distance , or do any of those kinetic things that I now only get to do in my dreams .
I think things like , " Oh ! I know -- I must clean the floor .
( laughter ) So then I had my new idea : why not engage people like me in sport ?
and anyway , I already had a go at changing the world .
here is a picture of me aged four .
by the time they were born , I was already hosting my own shows and working in the public eye .
I don 't think secrets are a good thing .
everybody warned me that I would never work again , but I decided it was absolutely worth the risk .
and in 2014 , on the day that the law was changed , I married my wife , who I love very much , indeed .
the hall seats two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half thousand people .
until you realize that 17 are run by men called " John . "
nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men .
nevertheless , there are still many , many women who , from early November until the end of the year , by comparison to their male colleagues , are effectively working for free .
but -- ( Applause ) But 2016 ! the first !
television 's been around for 80 years !
the representation of women in positions of power is shockingly low .
( laughter ) Here 's quick history sidebar for you : no woman ever burnt her bra in the ' 60s .
people wrote and said , " Please , can I help ?
first thing : we want to be the only political party in the world whose main aim was to no longer need to exist .
we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning .
it felt to me like injustice squared .
then hear this , please .
between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision , you have two versions of how to improve our eating .
this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself .
similarly , let 's look at a granola bar .
and I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life .
but , no , even if we were all steroid @-@ filled football players , the answer is no .
and we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths , but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space did share one remarkable fate .
he was excited , and he was inclined to accept the offer .
or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal .
now , the first thing we need to know is : what is my range ?
when I feel powerful , I feel confident , not fearful ; I expand my own range .
and I 'm going to give you a set of tools today .
and perspective @-@ taking is really simple : it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person .
that 's the perspective @-@ taking E because it looks like an E from someone else 's vantage point .
they said , " My eyes lit up .
both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears .
my dad was a psychologist like me , but his real love and his real passion was cinema , like my brother .
so when a scene calls for it , be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker .
so this is the iron hand that belonged to one of the German counts .
and four of the smartest people that I 've ever met -- Ed Boyden , Hugh Herr , Joe Jacobson , Bob Lander -- are working on a Center for Extreme Bionics .
and the interesting thing of what you 're seeing here is these prosthetics now get integrated into the bone .
and at that point , somebody might actually want to have a prosthetic voluntarily .
but you 're talking about really radical redesigns , and one of the interesting things that 's happened in the last decade is we 've discovered a whole lot of planets out there .
all bacteria , all plants , all animals , all humans , all cows , everything else .
but why is that so interesting ?
do you feel anything for this person ? "
we thought this was emotion and we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart . Nope .
second option : the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse .
the new mouse remembers what it 's afraid of , remembers how to navigate the maze , and if that is true , then you can transplant memory and consciousness .
( laughter ) This is taken from six billion miles away , and that 's Earth .
thank you very much .
and it 's easy for us not to be empathetic with those people who seem so distanced from us .
the unfortunate thing is that now , as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield , the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear .
it can run on natural gas as a result of the inventions of fracking and shale gas , which we have here .
but the impact of all that wealth allowed people to get massively better nutrition .
it allowed water pipes to be placed .
and that 's going to happen unless they have a better alternative .
it had to be first of all viable , meaning that technically , they could implement it in their country , and that it would be accepted by the people in the country .
if you look at the Chindia test , we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test .
that 's what the EIA forecast tells us .
to give them a better choice , it 's going to have to meet the Chindia test .
if you look at all the alternatives that are out there , there are really two that come near to meeting it .
outdated regulations and yesterday 's mindsets .
we have not used our latest scientific thinking on radiological health to think how we communicate with the public and govern the testing of new nuclear reactors .
right now , we 're basically waiting for a miracle .
what we need is a choice .
if they can 't make it safe , if they can 't make it cheap , it should not be deployed .
we love to engage on the issues of the day .
we love it .
who is on it ?
they 're activist investors : Carl Icahn , Dan Loeb , Paul Singer , Barry Rosenstein .
that bear is not passing through !
that bear made a detour for you .
( laughter ) Activists like money .
some activists also like Doritos , but they definitely want money .
long , drawn @-@ out lawsuits , public smear campaigns -- there is no need for that .
but I must say , there 's a small handful of activists , very small , that go to great lengths to be constructive and collaborative .
and overall , we have to give credit where credit is due .
as a group , they have managed to catalyze large @-@ scale change in large corporations , and that 's no small feat .
it 's good business .
Adidas teamed up with an organization called Parley for the Oceans .
parley goes out and collects plastic waste from the ocean .
like , in an Uber Pool .
( laughter ) " Hey , I noticed you looking at my feet . "
I 'm making PowerPoint slides , I 'm not looking -- " " No , it 's fine .
I get why you 'd be looking .
the plastic on my shoe must be bothering you .
doing my part . I got eco @-@ shoes . I got eco @-@ shoes .
" Hey , pass me your cell phone . I 'll give you a discount code .
let me give you a discount code . "
we 've all been -- Folks , I have jumped out of moving Uber Pools .
but we 've got to forgive the hipsters , we need to love the hipsters .
we need hipsters , and we need companies like Adidas , and what we need most is for investors to convince other companies to behave like Adidas .
and herein lies the challenge .
conscious investors care about ESG issues .
and they talk a lot about engaging management on ESG issues .
Argentina owed Paul 600 million dollars and would not pay .
you can 't take money from an OG and not pay it back .
then you have Barry Rosenstein .
( laughter ) He wanted to make some money .
now , the CEO of Whole Foods , John Mackey , and the board did not want to sell themselves to Amazon , because that would be the prime example of selling out .
but in the end , they caved .
vanguard and BlackRock -- together , they manage trillions .
today , when a company underperforms financially , who is on the hook ?
so use your voice and trust that it matters .
doesn 't mean that people who are in between don 't experience racism , but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum , the better off you are .
and so my journey as a trans person is about reimagining masculinity .
in the summer of 2001 , we connected with Cathy Woolard , who was soon elected city council president .
and we built a citywide vision around this idea : the Atlanta BeltLine , a 22 @-@ mile loop of transit and trails and transformation .
I was doing two and three meetings a week for two and a half years , and so was Cathy and her staff and a handful of volunteers .
and we got all the highways and strip malls and cul @-@ de @-@ sacs we wanted .
the Federal Highway Administration , for example , didn 't exist before there were highways .
we 're taking places like this and transforming them into this .
good for us !
if we care , we have to stand up and speak out .
this is hard , and it won 't happen on its own .
we can 't call it a success without them .
these places aren 't inevitable .
she and her baby were presumed dead .
now , in her 41 years on TV , perhaps Erica 's most famous scene is her alone in the woods suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear .
he maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt and it still wasn 't enough .
so every two weeks for two years on payday he stood in front of his employees and he asked them to sacrifice their salaries , and it worked .
so sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time .
and she said , " Why don 't we just stand here and compliment each other ?
and then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ...
and I felt I was stuck ; I was stagnant .
who doesn 't know that ?
it 's called rejectiontherapy.com.
( laughter ) I said , " You know what ? I 'm going to do this .
he looked like a security guard .
he was a chubby , loveable guy , and he even asked me , " Why ? "
and she was so happy to see me .
( laughter ) It was really boring .
and then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...
they let their own reaction after rejection define themselves .
what if all satellites , regardless of what country they were built in , had to be standardized in some way for recycling , servicing or active deorbiting ?
there are some encouraging signs .
so maybe you get into things like high @-@ powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers , as crazy as those sound in the short term .
but also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth , and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact .
and what I 'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points .
I 'm going to make it right now in case I forget .
I have a characterization .
this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water .
and as I will point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea .
running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes .
but the only logical [ explanation ] was that there were hot springs .
we 're making huge discoveries of large commercial @-@ grade ore along this mountain range , but it was dwarfed by what we discovered .
we 've been discovering these along ancient trade routes , where they 're not supposed to be .
this shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ .
more recently , into the Black Sea , where we 're exploring .
all their organics are perfectly preserved . we begin to excavate them .
so , we 're going to run it like an emergency hospital .
a discovery is made , that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later .
she 's talking to the pilot . she 's 5,000 miles away , but she 's assumed command .
watching exploration live from thousands of miles away , and it 's just dawning on her what she 's seeing .
everyone in this room is a former baby -- ( Laughter ) with a distinctive birthright .
two : when things get difficult or painful , try to stay open .
two years ago , my younger sister came out of remission from a rare blood cancer , and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant .
to woo my skeptical sister , I turned to my parents ' holy text : the New Yorker Magazine .
and that illustrates my research approach .
one couple explained their insemination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet inseminate cows .
it was about how special and how deeply loved their child was .
it 's what they do at that age .
let me explain what I mean like this .
of course there is a bright spot to this story .
so my friend Melissa and I sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues .
they were cynics and seekers , atheists and rabbis .
psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what 's broken in our world , the less likely we are to do anything .
because we know that social change only happens -- ( Applause ) when we are awake enough to see that the house is on fire .
the fourth and final is interconnectedness .
now , very importantly , all the new thinking that outliers and exceptions lead us to in medicine does not only apply to the outliers and exceptions .
we learned about it when doctors Li and Fraumeni were looking at families , and they realized that these families had way too many sarcomas .
you 're not talking about moons floating around some planet Jupiter .
silence can also be rather uncomfortable .
what are the unknowns ?
she came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes .
he said , " I got it all and you 're good to go . "
I said , " Why , you know the right thing to do as well as I do .
what will they tell you ?
we already have AI , and often it works in the background , in the back offices of hospitals , where it 's used to diagnose X @-@ rays better than a human doctor .
it 's in legal offices , where it 's used to go through legal evidence better than a human paralawyer .
it 's used to fly the plane that you came here with .
but it 's more than that .
that 's artificial smartness .
so let me talk about those three different aspects .
we tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension , that it 's kind of like a note that gets louder and louder .
and this single IQ intelligence is getting greater and greater .
so your calculator is smarter than you are in arithmetic already ; your GPS is smarter than you are in spatial navigation ; Google , Bing , are smarter than you are in long @-@ term memory .
( laughter ) Just driving , OK ?
and we actually might even come to advertise these as " consciousness @-@ free . "
we 're going to populate the space of all the different possible types , or species , of thinking .
we may need a two @-@ step program , which is to invent new kinds of thinking that we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems , say , like dark energy or quantum gravity .
it 's like a new commodity ; it 's a new utility .
and by the way -- right now , this minute , you can log on to Google and you can purchase AI for six cents , 100 hits .
science is inherently inefficient .
innovation by definition is inefficient , because you make prototypes , because you try stuff that fails , that doesn 't work .
so , the future : where does that take us ?
if you 've ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a hugely damaging , frightening , sopping mess .
winds up taking seven hours of her week .
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement , she found seven hours .
and rather than say , " I don 't have time to do x , y or z , " she 'd say , " I don 't do x , y or z because it 's not a priority . "
if you think about it , that 's really more accurate language .
( laughter ) Bit of a wretched genre of literature , really , going on about how amazing everyone in the household is , or even more scintillating , how busy everyone in the household is .
first , you can read some other family histories , get a sense for the style .
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others .
twenty @-@ four times seven is 168 hours .
and some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred creative genius .
another medical report describes them as being " inappropriately happy . "
they were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug that they actually just listed it as a side effect , an adverse side effect .
and mental set is another thing . right ?
but it does make you wonder what else we 've missed .
and in science , we try and remove our bias , right , by running double @-@ blinded experiments or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be .
and then we ran it again in a PTSD model , and we ran it again in a physiological model , where all we did was give stress hormones .
and in depression and PTSD -- here we have your stress exposure -- we only have palliative care .
antidepressants only suppress symptoms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the length of your own life .
we tried Prozac as well , and that had no effect .
if we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first , it 'd be pretty easy for us to develop it , but as is , we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere .
in one case , one of the bombs , which fell out of an Air Force plane , didn 't detonate because the nuclear core was stored somewhere else on the plane .
it would take a renaissance of sorts , the kinds of innovation that , for better or worse , underpinned both the Manhattan Project , which gave rise to nuclear weapons , and the Megatons to Megawatts program .
now , 2045 happens to be the 100th anniversary of the birth of nuclear weapons in the New Mexico desert .
but it 's also an important date for another reason .
have inspired a generation of innovators .
now , every day , I get to meet people who are real pioneers in the field of nuclear threats .
surely , a century of economic development and the development of military strategy will have given us better ways to manage global conflict .
so now , as I 've been telling you this imagined 2030 story , I have a feeling that I may have put some of you into this sci @-@ fi frame of reference . right ?
I 'm a stem cell and genetics researcher and I can see this new CRISPR technology and its potential impact .
and we may find ourselves in that reality , and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today .
and I think some people are going to run with this technology and try to make designer babies .
now , before I go on , some of you may hold up your hands and say , " Stop , Paul , wait a minute .
it 's really that simple .
I also think it 's not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification .
the engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors than they got back .
Adam said , " You don 't have to be Mother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver .
that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other .
the other combination we forget about is the deadly one -- the agreeable taker , also known as the faker .
now , an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up .
sometimes you might put a Band @-@ Aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain .
in 2014 when he came , Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries .
my colleagues and I held our breath and bit our fingernails , and then finally we saw the first proton collisions at this highest energy ever .
what if the stuff that 's bothered me since I was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime ?
I don 't have the answers , and I 'm still searching for them .
which would not be the end of physics , but a novel beginning .
Assembly lines were engineered to replace inconsistent human handiwork with machine perfection .
we no longer dig ditches by hand , pound tools out of wrought iron or do bookkeeping using actual books .
but those tellers were doing somewhat different work .
( laughter ) Here 's the broader point .
the same principle applies if we 're building a building , if we 're diagnosing and caring for a patient , or if we are teaching a class to a roomful of high schoolers .
does that mean there 's nothing to worry about ?
Norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility .
the challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs , and many citizens CANNOT qualify for the good jobs that are being created .
but it is feasible .
right ? is this time different ?
I don 't have the guts to take that bet against human ingenuity .
the atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that 's seen here from the International Space Station , a photograph that some astronauts took .
and it 's such an amazing phenomenon that the fact that it 's disappearing should frighten you , at least a little bit .
so atmospheric escape is not specific to planet Earth .
it 's part of what it means to be a planet , if you ask me , because planets , not just here on Earth but throughout the universe , can undergo atmospheric escape .
and because there 's all this lightweight gas that 's ready to escape , and all this heating from the star , you have completely catastrophic rates of atmospheric escape .
how can we speak up in a society that too often discredits or diminishes our experiences ?
assume that you 're going to forget .
assume you have to write it down .
you don 't have to talk to a person , there 's no fear of judgment , and you can do it whenever and wherever you need .
we refuse to even acknowledge that women who have sex with women or women who don 't want children even exist .
Cheryl responded , " Well , first , I don 't know what quinoa is . "
( laughter ) " But I do know that it 's a Monday , and that in my school , at High School in the Community , I always cook pasta . "
Cheryl talked about how , by the time Monday came , her kids ' hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn 't even begin to think about learning .
food was the only thing on their mind .
well , because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school .
those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland .
and then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller .
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
these are the dispensers . there 's this friendly shape .
but what if he worked in the opposite direction ?
and we just don 't have the tools that are small enough to work with them .
we don 't have any disease @-@ fighting nanobots , there 's no elevators to space , and the thing that I 'm most interested in , no new types of computing .
now that last one , that 's a really important one .
and this pace exists because of our ability to pack more and more devices onto a computer chip .
it 's exponential .
when Fredo betrays his brother Michael , we all know what needs to be done .
we just said , " What 's the Fredo in our problem ? "
you can go to the beach , you 'll find these simple organisms that use proteins -- basically molecules -- to template what is essentially sand , just plucking it from the sea and building these extraordinary architectures with extreme diversity .
they 're out there forever , and anyone anywhere can pick them up and use them , and help to deliver on the promise of nanotechnology .
" got me looking , got me looking so crazy in love -- " ( Laughter ) from the great philosopher , Beyonc√© Knowles .
I had no guidebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
( laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love .
and love involves both joy and pain .
I understand that 16th @-@ century Verona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Juliet 's suffering made sense to me .
I can 't spend the rest of my life being scared and hiding and that I 'm actually going to have to do something .
she tried to do everything right .
she married some guy that her parents chose for her , even though he beat and raped her constantly .
the same men , or similar men , to the ones that have hounded me for most of my life .
in fact , I found something , to my horror , that I recognized .
can you understand why they 're so angry and alienated when you put your honor before their happiness ?
how can we support them in redirecting their pain into something more constructive ?
but this is not a self @-@ aggrandizing enterprise , because in this type of discovery research , if you don 't feel like a complete idiot most of the time , you 're just not sciencing hard enough .
we Homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry .
we , like all other species on this planet , are inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet .
well , I first learned to program back in 1966 , when I was 15 -- just a couple months after this photo was taken .
it had to be something the computer knew what to put in .
pretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values you 'd never remember on the screen where things were .
then when you pointed to a cell , the computer could put the row and column in as a name .
Bob worked in the attic of the apartment he rented in Arlington , Massachusetts .
print wasn 't working yet , so I had to copy everything down .
and so they make him say sorry .
" if you can 't handle the Internet , fuck off , whore . "
I was married to a Scot for 14 years , so I said , " Cunt means many different things in different countries -- ( Laughter ) but I 'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick . "
( laughter ) ( Applause ) And I did that alone , and I published it alone , because my chief advisor said , " Please don 't , the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you . "
and I want to say a word about revenge porn .
kids , schools , caregivers , parents : it 's essential .
shall we talk about our friends in tech ?
so apparently , I 've got a pretty bold voice .
I would like for you to reflect it back to me .
it doesn 't so much have a flavor , but it does give your body a really subtle kind of boost of energy .
( in a lowered voice ) It has another quite surprising quality .
the images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs .
here they peddle their attack software and share information on new attack techniques .
what are they going to do -- sue you if you violate them ?
organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack to themselves .
why ?
about a year ago , my colleagues and I had a radical idea .
so you probably have the sense , as most people do , that polarization is getting worse in our country , that the divide between the left and the right is as bad as it 's been in really any of our lifetimes .
and what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards , we found that liberals , it didn 't matter what essay they read .
empathy and respect .
so , I had this wishbone , and I thought , it 's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long .
so I 've invented it in concrete , because it doesn 't really matter .
it 's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes , but it was so important to the concept , we got it done .
you can sit by the fireplace and share stories .
the result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony .
the balconies are misregistered .
but is it rebuilding trust ?
but now , they even have basketballs inside the station that kids can borrow .
they self @-@ governed their behavior , and they won the contract over some very powerful companies .
do you think those days are over ?
so I think there is a maturity that is starting to set , especially in that Silicon Valley area , where people are beginning to say , " We have a role . "
and that 's the key word .
and unless we play into that power table , I think we 'll end up in a bad place .
so , let me thank you for the opportunity to talk about the biggest international story of your professional lifetime , which is also the most important international challenge the world will face for as far as the eye can see .
never before have so many people risen so far so fast , on so many different dimensions .
now , I know his name is a mouthful , and some people have trouble pronouncing it .
he wrote the first @-@ ever history book .
and I can even pronounce his name : Thucydides . "
" Thucydides 's Trap " is a term I coined several years ago , to make vivid Thucydides 's insight .
finally , last year , it was finished -- three times over budget .
it 's called the Sanyuan Bridge .
now , for red @-@ blooded Americans -- and especially for red @-@ necked Americans like me ; I 'm from North Carolina -- there 's something wrong with this picture .
so how does this work ?
and just to remind you if you do , this won 't be the first time .
a remarkable group of Americans and Europeans and others , not just from government , but from the world of culture and business , engaged in a collective surge of imagination .
so , a remarkable story .
after World War II , Americans felt exhausted .
they had demobilized 10 million troops , they were focused on an urgent domestic agenda .
now , there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work .
how many of you are augmented cyborgs ?
I 'll give you an example .
what 's exciting is we 're starting to see this technology out in the real world .
well , every time the owner picked up the leash , they went for a walk .
in fact , rather than working from predefined recipes , Watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents .
would you cross this bridge ?
you just sort of knew that bridge was unsafe .
we 're not doing a very good job on our own , we could certainly use all the help we can get .
I think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world as it is about the virtual , intellectual realm .
but I 'm much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together are going to augment each other , and start to inhabit a new space .
( laughter ) So , Bishop 's human partner can tell what to do in plain English and with simple gestures , kind of like talking to a dog , and then Bishop executes on those instructions with perfect precision .
( laughter ) But what if it turns out that Barbie 's actually really lonely ?
what 's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design , make and use .
except a human did design this , but it was a human that was augmented by a generative @-@ design AI , a digital nervous system and robots that can actually fabricate something like this .
I think we 're going to see a world where we 're moving from things that are fabricated to things that are farmed .
where we 're moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown .
you know , I didn 't have access to a sophisticated laboratory .
those emails would begin with something like this : " what 's a Raghead like you doing in our parliament ? "
I just thought that the senders and I had nothing in common .
and at the time , I actually thought that was a pretty clever answer .
it was he who suggested that I should call them up and visit them .
emails that started with words like " terrorist , " " Raghead , " " rat , " " whore . "
and then he said , " I have to ask my wife . "
even our prejudices were alike .
when I was young and I waited for the bus and it stopped 10 meters away from me , I was sure that the driver was a racist .
the people who sent hate mails are workers , husbands , wives , parents like you and me .
but when I asked , " What about you ?
I know what I 'm talking about .
if you want to prevent hate and violence , we have to talk to as many people as possible for as long as possible while being as open as possible .
and finally , remember to finish the conversation in a positive way because you are going to meet again .
we hang out only with people who think like us and talk about the others in a category of disdain .
we unfriend people on Facebook , and when we meet people who are discriminating or dehumanizing people or groups , we don 't insist on speaking with them to challenge their opinions .
I thought if I was going to ask Greg to spend the rest of this life with me , then I should ask him in front of two people who had pledged to be together for eternity .
they are powerful reminders that our common humanity has not changed .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Archaeologists are the cultural memory preservers and the spokespeople for the billions of people and the thousands of cultures that came before us .
we 're back at the site just south of Cairo .
this rectilinear form is an ancient tomb that is previously unknown and unexcavated , and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years .
when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they 're finding , I believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find .
who blows up a temple ?
we know that ISIL is profiting from the looting of sites , but we don 't know the scale .
this means that any object purchased on the market today from the Middle East could potentially be funding terrorism .
we looked at open @-@ source data and mapped the entirety of looting across Egypt from 2002 to 2013 .
and putting that data together -- you can see the looting pits marked here .
of course I agreed , but I didn 't think we 'd find anything .
we started finding engraved inscriptions .
you can see it written out here , in hieroglyphs .
this is Omer Farrouk , my brother .
do you see a tomb ? do you see a pyramid ?
do you see any potential site damage or site looting ?
a hundred years ago , archaeology was for the rich .
it might be you .
and the greatest story ever told is the story of our shared human journey .
if you look at the etymology of the word statistics , it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in .
and there are many reasons for this .
so in this case , it 's how well do you know 64 million people ?
if we reframe the questions and say , how well do you know your local area , would your answers be any more accurate ?
so I devised a quiz : how well do you know your area ?
it 's a simple Web app .
and I was very conscious in designing this .
I wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people , not just the 49 percent who can get the numbers .
so here 's the quiz .
( laughter ) Actually , in Exeter , it 's incredibly young , and I had underestimated the impact of the university in this area .
we 've had online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years .
so in some senses , this was all a little bit old and not necessarily new .
was more than I could have hoped for .
( laughter ) This URL contains the words " statistics , " " gov " and " UK , " which are three of people 's least favorite words in a URL .
I never expected to be described by my own government in these terms : " lurking , " " nefarious , " " terrorist . "
I know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated I was because of my race -- and yes , I don 't think I would 've been detained if I were white .
and he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond , and when they came , the man was unconscious .
so I would come in and take the test and I fell asleep in each one .
and between companies like SpaceX and NASA and all of the international space agencies of the world , we hope to do that in the next few decades .
I have wanted to work at JPL on these missions since I was 14 years old and I am privileged to be a part of it .
rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four @-@ year @-@ olds , barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers .
I come from a family of civil rights advocates , and I had spent my career until that point working with low @-@ income children and families .
it wasn 't until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong .
we wouldn 't be designing better cities for children .
after all , shouldn 't we include end users in the design process ?
adult planners marveled at the students ' ideas as they shared a park constructed out of a jelly bracelet .
and then , public art constructed from animal @-@ shaped plastic beads .
and separated biking and walking paths , so speeding bikers won 't hit young people as they stroll by the creek .
literally .
our adolescents wanted thrill @-@ seeking opportunities .
they want nature right in their backyards , not four blocks away .
in addition to trees and plants , kids almost always include animals in their designs .
so if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaper food venues , we meet the needs of many other populations , too .
that isn 't to say that I didn 't have my doubts along the way .
but most importantly , the blame transferred from Thordis to me .
I feel that way . I try my best .
then we concentrate on what we have already mastered and we try to minimize mistakes .
it very much does .
I mean that every minute of every day , many students in elementary schools through colleges feel that if they make a mistake , others will think less of them .
finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
we 're going to do some open @-@ heart surgery . I was the only Brit , on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons , cardiac nurse , intensive care nurse .
open @-@ heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble .
you look at your X @-@ rays on a screen and you do stuff with them , you email them . but we were still using X @-@ rays , but we didn 't even have a viewing box !
for the past three years , I 've been developing technologies that could ultimately aid clinicians with rapid , early @-@ stage cancer diagnostics .
the idea here is that the separation process for screening could be as simple as processing a sample of urine , blood or saliva , which is a near @-@ term possibility within the next few years .
thirteen innocent people were killed , leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma .
what kind of a mother were you ? "
this is where I 'm going to tell you what I tell every audience I meet , which is to remind you about induced demand .
and here , you know , this street : yes , it will drain within a minute of the hundred @-@ year storm , but this poor woman has to mount the curb every day .
is it one to one ? three to one ?
and then , finally , the interesting walk : signs of humanity .
it was always the people screaming and running that really got me the most , especially those terrified @-@ looking children .
they were five and six then , at an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions , and expected real , convincing answers .
the question I had was , could parent training programs be useful for families while they were still in war zones or refugee camps ?
she listened carefully and patiently , and then to my joy she said , " If that 's what you want to do , and it means so much to you , then let 's do it .
they were making attempts at seeking support from NGO workers , from refugee camp teachers , professional medics , other parents .
but sadly , these attempts are almost always useless .
but my favorite has got to be , " Thank you for not forgetting about us and our children . "
Halul is the pet 's name for the Arabic female name , Hala , and is only really used to refer to really young girls .
when they reached the refugee camp and she knew they were finally in some kind of safety , she completely withdrew to acting like her old childhood self .
[ it 's a penis ] ( Laughter ) I have been studying sexting since the media attention to it began in 2008 .
people are into all sorts of things that you may not be into , like blue cheese or cilantro .
what I do think is a serious problem is when people share private images of others without their permission .
the key is consent .
in 1908 , Ford introduced the Model T car .
in the 1950s , seat belts .
and we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas .
and in a lot of states , you 're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim .
everything digital is not just automatically public .
that doesn 't make any sense .
all of your financial information is held in digital databases , but your credit card company can 't just post your purchase history online .
Jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated , but instead of being compassionate , her classmates harassed her .
Jennifer started missing school and her grades dropped .
ultimately , Jennifer decided to end her own life .
people are still saying all the time to victims of privacy violations , " What were you thinking ?
if we think more about consent , we can see that victims of privacy violations deserve our compassion , not criminalization , shaming , harassment or punishment .
so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of blaming them , let 's do this instead : let 's shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let 's respond with compassion .
I 'm sweating .
there 's a growing body of research examining the relationship between chronic stress and illness .
now , let 's imagine for a moment that I was pregnant .
but it turns out that the kind of stress we experience and whether we 're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough to keep our bodies working properly depends a lot on who we are .
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams , the person who pioneered the tools that have proven these linkages , says that the more marginalized groups in our society experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health .
in certain parts of the country , particularly the Deep South , the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in Sub @-@ Saharan African .
even nationally , black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women .
it 's what researchers call " the immigrant paradox , " and it further illustrates that there 's something in the US environment that is making us sick .
but here 's the thing : this problem , that racism is making people of color , but especially black women and babies , sick , is vast .
I could spend all of my time with you talking about it , but I won 't , because I want to make sure to tell you about one solution .
both are young , African @-@ American and moms themselves .
their approach is casual and friendly .
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis are actually the center of her care model , and that her role as a provider is just to support their work .
lastly , when you finally are called back to see the provider , you 've already taken your own weight in the waiting room , and done your own pee test in the bathroom .
this is a big departure from the traditional medical model , because it places responsibility and information back in the woman 's hands .
and that support provides a crucial buffer to the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day .
well , The JJ Way has almost entirely eliminated those problems , starting with what Jennie calls " skinny babies . "
a similar demographic of women in Jennie 's area who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did were three times more likely to give birth to a baby below a healthy weight .
the beauty of Jennie 's model is that she actually believes it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting .
they involve elaborate physiological mechanisms meant to protect us , that , when overstimulated , actually make us sick .
thank you .
but there was a crack in the wall , a problem with our industry , that I felt we needed to fix .
Afghanistan had already fallen off the agenda .
there were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008 that went to the war in Afghanistan .
" if I need medications , where will I find them ?
in fact , the Afghan Ministry of Health does things that I wish we would do in America .
we want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions is an integral part of their mission .
" Hmm , it 's probably not good . " that 's what I 'd tell you .
her work on human rights really serves as the foundation for all of our international human rights organizations .
they talked about building institutions to protect human security , for their generation and also for ours .
( laughter ) And you , sir , who laughed the loudest , you probably still are .
Hal was also a flawed character , for in the end he chose to value the mission over human life .
now , HAL was a fictional character , but nonetheless he speaks to our fears , our fears of being subjugated by some unfeeling , artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity .
actually , it is .
so let 's accept for a moment that it 's possible to build such an artificial intelligence for this kind of mission and others .
do I fear that such an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity ?
the humans we are today are not the humans we will be then .
the principle is you just need those three things -- variation , selection and heredity .
it doesn 't care about the consequences because it can 't , because it 's just information being copied .
if you copied it from someone else , it 's a meme .
why ? because the temes are selfish replicators and they don 't care about us , or our planet , or anything else .
I have no idea .
now , if you put all of these chemicals , these nitrates , into those kinds of environments , there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that -- algae , for example .
I 'll put this down , and I 'll lift up the fuel cell .
here we 've got a couple of videos , the first thing you 'll see -- hopefully you can see here is the mouth open .
but we can 't force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second .
how can we cope with that ?
it looks like the kind of thing we do .
current Row @-@ bots contain things like toxic batteries .
well , yes , we have shown that you can do this .
what 's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these biodegradable robots .
you throw them out there , and they degrade to nothing .
so , why not make something like this ?
so this changes the way , again , in which we think about robots .
how will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race ?
since 2012 , conservative state legislatures across the US have ramped up attempts to roll back African @-@ American voting rights by passing restrictive voter ID laws and curtailing early voting opportunities .
those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world @-@ makers who own and master time .
Africans were space @-@ takers .
do black people have a future ?
but we can 't get there on colored people 's time or white time or your time or even my time .
they don 't have to worry about maintaining the physical servers .
why would anyone spend thousands of hours on something anyone can freely copy , rename , or even sell ?
I fear that the future of our internet is out of our control .
now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger , but she 's not alone .
what if I told you that our definition of " good person " is so narrow , it 's scientifically impossible to meet ?
and what if I told you the path to being better people just begins with letting go of being a good person ?
you 'll have to use a laser @-@ cutting tool to cut up the square ; every other means available to you isn 't precise enough .
you secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky .
for now , on social networks , we see chaotic , individual usages .
( laughter ) let 's see what kids could hear Cayla say in the safety of their room .
my team and I decided to investigate this .
and to make matters worse , when we read the terms and conditions , we discovered the following , and I 'm going to need to take out my reading glasses for this one .
Governments must create a safer internet by ensuring enforcement and up @-@ to @-@ date rules .
so I had to do something .
this was not an appeal for the scripts that would be the next great blockbuster , not an appeal for the scripts that will win the Academy Award , they didn 't need to be scripts that their bosses loved or that their studio wanted to make .
and then two dozen other people actually emailed to participate to this anonymous email address , but I confirmed that they did in fact have the jobs they claimed to have .
the Black List .
everyone was sharing this list of scripts that everyone had said that they loved , reading them and then loving them themselves .
now , that 's not the interesting part .
because this agent then told me , and I quote , " Don 't tell anybody , but I have it on really good authority this is going to be the number one script on next year 's Black List . "
and so I did it again the next year -- and the " LA Times " had outed me as the person who had created it -- and the year after that , and the year after that -- I 've done it every year since 2005 .
about 325 have been produced .
what does it mean for how we see ourselves and how we see the world and for how the world sees us ?
public officials ignored it .
think about that .
more underrepresented characters in terms of race and ethnicity , and most importantly , more women working behind the camera in key production roles .
our own economic analyses show that gender of the lead character doesn 't play a role in economic success in the United States .
production costs alone or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country .
why ? because it makes sure that there 's women on set .
if we want to see more films by , for and about women , we have to support them .
and everyone else is somewhere in between .
and we find that Germany and Japan will get there or thereabouts .
what on Earth is happening ?
ca : so some , I guess many liberals out there view Trump and his government as kind of irredeemably bad , just awful in every way .
YNH : yes , very much so .
ca : and those elites might not even be human elites .
so no wonder more and more authority is shifting from us to the algorithms .
and that should not be impossible , because people can have several layers of loyalty .
one of the things I know as a historian is that you should never underestimate human stupidity .
now , how to get there and what would it look like , I don 't know .
ca : that 's your answer , Kat . ( laughter ) YNH : and I don 't think that they know either .
we look at these other groups which have formed which go outside of national bounds but still represent significant authorities .
and I think , again , history shows that you shouldn 't necessarily think in such exclusive terms .
and that that 's actually sparked a lot of the anger .
I kind of found myself hoping that , reading your book .
people often confuse intelligence and consciousness , especially in places like Silicon Valley , which is understandable , because in humans , they go together .
YNH : I try not to .
if it can 't suffer , it 's not real .
a nation CANNOT suffer .
my basic reaction as a historian is : if this is the era of post @-@ truth , when the hell was the era of truth ?
it was incorporated into the charter of those organizations that the truth mattered .
there is nothing that -- I don 't know -- Joseph Goebbels , didn 't know about all this idea of fake news and post @-@ truth .
ca : well , depending on how things go , we may all be back in the forest soon .
YNH : I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair , and that we should realize that .
if we don 't have a global governance , and if we suffer from climate change , from technological disruptions , the worst suffering will not be in the US .
you 're pretty worried about it .
you can use the same technology to create very different kinds of societies .
the trains did not tell you what to do with them .
similarly , now , artificial intelligence and bioengineering and all of that -- they don 't predetermine a single outcome .
and many countries basically took out war from their political toolkit .
my two kids go to school right in that bullseye .
and then they got sued by big tobacco , who claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards is neither precise nor provable .
( laughter ) Professor Keller was curious about many things : why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle .
they helped .
John is an out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ box thinker , which explains why the two of us have been such good friends all of our lives .
she was one of the first children to come for care after we opened our doors .
here you see the machining , the milling of a block of acrylic .
it 's an icon of water itself , and it elevates people 's perception of contemporary design .
if you pour water on that , it dissolves .
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop .
I was going to break into a dance then .
I 'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture .
Gernot Oberfell , working at three o 'clock in the morning -- and I don 't pay overtime .
it 's true . it 's true .
the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s .
before the war , your security policy had been isolationist .
partly , they 're pumping money in because commodity prices are high , but it 's not just that . there 's also a range of new discoveries .
so I thought , well , maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion .
at that stage I just wanted to abandon the research , but -- ( Laughter ) -- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , " Why not try an auction ? it 'll reveal the value . "
I grew up in a culture of self @-@ effacement .
what kind of world would that be ?
so currently in my lab , I 'm researching questions like , what makes a human smell like a human ?
and it turns out it 's fairly complicated .
can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music ?
you can grab the ring , you can ring that bell , when the ride is over -- over , over , you can never , ever tell .
they said , " OK , you know what ?
and that guy got to make the very difficult decision , but really the life @-@ changing decision about whether to go get help .
sounds a little sketchy to me , but I 'm listening , " you at least know you 're being engaged and respected .
we can resist .
I thought about it a lot over the past few years and I found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible .
each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up .
the last lap took almost 30 .
most of what they said to her when she was outside began with , " Be careful , " " Watch out , " or " No . "
I 'm just pro @-@ bravery .
so notice next time you say , " Watch out , you 're going to get hurt , " or , " Don 't do that , it 's dangerous . "
so practice .
because this is not about the steep hill in front of her .
it couldn 't detect my face .
this is a face . this is a face . this is not a face .
but don 't worry -- there 's some good news .
so there 's an opportunity to create full @-@ spectrum training sets that reflect a richer portrait of humanity .
law enforcement is also starting to use machine learning for predictive policing .
so what can we do about it ?
well , we can start thinking about how we create more inclusive code and employ inclusive coding practices .
so who codes matters .
on the technical side , how we code matters .
who codes matters , how we code matters and why we code matters .
my mother left school when she was 15 .
( applause ) So I started a festival called WOW , Women of the World , seven years ago , and it 's now in 20 countries across five continents .
so I traveled there last year , and part of the joy I had in going there was going to these caves .
the Laas Geel caves .
these paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old .
that 's what art is for .
and I thought , well , who painted this joyful , youthful figure ?
( laughter ) And he said , " Women don 't do these things .
men made these marks . women don 't . "
and I turn to Caroline , and she 's crying her eyes out .
men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication , but of course , how could they be ?
the rising pubic hair removal reminded me of the 1920s , when women first started regularly shaving their armpits and their legs .
the most sought @-@ after look , incidentally , in which the outer labia appear fused like a clam shell , is called ...
young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own orgasm .
now I know that 's not enough .
but for all that , it has a lot of holes .
and then I met Yoyo , who is the native Rapa Nui @-@ an guide , and if you look at Yoyo 's face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
another thing I do is I invent stuff .
while I was at Microsoft , I took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in France .
I 've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue .
it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way .
and that means what we see on the screen is in reality extremely tiny .
now , just five years ago , I really had no clue about phages .
after all , albeit invisible , you had something that reliably was killing bacteria .
and that 's what 's happening around the globe .
more than 10 biotech companies , including our own company , are developing human @-@ phage applications to treat bacterial infections .
but unfortunately in some children , there 's a blockage of this flow pattern , much like a traffic jam .
I could not understand what just happened .
and so I 'm here to debunk a myth .
so living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together and have a totally different perspective , just like the couple of people I mentioned earlier in my stories .
but we can do something better than that .
my first mall job that I had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called Herman 's World of Sports .
let me show you .
( laughter ) I always think in my head , if I owned a dead mall -- why don 't they embrace their vintage look ?
Donald J. Trump , the Republic candidate , was hot on her heels with 14 percent , and the remainder of the vote were shared between abstainers and Gary Johnson , the Libertarian candidate .
there is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs .
140 million Americans voted for the next president of the United States , and yet , as all of us knows , in a few weeks time , somebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes to Donald J. Trump .
in fact , I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates .
I send them the same two questions every single time .
some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine .
but I think it may also be a sign that the domestic electorate is still thinking very nationally .
we 've got the ex @-@ prime minister of New Zealand , who would be a wonderful member of the team .
it has some background .
it 's part of a project which I launched back in 2014 , which I call the Good Country .
since the US election and since Brexit it 's become more and more obvious to me that those old distinctions of left wing and right wing no longer make sense .
it 's one the Obama administration even called " the cornerstone to modernizing America 's electrical grid . "
and we have a simple checklist for this .
when the volunteer stood in front of just one door , people would avoid giving by going out the other door .
in the case of the Salvation Army , eliminating excuses just means standing in front of both doors , and sure enough , when they did this , donations rose .
people need to take their medication so that they 're cured , and so that they don 't get other people sick .
we 're talking about taking a really strong antibiotic every single day for six months or more .
it will make your pee turn funny colors .
the company OPower sends people in their electricity bill a small insert that compares their energy consumption with that of people with similarly sized homes .
I 'd say back to him , " No , it 's not . "
ca : and so take that a bit further , and maybe expand a bit more on your insights into Steve Bannon 's worldview .
it seemed to be a move to a more moderate position , on the face of it .
so I believe he was listening to her before that speech .
was it here or here or here ?
it 's nostalgic ; it 's for the past .
so I don 't know if that 's the right way to fight .
and there are two phrases you 've heard over and over again , wherever you go in the country .
and I teach at Yale .
but is there any path whereby we can start to get some kind of consensus , to believe the same things ?
GC : see , I understand how that happened .
that 's another groundswell kind of emotion that was going on in the middle of America and not being heard , in thinking that the mainstream media was biased .
ca : do you think enough of his supporters have a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ...
( laughter ) No , I reject the category .
and so there has been a genuine narrowing of what is permissible to say .
GC : I would just start by saying that I really think any change and coming together starts from the top , just like any other organization .
according to a lot of research , one of the best weapons is gratitude .
so knowing this , I started a new tradition in our house a couple of years ago .
then one day , my 10 @-@ year @-@ old son said , " You know , Dad , those people aren 't in our apartment .
I decided to call my project " Thanks a Thousand . "
and while she 's saying this , I 'm realizing I 've done that .
it reminded me that what I take for granted is not available to millions of people around the world .
being aware of the thousands of people involved in every little thing we do .
I 'm not talking about claims like , " 9 out of 10 women recommend this anti @-@ aging cream . "
what makes this claim different is it doesn 't come from a private company , it comes from the government .
among supporters of President Trump it 's even higher ; it 's about 7 out of 10 .
on the one hand , there are those who say these statistics are crucial , that we need them to make sense of society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes and measure progress in an [ objective ] way .
this is a total disaster .
if we don 't have this data , how can we observe discrimination , let alone fix it ?
facts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells that are smaller than the size of an average parking space .
that doesn 't mean every single swimming pool in the country contains exactly 6.23 turds .
one poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support jihad , which is obviously pretty scary , and it was reported everywhere in 2015 .
a poll might speak to a couple hundred people , maybe a thousand , or if you 're L 'Oreal , trying to sell skin care products in 2005 , then you spoke to 48 women to claim that they work .
( laughter ) Private companies don 't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right , they just need the right numbers .
they 're civil servants .
my mom was freaking out , my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a Snapchat video .
( laughter ) This was just the beginning of my team 's science project .
so the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier , a couple of my teammates took a trip to Central America and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam , or expanded polystyrene foam .
and when they came back and told us about it , we really started thinking about the ways in which we see Styrofoam every day .
well , simply put , recycled polystyrene is too expensive and potentially contaminated , so there is very little market demand for Styrofoam that has to be recycled .
and now France has become the first country to completely ban all plastic utensils , cups and plates .
so we started out by doing a variety of heating tests , and unfortunately , we had many failures .
so we kept trying and failing and trying and failing .
and we were also honored with the Scientific American Innovator Award from Google Science Fair .
philosophers , dramatists , theologians have grappled with this question for centuries : what makes people go wrong ?
and I had friends who were really good kids , who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson .
good people could be seduced across that line , and under good and some rare circumstances , bad kids could recover with help , with reform , with rehabilitation .
if you look at it and focus on the white , what you see is a world full of angels .
and apparently , he disobeyed God , and that 's the ultimate disobedience to authority .
paradoxically , it was God who created hell as a place to store evil .
he didn 't do a good job of keeping it there though .
evil is the exercise of power .
it 's the few bad apples , the few rogue soldiers . "
maybe it was the barrel that was bad .
and it all happened in a single place , Tier 1 @-@ A , on the night shift .
( typewriting ) [ Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008 Military Police Guards ' Photos ] [ The following images include nudity and graphic depictions of violence ] ( Camera shutter sounds ) ( thuds ) ( Camera shutter ) ( Camera shutter ) ( Breathing ) ( Bells ) ( Bells end ) So , pretty horrific .
that 's one of the visual illustrations of evil .
this is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
and so we 're interested in what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel ?
and secondly , we know there 's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners .
here are the prisoners , who are going to be dehumanized , they 'll become numbers .
your personality and morality are disengaged .
so another report , an investigative report by General Fay , says the system is guilty .
heroism as the antidote to evil , by promoting the heroic imagination , especially in our kids , in our educational system .
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .
( laughter ) Milk is why mammals suck .
at Arizona State University , in the Comparative Lactation Lab , I decode mothers ' milk composition to understand its complexity and how it influences infant development .
we abandoned the milk of human kindness and turned our priorities elsewhere .
that means that nearly 130 million babies are born each year .
recent research has shown that milk doesn 't just grow the body , it fuels behavior and shapes neurodevelopment .
( laughter ) Sex .
and he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups after they were born .
some mothers do a lot of that , some mothers do very little , and most are in between .
but what 's interesting about it is when he follows these pups when they become adults -- like , years in human life , long after their mother died .
so how can this work ?
it evolved during evolution .
is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light ?
Epigeneticists will tell you poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment that creates that phenotype , that property .
so we moved to look into our cousins , the monkeys .
then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time by cue , the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine .
you 're , like , watching a movie of your life , with the DNA , with your remote control .
but that 's just the electrons in your body pushing back against the electrons in the seat , opposing the force of gravity .
and at that point , we were no longer just exploring inside the atom .
nowadays , there are about 35,000 accelerators in the world , not including televisions .
our once country , all north and south and east and west , so restless the Nile couldn 't hold us together , and you ask me to summarize .
fact : my grandfather didn 't want to leave home , so he died in a war zone .
it feels too harsh for a bundle of wires and an audience to swallow .
in other words , as the disco ball spins , those mirrors change locations and we get to observe different parts of the image .
( laughter ) Different types of images have very distinct features .
I know what I 'm doing . I 'm confident . ' " being properly valued is so important .
it 's part of the case file .
" Rochi de River , " was her name .
knowing how to do something is one thing , knowing how to take care of yourself is another .
how do we teach our kids to be safe online when we don 't have either ?
today , I use it .
the key was to overcome the initial shock and do something new .
what kind of information do you share ?
those kids need to know what the risks of being online are , how to take care of themselves , but also that , fundamentally , as with almost everything else , kids can learn this from any adult .
online safety needs to be a conversation topic in every house and every classroom in the country .
and this number is growing .
grooming shows us this in the most painful way : by involving our kids .
after Yale and a law degree from Columbia , Clyde spent the next 30 years as one of America 's top civil rights lawyers .
it 's stunning .
all of these researchers were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting blacks , but they provided no evidence .
this scale captures ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not value is chipped away on a daily basis .
for example , there 's discrimination in medical care .
this was true for all kinds of medical treatment , from the most simple to the most technologically sophisticated .
it is a subtle process , but it 's normal and it occurs even among the most well @-@ intentioned individuals .
there is institutional discrimination , which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions .
one of America 's best @-@ kept secrets is how residential segregation is the secret source that creates racial inequality in the United States .
in America , where you live determines your access to opportunities in education , in employment , in housing and even in access to medical care .
but it took more for me to be successful .
this work will not always be easy , but former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall has told us , " We must dissent .
we must dissent because America can do better , because America has no choice but to do better . "
this is what my last week looked like .
what I did , who I was with , the main sensations I had for every waking hour ...
and I remember that no one thought that Berlusconi could get elected -- that was totally not an option .
we had all of the hard data we could think of -- just like the pundits before the election -- but what is the point of all these numbers ?
short @-@ termism , for many reasons , has pervaded every nook and cranny of our reality .
but they all did one thing that didn 't actually seem like a big deal until I really started kind of looking into this .
( laughter ) So before you hit that button , make sure you are clear and everyone else is clear .
( laughter ) We can also get arcing if we have an extremely wet chest .
I 'll leave you with one point .
remember , if you do find yourself dealing with a Wookiee , do not shave the entire Wookiee .
but what do I mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence ?
now , I do not blame the Hallowiches for accepting a take @-@ it @-@ or @-@ leave @-@ it settlement and starting their lives elsewhere .
we do a great disservice to boys on how we raise them ; we stifle the humanity of boys .
I know young women who are under so much pressure from family , from friends , even from work to get married , and they 're pushed to make terrible choices .
both men and women in Nigeria will say -- this is an expression I 'm very amused by -- " I did it for peace in my marriage . "
they grow up to be women who silence themselves .
but I sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations .
gender and class are different forms of oppression .
but also , culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people .
he 's also a kind , good @-@ looking , lovely man , and he 's very masculine .
two months ago , my kids and I huddled around a cell phone watching the live stream of the Game Awards , one of the video game industry 's biggest nights .
when we thought that Joel could live , I left the game designing to my husband .
I have to think in a totally new way to do it , but I love it .
our video game was our attempt to share that world with people who hadn 't experienced it before , because we never could imagine that world until it became ours .
and I drew this sketch , something with two layers , translucent with structure in between capturing light .
you all know this crazy search , letting the process take you , and you live for the surprises .
and it had this quality that we loved , this idea of the embodied light , but on the inside , we wanted something with a soft light , like the inner lining of a jacket .
but it was the third surprise that was most ...
it let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them .
to show you what I mean , let me tell you about another patient .
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her .
we 'll see our function decline , some of us will see our cognition decline , we 'll be no longer able to care for ourselves , to do the things that we want to do .
and how do they do it in a way that mainstream medical hospitals and clinics , at least for Robin , weren 't able to ?
and what I experienced -- what they experience every day , hundreds of thousands of people like Robin -- was really amazing .
those waiting rooms really are a hive of interaction , advice and support .
these are often small , mom @-@ and @-@ pop operations run by people with no medical training .
that should be baked into the way that healthcare is delivered .
you can see there 's a sort of strange dark dust across it .
now , that is local dust that 's obscuring the light of the stars .
there is a technique .
radio waves have a wavelength that 's long , and that makes their resolution poorer .
and I 'm very excited .
it 's alight with synchrotron radiation , and thousands of dots are in the sky .
it 's been a long @-@ standing mystery to astronomers where all the supernova remnants are .
it makes it easier to engage with what that person has to say .
and then , of course , they are discussed , picked over , refined , finalized .
it has precedent .
faced with enormous stress , I suffered an anxiety attack .
I have a loving , supportive family and incredibly loyal friends , yet I could not entertain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain .
the first time I heard " mental health , " I was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from Ghana , at the Peddie School in New Jersey .
according to the World Health Organization , mental health is about being able to cope with the normal stressors of life ; to work productively and fruitfully ; and to be able to make a contribution to your community .
mental health includes our emotional , psychological and social well @-@ being .
globally , 75 percent of all mental illness cases can be found in low @-@ income countries .
I heard the whispers .
do so with the confidence that you are not alone .
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .
it can be for profit or not profit . it can be large or small .
I 'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples , but always pointing to the broader themes .
right ? how do you capture that ?
and you can see why , from Ballmer 's point of view , that 's a bad idea , right ?
we were on the highway , and I took the wrong exit .
I mean , how was I supposed to do that ? I couldn 't read , write or spell .
she still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that .
so I never cared about my community .
so I got mine by any means necessary .
he gave me this brief description of what stocks were , but it was just a glimpse .
so at 20 years old , I did the hardest thing I 'd ever done in my life .
but little did I know I was receiving the greatest gifts I had ever dreamed of : self @-@ worth , knowledge , discipline .
as I furthered my career in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest , I soon learned that I had to take responsibility for my own actions .
true , I grew up in a very complex environment , but I chose to commit crimes , and I had to own up to that .
( laughter ) I needed a better plan .
it 's an epidemic and a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue .
Bridget was born in Cameroon , the oldest of four children .
you 've already given enough , brother . "
Brian is both a nurse and a soldier who 's seen combat .
so that puts him in a unique position to be able to relate to and help heal the veterans in his care .
and in the springtime , those animals have babies .
how in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters ?
we 're going to need all the help we can get .
so I live in fear of unintended consequences .
and so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended .
are you Red ? get Red .
I 'd say , " Here 's your logo . put it on the door . "

that 's how stage fright works .
how do we fight it ?
John Lennon played live thousands of times .
this makes your hypothalamus trigger a relaxation response .
you didn 't overcome stage fright , you adapted to it .

why ?
that 's your reward system saying , " Mmm , yes ! "
that 's because when it comes to food , the brain evolved to pay special attention to new or different tastes .
in other words , eating lots of sugar will continue to feel rewarding .
so , think back to all those different kinds of sugar .
the surprising answer is : none of the above !
but what is it about making music that sets the brain alight ?
or could it be that people who go into music were already smarter to begin with ?
I really believe he will have an answer for the first . "
but power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics .
money creates the ability to buy results and to buy almost any other kind of power .
so if you aren 't taking action , you 're being acted upon .
politics is the work of harnessing that flow in a direction you prefer .
law number three : power compounds .
your challenge is to learn how to read power and write power .
read so you may write .
do you want power to benefit everyone or only you ?
elephants know every member in their herd , able to recognize as many as 30 companions by sight or smell .
this is a great help when migrating or encountering other potentially hostile elephants .
unfortunately , it 's also what makes elephants one of the few non @-@ human animals to suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder .
they also tackle problems cooperatively , sometimes even outwitting the researchers and manipulating their partners .
on the other hand , elephant attacks on human villages have usually occurred right after massive poachings or cullings , suggesting deliberate revenge .
it 's 4 a.m. , and the big test is in eight hours , followed by a piano recital .
passed over even for a lab assistant position , he had to settle for a job at the Swiss patent office , obtained with the help of a friend 's father .
it came as a major surprise when in March 1905 he submitted a paper with a shocking hypothesis .
the discrepancy , and his inability to resolve it , left Einstein in what he described as a state of psychic tension .
so , how do these drugs work ?
however , there is ample cause for hope .
for example , it 's eaten by lanternfish , the lanternfish are eaten by squid , the squid are eaten by tuna , and the tuna are eaten by us .
how many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
everyone could complain about the Quakers for refusing to doff and don their hats or their " uncouth " practice of shaking hands .
without it , humans experience serious fatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition known as rickets .
in one telling , Narcissus was a handsome guy wandering the world in search of someone to love .
what makes these trait a true personality disorder is that they take over people 's lives and cause significant problems .
you actually do the work , right ?
light , bright , and cheerful .
not only is there musical thunder and lightning , there are also more birds , wet , frightened , and unhappy .
that 's why a chorus of sounds fills the ocean .
units , like moans , cries , and chirps are arranged in phrases .
this hierarchical structure is a kind of grammar .
this is one of the fastest examples of cultural transmission , where learned behaviors are passed between unrelated individuals of the same species .
this is the trolley problem , a version of an ethical dilemma that philosopher Philippa Foot devised in 1967 .
it 's popular because it forces us to think about how to choose when there are no good choices .
the five lives outweigh one , even if achieving that outcome requires condemning someone to death .
the dilemma in its many variations reveal that what we think is right or wrong depends on factors other than a logical weighing of the pros and cons .
for the many millions experiencing bipolar disorder around the world , life is split between two different realities - elation and depression .
type 1 has extreme highs alongside the lows , while Type 2 involves briefer , less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods of depression .
type 1 's extreme highs are known as manic episodes , and they can make a person range from feeling irritable to invincible .
without treatment , these episodes become more frequent , intense , and take longer to subside .
some bipolar patients reject treatment because they 're afraid it will dim their emotions and destroy their creativity .
this violation of the sacred hospitality tradition greatly angered the gods .
but Sisyphus may still have avoided punishment if it hadn 't been for his reckless confidence .
with Thanatos trapped , no one could die , and the world was thrown into chaos .
Sisyphus 's punishment was a straightforward task - rolling a massive boulder up a hill .
ipso facto , I , David Irving , am not a Holocaust denier . "
we didn 't prove what happened .
and finally , here 's the view where we 've overlaid the software and the hardware that 's used by the Bovingdons staff .
but it does give you a clue to the solution - dividing the batteries into smaller subsets narrows down the possible results .
I was like , can I play ?
SW : no , I 've been so fortunate and so I haven 't .
GK : you have a lot of support . you have a lot of love .
on the way over here , somebody was telling me about Ilie Nastase , who said some very unkind , inappropriate , dare I say racial things .
and that really wasn 't the time and the place .
you 've had three life @-@ changing things in a six @-@ month time : pregnant , huge win , fell in love .
but I would never put you with a nerdy geek , and you said , you neither .
look at the shirt .
( laughter ) No , he 's a very nice guy .
GK : was it a wonderful proposal ?
" if you like it then you ought to put a ring on it " ?
I can 't fly to Rome . "
because he wanted to take me to Rome , and I said , " I can 't . I GOTTA win . "
GK : this is a girl that says , " No , I can 't go to Rome . " OK .
SW : I feel like winning for me is superaddictive .
do you feel joy in that ?
in my life , it still and forever is always going to be Venus and Serena .
SW : we were always brought up to be superclose , and we are incredibly close .
I have three other sisters as well , and we were always so close .
GK : so before a big match , the two of you don 't get together and say , look , we 're going to go out there and -- there 's nothing ?
I 'm not going to play Australia in -- Well , who knows , I 've been playing forever , but I don 't think I 'll be playing in 50 years , say ?
GK : I don 't know , Serena . there 's never been anybody like you .
a lot has been made about your body .
so we 're thinking medium size and we 're just thinking -- My personality is a lot of fun . hopefully you can see that today .
GK : do you know if it 's a boy or girl ?
it 's a 50 @-@ 50 chance , but I have a feeling .
( laughter ) Alright , alright .
and maybe you 're thinking , " Well , it won 't be me . "
part of the fear around Alzheimer 's stems from the sense that there 's nothing we can do about it .
here 's a picture of two neurons connecting .
and remember .
and when this happens , it binds to itself , forming sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques .
so what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point ?
a crucial neural transport protein called " tau " becomes hyperphosphorylated and twists itself into something called " tangles , " which choke off the neurons from the inside .
we 're going to have to take this pill before we reach that tipping point , before the cascade is triggered , before we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator .
think of amyloid plaques as a lit match .
at the tipping point , the match sets fire to the forest .
some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it .
a single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta .
what else ?
cardiovascular health .
so a heart @-@ healthy Mediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter the tipping of this scale .
the average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses , which is fantastic ; we 've got a lot to work with .
let 's imagine a simplified example .
ideally , we want these new things to be as rich in meaning as possible , recruiting sight and sound and associations and emotion .
you want to pave new neural roads .
and if , despite all of this , you are someday diagnosed with Alzheimer 's , there are three lessons I 've learned from my grandmother and the dozens of people I 've come to know living with this disease .
you won 't lose your emotional memory .
now , you 'll be familiar of hacking and leaks that happened in 2016 .
the media took the bait .
they were consumed by how much the DNC hated Bernie .
and there was no shortage of evidence .
APT28 loved to prey on the emails and contacts of journalists in Chechnya , the Georgian government , eastern European defense attach√©s -- all targets with an undeniable interest to the Russian government .
before the first iPhone even hit the shelf , the Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and the inter @-@ communication and instant communication it provided us .
this panorama of information that 's so interesting to you gives a state , or anyone for that matter , a perfect back door into your mind .
take this for another example .
and it creates a fissured response and a feckless attitude towards Russia 's land grab in Ukraine .
it 's the ability to think critically : call out falsehood , press for the facts .
Chris Anderson : Elon , hey , welcome back to TED .
I ask myself that frequently .
it takes away so much of your life .
it 's horrible .
it 's particularly horrible in LA .
so a couple of key things that are important in having a 3D tunnel network .
and then the car gets on a skate .
ca : how much ?
but you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels , any number of levels .
well , they 're right .
so yeah , it 's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally .
ca : and how could you achieve that ?
em : actually , if you just do two things , you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement , and I think you can go beyond that .
so if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing , that will give you a factor of two improvement .
em : we want to beat Gary .
you save all that tunneling cost .
em : right . I 'm in favor of flying things .
obviously , I do rockets , so I like things that fly .
is there a tie @-@ in here with Hyperloop ?
so actually , it sort of turns out that automatically , if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table , it is automatically capable of holding vacuum .
em : I think there 's no real length limit .
very nice . very funny .
ca : you 've called it a hobby .
like , it will cost less than a bus ticket .
ca : you started Tesla with the goal of persuading the world that electrification was the future of cars , and a few years ago , people were laughing at you .
em : OK .
( laughter ) I don 't know . I don 't know .
this is just using passive optical , which is essentially what a person uses .
if you don 't solve vision , it 's not solved .
so that 's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision neural net that 's very effective for road conditions .
like , you can probably do it ten times better than humans would , just cameras .
ca : so the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them .
they can 't yet do what that showed .
em : I will show you a teaser shot of the truck .
em : it 's just like , driving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers .
so you have an even color from the ground level .
you can 't tell from street level .
you 're on a body now giving advice to a guy -- EM : who ?
ca : as one does . em : yeah .
Aspirationally , that 's our target .
like , why do you want to live ?
( applause ) CA : people want to position this as an either or , that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to , you know , you pick your issue .
it 's like a branching stream of probabilities , and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing .
it 's tautological .
they forgot how to do it .
that was really fantastic .
they return to school in the fall , and their teachers spend another two months reteaching them old material .
some of you might know his work " The Very Hungry Caterpillar . "
but I am not lazy . ' then the sloth yawned and said , ' That 's just how I am .
we know that our friend James , who comes in after school and is staying at a local shelter , isn 't reading at grade level and has probably never read at grade level .
it starts with ensuring free and equitable access to everything libraries offer them .
business start @-@ ups .
a colleague of mine took a ride in a Lyft in Atlanta last year , and he started chatting with his driver about libraries , as we do .
she said , " It would be like another credit card that I can 't pay . "
when people aren 't afraid of the fines they might accrue , they line up to access what we have to offer .
but like all of our friends at the library , I am busy , I lose track of things , my house is sometimes messy , and I have lost a DVD or two under the sofa .
as Michael might have mentioned , I 've been a librarian for 15 years and my mom hasn 't been in a library in decades , because when she was young , she lost a book .
if we want people to use the library again , we should just get rid of fines altogether .
basically , we fine because we 've always fined .
this film was called , " Le Monde Du Silence , " or , " The Silent World . "
and sound transmits very well underwater , much better than it does in air , so signals can be heard over great distances .
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape .
over the past 30 years , areas of the Arctic have seen decreases in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks to four months .
what do I mean by soundscape ?
those of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living use instruments called hydrophones , which are underwater microphones , and we record ambient noise -- the noise all around us .
I learned that a D√©cima is a type of verse that only exists in Spanish , and that it has 10 lines .
it also has a very concrete date of origin , which is very rare for a style of stanza .
it died out about 200 years ago , and yet in Latin America , from Mexico to Chile , all our countries maintain some form of the D√©cima in our popular traditions .
for those of you with headphones on -- I see that some of you are listening to the translation -- please take them off for a minute .
( Spanish ) A choreography of sound .
I wrote the first one having only recently learned how , and it has some errors in terms of meter , so it 's not presentable in its current state .
I had just returned from doing a concert in Israel , and I was very emotional over a problem that hits really close to home , which is the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict .
and I wanted my song to be very , very Uruguayan , the most Uruguayan type of song there is -- the milonga .
not long ago , we were in Mexico after a concert .
when these amazing musicians finished playing what is for me , something amazing , which is the son jarocho , they finished playing and were ...
in reality , the D√©cima is its origin , but at the same time , just like in the milonga and in the D√©cima , are the roots of many more cultures from all over the place , like he said .
I am dust in your wind and although I bleed through your wound , and every beloved stone has my deepest affection , there is not a stone in the world worth more than a human life .
I don 't know who my God is , nor who my brothers are .
I don 't know who my God is , nor who my brothers are .
we lived with Paul 's illness for 22 months .
he wrote a memoir about facing mortality .
the day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time was the most difficult day of my life .
Paul didn 't want a ventilator and CPR .
and I learned that when we approach it together , we get to decide what success looks like .
either way , we never have those answers .
families can struggle with those conversations , but for us , we also found that information immensely helpful with big decisions .
he said , " wouldn 't it be great if it did ? "
you keep saying things out loud .
but doctors can 't make sure your wishes are respected until they know what they are .
and a gorilla suit never hurts , either .
but there 's some people I would like to see killed , but I 'm against the death penalty .
and there 's another complication , which is , in addition to us being this miserably violent species , we 're also this extraordinarily altruistic , compassionate one .
and it turns out that thing in this person 's hand was a cell phone .
it doesn 't fully mature until you 're around 25 .
but we 've got to push even further back , back millions of years , because if we 're talking about genes , implicitly we 're now talking about the evolution of genes .
for example , ecosystems change .
cultures change .
neurons grow new processes .
what we have here is the opposite of it .
an atom is the smallest unit of any element in the periodic table .
electrons are bound to an atom 's nucleus by electromagnetism .
measurements of weak interactions found that there are different kinds of neutrinos associated with the electron , muon , and tau .
it 's eclectic , I know , from onshore wind turbines to educating girls , from plant @-@ rich diets to rooftop solar technology .
that represents the total equivalent carbon dioxide reduced from the atmosphere when the solution is implemented globally over a 30 @-@ year period .
this fundamentally shifts traditional thinking on climate solutions .
but let 's go to the top of the list , because I think what 's there may also surprise you .
and we need to rethink how we produce our food to make it more regenerative .
moreover , approximately a third of all food produced is not eaten , and wasted food emits an astounding eight percent of global greenhouse gases .
food is not wasted by consumers in low @-@ income countries which struggle to feed their population .
the top solutions would take us far along the pathway , but there 's no such thing as a small solution .
when we implement these solutions , we shift the way we do business from a system that is inherently exploitative and extractive to a new normal that is by nature restorative and regenerative .
and Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine .
and this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern , who wrote the " Theory of Games . "
this includes a large amount of human error .
what 's code , what 's hardware ?
so , he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running , let alone having , you know , software problems .
so , already , they 're complaining about the manuals : " before closing down in disgust ... " " The General Arithmetic : operating Logs . "
" I have now duplicated both results .
he 's still ahead of some of the stuff that 's being done now .
and he published it . it wasn 't locked up and disappeared .
you have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype .
it just was another version of the same thing happening .
yeah , I do that .
( laughter ) Because I truly believe that humanity is a lot like me .
I started to feel that I had arrived , and generally , by the time I was 40 , I was really , really flying .
putting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem .
OK , I have to take steps to prevent that .
I will do anything to defend myself against interference with this objective that I have been given . "
so this single @-@ minded pursuit in a very defensive mode of an objective that is , in fact , not aligned with the true objectives of the human race -- that 's the problem that we face .
I 'm trying to redefine AI to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently pursue objectives .
so what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective ?
I sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge .
in fact , it 'll just help you send your kids to school .
think of a Siri on steroids .
what are you talking about ? "
that one incident would be the end of the domestic robot industry .
people used to think that the oceans were so vast that they wouldn 't be affected by human activities .
so ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain -- and right onto our dinner plates .
you see , I 'm a sleep researcher .
you 're barely passing .
this is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin .
they can 't concentrate , their attention plummets and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic ADHD .
and they 're legitimate concerns , but these are problems we have to work through .
( laughter ) Who am I to contradict my baby girl ?
it may even be better .
together , we co @-@ authored " The Conservative Case For Carbon Dividends . "
the answer is to return all the money raised directly to citizens , in the form of equal monthly dividends .
and this domino effect could start anywhere .
I 'm actually not sure I 've seen a conservative get a standing O at TED before that .
if it stays in Paris , as many are pushing for in the administration , well then that begs a question : what 's the plan ?
our Secretary of State will be asking other countries for NATO contributions , and they 'll be saying , " No , give us our Paris commitment .
and , hopefully , we 've provided one .
look again .
it is one piece of bleached Honduras mahogany .
they believe that it has no practical use beyond its aesthetic value .
their arms are crossed , their legs are crossed , their body language is saying , " What am I going to learn from this lady who talks fast about painting and sculpture ? "
I ask them to look at this work of art , like this portrait by Kumi Yamashita .
in medicine , people are connected as humans before they 're identified as doctor and patient .
and don 't misunderstand me , I 'd eat that doughnut in a minute .
and most importantly , to forge human connections where they may not be apparent , empowering us all to see our work and the world writ large with a new set of eyes .
the poor borrow more , save less , smoke more , exercise less , drink more and eat less healthfully .
well , the standard explanation was once summed up by the British Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher .
now , I 'm sure not many of you would be so blunt .
and others may argue that we should help them to make better decisions .
but the underlying assumption is the same : there 's something wrong with them .
what they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind .
and what that thing is doesn 't much matter -- whether it 's not enough time , money or food .
this narrows your focus to your immediate lack -- to the sandwich you 've got to have now , the meeting that 's starting in five minutes or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow .
so the long @-@ term perspective goes out the window .
but it 's not enough .
we could help the poor with their paperwork or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills .
( applause ) Because , I mean , the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self @-@ appointed experts think they need .
just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers , like George Orwell , are now withering away in scarcity .
but let 's talk about the elephant in the room .
( applause ) The time for small thoughts and little nudges is past .
( laughter ) Now , don 't get me wrong -- I 'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen and the care workers here .
if they stopped working , we 'd be in trouble .
I believe in a future where an existence without poverty is not a privilege but a right we all deserve .
thank you .
this story begins in 1985 , when at age 22 , I became the World Chess Champion after beating Anatoly Karpov .
( laughter ) Machines were weak , and my hair was strong .
and this competitive rhetoric is standard now .
jobs are being killed off .
but even at the incredible speed , 200 million positions per second , Deep Blue 's method provided little of the dreamed @-@ of insight into the mysteries of human intelligence .
I immediately sensed something new , something unsettling .
but you are not going to send your kids to school in a self @-@ driving car with 90 percent accuracy , even with 99 percent .
machines have calculations .
we have purpose .
if we fail , it 's because we grew complacent and limited our ambitions .
our humanity is not defined by any skill , like swinging a hammer or even playing chess .
VG : and in the tradition of our families , the great oral tradition of almost every Black church we know honoring the culture from which we draw so much power , we 're gonna start the way our Mommas and grandmas would want us to start .
it is an opportunity that we don 't take for granted , and so we thought long and hard about how we would use it .
would we talk to the women we hope to inspire , a million in the next year , or would we talk to you ?
but we 're going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary , and because we need you .
her mom walked down the steps of an abandoned school bus where she raised 11 kids as a sharecropper .
I was living the kind of life that , really , any child would dream of .
my school shut down , and when the rebel armies captured the only international airport , people started panicking and fleeing .
and every time business would get bad , he 'd remind me of that mantra : no condition is permanent .
so A.B. took Prince and his mother to the river , got in a canoe and paddled for four hours to get to the hospital .
community members across Liberia learned the symptoms of Ebola , teamed up with nurses and doctors to go door @-@ to @-@ door to find the sick and get them into care .
and I think it 's time for technology to help us train , to help us train people faster and better than ever before .
or when you drink a little too much at a party , just out of anxiety .
and as you get all the way up close , you realize that it 's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups .
and the day after that , another 1,100 Americans died from smoking .
and today , 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking .
and this last US presidential election was the mother of all disruptions .
millions of Americans became activists overnight , pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time .
now , art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly @-@ burly of politics in my daily work at the ACLU , but not anymore .
now , these are big images and big ideas , but I really love the small stuff .
crops and livestock are being brought to market .
in the city , builders raise a tower .
that 's what we do .
and this causes something of a problem , because ...
you think of an idea .
go back to that video that we just showed you .
let 's play with optical illusions .
so I spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this .
it was like my playspace was 400 lines long and 25 columns wide -- which I presume that if anybody is going to understand that , it 's this crowd .
we are OK Go , and this is called " The One Moment . "
and there 's no known cure .
it was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil who first noticed , just a year ago , after a Zika outbreak , that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly .
the first human cases of Zika fever surfaced a few years later in Uganda @-@ Tanzania .
then when they land , the local mosquitoes begin to bite them and spread the fever .
and then , in early 2015 , there was an upsurge of cases of a dengue @-@ like syndrome in the city of Natal in northeastern Brazil .
staying home isn 't a foolproof protection either because we now know that it can be sexually transmitted .
the protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that kill people as well as bugs .
these are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua .
but it looks the same in Miami , Florida .
that 's because insecticides aren 't very effective .
a little British company called Oxitec genetically modified that mosquito so that when it mates with a wild female , its eggs don 't develop to adulthood .
sounds impossible ?
from there it 's pretty simple .
took them another five years going back and forth and back and forth to convince the FDA that this would not harm people , and it would not harm the environment .
so the bottom line is this : biological control of harmful insects can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using insecticides , which are toxic chemicals .
my parents are from Trinidad and Tobago , the southernmost island in the Caribbean .
there ain 't no hammer that 's on this mountain that ring like mine , boy , that ring like mine .

this is a section of wall framing a plaza in the pre @-@ Hispanic city of Mitla , in southern Mexico .
it 's an intricate , communicative language that an epidemic of glass would simply wipe out .
the good news is that architects and developers have begun to rediscover the joys of texture without backing away from modernity .
others invent new products like the molded panels that Sn√∏hetta used to give the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that crinkly , sculptural quality .
but the truth is that these are mostly one @-@ offs , boutique projects , not easily reproduced at a global scale .
and that is the point .
so by analyzing your brain signals , we can track where exactly you are watching or you are paying attention to .
we will be there soon .
so , this happy pic of me was taken in 1999 .
it 's the closest I 've ever come .
that later became " stoicism . "
but for our purposes , chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you CANNOT control , and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former .
she 'd had enough , and she didn 't give me a Dear John letter , but she did give me this , a Dear John plaque .
I had no idea what I was doing . I was working 14 @-@ plus hour days , seven days a week .
I bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers .
that took me to his letters , which took me to the exercise , " premeditatio malorum , " which means the pre @-@ meditation of evils .
so I created a written exercise that I called " fear @-@ setting , " like goal @-@ setting , for myself .
super simple .

humans are very good at considering what might go wrong if we try something new , say , ask for a raise .
and I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear @-@ setting at least once a quarter .

the only thing they have in common is that they 're different .
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they 're really good at ignoring you .
( laughter ) Fastest @-@ growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
thank you very much for your attention .
the challenge , of course , is to answer this question : what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?
we got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem .
whereas nature tends to be small , and curved , and it bends and twists , and has legs instead , and appendages , and has many muscles and many , many sensors .
here 's what some of you did this morning , although you did it outside , not on a treadmill .
( laughter ) Same principle : it only has six moving parts , six motors , but it has springy , tuned legs . it moves in the gait of the insect .
here 's the animal that we have here , running on a vertical surface .
we were fortunate to work with another group at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor , that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair .
and so without a referral , and paying out @-@ of @-@ pocket , I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist .

and I was surprised , but they said I could give a talk , and I said I 'd love to .
I know because I used to be in one of those control rooms .
when we talk about technology , we tend to talk about it as this blue sky opportunity .
so the internet is not evolving at random .
and they invented a feature called Snapstreaks , which shows the number of days in a row that two people have communicated with each other .
because outrage doesn 't just schedule a reaction in emotional time , space , for you .
it doesn 't have to be this way .
they are actually -- they really want it .
she was in the kitchen and she overheard the conversation , and she was mortified .
that was 70 kilos on each arm .
but this is also , if I take a big step back from this , this is also a very personal journey for me .
and I love this picture , too .
she was sent to start a new life in a new country on her own at the age of 12 .
she 's working for the International Rescue Committee to help other refugees , but she has no certainty at all about her future , where it is or what it holds .
I truly believe this , that the biggest question in the 21st century concerns our duty to strangers .
that means they cross a border into a neighboring state .
in Lebanon , one in four people is a refugee , a quarter of the whole population .
it 's called Dadaab .
and then when I asked the camp management how many of the 330,000 people in that camp were born there , they gave me the answer : 100,000 .
I think people do want to make a difference , but they just don 't know whether there are any solutions to this crisis .
the most vulnerable refugees need to be given a new start and a new life in a new country , including in the West .
the numbers are relatively small , hundreds of thousands , not millions , but the symbolism is huge .
we can 't say we don 't know what 's happening in Juba , South Sudan , or Aleppo , Syria .
and there 's one other thing it reveals about us : whether we have any humility for our own mistakes .
and I think that when you are in a position of looking for leadership , you have to look inside and mobilize in your own community to try to create conditions for a different kind of settlement .
but I still wish I could have known what they were thinking or what they were feeling .
you 're seeing my brain activity that was recorded in real time with a simple device that was worn on my head .
to share this information with you , I wore one of the early consumer @-@ based EEG devices like this one , which recorded the electrical activity in my brain in real time .
a US @-@ based company has developed a technology to embed these sensors into the headrest of automobilies so they can track driver concentration , distraction and cognitive load while driving .
I worry that we will voluntarily or involuntarily give up our last bastion of freedom , our mental privacy .
and I don 't think people understand that that could change everything .
does it also protect freedom of thought ?
and if so , does that mean that we 're free to alter our thoughts however we want ?
instead , we should be focusing on securing rights and remedies against the misuse of our information .
the time has come for us to call for a cognitive liberty revolution .
are aspirations converging all around the world ?
they actually met in New York City and got married in New York City .
now , when they were married and living in New York , my father was a waiter at Patricia Murphy 's restaurant .
for people who have the great privilege of studying medicine and anthropology -- I had come from parents who were refugees .
given our ridiculously elaborate educations , what is the nature of our responsibility to the world ?
it launched at Sundance this past January .
we were reading everything and we had to come to a conclusion of how are we going to structure our work ?
they wanted schools .
you should treat multidrug @-@ resistant tuberculosis -- we heard the same arguments in the early 2000s about HIV .
a few months of medicines , and this is what he looked like .
and we argued with the World Bank .
the Fourth Industrial Revolution , now , you guys know so much better than I do , but here 's the thing that concerns me .
and in this case , Zambia went from having a cost of electricity at 25 cents a kilowatt @-@ hour , and by just doing simple things , doing the auction , changing some policies , we were able to bring the cost down .
lowest bid , 25 cents a kilowatt @-@ hour for Zambia ?
that 's what we need , and we need that from all of you .
this is me with a classroom of 11 @-@ year @-@ olds .
now -- thank you .
you folks in this room , work with us .
then we trace those threads of potential out into the future , asking : what might it feel like to live in this future ?
but this work is not about predictions .
its glaring presence is so overpowering , I can 't help but stare at it .
and we see this all around us .
we treat our future selves as a stranger , and the future as a foreign land .
even when a technology is developed with utopian ideals , the moment it leaves the laboratory and enters the world , it is subject to forces outside of the creators ' control .
how on earth did Arnold manage to do that ?
when Arnold received his health insurance bill , he was shocked and scared to see that his premiums had gone through the roof , beyond anything he or his family could ever afford .
we stripped it down to the bare minimum .
in 1987 , tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage .
people usually contract bacterial meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and saliva that spray into the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs .
so fast treatment , or better yet , prevention , is critical .
that planet , after all , supports our living bodies our whole lives .
I began designing a system based on the principles of livestock mortality composting that would take human beings and transform them into soil .
we want to bring back the aspect of ritual that 's been diluted over the past hundred years as cremation rates have risen and religious affiliation has declined .
but I always thought it would get better , that no one could force me to leave , no one could take my home away from me .
in the past , I was able to reassure my students that the majority of the world does not hate refugees .
design inhibits my autonomy and my independence .
I 'm not showing you that one .
and then one day , she felt something move beneath her .
storybook Dads began in 2003 , when Sharon Berry , a civilian worker in a prison , realized just how much many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children .
is it difficult for prisoners ?
well , the process of choosing , reading and recording a story can be very challenging for prisoners .
Charlie : that 's his reindeer , isn 't it ?
you 've done a good job , good job .
for Sophie 's family and for thousands of families like them , Storybook Dads has been a lifeline .
the other swans looked at him and thought how beautiful he was .
and one way into it is to see that perhaps the most simple way into a culture and into an age is to ask : what do people worship ?
what do we worship ?
I 'm going to draw a little more blood .
we 're going to take the sample , mount it on Paperfuge .
so now the sample is completely enclosed .
it goes back and forth , back and forth ...
and now I 'm charging it up , and you see it builds momentum .
the world map for where mosquitoes are is missing .
that 's a male chasing a female .
what is that responsibility ?
it is to question and to challenge those in positions of power .
but neutrality won 't necessarily lead me to the truth .
life is much more complicated , and I believe journalism should reflect that very complexity .
that is not true journalism .
to me it seemed like a brilliant idea to expose the president , but to my boss -- ( Laughter ) My boss didn 't think it was such a great idea .
on June 16 , 2015 , a candidate who would eventually become the president of the United States said that Mexican immigrants were criminals , drug traffickers and rapists .
in comparison , six percent of US citizens have committed a serious crime .
eight weeks after they published my cell number , I obtained a press pass for a press conference for the candidate gaining momentum in the polls .
Donald Trump : who 's next ? yes , please .
Jr : it 's not about you -- Man : get out of my country !
neutrality helps only the oppressor , never the victim . "
August is monsoon season in this region of the world , and anyone that lives near a river is no stranger to flooding and the hazards and inconveniences at minimum that are associated with that .
what happened is the KOSI River jumped its banks , and for reference , the scale bar here is 40 miles .
so if we zoom in here , you guys can see these nice , curvy river pathways .
again , they 're really beautiful , but again , they 're not static .
it 's almost like a whip cracking and snaps off the pathway of the river at a certain spot .
so just for reference , again , in this location , that river changed its course over four miles over the course of a season or two .
so this was a pretty warm time and it happened really abruptly .
the yellow blob here is a fossil river .
and right now , it 's in a very small box .
one thing you can do is ask yourself : what goes on during that time ?
what 's interesting about these -- dating , social networking , gaming , entertainment , news , web browsing -- people spend 27 minutes a day on each of these .
and what they 've done is rigged the desks to the ceiling .
we don 't know how they 're going to react as the planet heats up , and hidden in that uncertainty might be hope .
but I 'm going to be honest with you : if I had a time machine , I would not be hanging out at this particular point in history .
they turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us .
if global warming triggers cloud changes that make for a less powerful greenhouse or a more effective sunshade , then that would enhance the cooling power of clouds .
but climate models struggle with clouds , and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways .
clouds could help us out with global warming .
I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest is like , " I have some suggestions for you . "
( distorted voice ) OK , so what 's going on here ?
( laughter ) Now I 'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self , the specific experience of being you , is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain .
or " Should our army advance into this territory ? "
well , you know what happened to Nokia ?
but not all systems are as neatly contained .
but the problem is that quantifying is addictive .
it 's very easy just to slip into silver @-@ bullet thinking , as if some simple solution existed .
so in an extraordinary range of contexts all over the world , this technology is still the dominant , most used , most effective technology to manage governance .
first , they founded political parties .
you know -- all the stuff .
as I motioned in the direction I thought she should go , saying , " There are no stores on this side of the street so your best bet is to cross -- " " Oh my goodness , " she interrupted .
around 10 years ago , I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins that first mapped the mutations of cancers .
medical procedures are the gold standard ; however , they are highly invasive and require a large infrastructure to implement .
then we use molecular biology methods to be able to enrich this DNA for areas of the genome which are known to be associated with cancer , based on the information from the cancer genomics projects .
we now know that these receptors are found all over the body , including in some pretty unexpected places -- in muscle , in kidneys , lungs and blood vessels .
this is exciting stuff .
over in the Caribbean where I work , we 've already been through the nosedive .
so we ended up with a digital landscape that really repressed creativity , repressed novelty , it repressed what makes us most human .
I mean , where 's the button on the ride hailing app for the drivers to talk to one another about their working conditions or to unionize ?
the idea of public education was for coal miners , who would work in the coal mines all day , then they 'd come home and they should have the dignity to be able to read a novel and understand it .
he kills , I kill . "
of course you would .
we 're interested in scenarios in which this is not possible .
( laughter ) We 've seen this problem before .
and to understand the social dilemma , we have to go a little bit back in history .
and this is helping us form an early picture of what trade @-@ offs people are comfortable with and what matters to them -- even across cultures .
so it 's time for Spot to come back out , and we 're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility , dexterity and perception .
the robot can walk with a number of different gaits ; it 's got a gyro , or a solid @-@ state gyro , an IMU on board .
now , Spot has a set of cameras here , stereo cameras , and we have a feed up in the center .
in fact , we look identical to the one next door , except that we 're bright yellow .
instead of pursuing the American dream , where we might have been isolated in our single @-@ family homes , we instead chose cohousing , so that we can increase our social connections .
it turns out , when you eat together , you start planning more activities together .
when you eat together , you share more things .
we follow up , we check in , we speak our personal truths and , when appropriate , we apologize .
and in the library , I found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the Great Depression .
my dog is in fact a malamute .
so we 've made amazing strides in image classification , but what happens when we run our classifier on an image that looks like this ?
and it 's correct , there is a malamute in the image , but just given this label , we don 't actually know that much about what 's going on in the image .
I work on a problem called object detection , where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects , put bounding boxes around them and say what those objects are .
and I knew that the Colombian army wore leather boots .
and at night , we would leave , get in the water , and we would swim and let the current carry us .
but after having lived through that with Lucho , after having faced fear together , united , not punishment , not violence -- nothing -- could ever again divide us .
( laughter ) So we got started but we had a delay , because first , pincho had to learn how to swim .
they made us dismantle the camp , and we started marching .
I called the man upstairs , and he sent me the patrol that rescued me from the jungle . "
but faith is , too .
but when they took us , handcuffed , into the helicopter that finally took us out of the jungle , everything happened as quickly as when they kidnapped me .
the shriek that came out of all of us when we regained our freedom , continues to vibrate in me to this day .
the " No " vote on the peace referendum in Colombia ; Brexit ; the idea of a wall between Mexico and the United States ; Islamic terrorism -- they 're all examples of using fear politically to divide and recruit us .
you can survive crawling along , fearful .
thank you .
you have a wonderful , wonderful , wonderful trip .
you drive 19 long hours back home .
so about three years ago , I got a call from the Brooklyn District Attorney .
he asked whether I 'd be interested in designing a program called a " conviction review unit . "
and to put it politely : Usain Bolt couldn 't have run from where she said she was to the other spot .
right ?
the man spent 17 years behind bars .
the last one is a case about two boys , Willie Stuckey , David McCallum .
now this was a case , once again -- first blush , it looked open and shut .
but my research showed that juvenile confessions without a parent present are prone to error .
we knew what really happened ; someone told them to say this .
after just about 30 years : " you are free to go . "
I knew my baby didn 't do this . "
if there 's anything that we 've learned , anything that I 've learned , with this conviction integrity work , it 's that justice doesn 't happen .
we make justice happen .
it would have taken someone just a minute to look at the video confession and say , " That CANNOT be . "
I must suffer if I lose it , give account if I abuse it .
just a tiny little minute , but eternity is in it . "
and he said , " I just want to walk on the sidewalk without anybody telling me where to go . "
a similar narrative exists all over the world .
but the truth is that the challenges of making this happen have less to do with what we do and more to do with the wealth position in which we are born .
the reason why we should create these trusts is simple .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : Darrick .
so , these trusts are different .
the old adage , " I have to be twice as good as someone else . "
soft ? squishy ?
you 're likely even touching the fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time you flushed a toilet , or those bacteria that live in our water pipes and sprayed onto you with your last shower .
I started talking to neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists , and what they told me was fascinating .
( audio ) MZ : so switch , switch , switch , you 're using glucose , glucose , glucose .
( audio ) Dr. Gloria Mark : so we find that when people are stressed , they tend to shift their attention more rapidly .
but when the data came in , it turned out that we had cut down , on average , just six minutes -- from 120 minutes a day on our phones to 114 .
but if it 's to distract yourself from doing the hard work that comes with deeper thinking , take a break , stare out the window and know that by doing nothing you are actually being your most productive and creative self .
you interacted with the company that you work for or that you own .
fraud has become a feature , not a bug , of the financial services industry .
there are whistle @-@ blowers like Michael Woodford , who blew the whistle on Olympus .
these whistle @-@ blowers risk their careers , their friendships , to bring out the truth about their companies .
similarly , reputation is a very powerful economic force , right ?
well , I 'm an economist and we conduct so @-@ called experiments to address this issue .

now , the modern twist on this display argument is that the peacock is also advertising its health to the peahen .
in my life , I ain 't met many people that will readily admit when they are afraid .
when I got out to those protests about the fourth or fifth day , it was not out of courage ; it was out of guilt .
it was so amazing in fact , that for the next 100 years , between 1900 and 2000 , humans built just billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure to essentially help artists do two things .
it 's not , like , perfect yet , but it 's really working .
thanks , everybody .
that 's a doubling of the urban environment .
the key attribute is that it isolates people .
no matter what they do , no matter how many ring roads they build in Beijing , they just can 't overcome complete gridlock .
so I 'm very hopeful .
and we did connect them with food and shelter and services .
I decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated .
and they do the paperwork , they do the insurance , they do all of the other forms that I can 't do quickly .
if you live in a city of eight @-@ and @-@ half million people , you can do this .
it can 't work that way . "
Siri is the thing that knows your intent and helps you do it for you , helps you get things done .
those things are changing every day .
and imagine how this could revolutionize the way we manage allergies and chronic disease .
the words they used to ask the question are important , but the intentions behind the question dictate your understanding and ultimately , your response .
it 's a remote , mountainous zone , a blue zone , where super longevity is common to both sexes .
now , a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on .
and these areas become much more engaged when we 're interacting with a live partner .
now , to return to the beginning , why do women live longer than men ?
that scientists and the public are so far apart on these science issues .
I often say , weather is your mood and climate is your personality .
we have knowledge .
it is not having a vagina that makes life harder for women .
aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured .
look at how much the position of women has changed in my lifetime or the incredible strides that the gay rights movement has made in just a few decades , right ?
( guitar ) And then there 's you .
we 're being scored with secret formulas that we don 't understand that often don 't have systems of appeal .
the New York Post filed a Freedom of Information Act request , got all the teachers ' names and all their scores and they published them as an act of teacher @-@ shaming .
he found 665 teachers from that New York Post data that actually had two scores .
and whereas an airplane that 's designed badly crashes to the earth and everyone sees it , an algorithm designed badly can go on for a long time , silently wreaking havoc .
second , we should think about the definition of success , audit that .
we should look to the blind orchestra audition as an example .
how often are there errors , and for whom does this model fail ?
data scientists : we should not be the arbiters of truth .
( applause ) And the rest of you , the non @-@ data scientists : this is not a math test .
and the answer is going to have to be cooperative economics .
Luci stands for the Los Angeles Union Cooperative Initiative , and our objective is to create more worker @-@ owned businesses here in Los Angeles .
these are the types of folks that want more union businesses to exist , so let 's build them with them .
and that vision is Mondragon , Spain .
and on a quiet day , I can hear her breathing . "
they had parents , and the few that were orphaned had other living relatives , like grandparents and aunties and uncles and other siblings .
so why were these children living in an orphanage when they weren 't orphans ?
these problems are reversible and preventable , and when we know better , we can do better .
thank you .
and I glanced upward , and I was just dumbstruck .
and pictures just don 't do it justice .
so there was the sun , and there were the planets , and I could see how the planets revolve around the sun .
( laughter ) Because you 're using ammonia , you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong ; it topped 400 psi .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
this is a talk about sugar and cancer .

what I find remarkable is that these birds would not be able to do that if they all would have to follow one leader .
their alignment enables their autonomy , and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible .
but instead , they used strange drawings with funny names like " squads " and " chapters " and " tribes " to explain how they were organized .
if the product guy has an idea , he can just raise it to get input from the engineer who is sitting right next to him .
or should we invest in better videoconferencing ?
it 's about all of us stepping up to take initiative .
now , today , to know how things are going , instead of looking at status reports , he needs to walk down to the team floors to attend one of their sessions .
and instead of telling people what to do , he looks for ways to help them .
that is radical change for someone who used to be a master of milestone @-@ tracking .
now they have releases every few weeks , and without the handovers and the red tape , the whole organization becomes more efficient .
and finally , if you walk the halls of these companies today , you just feel a new energy .
OK , so now you might understand what I said : modern AIs do not read , do not understand .
but see how it is beyond the volume zone of to @-@ be white @-@ collar workers .
I decided to investigate what was going on in the human world .
I took hundreds of sentences from high school textbooks and made easy multiple @-@ choice quizzes , and asked thousands of high school students to answer .
[ _ _ _ _ _ _ has spread to Oceania .
and Todai Robot chose the correct answer , too .
but -- do I read you right , that you think we really need quite an urgent revolution in education to help kids do the things that humans can do better than AIs ?
ca : a shift from knowledge , rote knowledge , to meaning .
[ the Way We Work ] My name is Dan , I 'm a partner at a global creative consultancy .
we can talk about challenges and struggles in an open way , rather than everybody pretending that they 're fine until it 's too late .
here we see cargo ships and oil tankers waiting outside the entry to the port of Singapore .
those are actually cows at a feedlot in Summerfield , Texas , in the United States .
over the next three to four months , the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms before they are shipped off to slaughter .
so this facility contains 2,650 mirrors which are arrayed in concentric circles around an 140 @-@ meter @-@ tall tower at its center .
through the incredible technology of these high @-@ flying cameras , we can see , monitor and expose the unprecedented impact that we are having .
it 's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion and natural disasters , but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid .
there is that very statue , as it was toppled over , breaking into pieces .
when we started the project , we started it with the Mosul Museum in mind .
the partial reconstruction of the statue , as well as the Lion of Mosul , the first reconstruction completed by our project .
this is a digital reconstruction from before , and this is actually during the destruction .
we believe 3D printing doesn 't offer a straightforward solution to lost heritage .
for example , I can show you here ...
now , if you look closely , you 'll notice that there are some parts that have been printed in color , and some parts that are in white or gray .
you may be thinking , you didn 't create these 3D models with only tourist photographs , and that 's true .
so we 're already finding photographs to complete a digital reconstruction of this .
but cultural heritage offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people for future generations .
we need your help to reclaim the history that is being lost .
you 've got just a minute to jump through the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history .
as soon as a red or blue triangle is created with a nodule at each point , it opens a doorway through time that will take you back to the present .
so we decided to build the largest smog vacuum cleaner in the world .
these are smog @-@ free bicycles which -- I 'm Dutch , yes ? -- I have this " bicycle DNA " inside of me somewhere .
you know , we 're not going to do that .
but the moment you present a new idea , there 's this weird tendency to reply to every new idea starting with two words .
" yes , but . " very good .
we are all crew . "
so in 2011 , I altered my name so that I could participate in Far Right youth camp in Hungary .
so a colleague enrolled me , and my last name sounds a little bit too Jewish .
but going to this camp , I was further shocked to realize that it was actually really fun .
and what 's really tragic is that oftentimes there 's no one profile .
we saw what they were eating for dinner .
how do we get rid of terrorist content ?
it 's not just recruiting combatants ; it 's trying to build a state .
one is " Extreme Dialogue , " and it 's an educational program that we helped develop .
and Africa is a serious place where only serious things happen .
to do this , we 're going to need three technologies to be good enough , and none of them are there yet .
I spent four years trying to analyze it , using standard academic tools , to guess what would happen , and I 'm here to tell you what I found .
now , if you were to spend a lot of time here , you might want a dashboard where you could do things like make a phone call , move to a new virtual world , check your bank account .
em world also contains enormous variety .
this is your life : you start and you end , really simple .
they don 't know which way the future 's going .
and that was because the computer could make decisions much faster , it could process a lot more information and it can process decisions much more -- less emotionally .
naturally , people had different opinions on the matter and how we were approaching the discussion .
the " Dot Collector " collects these views .
different people are always going to have different opinions .
I mean , you don 't have to tell somebody that their bald spot is growing or their baby 's ugly .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , if you 'd waited for one more year , you would have heard this .
( music ) The 10 @-@ year @-@ old , on every eight notes .
he was the president of a corporation in Ohio .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
the audience gasped when they heard the difference .
then I got a letter from this gentleman .
you adore classical music . your FM is always on that classical dial .
that 's the second group .
now comes the third group : people who never listen to classical music .
and then there 's a very small group .
you couldn 't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome .
but I tell you what .
now , you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work , if you look at my face , right ?
it 's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading to realize whatever he 's dreaming .
of course , I 'm not sure they 'll be up to it . "
( laughter ) All right . so I 'm going to take a piece of Chopin .
when I started , you thought , " How beautiful that sounds . "
( music ) " I don 't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year . "
then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say , " Wake up ! it 's culture ! " and then you feel even worse .
we have a B. This is a B.
the next note is a C.
( music ) But basically , it 's just a B , with four Sads .
( laughter ) Now , it goes down to A.
( music ) That might have been a fluke .
or they say , " Hamlet has an Oedipus complex . "
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
and ...
he did not survive .
so what the general straight public saw was this very awful thing happening to a group of people who were already on the fringes of society .
fear , stigma and shame : these keep those living with HIV in the closet , so to speak .
but this form was , and it was tremendously disappointing because it came from such an unlikely source .
you can upload a profile and a picture and it will show you available guys within a radius .
thank you .
but instead of ever feeling fulfilled , I felt anxious and adrift .
but Jonathan insisted on paying , so he went to the store and bought something he didn 't need to make change .
they make them feel invisible and unworthy .
for many people , belonging is the most essential source of meaning , those bonds to family and friends .
of course , for many of us , that happens through work .
of course , you don 't have to find purpose at work , but purpose gives you something to live for , some " why " that drives you forward .
but we don 't always realize that we 're the authors of our stories and can change the way we 're telling them .
that 's what set me on this journey .
of course , the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones .
so , the image of physics -- we 've got an image problem , let 's be honest -- it hasn 't moved on much from this .
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean .
so this is definitely physics happening here -- there 's lots of things -- this is definitely physics .
because I 'm a physicist , there has to be a graph , right ?
that 's allowed .
there 's quantum mechanics down in that corner , it 's very small , it 's very weird , it happens very quickly , and it 's a long way down in the general ...
on the scale of anything that matters for everyday life .
and if you go to some places like black holes in the beginning of the universe , we know that these are frontiers in physics , right ?
and the thing about all of these is that they all run on a relatively small number of physical laws , things like Newton 's laws of motion , thermodynamics , some rotational dynamics .
there 's plenty of physics research going on here .
but because it doesn 't involve pointing at stars , people for some reason think it 's not that .
I want you to tell me which one is which .
and that 's really fundamental in how the universe works .
this is the Hubble Space Telescope .
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field , which is a very tiny part of the sky .
Hubble has been floating in free space for 25 years , not touching anything .
Hubble kind of rotates around them , and so it can orient itself .
so the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use , also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time .
so this is the fun bit of physics , that you learn these patterns and then you can apply them again and again and again .
then I left the stage .
so I think we should play with these patterns .
magnets that you can play with in your kitchen get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation .
if you 're at a boring party , fish some raisins out of the bar snacks , put them in some lemonade .
you win on all fronts .
there 's these little patterns , and they 're right around us everywhere .
and being familiar with these concepts means we 're not helpless .
it 's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions .
and by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life , we gain the confidence to ask the right questions .
all of us can have fun playing with toys , and we shouldn 't be embarrassed about it .
and the fundamental physical laws that we can learn that are the way the world around us works , are the tools at the basis of everything ; they 're the foundation .
I 'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are teacups around .
the most obvious one is to get a teacup , get a spoon , tap the teacup around the rim and listen , and you will hear something strange .
playing with toys is great .
( laughter ) But of course , I know what they 're really asking , so I say something like , " Well , my grandparents and my mum were born in India , my dad and I were born in Kenya , and I was brought up in London .
and often the conflict is based on old stories of identity and belonging and origins .
he 's a very high @-@ risk security prisoner in the UK and one of the most important Al Qaeda figures to be arrested in Britain .
what about you , now , listening to this ?
because ibn Rushd said that something true in religion may conflict with something that your reason finds to be true on earth , but the latter is still true .
there are days when you feel as if you 're floating among the clouds .
but there are days when the horizon disappears ; there 's no longer a top or a bottom .
and if it 's sunny out tomorrow , we can go out and fly -- though , no , the weather in Vancouver isn 't -- ( Laughter ) it 's not very ...
but it wasn 't free from crossing borders .
these are fragile ecosystems .
now , civil libertarians like myself have been trying to draw people 's attention to these things and fighting against them for years .
so please join me , and let 's get to work .
you think about those missile tests , maybe their notorious leader or his good friend , Dennis Rodman .
Mike lost his job to a machine .
so what he 's talking about here is shared production , and efficiency is the name of the game .
so let 's just imagine that the US decides to impose a 20 percent border tax on all imports from Mexico .
but do you think Mexico is just going to stand by and let that happen ?
now , don 't kid yourself , these costs are going to be passed along to you and to me .
it 's that simple .
so telomere length wasn 't just a matter of age counted in years .
Elissa 's question to me , back when she first came to my lab , indeed had been a life @-@ and @-@ death question .
can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone ?
people sometimes ask me , how can you be an astrobiologist if you don 't have your own spaceship ?
to give you an idea of how dry it is , consider here in Vancouver it rains over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year .
how do I know this ?
in this place , we reported a new type of microalgae that grew only on top of the spiderwebs that covered the cave entrance .
in another cave , we found a different type of microalgae .
when you think of a fish school , or when I think of a flock of starlings , that feels like a really different kind of intelligence .
today I 'm here , actually , to pose you a question .
a lot of things could be studied , but look at that : 30 years ago , we were still poor in China .
I have a very high risk of gout .
I mean , it worked for me .
all those thousands of years of wisdom worked for me .
you have to ask a lot of questions about yourself : " what if ? " -- I 'm being jet @-@ lagged now here .
these early studies told us , even with the same banana , we have totally different glucose @-@ level reactions over different individuals .
I mean , the work is amazing .
giant clams are these massive and colorful shelled marine animals , the largest of its kind .
the biggest recorded individual was four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ feet long and weighed about 550 pounds .
street evangelism is only slightly less ubiquitous than street harassment .
forced evictions are incredibly violent and , of course , unconstitutional .
informal settlements are incorrectly named as the problem .
but there is no reason why their dreams -- or mine , for that matter -- are allowed to come true while those of others are turned to nightmares .
and he said that despite feeling lonely , he just threw himself at his work , that he built strategies around his grit and his desire to be successful .
similar to couscous , fonio has a delicious , nutty and earthy flavor .
( audience ) Oh !
( audience murmurs ) In K√©dougou it is also nicknamed " √±amu Buur , " which means " food for royalty , " and it 's served for guests of honor .
others end up on inadequate wooden canoes in desperate attempts to reach Spain .
last year , a business partner and I secured a commitment from Whole Foods Market , the US 's largest natural food store chain , to carry fonio .
political conversations with our family and friends uncovered a level of polarization that many of us had not previously experienced .
la : and I 'd say I 'm a little to the left , like all the way to the left .
what if , in these heated moments , we chose dialogue over debate ?
but the most significant reason we marched as a family is that it was a way for us to honor my parents ' legacy .
it was the boys who wanted to march after they talked about the issues as a family .
but what 's most important about this example is to think about the alternative .
think about it .
and do you know how much it costs for a company to even have an office ?
but that is going to change by the convergence of two technologies : augmented reality and telepresence robots .
well , the robot doesn 't give you any of that .
but today you can do all that online .
a vehicle carrying a squadron of drones .
so that 's two .
now , what was the third reason why people move to cities ?
a recent study made in the UK by the Office for National Statistics showed a higher life satisfaction rating among people living in rural areas .
( laughter ) I just think they will once they realize they can have the same benefits the city has .
and more importantly , do you want to ?
so I brought the dirt to Harvard , ( Laughter ) precisely 60 tons of dirt right in front of the main facade of the Graduate School of Design .
( laughter ) Yeah .
I had just seen The Green Lady .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
that was very important , and in some sense , we 've lost that .
you want a separate thing , like the AC adaptor .
I didn 't bring one with me , but they really work much better off @-@ board .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
and that 's very important , the user interface .
I 'm willing to suspect some of you hadn 't even heard of them before .
and this is the big difference .
so what I want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . I decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it 's not what we 're doing now -- is to go to six countries .
they went to Uruguay , Peru , Mexico .
I 'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me .
I felt a deep sense of dislocation and invisibility .
something should stand while Rhodes falls , I think that 's what it 's saying . yeah .
opinions varied , but the media focused on problematizing the removal of statues .
and so I started conjuring her mentally , spiritually and through dress .
on that day , I happened to be having a meeting with my supervisors , and they told me that the statue was going to fall on that day .
this is what I have called " Africa 's knowledge imperative . "
we are content to run our cities and rural dwellings alike on boreholes .
how does one run metropolises on boreholes and wells ?
it is yet another knowledge crisis regarding Africa 's agricultural resources , what and where they are , and how they can be best managed to make Africans live more lives that are worth living .
they created some of the most original civilizational elements for which the United States is now celebrated .
African universities are now all too content to have e @-@ connections with libraries elsewhere , having given up ambitions on building libraries to which the world would come for intellectual edification .
take archaeological digs , for instance , and their impact on tourism .
it 's something that I find immensely interesting .
so far , over three and a half million people have played it .
so I have a couple of videos .
these are from YouTube .
but what Silvarret has done here is that what he wanted to make was not a real city .
this is a fantasy city , even though it looks real .
so what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands .
so the places are really densely populated .
these city designs are what I love the most .
like , it 's not enough to have a hospital .
maybe this is what the future might look like .
so we need the solutions and these people , playing the game , they are trying out different kinds of solutions .
I 've got three boys ; they 're three , nine and 12 .
they 've been more likely to do worse at school , to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money .
so there we have it .
reading to children every day seems to be really important , too .
were the children going to bed at regular times , or did they go to bed at different times during the week ?
so wait , does that actually mean , then , that poverty doesn 't matter after all ?
now that means that poverty leaves a really lasting scar , and it means that if we really want to ensure the success and well @-@ being of the next generation , then tackling child poverty is an incredibly important thing to do .
as a scientist and a journalist , I like to have some science to inform my parenting ...
now , as you can imagine , the answers aren 't quite as simple as that .
for one thing , this study looks at what happens to thousands and thousands of children on average , but that doesn 't necessarily say what will help my child or your child or any individual child .
of course , I make sure they always have a book to read .
and Nairobi continues to grow in fear @-@ driven ways .
he had an idea .
we were confronted with the hierarchy of decision @-@ making within religious establishments .
I 'm talking about the creature in the box , not my cat .
but it will probably take a lot of time .
but I needed to know . like , I wanted to know .
I don 't have infinite olive branches to extend to people who , like , would not want to see me on this planet . right ?
it is going to happen with or without you .
armed with this information , I made a decision : I wasn 't going to be silent anymore .
( laughter ) Are you ready ?
audience : yes !
I 'm not going to say that you can 't sing that song , but if you are going to sing that song , I do need you to understand the extremely problematic gender construct that it reinforces . "
but , remember -- I came here to play smart , willful , complicated , interesting complex , confident female characters , right ?
and all of the sudden , I am wrestling with 300 other gorgeous , talented women to play ...
( laughter ) And I said , " Oh . that 's funny .
just so that people will trust you with their money . "
so we make the movie , anyway .
and so you don 't get change by asking them or even yelling at them .
( laughter ) So , now before I get to my four @-@ point plan for the revolution -- yes , I have a four @-@ point plan -- I have two pieces of very good and important news for you .
but the good news is , we exist , and there is a vast amount of untapped potential over here .
fact : women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets .
and as you start noticing this , it 's going to shift your viewing habits .
if we can figure out how to make our movies and deliver them to the audiences that want them , that 's it .
if you can give a female filmmaker 25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign , great , do that .
so now I 'm talking to all of the businesspeople and entrepreneurs .
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption .
come pick it up .
and I definitely want to give a little girl who may not have a real @-@ life role model the chance to watch movies and see women doing everything she dreams of achieving .
looking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact that not much has changed in the education curricula in Africa .
I was in the United States in Washington , DC studying towards my doctorate , and I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region .
and I was intrigued . I asked him why .
he said , " Oh , when I go to Africa , it 's so easy .
my bosses are happy with me . "
and he mentioned a particular country , Asia and some of these countries .
we know our aim . ' and they just keep going through all these things .
" really ? " I thought in my head , " OK . "
I had mostly Euro @-@ Americans , you know , with me from Washington , DC .
that 's a record .
he said that the task ahead of us can never , ever be greater than the power within us .
( applause ) Thank you . thank you .
" Robam kbach Boran , " or the art of Khmer classical dance , is more than 1,000 years old .
all of these curves create a serpentine impression , and this is important because before the introduction of major religions , Khmers , and people all over the world practiced animism .
they tore families apart and brainwashed children against their own parents .
nearly 40 years later , Khmer classical dance has been revived to new heights .
my name is Prumsodun Ok .
and then they look at it another 50 times during the day .
and if we pretend that they aren 't , or if we get overwhelmed by our fear , kids are never going to learn how and why to use them .
for those few weeks , people got to be creators and innovators .
and music has psychological effects on us .
hair up in a bun that 's the most fun .
top knot turn up , turn up , turn up .
the music pulls you in via the community aspect of it .
( percussion ) Yes .
all my bad habits have got to , got to go .
we were at the border .
it was our last day of filming .
and I made it to Chinese soil .
I looked at his eyes .
this time , an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm , because I lost my coat on the frozen river while battling with one of these soldiers .
South and North have been under armistice for 63 years , since the end of the Korean War .
referring to the cartoon that I just showed you .
every day was like a psychological battle .
and I learned that these girls also grew up watching a similar cartoon , but just propaganda towards South Korea and the US .
his first reaction was , " Euna , have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome ? "
there definitely was a wall that we couldn 't climb over .
and I 'm in this place where I read and hear about North Korea provoking the US .
I believe we need to ask a different question .
this means at this point supply can no longer keep up with demand despite exploding prices , unless we can commit to some type of structural change .
but what we care about in food is nutritional value .
India is food self @-@ sufficient and in the past decade has actually been exporting calories .
then we add China , the green line .
and even if you have optimistic assumptions around production growth , it will make that slight flip .
what I just presented to you is a vision of an impossible world .
nothing has happened because those arguments ask the surplus regions to change their behavior on behalf of deficit regions .
this is because , for the first time ever , the most critical tool for success in the industry -- data and knowledge -- is becoming cheaper by the day .
so before I do that , just one warning , which is that this presentation has been rated ' R ' by the Motion Picture Association of America .
being a gang leader in the inner city wasn 't such a bad deal in the mid- ' 80s -- the early ' 80s , let me say .
it had a huge impact on life .
and for the people who were there running the gang , it was a great way , seemingly , to make a lot of money .
so this is where we enter the picture .
but he hears some voices up in the stairwell , so he climbs up the stairwell , comes around the corner , and finds a group of young African @-@ American men playing dice .
this is a very dangerous job , being in a gang .
it was below the minimum wage . and this is well @-@ documented .
truly , you would be a great success story .
so , with shooting at you , what are the death rates ?
it turns out , the death rates on death row from all causes , including execution : two percent a year .
and then all of my friends said , " Maybe I should go do that , too . "
and so for instance , one thing the gang would do is -- the gang leaders would have big entourages , and they 'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry .
and really , they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be .
( laughter ) Maybe " weak and shit " is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis .
it 's my science fiction fantasy cure of my own incurable disorder .
vision loss has helped to take me away from the things that disconnect me from the world .
I think one of the best parts about this project for me was that I got to hang out with my brother a lot , who lives 2,500 miles away from me .
she reminds me that physical presence is important and that play is not a luxury , but a necessity .
she 's Pixie , and she 's our family dog .
workplace romance can be a tricky topic .
how do we deal with gender imbalances and power dynamics in the workplace ?
in almost all cases , no , you should not date your boss , because now , you 've got a power dynamic .
the evaluators were also quick to dismiss their accomplishments .
but you are , and there 's a power dynamic there that 's simply not there for other couples .
people who frequently witness flirting at work -- they actually report feeling less satisfied in their jobs , and they feel less valued by their company .
you certainly need a policy on a sexual harassment , and I think most HR departments recognize that .
but I don 't know if I have it .
I have been propelled by possibility for most of my life .
off the rugged coast of the pacific northwest , pods of killer whales inhabit the frigid waters .
the matriarch shows the younger whales where to find the most fertile fishing grounds .
the remaining explorers hoped for a prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base , but due to a series of mishaps , misjudgements and miscommunications , their rescue never arrived .
today , scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic research stations .
why do I want it ?
but in the pursuit , I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party .
( applause ) Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos who believed their voices mattered in the state of Georgia .
but they also let me understand the obstacles aren 't insurmountable .
( laughter ) And finances are something that holds us back so often , our dreams are bounded by how much we have in resources .
that 's why God created naps .
you take an airplane , you fly over the top , you 're weightless for 25 seconds .
and my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero @-@ g .
but it 's so fundamental to everything else in our world .
and so her lawyers and I asked Lily , did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her .
instead , we filed a civil lawsuit , and we eventually won the case , and her case became a rallying cry for domestic workers everywhere .
and what I thought to myself was : if domestic workers were in charge , this never would have happened .
we live in a time of moral choices everywhere we turn : at the border , at the ballot box , in our workplaces , right in our homes , full of moral choices .
so what does it mean to be a woman ?
they have a mix of chromosome types with X , with XY or with XXX .
if it 's not just about our chromosomes , then what is being a woman about ?
or does it ?
that 's a mouthful , but it 's what 's happening on the microscale .
to truly understand DNA decision @-@ making , we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic detail .
for that we 'd need a million computers to do that .
that 's exactly what we have at Los Alamos Labs -- a million computers connected in a giant warehouse .
and the patchy pattern actually happens in our brains and in cancer .
sometimes it raises eyebrows , but it also raises awareness .
maybe becoming a woman means accepting ourselves for who we really are and acknowledging the same in each other .
all of them use different methods , but they always make sure it 's something that they personally enjoy .
and the same thing happened when I was learning German .
so meeting other polyglots helped me realize that it is really crucial to find enjoyment in the process of learning languages , but also that joy in itself is not enough .
first of all , you 'll need effective methods .
because that 's really the moment we really know what we 're made of .
as Chris said , I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation -- in the ' 80s -- of students who were protesting a military dictatorship , which has finally ended .
in South Africa , they have a phrase called Ubuntu .
she was five foot two , very feisty and very English .
this is how English my mother is -- or was , she just passed .
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you .
and they would sing them only when they planted the rice , as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice .
did you also know that after apartheid , when the new government went into the parliament houses , there were no female toilets in the building ?
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women , that 's essentially what it is .
and I was this weird , sensitive kid , who couldn 't really do it , but I had to do it .
now , when I was growing up , he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people , and their intestines would fall out , but they would keep running .
anyway , a goat 's eyes are like a child 's eyes .
and then afterwards he said to me , " It will always be difficult , but if you cry like this every time , you will die of heartbreak .
that 's how I ended up in solitary , because I let my feelings be known .
the Igbo used to say that they built their own gods .
this is the cover of " Contagious " magazine last year , that was done by using the same ink that we made back in our labs .
this is a famous painting by the British artist , Christian Furr , who painted it for the song " Paint It Black " by The Rolling Stones .
now , there 's more to this pen and this ink than just the popular and pop @-@ culture artworks .
it 's made from the same pollution that is inside this petri dish .
suck it up .
this grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the Mediterranean .
at the time , they were one of 966 counties in the US that had no voting information online .
to Kat and Marie , not having and election website was unacceptable , but they didn 't have very many options .
it 's already transformed how we connect with one another and understand the world around us , but our democratic institutions -- they 're being left behind .
so if you 're ready to help millions , if you 're ready to close the gap between the system that we have and the system that we deserve , we need you .
this was my first time there , and as I observed , I saw that there was one person that was responsible for recording the outcome of a conversation .
so here was my opportunity to see exactly how that worked .
nothing really special , but a good pair of hands . "
you CANNOT have a 100 percent meritocratic environment when there is a human element involved in the evaluative equation , because by definition , that makes it subjective .
OK . person can 't be a champion or an advocate , because you don 't necessarily have to spend any currency to be someone 's champion .
it was almost two years later when I realized what this person should be called .
and frankly , why do you need one ? "
so that means it has that measure of subjectivity .
but here 's where the other currency is now most important .
( laughter ) And that 's something that could happen .
a nomadic Thracian from what is now Bulgaria , he had served in the Roman Army but was imprisoned for desertion .
as news of the rebellion spread , its ranks swelled with escaped slaves , deserting soldiers , and hungry peasants .
the rebels left victorious , but many lives were lost in the battle , including Spartacus " lieutenant Crixus .
after failed attempts to build rafts , and a stinging betrayal by local pirates , the rebels made a desperate run to break through Crassus 's lines- but it was no use .
of course , I was immediately intrigued .
Eun @-@ Sook was 11 years old .
and this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean .
and as we started talking , I saw him yell something , and Eun @-@ Sook came and brought us some food .
I want him to understand what happens if she stays here .
I don 't pretend to understand what 's going on here .
and so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keane to find out how the adoption process worked .
this may be one of those myth @-@ buster things that we 'll have to clear up here , in a minute .
I 'd been doing this every night I 'd been there .
so the two of us were just like , " Oh my God , oh my God . "
you know what kids are like when they 've been asleep for like an hour , it 's like they took five Valiums -- they 're all over the place .
his son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces , and we 're trying to do up his laces .
this has got to be a nightmare , this can 't be happening .
and the other is unbelievable guilt .
we were both so drunk , I couldn 't believe it .
this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .
I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years , where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography .
gene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta -- they 're the most social couple imaginable .
( laughter ) This is a tense moment in the first football game , I think .
Natasha : I 've seen pictures millions of times , but today was the first time I 'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .
they visibly make a living by asking for donations and by selling pairs of sticks tied with two strings .
this is a single bubble .
this is made from two layers of plastic with four pins connected to each other .
I am talking about the big ships here , the ones that are used to transport thousands of containers across the ocean .
the bubbles will move to the target areas .
there are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members of their own species , but that happens too .
thirdly , and this hits home .
we want to swoop in , do our job and leave feeling satisfied that we 've made a difference in somebody 's life .
we leave feeling frustrated and useless .
and you know what ?
at some point , I realized that it is up to us as first responders and as a community to solve this problem , to find better ways to deal with those that are suffering .
what makes their situation worse ?
what makes their situation better ?
I began experimenting with my words and paying attention to my own actions and how it affected those of my patients .
the education that I have received and continue to receive on a street level in Huntington has been both eye @-@ opening and life @-@ changing for me .
as a team , they go out and visit people who have overdosed within 72 hours of that resuscitation .
they work with them to provide treatment options based on their own needs , individual needs .
this does several things for us .
more and more ...
first responders are experiencing compassion fatigue and PTSD .
( laughter ) And we have some off @-@ duty programs that we 've started , like cooking classes for first responders and their significant other and pottery classes .
and I hadn 't seen that in years .
and that relaxed state is trickling down to the community , to the citizens .
twenty @-@ two years old .
talking in a non @-@ judgmental way .
I watched as one of my firefighters showed the father and another family member how to provide rescue breaths , should this happen again .
positive change .
did I happen to mention the two things that firefighters dislike the most ?
and I 've seen what crack can do to a community .
but right now , what I know is people are dying .
and we in Huntington deal with people suffering from substance use disorder of every color and every background , on the streets , every day .
the job of a first responder : prevent unnecessary deaths .
so ...
just by listening and being kind to somebody , you have the ability to make a difference in their lives .
representation matters .
authentic representations of women matter .
exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational .
there is a movement from within museums themselves to help combat this bias .
museums are didactic .
and there are hard truths about being a woman , especially a woman of color in this industry , that prevents us from centering inclusive examples of women 's lives .
pipelines to leadership for women are bleak -- bleakest for women of color .
or immigrant women , or Asian women , or Native women , or trans women , or undocumented women , or women over 65 , or girls -- the list can go on and on and on .
and after I finished , I went to this area , the Ituri Forest .
and my father was a soldier , and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .
but finally , I got myself involved .
on their way , they looted everything .
I 've been working with him about 10 years .
he has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest .
we don 't think so .
we started talking with them and I was negotiating .
and I was mad .
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it , until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander .
everybody is happy , but see what it 's doing , see what is going in Darfur .
and despite everything , I still believe in America .
I was giving a talk at a Christian college a number of years ago , and after my talk , a fellow scientist came up and he said , " I need some help .
because no matter where we live , climate change is already affecting us today .
( laughter ) But fear is not what is going to motivate us for the long @-@ term , sustained change that we need to fix this thing .
yes .
they also have a panda @-@ shaped solar farm .
she couldn 't work , socialize , or even concentrate well enough to read the newspaper .
one treatment changed everything .
at first , she talked openly about her life changing treatment .
the only physical indication of the electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot .
the treatment lasts for about a minute , and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an hour after each session .
some have trouble remembering what happened right before a session - for example , what they had for dinner the previous evening .
neurons in the brain communicate via electrical signals , which influence our brain chemistry , contributing to mood and behavior .
for example , ECT triggers the release of certain neurotransmitters , molecules that help carry signals between neurons and influence mental health .
a public , Dewey long ago observed , is constituted through discussion and debate .
but the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems .
we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world , in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope .
we have three critical terms : economy , civil society and the state .
the first challenge is to rethink , fundamentally , the issue of the time .
the absolute majority of the world 's population are below 20 , and they are growing larger and faster .
you stay away from design for development .
Ashraf Ghani : what scares me most is -- is you , lack of your engagement .
abandonment .
and I told them -- my people , with the Americans here -- separate .
the U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff .
the textile industry is incredibly mobile .
you know , the aid system , at first , was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries , not to generate growth in the poor countries .
and one of the good things about this cure was that it was free , virtually free , and was very easy to use .
and the people were happy . they were satisfied .
but he knew about the cheap and simple one .
and so if we look at recent crashes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years ' worth of data -- you won 't see it in the recent crashes . the new car seats are far , far better . "
but indeed , in recent crashes the lap @-@ and @-@ shoulder seatbelts , actually , are doing even better than the car seats .
they say , " Well , that 's impossible , that can 't be . "
but what 's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much .
it really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two , which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data .
so they just have these bench seats , and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it .
it 's hard to believe , when you look at this , that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash .
it seems to me that this can 't be a very expensive solution , and it 's got to work better than what we already have .
and I think the answer , perhaps , lies in a story .
I 've made him run into a wall here , over and over again .
they are a graphical visualization of a character .
so , he or she sits down , animates it , and tries to anticipate what 's going to happen , and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game .
it 's a very trivial thing .
and for that , we use the neural network , which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans .
we did get it to work eventually , after tweaking a bit here and there .
and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
( laughter ) Now , after five generations of applying evolutionary process , the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better .
and what you see is , it 's going to fall over the obstacle .
now , this might look kind of trivial , but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further , because obviously this was just a very simple , blocky biped .
what we really wanted was a full human body .
it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it .
but what it will do -- I 'm going to push it again .
now , it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well .
what you see is it takes steps backwards , it tries to counter @-@ balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land .
because stunts are obviously very dangerous , they 're very expensive , and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you CANNOT do , obviously , because you can 't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt .
now , here 's another one .
so I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take @-@ aways , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year .
I 'm very proud because I think I 'm the only person in America to out Bible @-@ talk a Jehovah 's Witness .
they have a pamphlet that says , " Here 's what Jesus said about homosexuality , " and you open it up , and there 's nothing in it .
and finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose .
" Flamin ' Red hots . "
and I refuse to be an accomplice to genocide .
next , while Eitri worked a block of gold , the fly bit Brokk on the neck .
after years of experiments , you 've finally created the pets of the future- nano @-@ rabbits !
that means you don 't actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold all the rabbits - and the reproduction is already underway !
to make matters worse , your devices and calculators are all malfunctioning , so you only have a few minutes to work it out by hand .
but how can we know how many trailing zeros a number has without calculating the number itself ?
so there 's three people in front of the Rothko on the left , so you take the third letter , which is a T.
you do that for all 10 of the original artists and put them in the order , and you get the answer , which is " illuminate . "
( laughter ) Puzzles like this are about communicating an idea .
what I didn 't mention before is that the prize for winning is that you get to construct the whole hunt for the following year .
whether you give them stars on a keyboard or play the celestial music of the cosmos , you 're getting them there , one way or another .
this might be a familiar experience to you , if you 've ever been watching a TED Talk and asked yourself , " Is this a puzzle ? "
it 's really fun , but no more winning . "
whether you 're in a subway , a park , an airport , a restaurant , even at this conference , all of you have a phone in your hands or maybe in your pockets .
I moved into a single large room in a cheap bohemian district of Delhi , with a small team .
it 's not an exaggeration to say that a threat to the ozone layer is a threat to human safety .
are there any ? I think there are .
and so ask yourself , did you wear your seat belt because someone told you with a hundred percent [ certainty ] that you would get in a car crash on the way here ?
you CANNOT build a light bulb by building better and better candles .
to make this happen , you may remember getting an email ahead of time , from TED , asking you whether you would choose to flip the coin or not , if you played the game .
( laughter ) So how did it achieve this amazing winning streak ?
and thirdly , my favorite quantum application is teleportation of information from one location to another without physically transmitting the information .
so it 's a lot of fun for me , being a quantum physicist .
we don 't want to continue to try to , like , look at the next 100 years and be granted , grudgingly , small legal rights and accommodations .
I think that women are tired of retrofitting ourselves into institutions and governments that were built by men , for men , and we 'd rather reshape the future on our own terms .
and so I 've given some thought about how to build this women 's political revolution and that 's what I want to talk to you about today .
and when my grandmother got pregnant , of course she was not going to go to the hospital to deliver , she was going to have that baby at home .
we 're half the medical students , we 're half the law students -- Exactly .
but when it comes to government , it 's another story , and I actually think a picture is worth 1000 words .
and as white women , we have to do more , because racism and sexism and homophobia , these are issues that affect all of us .
when a virus invades a bacterium , Cas proteins cut out a segment of the viral DNA to stitch into the bacterium 's CRISPR region , capturing a chemical snapshot of the infection .
those viral codes are then copied into short pieces of RNA .
here 's how it works in the lab : scientists design a " guide " RNA to match the gene they want to edit , and attach it to Cas9 .
many may not think of cats as serviceable sailors , or cooperative companions of any kind .
the main differences being that ancient Wildcats were more muscular , had striped coats , and were less social towards other cats and humans .
the abundance of prey in rodent @-@ infested granaries drew in these typically solitary animals .
in other words , cats today are more or less as they 've always been : wild animals .
I knew from the time I was three or four years of age that I was transgender .
I think he liked them .
still , somehow I ended up in ministry .
but I was certain that we were going to see this through to redemption .
but we can look outside , very cheaply and in a simple fashion .
you see the red glow in their eyes , which is the reflection of the flashlight .
so as you go further away from the Sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
they look like , maybe like sunflowers .
they pine for love , they live for love , they kill for love , and they die for love .
they 've never found a society that did not have it .
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you .
we found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses .
the question that I 'm working on right this minute -- and I 'm only going to say it for a second , and then end -- is , why do you fall in love with one person , rather than another ?
no , they 've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship .
we swivel towards each other , we do what we call the " anchoring gaze " and we talk .
and there 's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding .
most people live as if they 're never going to die .
I 've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death .
he was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39 .
they 're attempting to stow her possessions securely into wagons .
her fingers itched to pry it open .
we all know that saving is important and is something that we should be doing .
the question is : how do we do it ?
here 's number one : harness the power of pre @-@ commitment .
so take a moment and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self for something that you know today will be a little bit hard .
so right now , put a meeting request on your calendar for the day before your next birthday .
no matter what I 've done , what I 've tried to do , everybody says it can 't be done .
it 's Calvino 's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line , not the straight line .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer , observing every kilometer a particular object of desire , and then placing that within this .
again , a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated , very large @-@ scale organisms .
architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place .
it 's the clothing , the skin , without the presence of the character .
and now it turned into something much , much broader as a problem , and it has to do with performance .
there it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work .
it 's an idea that started from my first discussion .
and then of course , this one , our governor at the moment .
here 's a piano nobile , which is a device used in the Renaissance .
thank you so much .
have you ever heard of second sight ?
kt : God .
kt : look at the road -- ( Beep ) Still got that goddamn blindfold on .
kt : that is weird .
so , I stopped pretty quick , and that was it .
you might want to use the stairs , there .
your name is ? Nicole : Nicole .
I want you to be aware of the sensations , but don 't say anything until I ask you , and don 't open your eyes until I ask you .
has anybody here seen that film ? yeah .
sometimes the object will slide across the table , sometimes it will not .
we 're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis , right now .
Steve Jurvetson : MMM , yes .
tell me when I 'm over a cup .
( laughter ) KB : I told you I 'd have the last laugh .
SJ : can we do the left hand ?
KB : OK . do you think it 's here , yes or no ? this is your decision , not mine .
do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand ?
SJ : Oh !
however , I don 't see it as the noise of the car .
as soon as it moves , it creates this ascending high @-@ frequency pitch sound , which we called " whistling " sound .
together with a small team , we create lots of sonic textures that are able to transmit emotion .
[ sound is hypnotizing . ] And sound has the power to create an unexpected sense of wonder , which Hypnotizes .
if I would start to play the violin , I would generate a sound field which would propagate in this hall , and at some point , the sound field would hit the side walls and would be scattered all over the place .
and this is how it looked like .
on the subway , ads blast out of the walls .
when the alarm sounds they surge out in salamander @-@ shaped vehicles , sometimes to burn whole libraries to the ground .
altogether , Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait of independent thought on the brink of extinction - and a parable about a society which is complicit in its own combustion .
and who 's to say that we 'll stay forever small ?
and they 'll all have four decades of experience .
the older entrepreneurs in this country have a 70 percent success rate starting new ventures .
we 'd like to interview you about that . "
" not good . "
we 'd better give you a real sound bite .
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? "
and we forgot that people made choices and decisions .
so in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we 've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
they don 't sit in seminars on Saturday morning .
( laughter ) They don 't spend time alone .
American women said to Len , when he dated them , " You 're no fun . you don 't have positive emotion . get lost . "
it turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football , and played bridge .
and the answer seems to be yes .
when you do something philanthropic to help another person , it lasts and it lasts .
and our results surprised us ; they were backward of what we thought .
and there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes .
so , Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard , and so this was amazing for me .
so in conclusion , the eleventh reason for optimism , in addition to the space elevator , is that I think with technology , entertainment and design , we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .
and about 40 percent of them would say they 're happy at work .
it 's not about the perks .
employees want to be treated the same , regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age or their experience or their job category , compared to anyone else .
the one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they 're speaking is to know that what they say matters so much you might actually change your mind .
but people often ask me , " This works great for y 'all , but what about everyone else ? "
try to have as much communication as possible online .
the primary goal is connecting people .
each person who joins the company gets a home @-@ office stipend .
the decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
and I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
they all have bank accounts .
well , here we are on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane operated by NASA flying over the Greenland ice sheet .
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics , which are located in one of the most remote physical environments remaining on earth .
you can see that some areas of the ice sheet melt or lose ice in the summer .
well , under the ice lies the bedrock .
we used radar to image the hills , valleys , mountains and depressions that the ice flows over .
the reason that radar can reveal the bedrock is that ice is entirely transparent to radar .
just six years ago , we had no idea this glacier aquifer existed .
does the water stay there forever ?
pressurized fluids fracture rocks .
all it takes is a crack to get started .
to answer these questions , we need something beyond remote sensing data .
that 's about as cold as your kitchen freezer .
so the aquifer water is a part of the three millimeters per year of sea level rise that we experience as a global society .
in other places , not so fast .
ice sheets are immense , powerful machines that operate on long timescales .
it 's a particularly good thing to be having sex outside of the institution of marriage .
do they follow through ?
and of course , romance has to be there .
" five more minutes . "
and she certainly wasn 't camera @-@ shy .
I also got Mom to model for my oil paintings .
( applause ) ( Applause ends ) I don 't take pictures of her anymore .
my father , my brother , ( Voice breaking ) my nephew , my partner and my best friend , all passed away suddenly .
heart attacks occur for many reasons , but most often , they occur when arteries get clogged , blood flow is cut off and oxygen @-@ starved cells in the heart muscles start to die .
a noninvasive device that is inexpensive , portable , wearable by at @-@ risk patients at all times .
it greatly reduces the need for a blood test and works 24 / 7 , collecting and analyzing data at preset intervals .
and all this data is collected for a single purpose : detecting heart attacks as they occur .
we literally wait for the heart attack to occur and put our vast majority of resources into post @-@ care treatment .
but by then , irreversible damage will already be done .
I 'd had some previous judo training .
according to a National Black Women 's Justice Institute analysis of civil rights data collected by the US Department of Education , black girls are the only group of girls who are overrepresented along the entire continuum of discipline in schools .
well , for one thing , it means that we have to immediately discontinue the policies and practices that target black girls for their hairstyles or dress .
gender and climate are inextricably linked .
we can feel the connections between us .
and we , all of us , we are life force .
too often , the story ends here .
but not today .
compared with men , women smallholders have less access to resources , including land rights , credit and capital , training , tools and technology .
we humans need land to grow food .
but if existing farms produce enough food , forests are less likely to be lost .
education is one side of a coin .
curbing the growth of our human population is a side effect , though a potent one .
( laughter ) Though we probably will .
we have the most to do .
this earth , our home , is calling for us to be bold , reminding us we are all in this together -- women , men , people of all gender identities , all beings .
so when she began to disappear for days at a time , I turned to some magic of my own .
but if my perfect walk could not bring my mother back , I found that this approach had other uses .
does she look back because she wanted to be sure that her people were far enough from danger to breathe a little easy ?
here is the usual version of climate change .
nothing much , just a crocodile on the street .
this land has no room for water .
when life gives you a flood , you have fun with the water .
no matter how rough the path , how big the crack , you push through to your goal , because that 's where your heart is .
and essentially we are just an upright @-@ walking , big @-@ brained , super @-@ intelligent ape .
( laughter ) It 's extremely time @-@ consuming , labor @-@ intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people , to begin to piece together our past .
fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin , which represents some 20,000 square miles .
he was very able to use stones effectively as tools .
and we 've also managed to communicate with people all over the world , from extraordinary places .
we all have an African origin .
we 're sitting on the edge of a precipice , and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today .
this is showing the world 's most common feelings overall right now , dominated by better , then bad , then good , then guilty , and so on .
so I 'll show you now some of my favorite montages from " We Feel Fine . "
" I feel pretty . "
so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in " The Whale Hunt " and the two whales that were killed down here .
he had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face , which I 'm told is very good luck .
he was eating this orange , sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into , and since there was so much saliva on his hands , this orange paste started to form on his palms .
I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
what if she saw the truth after just one year , what would she do for the next 35 years in her life ?
woman : you 're most welcome .
JH : so if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .
and they 're actually still flying up there today .
it 's very common among highly creative people , both artists and scientists , and I 'd like to give it a name : slow @-@ motion multitasking .
the top scientists kept changing the subject .
slow @-@ motion multitasking among creative people is ubiquitous .
for an example of this , consider the original eureka moment .
not because you 're in a hurry , but because you 're in no hurry at all .
so immediately , Darwin starts making notes .
a book that he 's to continue working on for his entire life , he never finishes it .
and then , the book about the development of the human infant .
( laughter ) He worked upon that book for 44 years .
make a list of your projects .
and get to work .
thank you very much .
when I was 15 , I came home from school one day , and she was standing on a long veranda outside of our kitchen , holding a giant stack of plates .
anger is a human emotion , neither good nor bad .
what happens too often is that for all of us , indignity becomes imminent in our notions of femininity .
if we 're faced with a threatening street harasser , predatory employer , a sexist , racist classmate , our brains are screaming , " Are you kidding me ? "
if you ask women what they fear the most in response to their anger , they don 't say violence .
if you have multiple marginalized identities , it 's not just mockery .
I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired .
there is anger that 's acceptable .
we can take emotions and think in terms of competence and not gender .
most of them are now investing their funds on women 's health , education , skill development and safe drinking water .
we have all had such tests .
now , I 'd say my driving was pretty good , but let me check .
( laughter ) Now imagine a device like this one , that does not only measure alcohol levels in your breath , but that detects diseases like the ones I 've shown you and potentially many more .
but they didn 't stick together .
Ocean currents are driven by a range of sources : the wind , tides , changes in water density , and the rotation of the Earth .
as water moves towards the North Pole , it gets colder .
but that was not usually the case .
her friends , for example , had been lynched when their grocery store became popular enough to divert business from a white competitor .
she was ahead of her time , waging a tireless struggle for equality and justice decades before many had even begun to imagine it possible .
to be new at TED -- it 's like being the last high @-@ school virgin .
but I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents , and that these two things talk about very specifically .
now , I don 't mean romantic as in , this is a nice place to take someone on a date .
I mean romantic in the sense of , there are things larger and grander than us .
or the way we went to describe that later : manifest destiny .
now , which would you rather be ? a grid , or manifest destiny ?
they 're now building a 16 @-@ story building on the side of New York , using the same technology .
every single surface of this restaurant is white .
the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting .
it 's all about sensuality . it 's all about transforming .
this is a wine @-@ buying experience simplified by color and taste .
and my oldest sibling is a sister , I 'm the youngest , and there are three boys in between .
we didn 't like it at the time , but that 's how we learned that it was our obligation to take care of those who couldn 't take care of themselves .
but I saw grinding poverty .
but it was the right judgment to make .
MWe : well , I think the children now have sort of become a mainstream issue .
we 've been trying to reform the child welfare system for decades .
I 'm dressed like one , I guess .
but I 'm not talking about bravery or courage .
I don 't respond to testosterone , so during puberty , I grew breasts , but I never got acne or body hair , body oil .
( laughter ) But even though I don 't actually have a uterus -- I was born without one , so I don 't menstruate , I can 't have biological children .
are they kind , generous , funny ?
who do they want to be when they grow up ?
in this society , we love putting people into boxes and labeling each other .
you have your internal sex organs , your hormone production , your hormone response and your secondary sex characteristics , like breast development , body hair , etc .
those seven areas of biological sex all have so much variation , yet we only get two options : male or female .
did you know that besides XX or XY chromosomes , you could have XX and XY chromosomes ?
and everyone 's favorite part , genitalia : you either have one or the other , right ?
you know the one .
just notice .
we 're not new or rare .
we 're just invisible .
we 've existed throughout every culture in history .
a friend of mine found out last year , in his 50s .
I also had doctors lie to me .
they 're not responding to testosterone , they 're not producing sperm .
we often place unrealistic expectations on the things that our bodies do that are outside of our control .
( laughter ) We constantly change and evolve , the more we understand as a society .
what they do is they cement to each other , and they build these huge , extensive reef systems .
so they 're really quite influential .
and then another thing is it also helps with reproductive efficiency .
I think of this as like that , except for it 's real , in this case .
and I just think it 's a really cool image , because you can imagine yourself flying in and going back there .
but what we do want to do with this information ?
so imagine you 're at home and you break your favorite figurine or a mug or something like that ?
we need to scale this up , ideally maybe train car scale .
and here 's something else that we can do .
so this is a tank of seawater , and then , in that syringe is one of our adhesive formulations , and what we 're doing is we 're dispensing it completely underwater , on a piece of metal .
and then , we want to make an adhesive bond , or joint , and so we take another piece of metal and we put it on there and just position it .
I 'm always very anxious here .
and it 's stuck .
so we can actually get very strong underwater adhesion .
it 's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce , so for us , it 's pretty exciting . it 's pretty cool .
so think about your cell phone , your laptop , plywood in most structures , the interior of your car , shoes , phone books , things like this .
it 's just awful . it hurts .
you 're making sites for infection .
to me , it looks like these were things devised in a medieval torture chamber , but it 's our modern surgical joinery .
you don 't want to hurt the patients .
it 's been done many times . but getting all three hasn 't been done .
so what we 're doing is we 're getting all sorts of bones and skin and soft and hard tissue , and sometimes we 'll whack it with a hammer .
especially through architecture , you 're trying to challenge preconceptions and push boundaries and innovate , even if just using what we have around and we overlook all the time .
and we are observing that the results are intriguing .
and we are doing it ourselves with our hands in our shop , and we are architects . we 're not professional builders but we want to make sure it 's possible .
and it 's so nice that Ant√≥n can move it with his hands and Javier can put it in a container , and we can ship it like you would ship your belongings if you were moving abroad ...
and what they were watching was : " one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind . "
it showed me what it meant to be an explorer , at a very early age .
( laughter ) And so I knew I could be a chemist .
so as I went on this journey through a high school , and I went to college , and I got a football scholarship to play football in college .
so the next selection , I filled out the application , and I got in .
thank you .
so in which corner should you place the diffuser to flood the vampire lair with sunlight ?
and indeed , when that precious beam of sunlight enters the hall , it bounces between the walls and strikes the Southeast corner , spot on .
and if you take all these things that are impossible , I think one of the things that we 're learning from this era , from this last decade , is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible , because we 're unprepared for it .
and it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we 've ever made .
there 's two million emails per second .
so every second , half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine . it 's a big machine .
we 're giving it a body . and that 's what we 're going to do in the next 5,000 days -- we 're going to give this machine a body .
but everything , all the cameras , and the microphones , and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine .
and I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web .
so that the laws of media , such as the fact that copies have no value , the value 's in the uncopiable things , the immediacy , the authentication , the personalization .
the media wants to be liquid .
and so , giving an example of this thing , I live in Pacifica , rather than -- right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere .
but we can also think about it as kind of a large organism .
you know , creation is what put that dog in that picture , and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters .
the entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume , for travel purposes .
because clouds can mean anything you want .
and you become trapped into this kind of representation .
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection .
I wasn 't interested in the very large things , or in the small things .
how does that compare with the way computers work ?
and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity , just by it flowing through the network .
we 've all experienced the frustration of an old smartphone or tablet grinding slowly to a halt over time under the ever @-@ increasing weight of software updates and new features .
and this process has been dramatically improved over the years to give the electronics performance we have today .
and we can even create more elaborate structures if we use unsymmetrical molecules , where one polymer chain is significantly shorter than the other .
the early 16th century statesman Niccol√≥ Machiavelli wrote many works of history , philosophy , and drama .
but what we know about Machiavelli might not fit this picture .
first , for those unfamiliar with what I do , I guess if you distilled it right down to its essence , you would call me a beatboxer .
that 's really remarkable .
it 's become an art form , a form of sculpture .
or you could do a moose .
and sometimes you create high art , and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work .
they certainly didn 't need to talk to origami artists .
whether you look up or look down , how do you get it up in space ? you 've got to get it up there in a rocket .
and rockets are small . so you have to make it smaller .
it holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination , but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there , through your blood vessels .
she 's a resident , a surgeon in training .
so my cofounders and I set out to create that language .
initially , we were just trying to get people out of their phones and back into the real world .
but the more we experimented , the more we realized that those who stood to benefit most from our work were people who had little or no sight .
skyscrapers have come a long way since Wright proposed his mile @-@ high tower .
I was beginning to question myself as to whether or not I wanted to give this man the death penalty .
I gave up and voted along with the other 11 jurors .
my life was kids , work , church , ball games -- just your average , normal , everyday life .
however , if I talked or tried to talk about the trauma outside her office , I was shut down .
within two minutes of his execution , they had given him a stay .
well , thank God for Allen .
and he said , " You know , I had a responsibility in that man 's death . "
while I was there , I got a T @-@ shirt .
so I turned around and I looked at her , and I said , " Are you gonna wear this ? "
it also gave me confidence to be able to see through the eyes of my granddaughters , that this younger generation , they 're capable and they 're willing to tackle these difficult social issues .
some people have been thinking about alternatives , and one of the ideas that is out there is the idea of direct democracy .
there are no humans in that factory .
ignorance about the female body goes back centuries .
some people feel that all this is a trivial issue .
she says the hundreds of women she sees all tend to repeat the same thing .
and the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas , the chimpanzees and us .
but that 's not really the question I 'm asking .
you 're looking at a great example here .
and he did a pretty good job .
it 's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well @-@ intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre @-@ Darwinian era .
what 's the take @-@ home message ?
such an amazing story .
we hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago , but basically , from 70,000 years on , things were getting really tough , getting very cold . the Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets .
and the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets , compared to what we have today .
we nearly went extinct . we were hanging on by our fingernails .
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa , and they allowed us to start to expand around the world .
and it 's basically a meat locker .
the grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age -- stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea , and the entire continent was open to them .
which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic .
and it 's based on a few thousand people we 've sampled from , you know , a handful of populations around the world .
the field research that we 're doing around the world with indigenous peoples .
the Human Genome Project , or a Mars Rover mission .
it 's a charitable entity , basically a grant @-@ giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational , cultural projects initiated by them .
did you know that over 90 percent of cancer deaths can be attributed to its spread ?
we found that in our treated group , over 75 percent of the cancer cells we initially injected were dead or dying , in comparison to only around 25 percent .
Nailah Ellis @-@ Brown started Ellis Island Tea out of her trunk .
Arsha Jones started her famous Capital City Co Mambo Sauce with one product and a PayPal link .
scale is great , but there 's also beauty in a successful business that 's built for a specific audience .
but seventh grade was a game changer .
all of our journeys are made up of a series of rest stops , accelerations , losses and wins .
it was so gratifying to see the kids calling each other and texting each other to say , " Hey , why are you late for SAT prep ? "
I saw a group of kids kind of huddled in a circle .
we 're open evenings and weekends .
( laughter ) PA : aja challenged everything I knew and understood about the world .
PA : this became Smoke Signals Studio .
our art possesses rhythmic communication , coded emotional cues , improvised feelings of critical thought .
art -- ( Applause ) Art as organizing is even changing and opening doors in places seen as the opposite of freedom .
the year 2078 , I will celebrate my 75th birthday .
once we start to act , hope is everywhere .
thank you .
so what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars , that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside .
when those measurements are made , instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant , as a function of distance .
galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space ; they tend to cluster .
can we see it more visually ? yes , we can .
now , how do we deduce where the galaxy is ?
now , suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies -- and don 't forget the dark matter , OK .
we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here .
( laughter ) .
they 're not necessarily moving through space .
they 're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger , OK .
so the expansion of space is actually speeding up .
it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider .
now , unfortunately , there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy , so it will be hard to tell the difference .
whether she 's describing bickering families , quiet declarations of love , or juicy gossip , Jane Austen 's writing often feels as though it was written just for you .
but this unique brand of tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek humor is just one of the many feats found in her sly satires of society , civility , and sweeping romance .
or the iron @-@ willed Anne Elliot of " Persuasion , " who chooses to remain unmarried after the disappearance of her first love .
I like to explore : what does the word " creativity " taste like , or " equality , " " love , " " revolution ? "
sometimes it draws circles , even slides backwards , and that generations can make the same mistakes that their great @-@ grandfathers had made .
demagogues come in all sizes and in all shapes .
they don 't seem to understand that we don 't have to pick one pain and one place over all others .
I think East and West , we are losing multiplicity , both within our societies and within ourselves .
today , my motherland became the world 's biggest jailer for journalists , surpassing even China 's sad record .
I have become a Londoner over the years .
we 're also interested in our own silences .
so even stronger than my emotions is my awareness that not only gender , not only identity , but life itself is fluid .
I think we need to go back to the basics , back to the colors of the alphabet .
do you agree ?
over the heart , don 't move the wrist .
and forward . yeah .
and I think I 'll take off this one .
I think we keep the queen here , yes .
Ace of diamonds .
yes , yes , OK .
two -- and it was two of spades , right ?
sorry , two of diamonds . I 'll do it quick now .
so , this whole dominance issue -- number one , what we get in dog training is this Mickey @-@ Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system .
the poor puppy jumps up , you open the dog book , what does it say ?
the dog doesn 't speak English , or American , or Spanish , or French .
and there 's times , for example , if my son 's friends leave the door open , the dogs have to know you don 't step across this line .
it doesn 't have to be .
this is crazy .
" Johnny , don 't do that . "
you see it especially in the workplace , especially from boss to employee .
so , that would be my wish to the future .
it says right now , we think music is notes and how they 're played .
it 's one minute long .
and the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war .
the material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense , thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States .
I 'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer .
I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat .
the question is , what 's the good you can do with it ?
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Here 's my parody and it ain 't much of one .
what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow , and creating the peace space that allows us to move on .
( laughter ) This is not about overwhelming force , but proportional force .
it 's about non @-@ lethal technologies , because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you 're going to lose friends very quickly .
but it 's not a perfect world , and your administration isn 't getting us any closer . "
like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan .
( laughter ) And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say , " Jesus , it was dark . "
what we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what I call that Sys Admin Force .
all security dominated .
you vote according to how much money you put in the kitty .
this is why it matters to the military .
( laughter ) I 'm talking about the 1990s .
I maintain this is code inside the Army for , " We don 't want to do this . "
I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s .
it elevates MOOTW -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy , because that 's how you 're going to shrink that gap .
Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets , which you CANNOT do , but maximum rule sets which you must do .
certain bad things you CANNOT do .
our long @-@ term rationale becomes , we 're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets .
( laughter ) I supported the war in Iraq .
I knew we 'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force .
what should be the CIA , open , analytical , open source should come over here .
the hospital put him on a water drip for three days .
because we talk about it in big terms , and you wonder , you know , so what ?
but it 's damaging .
and you didn 't know about the windmill , you know ?
he was like , I try and I make .
first of all , Africans , we need to get better at telling our stories .
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa .
( laughter ) But the point I 'm trying to make , though , is that it 's not enough for us to criticize .
and we give them business development services , as well as financing loan and equity .
and basically , we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians .
what are they doing ?
they come from us .
people are like , " OK , if you don 't do aid , I 'm a bleeding heart liberal , what can I do ? "
my cousin ran out of school fees , and she 's really smart .
and he said , " Look , you can get into Harvard , you 're that good , OK ?
basically , I want to end with my vision for Africa , you know ?
you know , my vision is that my daughter , and any other African child being born today , can be whoever they want to be here , without having to leave .
I would like to see that change , and the change starts with us .
and there are a lot of people doing this , a lot of synthetic biologists doing this , like Craig Venter .
you can look in this computer @-@ fabricated artifact , and he 's got a double @-@ stranded genome -- that 's no good .
you look in his intestines . there are billions of bacteria .
and here 's how we do it .
now , we can 't actually take a movie of this process , but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it .
that holds the long strand like this .
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye , down the nose , up the nose , around the forehead , back down and end in a little loop like this .
and so , I got this in the mail about a year after I did this , unsolicited .
you get a high @-@ level description of the computer program , a high @-@ level description of the origami .
the fact is that it does not scale .
so , that answers that sort of first question I was talking about .
you can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you 'll get 96 rather than 32 .
so , you can ask , how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size ?
that 's really not affordable .
so it 's got some errors , but at least it counts up .
and I think in the next five or 10 years , we 'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self @-@ assembled circuits .
what it 's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light , asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things . thank you .
the doctor looked at her , didn 't shake her hand and said , " Why are you here ? "
these are all myths and untrue .
and what this means is , before , we always thought there was only two , male and female .
now , you may be thinking , " Dr. Kristie , I have never questioned who I am .
a transgender male is someone who was assigned female at birth , but their sense of self , who they are , how they live their life , is as a male .
three very different identity spectrums .
now , the average medical student spends about five hours learning about the LGBT health @-@ related needs while they 're in medical school .
so what about the rest of us ?
what will you do ?
and that 's no different from Imperial College in London , by the way , it 's not some sort of anti @-@ American thing going on .
it 's so easy , isn 't it ? of course , you all knew that .
I promise you that most of you will have got that .
what sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system , to show that it 's not really like that ?
SW : yeah . she would get really , really excited .
E : [ spaceship noise ] SW : even if it doesn 't have a laser ?
because one of her favorite folks from back home is here , and she 's pretty nervous to meet him .
E : OiNK , oink , oink .
one of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE was take the challenge on that risk is OK , you know .
we know -- 20 million dollars today , you can go and buy a ticket , but how cheap could it get ?
it 's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy .
( laughter ) But guys , if history has taught us anything , it 's that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
I have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
by ' 08 , suborbital flights , the price tag for that , you know , on Virgin , is going to be about 200,000 .
you get publicity increase , and when it 's won , publicity shoots through the roof -- if it 's properly managed -- and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor .
you know , innovators , the entrepreneurs out there , you know that when you 're going for a goal , the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself .
we are looking at a number of energy prizes .
yet , I 'd argue that no other continent has nurtured , has fought for , has celebrated its history more concertedly .
history matters .
history really matters .
they knew that controlling territory and subjugating the head of state -- it wasn 't enough .
in 1871 , Karl Mauch , a German geologist working in Southern Africa , he stumbled across an extraordinary complex , a complex of abandoned stone buildings .
Mauch , like dozens of Europeans that followed in his footsteps , speculated on who might have built the city .
we have to rediscover African philosophy , African perspectives , African history .
and like him , I loved everything about it : the showmanship , the athletic skill , the drama .
in fact , I did it so well , I was the only guard to get a close @-@ up on TV that night .
( laughter ) I mean , it was just the one time , and my daughter was clearly fouled !
but then I think , " Hey , I 've wrestled in less . "
thank you .
and these future musings were always presented to me like part of this American dream , but it always felt to me like someone else 's dream .
and as a kid , when I would try to explain this , this disconnect between their roles and my values , they often laughed in the way that adults do at the absurdities of children .
and " my long @-@ term partner has this kind of business , " and " I 've done research on this for months .
( laughter ) that this supported something integral to who I was .
" how does he or she feel about all of this ? "
my stance on childbearing has always been first date conversation .
the European Commission has dealt with already seven different car parts cartels , and we 're still investigating some .
of course , to some degree , technology can help us to build trust in one another with ratings systems and other systems that enable the sharing economy .
and that can help us build the trust that we need for real innovation to flourish and for societies to develop for citizens .
nobody 's going to want to do the same thing for 60 years .
lesson six : your company needs to live out its values .
here are two images of a house .
however , noise affects our health in many different ways beyond hearing .
so what do we mean when we talk about noise ?
sleep is a very active mechanism that recuperates us and prepares us for the next wake period .
also , talk to your children about the health effects of noise and that listening to loud music today will have consequences when they 're older .
use that information .
and we recognized -- and I think every year we 're reminded of this in the world -- that predicting what 's going to happen is hard .
BF : so what does that mean , and what does that tell us ?
RB : you can 't eat dignity . you need stability first .
because what we need to do from the beginning is understand what is it about work that gives people dignity , so they can live the lives that they want to live .
and then you think about our culture more broadly , and you ask : who do we make into heroes ?
that 's the Netflix show that I would binge .
she smiled innocently and said no .
these three identities forced me to think that I should never have been born .
( laughter ) Everyone was hooked on to the television that morning , including my parents .
to build that , what we 'd do with Whirlwind technology is we 'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland , and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those whirlwinds .
it shows up at places like MIT , and then a mutation happens .
here he is talking from the 1960s .
( video ) John Markoff : do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs , sex , rock ' n ' roll and the anti @-@ war movement had to do with computing ? everything .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network .
narrator : stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising , David Sarnoff commercializes radio .
we come into the era of the dotcom , the World Wide Web , and I don 't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together .
and that 's the kind of resolution that you need to begin to image that little speck of dust as it comes around the sun and see if it has a blue @-@ green signature .
it means that we 're beginning to learn how to read this language .
so this is the world 's first synthetic life form .
it 's just ones and zeroes flying through there .
if you can flow ATCGs through cells , then this software makes its own hardware , which means it scales very quickly .
DNA is a really powerful information storage device .
and a lot of us think , " Oh no , we never want to redesign humans . "
unless , of course , if your child has a Huntington 's gene and is condemned to death .
other people say , " This is one of the things that 's killing millions of people yearly .
he 's had the precursor of the RNA be absorbed by the cell and then he 's had the cells divide .
so we 're getting to the point where we can rebuild most of our body parts , in the same way as if you break a bone or burn your skin , it regrows .
although she considered other careers , Plath chose the artist 's way .
could this tiny point of matter explode in another Big Bang ?
this is at 17,000 feet .
as a teenager , he faced the invasion of his country , and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country .
and this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago .
so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior .
as the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals , so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual 's life history .
and young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do .
they 're capable of extreme brutality , even a kind of primitive war .
and these decisions affect Africa .
the most important message of Roots and Shoots : every single one of us makes a difference , every single day .
the Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects .
and just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring .
people like this are the role models we need for young Africans .
and I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things , especially the Roots and Shoots program .
and just a last word on that -- the young woman who 's running this entire conference center , I met her today .
thank you .
people who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty , variety , diversity , new ideas , travel .
you can predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to and what kinds of food they like to eat .
well , let 's see now .
let 's find out .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) So if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way , then my message to you is that you 're trapped in a moral Matrix , in a particular moral Matrix .
anyway , let 's go with the red pill , study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
that second foundation underlies the other 30 percent of the moral statements I 've heard here at TED .
and this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don 't have tribes , we go ahead and make them , because it 's fun .
I mean , we debate over what 's fair , but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter .
suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent @-@ minded and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal .
because liberals like to say , " Fetch ! please . "
( laughter ) You might say , OK , there are differences between liberals and conservatives , but what makes the three other foundations moral ?
aren 't they the foundations of xenophobia , authoritarianism and puritanism ?
all is ordered , all is beautiful , all the people and animals are doing what they 're supposed to be doing , are where they 're supposed to be .
if you 're high in openness to experience , revolution is good ; it 's change , it 's fun .
you have the markings of Vishnu on the left , so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god .
thank you .
I wrote a column in People magazine at the time , talking about the importance of names and how names are our identity .
and that 's the name all of us now use .
and to them , callouts for civility are really very much like what George Orwell wrote in " 1984 " -- he called it " newspeak . "
and I took that to heart , it was very -- The audience was very engaged about that online , as you can imagine .
I 'll call it light and fluffy .
because then , a few months later , he came to my door , my front door , in a rage and tried to break the door down .
they 're incendiary and they do not allow us to find common ground .
when you have a specific word , though , to describe a problem like that , you know you really have a problem .
but therein lies the third rule : Don 't mistake decorum for civility .
so I think civility , with that understanding , is not a dirty word .
thank you .
most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea , at the bottom of the sea .
most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this .
because we see it in bits and pieces right now .
not only that , but on top -- the lifeblood -- that plumbing system turns off every year or so .
is it fragile ? no , it 's not really very fragile .
I 'll end up with saying one thing .
it 's absurd . it 's just absurd .
learn to manage it .
conservation 's tougher , but we can probably get there .
so what made James Baldwin loom so large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities ?
by delivering sermons , he developed his voice as a writer , but also grew conflicted about the Church 's stance on racial inequality and homosexuality .
set in Harlem , the book explores the Church as a source of both repression and hope .
they said , " We don 't know , " or , " Our lawyers won 't let us tell you that , " though we did get a lot of information .
these pricing variations existed for all the procedures and all the cities that we surveyed .
a San Francisco contributor saved nearly 1,300 dollars by putting away his insurance card and paying cash .
there are a lot of people who are going to in @-@ network hospitals and getting out @-@ of @-@ network bills .
and then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man .
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
somebody once said , Al Qaeda does not have a return address , so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon , what 's the response , and to whom is the response ?
it becomes very portable .
you can 't get an exact number for that kind of probability , but what I 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
we can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things . "
once you 're out and evacuating , you want to keep as much of your skin , your mouth and nose covered , as long as that covering doesn 't impede you moving and getting out of there .
and this is a real crisis for them .
now , the end product of that action is up on the board here .
Richard Wurman : that 's the end ! Keith Bellows : yeah , yeah .
no .
leathery chest pads that beat the heat .
" camels are like angels , " a Bedouin once said .
it 's kind of an inspiring statement , and I 'll go back at the end of this .
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
and it turns out to not be very hard .
so the idea of -- this technology actually may end up putting books back in people 's hands again .
now let 's go for audio , and I 'm going to go through these .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
and we 've got , now , a lot of these materials .
so books , music , video , software . there 's only 50,000 titles of it .
you still with me ? ( laughter ) I called her up .
when Lexus wants to sell you a car , they 're telling you a story .
we went from Havana , Cuba to Decatur , Georgia .
I called my mother , and she said , " Carmen , I need you to come , please .
that 's why they call them that .
( laughter ) This is her ensemble .
" Mommy , I know you have been stopped . "
" I did not get a ticket . "
this is new and fast , just so you -- are you still with us ?
she wields great power .
Don 't you want to look ?
this is the USDA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
and why can they serve that much ?
now I don 't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets , but I 'm sure you 're rich if you did .
well , Tyson did , because there 's no chicken in the chicken .
there 's a lot of stuff we can do . there 's a lot of schools doing farm @-@ to @-@ school programs . there 's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools .
this is available on my website in English and Spanish , and it 's a visual way to talk to kids about food .
we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference .
most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child .
and if we 're going to change it , and change how we feed kids , we really have to rethink that .
so , public and private partnerships , advocacy groups , working with foundations .
we really need to change it .
these are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up , because they haven 't had lunch .
and , you know , I 'm not that better off now .
but we really have to educate .
I think if we 're going to fix this , one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program .
instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA , I think it should be under CDC .
that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools , 80 to 90 cents . in L.A. , it 's 56 cents .
you know what ? we should be ashamed .
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .
but then , they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him , but he never told the son .
and he goes , " Oh , this is great , this is great . "
it wasn 't going anywhere toward , you know , saying what the gene was ; it was just nuclear science . and oh , that 's the book , little book .
we rushed over to the chemistry department and said , " Could Pauling be right ? " and Alex Hust said , " No . " so we were happy .
it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule , and then how do you go from RNA to protein ?
and then you go to these toy companies and there 's some guy across the table , and he goes , " Pass . pass . pass . "
and , you know , I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time .
and there 's Furby on the half shell .
so my wife says , " Well , you may like it , but nobody else will . "
and she does drawings , right ?
and then she started doing these other images .
I actually went to Toys " R " Us , got a little furry cat , ripped it apart and made this .
he 'd -- you can tickle him . when I put my hand up , " Ha , ha , ha , ha " and that 's how we sold him .
and I started working with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that .
and then they looked like little Garfields there .
so full circle -- why do I do this ?
and the picture from the book , so when I -- I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern , whatever you can to copy that .
there 's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue .
so you hire artists , and you try to get the look and feel of the character .
and then , four years and 10 million dollars later , we have a little Pleo .
but they have 40 sensors all over their body .
they 're just cute , right ? that 's the idea , that 's the idea .
so you see -- hey , come on . Hey , did you feel that ?
( laughter ) That 's good , wake up , wake up , wake up .
now these are not robots , they 're kind of lovebots , you know .
and you let a few million of them out at a time .
and whatever you do , don 't read anything about genetics that 's published within your lifetime , or something .
you know , there 's about 400 different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions .
let 's see if you can get this one .
you 've got to convey passion .
next : knowledge .
I don 't know who the players are , what the market is like . "
you 've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it , or else you can .
there 's never been a venture @-@ funded company where bad things didn 't happen .
the best way to do this is to look at our betters , people who have done this before .
I want to know the size of the market . why is this market worth getting at ?
there 's never been a company with no competition , even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
and when we think of why people do not get involved , why they do not become activists , it 's often that people are so worn down with their own familial responsibilities , and women especially .
just remember that , when we think about what we 're doing .
so , one day , while we were sitting in the office , a farm worker comes in .
so , Leticia Prado is an immigrant from Mexico , only has a sixth @-@ grade education and speaks very limited English .
then she looked into all of the finances of the water district and found there was 250,000 dollars missing from their bank account .
and I want to share this with you . Coretta Scott King said , " We will never have peace in the world until women take power . "
after World War II , when Japan and Germany were devastated after the war , United States of America gave many tax dollars to those two countries , so that they can rebuild their economies and rebuild their corporations .
they 're 11 million citizens .
so , how do we make this happen ?
we had the Women 's March in the United States .
thank you very much .
the australopithecines evolved into the genus Homo and eventually modern humans -- us .
with these new fossil finds , we realize we now have to make changes to this tree .
I first traveled there in 2003 , and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples .
so there was " Hand Land , " for the fossil hand people , " Hip Heaven " for the pelvis ...
and if we had only recovered the skull , we might have called it one thing ; if we had only recovered the pelvis , we might have called it another .
as someone who studies teeth , I might argue these are the coolest fossils found at the site .
the deciduous teeth are especially narrow , and the premolars are unique in their outline shape compared to other hominids .
why is there so much morphological variation in the genus Homo ?
and what force is driving that variation ?
who did it evolve from ?
( laughter ) Thank you .
he studied how our process of perception doesn 't just register sensory inputs , but transforms them .
patients suffering from the same mental illnesses also performed similarly , making the test a reliable diagnostic tool .
by the 1960s , it had been officially administered millions of times in the U.S. alone .
employers made prejudiced hiring decisions based on reductive decoding charts .
bringing us one step closer to understanding the patterns behind our perceptions .
this is what happens in people who share half of their DNA -- fraternal twins .
and you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter .
when I wrote a first draft of the book , I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments , and here are some of the reactions that I got : " better get a security camera for your house . "
but what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80 @-@ odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received .
that 's from Robert Brustein , the famous drama critic and director , in The New Republic about five years ago .
what a puzzle -- I wonder why .
someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on . I won 't comment on that .
I 'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they 'll grow up to be healthy adults .
and he told me that he would go to his work every morning with a paper bag with his lunch and one cigar .
that one cigar was the only luxury he could afford for himself .
and after lunch , he would have that one cigar .
and the professionals know how to do their professional work in a way that it fits in a natural way in the life of our residents .
to do things differently than we always have done in a traditional nursing home .
and I think it 's exactly these kinds of two @-@ sided negotiations that are needed to bring down walls that divide .
it was designed by graphic designer John Hood , a Native American war veteran working for the California Department of Transportation .
the worst thing that 's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters .
so just take a second to freeze this scene in your mind .
the reason why people have that perception has to do with the way stories are covered about dictatorships .
wherever Rustin went , he organized and advocated , and was constantly attuned to the methods , groups , and people who could help further messages of equality .
this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .
I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these , so there 's always a client attached to them .
now , based on what I know about the game of Go , I would 've guessed that it really ought to be on the safe side of that line .
but the fact that it isn 't , and that Google solved this problem , suggests that that line is going to be very dynamic .
that 's something that we should absolutely strive to move toward .
now , basic income is becoming a very important idea .
but also , maybe we can use something from inside the community , something we already had .
" let 's use it and combine it with the rubble of the demolished houses and make building blocks out of it . "
we also need electricity , we need the energy .
we went to community centers -- those are places , you know for whom ?
now , families are approaching us from all around the Gaza Strip .
now I can control my source of energy .
( laughter ) Before we understand how this is possible , it 's important to understand the value of this feat .
aside from running out of space on our phones , we rarely think about our digital footprint .
now , this is very tempting , but I decided to go back and look at the TED website 's very humble beginnings .
each pixel in a black @-@ and @-@ white photo is simply a zero or a one .
and this is what we got back .
we recover our message by sequencing the DNA , and every time data is retrieved , we lose the DNA .
it 's really hard to grasp what 's important today , or what will be important for future generations .
instead of asking the current generation -- us -- what might be important in the future , we could store everything in DNA .
I built a school just for girls so that they can be free from FGM and early marriage .
and she also met adults who already believed in her .
so I came to realize once again , as I did when I needed help to go to university , that while I could dream or have a dream , I could not make it come true all by myself .
President Obama visited Kenya in 2015 , and he met with representatives from organizations trying to help improve communities .
can we cure climate change ?
none of us will see that day , but we must start in the hope that future generations will be able to finish the job .
thank you .
you talked about , we need to do an experiment on this .
that lime is going to get out there .
you can deploy power in a wide range of ways .
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol , for example .
I don 't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to .
some people say that democracy consists basically in elections .
what I want to suggest to you , though , in the next couple of minutes is that there 's also a hopeful response to this .
because they would have done extraordinarily well .
so had they contested a larger number of the seats , they would have done even better .
what does it mean to say that there 's an Islamic democracy ?
I was running against a two @-@ term incumbent , and my opponent ran the classic partisan playbook .
( laughter ) He ran ads on TV that my kids thought made me look like Voldemort , and sent out little gems in the mail , like this .
( laughter ) And so when something like this hits you in a campaign , you have to decide how you 're going to respond , and we had a novel idea .
now , why is that story and that approach so novel ?
over 150 programs had their funding reduced because they could not demonstrate success .
lots of us mayors do that .
( laughter ) He realized that the same approach could be used to all of the problems that his city faced .
so what happens is , when there are leftovers from digestion , they 're being delivered to the inner one first .
I thought that was nice .
but really , it 's more that 10 percent of the nerves that connect brain and gut deliver information from the brain to the gut .
the research we have today is creating a new definition of what real cleanliness is .
96 percent of all fish species died during the Hangenberg event , 359 million years ago : an interval of fire and ice .
the mighty fell , the meek inherited the earth , and here we are .
the handful of survivors came from many groups -- all greatly outnumbered by their own dead .
as long as a handful of species survive , life will recover .
the versatile and the lucky will not just replace what was lost , but win in new forms .
it just might take several million years .
at the appointed time , you 'll be walking in the yard near the electric fence .
that means that if you lit it from both ends simultaneously , it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds .
but how will you time the last fifteen ?
and this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar .
however , the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective , and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show .
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn 't belong together .
moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago .
but it 's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . and here 's an acoustic shelf .
this feather has enabled birds to conquer gravity and take to the air in an extraordinary way .
birds have been used as brands and labels all over the world .
imagine having a name like " shoebill . "
she said that someone attacked her from behind , told her not to scream , said he had a gun and that she shouldn 't move .
when we hear or read a story like this , we immediately visualize it : the rapist , a depraved lower @-@ class man .
and the victim , a young , attractive woman .
the following is the testimony of a woman I 'll call " Ana . "
at a stoplight , he told me he liked me and touched my leg .
how did you feel listening to this story ?
and then doubts , questions and suspicion will creep in .
so to protect ourselves from the discomfort , we have an option .
it means she consented .
no disrespect , Finland .
in the 2015 PISA -- Program for International Student Assessment -- Vietnam outperformed many wealthy economies , including the United States .
now , if you 're not an education expert , you may ask , " What 's new and different ?
now , improving current education systems to deliver results is important , but won 't be enough .
Filipe and a fellow student were the only two attending grade 11 in 2015 .
it 's four and a half times the size of Germany , and it 's fully covered in jungle and rivers .
you have specialized , trained content teachers in Manaus delivering classroom via livestream to over a thousand classrooms in those scattered communities .
now , why is this division between content teacher and tutoring teacher important ?
but secondly also because teachers do too many things they 're either not trained for or not supposed to do .
it teaches us how we can harness technology for learning .
and we know technology is not always perfect .
you 're going to say , " How are we going to implement this all over the world ? "
if you wanted to borrow money to build a bridge or a road , it 's quite easy and straightforward , but not for education .
that 's kind of a longer term commitment .
quality education for all : that 's the freedom fight that we 've got to win .
but wildfire smoke ?
that option is actually not on the table .
you know , that might be something to consider , but that 's a distant threat .
now , artificial intelligence has started bolstering their business as well .
that 's why you see it in every supermarket .
what if the system that we do not understand was picking up that it 's easier to sell Vegas tickets to people who are bipolar and about to enter the manic phase .
now , the problem isn 't solved if he doesn 't publish it , because there are already companies that are developing this kind of technology , and a lot of the stuff is just off the shelf .
this is not very difficult anymore .
the ProPublica reporter spent about 30 dollars to target this category .
this simple tweak .
this isn 't " 1984 . "
so Facebook 's market capitalization is approaching half a trillion dollars .
now , don 't get me wrong , we use digital platforms because they provide us with great value .
and that 's the core of the problem .
so what can we do ?
in this context , it means that we are the product that 's being sold .
once on , the transporter worked best when I didn 't touch it .
it 's all about the question , " What if ? "
everybody saw it , all over the world .
it was a 10 by 10 cell .
it was perhaps eight feet tall , 40 feet long , and 10 feet wide .
they were barefoot , and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile .
but it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating -- that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood .
'it 's a simple life , but nobody is restricting you .
this is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera , little more than a stick @-@ and @-@ mud hut next to a garbage heap .
this is home improvement : putting plastic tarps on your roof .
this is in Rio de Janeiro , and it 's getting a bit better , right ?
and then you finally get squatter homes like this , which is built on the suburban model .
so , that 's a restaurant .
that does not necessarily mean property rights , and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question , because property rights create a lot of complications .
there 's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don 't work in these cases , but they do need security of tenure .
and they need access to politics , and that can mean two things .
look , failure and imperfection are basically the same thing .
nothing and nobody is perfect .
the true illness in our society today is our unwillingness to confront failure .
and when everybody gets a prize , everybody advances , or everybody gets a pay raise despite results , the perfectionist in all of us is left to wonder , what do I have to do to get better ?
for example : do you have a place to stay tonight ?
( laughter ) I couldn 't pick a career .
so I brought a picture with big hair .
I just want to get that out of the way .
( laughter ) And -- you see the picture at the bottom ?
the reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it .
you had this same thing in America , it was called the Timex Sinclair1000 .
they started making their own video games .
he 's a multi @-@ millionaire , and I think that 's why he 's smiling in this photograph .
some of the highlights were things like " The Terminator , " " Aladdin , " the " Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles . "
I personally preferred the Spanish version , which was " Tortugas Ninja . "
he didn 't actually buy anything , just some data .
this is happening in your local cities too , you 're probably just not aware of it .
so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
without it , the problems faced in the real world -- poverty , war , disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should .
a well @-@ designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience .
I know violent video games make my mother worry .
( applause ) DP : wow .
who is that going to come from ?
he 's out of time .
DP : I 've just got a little tiny bit more if you 'll indulge me .
the woman , let 's call her " V , " was beaten for over 50 minutes before she died .
one minute and 20 seconds .
more and more , we fear that we can 't win this .
( laughter ) When we play , others want to join .
you see , assigning a letter to my father , a letter to my son , " If I knew then what I know now ... "
the judge CANNOT be perceived to be favoring one side over the other .
( laughter ) You see , once people understand the question , they can give you valuable information that allows the court to make meaningful decisions about the cases that are before them .
versus , " You can read and write , can 't you ? "
( laughter ) Because the reality is that when the court behaves differently , then naturally people respond differently .
I would totally support his right to use the men 's bathroom .
and not just because the gender I was assigned at birth mismatches the one I really am .
there are dozens of different gender @-@ affirming surgeries from chest surgeries to bottom surgeries to facial feminization and man @-@ sculpting .
( laughter ) The truth is we trans people are so much more scared of you than you are of us .
his eyes were open and he was looking at me , and I said , " Hi , Dad ! "
so I fell over and I sat there with him because for the first time in a long time he seemed kind of OK .
nobody was productive .
and I think it kind of does , because as you 've heard , as the sea levels come up , it takes weaker and weaker storms to do something like this .
so now we have too much , too little , wrong place , wrong time .
it 's a place called Svalbard .
but cities have a dark side .
what you see here is a map that shows sea level rise in relation to changes in temperature .
see , the Brazilian government , from the national to the state to the municipal level , has also introduced a whole range -- a lattice -- of parks and protected areas .
how ?
ICLEI , UCLG , Metropolis -- these are the movements of the future .
they 're problem @-@ solvers .
thank you .
in both Chinese and Native folk , I sense this inherent sound of longing and holding onto the past , an emotion that greatly drives the music I create today .
at the time , I wondered if I could make this feeling of immersion even more powerful , by layering visuals and music -- visuals and images on top of the music .
in my father 's words , " Being Native is not about wearing long hair in braids .
brother number one replied .
in contrast , the US budget for our National Endowment for the Arts , the largest single funder for the arts across the United States , is merely 146 million dollars .
the arts brings meaning to life .
on one side you have institutions and people with money .
and I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days .
and I thought , well , this is the power of a city .
if they did , it probably was right there at Ground Zero .
so I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well , and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now .
now , they 're more innovative -- well , Google 's pretty innovative -- but there are some new twists on this .
that 's not necessarily something we didn 't know already .
( laughter ) I also did -- and I don 't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection .
now our theory of case management is : anything necessary to keep them housed . "
it recognizes the complexities of the different factors that can shape a human life .
when he couldn 't afford canvases , he fashioned them out of discarded wood he found on the street .
when the protons reach their maximum speed , they shoot out onto a target that contains a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen @-@ 18 .
in the 13th Century , Genghis Khan embarked on a mission to take over Eurasia , swiftly conquering countries and drawing them into his expanding Mongol Empire .
in early spring , these frozen pools begin to melt , supplying villagers with irrigation for their fields .
I was visiting this birth center in the north of India .
and if that doesn 't work , you give them breaths with the baby mask .
I didn 't meet anybody who hadn 't been part of thousands of deliveries .
it 's how good you 're going to be that really matters .
it presses on a fundamental question .
you have to put all of the checklist together to achieve the substantial reductions in mortality .
and she got back a green , thick liquid , and within a minute of being able to do that and suctioning out over and over , that baby started to breathe .
and five minutes after that , she was pink and warming on her mother 's chest , and that mother reached out to grab that nurse 's hand , and they could all breathe .
that essence of storytelling is never going to change .
I wasn 't bringing in a bunch of actors who looked very different from one another simply because I was trying to make a point , and I wasn 't trying to do anything special .
we 'll see what happens .
but part of me also gets it completely .
we have this show that 's about politics gone mad , and basically the way we 've always told the show -- you know , everybody pays attention to the papers .
obviously British television is always amazing and always does interesting things .
I was at the International Emmys and looking around and seeing the stuff that they were showing , and I was kind of fascinated .
to what extent do you think you will use your storytelling in the real world to effect change ?
please help me thank Shonda . SR : thank you .
and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other , is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age .
and his great friend Speed went to his side and said , " Lincoln , you must rally or you will die . "
( laughter ) So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales .
it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family , without work , could not fill it .
but he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story .
when you are brought up as a Catholic , you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church , you 'll be struck dead at the threshold .
he said , " No problem . it wasn 't a religious service . "
for the ambivert , you 're involved in all of it .
for the extroverts , I want to say that when you 're planning a campaign , think about introverts .
did you ever imagine that ?
AGF : absolutely not .
she said , " No , it 's serious .
this was a time when cultures , religions -- they were talking to each other .
( applause ) AGF : virtual or otherwise .
I mean , if you 're a scientist , you tend to really look at the perfection of the human body , the way it functions .
I read that when you were a very young girl , you went to a career guidance counselor and told them you wanted to become a chemist , and they said , " No , it 's for boys .
and if we want to move along the line for them to become great scientists , they need to become more and more curious in everything they do .
the new thing now is that computers can find their own rules .
and back in the day , I hired the world 's best software engineers to find the world 's best rules .
ca : and so , you 've also got an example , I think , of how the actual learning part takes place .
what you see here is the machine learning version of it .
ca : I mean , that 's incredible .
and we are . we are creative .
now , that to me means the next 150 years will find more things .
it 's a bit scary , I know .
that was fantastic . ( applause )
this lets you stay afloat while you wait to paddle for a wave .
wind blowing across the ocean accelerates water particles near the surface , leading to the growth of ripples that become waves .
at the same time , your increased forward momentum makes you more stable , allowing you to stand up and surf along the wave .
sometimes , the curl might completely enclose part of the wave , forming a moving tube of water known as the barrel .
( music ) ( Beatboxing ) Thank you .
after months of strategic planning and controversy , thousands of women gathered in Washington D.C.
as a disenfranchised group , women had no voice in the laws that affected their- or anyone else 's- lives .
that brought the total number of states which recognized a women 's right to vote to four .
a new , media @-@ savvy spirit arrived in the form of Alice Paul .
however , in planning the parade , Paul mainly focused on appealing to white women from all backgrounds , including those who were racist .
floats came in the form of golden chariots ; an enormous Liberty Bell ; and a map of enfranchised countries .
the police did not intervene , and in the end , over 100 women were hospitalized .
the world is awash with divisive arguments , conflict , fake news , victimhood , exploitation , prejudice , bigotry , blame , shouting and minuscule attention spans .
it can sometimes seem that we are doomed to take sides , be stuck in echo chambers and never agree again .
I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours , a tool that you might not expect : abstract mathematics .
and then at the top , we have 30 , which is a product of three prime numbers -- two times three times five .
and each of those arrows shows losing one of your numbers in the set .
here we have white male people .
and there are many things we can learn from this diagram , I think .
the first is that each arrow represents a direct loss of one type of privilege .
we can all use these abstract structures to help us pivot between situations in which we are more privileged and less privileged .
but I also understand that I am probably among the most privileged of nonwhite people , and this helps me pivot between those two contexts .
I 'm not as rich as the kind of people who don 't have to work .
rates of suicide in the US alone increased by 25 percent across the last two decades .
every flaw , every unforeseen setback increases a need to perform more perfectly next time , or else , bluntly , you 're a failure .
or , more precisely , perfecting an imperfect self .
every time that D lashed out , I kept thinking to myself : what did I miss during my principal prep coursework ?
in education , we tend to always look outside the box for answers , and we rarely spend enough time , money and effort developing what we already have inside the box .
our partnership with our local Nationwide Children 's Hospital afforded us -- they 're building us a health clinic within our school , providing health and mental health resources for our students .
teachers are typically good at planning for and delivering academic instruction , but when you throw in disruptive behavior , it can feel completely outside the scope of the job .
it wasn 't easy , but we felt at heart , it was a positive way to make change , and I 'm in awe at the teachers that took that leap with me .
( laughter ) I saw teachers say , " What happened to you ? "
and what I discovered was that many of them exhibit the same behaviors that I saw in six @-@ year @-@ old D.
then came the day when I realized my mistake .
but the data didn 't look like a planet .
we gave our discovery its name : synestia .
what is hidden from my view by my own assumptions ?
she was everything we were expecting according to the literature , to the research , right down to she was a single mom driven to trade , supporting her kids .
so what overturned our assumptions ?
this is Teresia , the invisible one , the hidden middle .
so the problem turned out that it wasn 't the criminalization ; you can 't really criminalize someone you 're charging receipts from .
even here in this hotel , the invisible ones -- the butchers , the bakers the candlestick makers -- they make the machines that make your french fries and they make your beds .
I could no longer go to school , see my friends or even eat out , because my tics would attract the attention of everyone in the room .
instead , she diagnosed me with an incurable neurological disorder , Tourette syndrome .
we tried drug after drug to find something that would bring me some sort of relief .
but imagine if there were a way to treat these conditions without a price or without side effects .
( TIC ) Very soon , and rather unknowingly , I became an addict of this newfound drug .
we see this everywhere .
we could blame Hollywood for that .
algorithms are being used all the time to make decisions about who we are and what we want .
and now , it 's screening out female candidates .
that 's not it .
they all have two things in common : one , they can never get my name right , and second , they are all female .
you can probably guess where this is going , right ?
less racist robots , less machines that are going to take our jobs -- and more about what technology can actually achieve .
so , yes , some of the energy in the world of AI , in the world of technology is going to be about what ads you see on your stream .
first , I hope you leave thinking about bias today .
this is a European society with literate records , so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation .
and it describes the same effortless , spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state .
for instance , this is another student of mine , Susan Jackson from Australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world .
and once the conditions are present , what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake .
in 1970 , Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson , two veterans of Stonewall , established STAR : street transvestite Action Revolutionaries .
but what 's rarely mentioned is that included in this massive pile are works from the Institute for Sexual Research .
when the blog is active it heals itself within seconds .
that makes it seems like you 're doomed to keep creating obtuse angles .
imagine squaring off the outside of a pizza , so that instead of a circle , it 's an octagon .
this is what we call peer review .
it 's not that special .
this is the last place in the universe you would expect to find a planet , but they had very methodically looked at this pulsar , and they detected the gravitational tug of this planet as it orbited the pulsar .
by the clothes that we wear and the makeup that we put on .
yeah , I guess those hoodies that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley are just so provocative .
( applause ) So how do we go about getting our power back ?
time Magazine calls it , right there on the screen , " The teeny tiny little print in contracts that keeps sexual harassment claims unheard . "
and here 's what I tell the Senators : sexual harassment is apolitical .
" keep it together , " you say to yourself , but you can 't .
or imagine every time you go out , and you 're in crowded places , you feel this panic starting to arise .
this actually used to be a cornfield nine months ago , and with the Rwandan government , we leveled it and built this center in a couple weeks .
and from the moment it leaves the end of the launcher , it 's completely autonomous .
let me give you an example .
and they can totally leapfrog over the absence of legacy infrastructure to go straight to newer and better systems .
they run the world 's only automated delivery system operating at national scale .
and the jobs that these kids may have gotten 10 years ago are largely being automated or are being changed dramatically by technology .
so why aren 't there more start @-@ ups that are tackling these global problems that are faced by billions of people in developing economies ?
and they 'll say , " Oh , it 's a sky ambulance . "
we have exactly one employee , and that employee is our lead software developer .
every single change on the site goes to the " Recent changes " page .
there 's a " new pages feed , " for example , so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it 's created .
when somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone , an anonymous IP number , made an edit to my page .
there 's no reason to have a big argument about it .
and so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page .
this is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue .
it just isn 't appropriate .
of course , because of the free licensing , if I do a bad job , the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave -- I can 't tell anyone what to do .
Jimmy , you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia 's success .
and the storyline is , there 's this crazy thing , Wikipedia , but academics hate it and teachers hate it .
( laughter ) But I think there 's going to be huge impacts .
if we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral , we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question .
the main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle , and we 're almost certain it will .
so the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two @-@ dimensional space .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
and we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we 'll see when experiments reach higher energies .
they sit on top of one another in the standard charge space .
but I also greatly enjoy the company of hyperintelligent people .
your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi : I 'm used to coral .
I mean , is there a scale to it , at the smallest scale , or ... ?
eventually they moved from the fringes of our communities into our homes , becoming humanity 's first domesticated animal .
humanity 's longest experiment in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well .
not only can canines understand our emotions and body language , but when dogs and humans interact , both our bodies release oxytocin ; a hormone commonly associated with feelings of love and protectiveness .
and it 's heartening to know that given enough time , even our most dangerous rivals can become our fiercest friends .
this causes the plates to spread very slowly , at anywhere from 1 to 20 centimeters per year .
unfortunately , phones might not be able to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols .
we have a sample from a patient .
but the girl was now diagnosed with a severe infection of deadly bacteria .
so when I saw these results that weren 't even validated , I didn 't dare to tell because treating a patient without an actual infection also has negative consequences for the patient .
I 'm showing to you different sections of the show right now , just to give you a taste of it .
so they 're working on enhancing everything : touch , smell -- everything they can , in order to find the perfect mate .
so , we 'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future .
one of the most important topics of the show -- you know , as anything in our life today , we can look at it from many , many different viewpoints , and at different levels .
you see here the work of Ben Fry . this is " Human vs. Chimps " -- the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps .
it takes seven days today to manufacture a chair , but you know what ? one day it will take seven hours .
Elio Caccavale : he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia .
it 's quite amazing how these things can make you smile , can make you laugh , can make you cry sometimes .
pollinator decline is a grand challenge in the modern world .
so in order to explain what 's actually been saving bees , where they 're thriving , I need to first tell you what 's been killing them .
that 's not the case .
we moved on .
but we didn 't know how to test this .
we 're finding out now that in rural areas , there are 150 plants on average in a sample of honey .
one hour .
it can also function as a little power station .
she was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother , and they were talking about the novel , " Dune . "
( laughter ) Three : there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe .
she was smiling .
( laughter ) And even now , a decade and a half later , even now that we are married , I look for her still , whenever she is not in the room .
we can have any experience that we want , but feel nothing .
my company , Artichoke , which I cofounded in 2006 , was set up to create moments .
and yet , a year later , persuasion , negotiation -- everything I could deploy -- saw me producing the work .
I backed away .
it was our first show .
and every summer , they burn them .
and we put it in this place where everyone told me nobody would come .
( music ) Thank you .
so in the two years since that launch -- California / Alabama Project -- we 've gone on to host dialogues and partnerships with media organizations across the country .
it is a deeply unhappy state of being .
huge range of conversations .
he 's present in my marriage to Matthew , because Aaron 's life and love and death made me the person that Matthew wanted to marry .
so , I met Matthew , my current husband -- who doesn 't love that title , ( Laughter ) but it 's so accurate .
they are just strands to the same thread .
you know , when you get , actually to this town it has reality .
but if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern , beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this .
and , you know , this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because , like sunglasses , it conceals and reveals at the same time .
so , this session 's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour 's really partly about meaning .
I mean , look how happy the people are , and good @-@ looking too .
and it 's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor .
and here 's Hedy Lamarr .
so she 's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn 't stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
a colleague calls this " serving a life sentence 30 days at a time . "
the other is a letter to the inmate with specific suggestions for how to manage themselves .
for example , if our test result suggests that a probationer has a hard time remembering the things they hear , that would be an auditory memory deficit .
and he writes , " Can you tell me what you think of all the head traumas I 've dealt with ?
I just have to work a lot harder at it . " ( laughs ) And here 's Thomas .
this is my good friend and colleague Judge Brian Bowen .
( applause ) This program shows us the overwhelming prevalence of traumatic brain injuries and cognitive deficits and the accumulation of brokenness in the criminal justice system .
all told , in this program , these inmates and probationers come to see themselves differently .
and yet , look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold .
and you get all the disease @-@ protective substances .
you find them , for example , in fish oil .
bad fats are things like trans @-@ fatty acids in processed food and saturated fats , which we find in meat .
so , yes , you can lose weight , but your heart isn 't happy .
an optimal diet is low in fat , low in the bad carbs , high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats .
we all know that in childhood , boys tend to be taller than girls , but go into any elementary school classroom , and you 'll find some girls who are taller than some boys .
and it can be labor @-@ intensive , it 's sometimes costly .
but again , just like school @-@ based initiatives , this is hard work .
we spend over a 100 billion dollars -- billion with a " B " -- in this country every year on the treatment of heart disease .
what makes this disease so deadly ?
this leaves the patient with a deficit in the amount of heart muscle that they have .
so when I talk to people about this problem , I often get a shrug and a statement to the effect of , " Well , you know , Chuck , we 've got to die of something . "
the first is they can divide like crazy .
so I can take a single cell , and in a month 's time , I can grow this up to billions of cells .
OK , so now we were finally ready to begin animal experiments .
so if we could do eight points in the clinic , I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact on human health .
little do they know it , but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death .
the sundew 's tiny leaves are equipped with a viscous secretion called mucilage .
but in that case , if the maturing brain is to blame , then why are teens more vulnerable than children , even though their brains are more developed than those of children ?
in short , I wanted to conduct a research study to answer one big question : why do teens keep making outrageous choices that are harmful to their health and well @-@ being ?
can positive risk @-@ taking escalate with repeated exposures ?
I turned around to a tall , broad @-@ shouldered man , pure hate in his eyes .
and I began to think about what I could potentially offer to build safety and power for women .
and we mean those words .
and for that to happen , we need all hands on deck .
so I 've given you my secret recipe , and now it 's up to you .
Halla T√≥masd√≥ttir : I think it 's a crisis of conformity when we continue to do business and lead in the way we always have , yet the evidence is overwhelming that the world needs us to change our ways .
so let 's look a little bit at that evidence .
in the UK , three percent of people trust their government to solve the Brexit crisis , and that was in December .
so at The B Team , we embrace sustainability , equality and accountability as our principles .
can you talk about that ?
HT : well , yes , I think hubris is our cancer in leadership .
BF : well , we have a lot of people here who I bet have questions for you , and we have a few minutes for questions , so is there anybody that would like to ask Halla a question ?
HT : well , thank you very much for that fantastic question .
and I want to tell you this story because I think we need to remember that sometimes the stories we tell each other are more than just tales or entertainment or narratives .
and that 's to say nothing of his idea of a goose machine that could go to the Moon .
and note , by the way , that word " habitable . "
so , that 's the stage out of all this . I find , for reasons I don 't understand , I really do have a goal .
let me just rush very quickly through things that we 've done .
in 1981 , it flew 163 miles from Paris to England , solely on the power of sunbeams , and established a basis for the Pathfinder .
it 's amazing : just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane , you 're able to get it up there .
there he 's the project manager . anything they do is certainly a team effort . he ran this program . here 's ...
Oh , that was only a minute , but I think you 'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight , perhaps .
all right .
OK , here we go .
OK .
every 25 years I do a picture . here 's the one -- tries to show that the world isn 't getting any bigger .
if you look at the other robots in the competition , their movements also still look , well , very robotic .
HASELs are gentle enough to pick up a raspberry without damaging it .
and with a large weight , you get a large contraction .
if you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph , television , radio , telephone were adopted in decades .
we 'd like to actually turn that program off .
the price performance , bandwidth , capacity of communications measured many different ways ; wired , wireless is growing exponentially .
the most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions .
it turns out that we can understand it .
my main message is that progress in technology is exponential , not linear .
if you really look at the power of exponential growth , you 'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand .
so we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems .
the next day , one wrist signal was flat and the other had the biggest peak I 've ever seen , and I thought , " What 's going on ?
how can you be stressed on one side of your body and not the other ?
Hey , do you have any idea what happened to him ? "
we 've had people whose hair stands on end on one arm 20 minutes before a seizure . "
he explained how this could happen in the brain , and he got interested . I showed him the data .
these three seizures you see here are popping out of the forest like redwood trees .
I think I turned white reading this email .
the energy used to power the contraction comes from a molecule called ATP .
many muscles grow with exercise , and larger muscles also have bigger stores of ATP and a higher capacity to clear waste , pushing fatigue even farther into the future .
let 's imagine a new coffee company that decides to launch on the market .
this see @-@ saw of supply and demand is influenced by many factors .
with the dawn of the Internet , everyday investors can buy stocks in many of the exact same ways a large investor would .
so we use executive function every day in all aspects of our lives .
we 're not going to play the color game anymore .
think of climate change , it can feel so big , that not a single one of us could make a difference .
and once we all recognize that shared vulnerability , that gives us the power to open our eyes , to see what 's in front of us and to act before we get trampled .
but Troy 's mannerisms -- they reveal the patterns of someone who is scared , troubled and unsure of the future .
now , I don 't know if Troy 's dreams came true .
actress Lena Dunham may be the media 's representation of this generation , but Troy and other voices like his are also part of the story .
and honestly , that 's really just the beginning .
this is a really great thing , a really positive step .
she is , like , everything .
millennials make up 27 percent of the world 's population .
but I want to make it clear -- I want to make it really clear to everyone that just because things look more equal than they did in the 20th century , doesn 't mean that things are equitable at all .
and just a few days after my 17th birthday , that mission completely failed .
this is possible if we do the work .
ca : that 's an amazing story , thank you .
KB : thanks for letting me show these .
painted with squirrel @-@ hair brushes on vellum or parchment by monks , nuns , and urban craftspeople , these bizarre images populate the margins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages .
some artists even painted themselves into the manuscripts .
they appreciate competition , they love effective communication .
more parents were divorced in this generation than any generation prior .
they 're incredibly pragmatic , they 're hopeful and they 're determined .
they might be a little bit idealistic sometimes , but in just the last several years , we 've seen millennials overtake Generation X to be the most represented generation in the workforce .
and " Why baby boomers have ruined it for everybody . "
I 've been spending some time thinking about this and researching this , and fellow researchers and I aren 't exactly sure that these generations are real .
and in fact , if we can agree that these groups even exist , we certainly don 't agree who belongs in them .
at least when it comes to things happening outside of work .
pick a person , just one , and explore their onlyness .
" CAT . "
these are when .
so , the guy replies , " Yeah , I know , I know .
hell , ponytail alone .
the blood moving through your arteries .
that 's different from being random .
another important characteristic of turbulence is the different scales of motion that these flows display .
inertia is the tendency of fluids to keep moving , which causes instability .
for example , the motion of the atmosphere is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the earth 's rotation .
other scientists think that the phenomenon is so complex that such a full @-@ fledged theory isn 't ever going to be possible .
Keith Schacht : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
( laughter ) Come on up . tell everybody your name .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
( laughter ) All right , well thanks for coming up .
( applause ) So what 's the significance of this dry liquid ?
you can circulate it to draw the heat away .
ZK : for example , you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist , but doesn 't use a buckle .
KS : so that was the six we had for you today , but I hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
in front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward .
your girl is here .
thank you .
and I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex @-@ combatants , as they like to be called .
for the rocketeers in the audience : I love what you 're doing , I admire the guts , I admire the courage -- but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction .
well , it 's the relative importance .
this is the envelope , and this is the gondola , the payload .
and this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
he has a spider B & amp ; B at work ... "
in fact , we have known for a long time that 90 percent of smokers start smoking cigarettes prior to the age of 18 .
teens who use tobacco products are more likely to use marijuana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety as a teen or as an adult .
blue and purple combine to make red eggs .
the Cuddly that hatches is sure to make your 6 @-@ year @-@ old as happy as can be .
the trick lies in a phenomenon known as total internal reflection .
so I 'm going to start with why we should .
so , I say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone , robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation .
the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
so we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : OK . I don 't know if there 's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Audience : species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
so , it 's not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags .
you know , as Chris mentioned , I wrote a book called " The Wisdom of Crowds . "
and what 's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations .
a network is not just the product of its component parts .
perpetrators ejaculated on images of me , took photos of their sperm and penises on these images and posted them onto porn sites .
I hadn 't heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , " God , who 's saying what I 'm thinking ? "
I didn 't .
so if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
so , let 's go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we 've shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
he was a creativity researcher in the ' 60s and ' 70s , and also led the Stanford Design Program .
and in fact , my friend and IDEO founder , David Kelley , who 's out there somewhere , studied under him at Stanford .
I need you to turn that piece of paper over ; you should find that it 's blank on the other side .
and I want you to pick somebody that 's seated next to you , and when I say , go , you 've got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor , OK ?
he got exactly the same response : lots and lots of sorry 's .
but as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed .
and I 'm going to run a little experiment . another little experiment .
now , what I 'm going to do is , I 'm going to see how -- I can 't see out of these , OK .
( laughter ) There we go .
( laughter ) Thank you , thank you , thank you .
( laughter ) Well , they 're still coming in from the back there ; they 're still coming in .
I 'd better clear these up out of the way ; otherwise , I 'm going to trip over them .
so , ah , that was fun .
but why is it important ?
we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions .
helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
now , an adult encountering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can , you know .
life 's complicated ; we want to figure out what 's going on around us very quickly .
I suspect , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categorize new things very , very quickly .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stripy thing : is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us ?
we need to figure that out pretty fast .
any parents of young kids in the audience ? there must be some .
so what I 'm going to do is , I 'm going to give you minute , and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form .
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible .
anybody know what this is ? it 's the peyote cactus .
he gave each of them some mescaline , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
and somehow that seems wrong .
they were exploring following what was interesting to them .
they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War , I think , and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .
now , that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh .
they were meeting with them ; they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device .
the prototyping carts , filled with colored paper and Play @-@ Doh and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean , they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .
so we do quite a lot of work at IDEO trying to convince our clients of this .
another way for us , as designers , to explore role @-@ play is to put ourselves through an experience which we 're designing for , and project ourselves into an experience .
so when a kid dresses up as a firefighter , you know , he 's beginning to try on that identity .
I will show it to you .
so I put it through a G.C. , a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office , and it 's about 400 .
it 's not really true .
these are the five atoms from which just about everything that you 're going to smell in real life , from coffee to fragrance , are made of .
why doesn 't it smell of potatoes or violets ? well , there are really two theories .
like , at no concentration , even pure , you know , if you smelt pure ethanol , it doesn 't smell of rotten eggs .
now , I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology , and he says , " That 's easy ! the things are a different color ! "
if you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
the bad news is they 're rocket fuels .
and this is the main objection to the theory .
OK , great , we smell vibrations . how ? all right ?
and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules , related or unrelated , that have the same vibrations .
and the prediction is it should smell of coumarin .
and this is our new baby , called tonkene .
and people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) And people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
this is a new 33 @-@ million @-@ pound college of further education that was mostly funded by the European Union .
and this is the new 77 @-@ million @-@ pound road @-@ improvement scheme , and there 's a new train line , a new railway station , and they 're all being funded by the European Union .
he was fed up with it .
I was like , " What stuff ? "
and this entire referendum took place in darkness , because it took place on Facebook .
and what happens on Facebook stays on Facebook , because only you see your news feed , and then it vanishes , so it 's impossible to research anything .
and he was extraordinarily brave , because the company is owned by Robert Mercer , the billionaire who bankrolled Trump , and he threatened to sue us multiple times , to stop us from publishing .
( applause ) Our parliament has been the first in the world to try to hold you to account , and it 's failed .
democracy is not guaranteed , and it is not inevitable , and we have to fight and we have to win and we CANNOT let these tech companies have this unchecked power .
so , about three years ago I was in London , and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said , I represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
we have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well .
it took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea .
and it 's the first time I 've had a job where I 'm afraid to go away because of everything that 's going to happen in this week when I 'm here .
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
so this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
so it works . but not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe .
now , not only that , but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational .
no matter what any one nation @-@ state does , they will not be able to solve the problem alone .
so we want to incentivize healthy contribution back to the network , and what we believe that is is actually participating in conversation that is healthy , as defined by those four indicators I articulated earlier .
ca : you come over to many , I think to me , as this enigma .
ca : all right .
it took courage .
Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy , and amazingly , genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy .
why no hearings , no denunciations , no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House ? what 's the deal ?
and yet the politicization of Never Again , the operationalization of Never Again , had never occurred in the 20th century .
so that was the 20th century .
it grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur .
evangelicals have joined it . Jewish groups have joined it .
now because it 's student @-@ driven , there 's some amazing things that the movement has done .
and that 's all the Bush administration 's leadership , and it 's all because of this bottom @-@ up pressure and the fact that the phones haven 't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis .
he 's the viceroy . he has to decide on tax policy , on currency , on border patrol , on policing . he has to make all these judgments .
let 's not hype the threat ; let 's actually see it clearly .
ca : so you started capturing huge amounts of data .
and you didn 't really know what you were going to see coming out of this .
this moment .
but it 's actually more complicated than that .
so tell us more about what we 're actually looking at here .
now , we 're too close to really see all the jet structure , but it 's the base of those jets that are illuminating the space @-@ time .
ca : and if you were in a spaceship whirling around that thing somehow , how long would it take to actually go around it ?
there 's something called the -- if I can get wonky for one moment -- the innermost stable circular orbit , that 's the innermost orbit at which matter can move around a black hole before it spirals in .
you 're just going to drift right through that event horizon .
( applause ) It 's the red circle , that 's terrifying .
and if they survive , the reader is left with no feeling of triumph , only cosmic indifference- the terrible sense that we are but insignificant specks at the mercy of unfathomable forces .
today , this shared universe is called the Cthulhu Mythos , named after Lovecraft 's infamous blend of dragon and octopus .
he died unknown and penniless at the age of 46- a victim of the universe 's cosmic indifference .
I came here to give you a science lesson about animal mating systems and why defining monogamy has been a challenge for scientists .
now , " OPP " is a call @-@ and @-@ response song .
audience : yeah , you know me !
now , in the song , the MC hints that it 's a five @-@ letter word , but to keep it rated PG , he simply refers to it as " property . "
that was until the late 1980s , when a new laboratory technique came on the scene , which could copy DNA from a small tissue or fluid sample and decode the genetics of individuals .
now , before that technique , we were never ever certain about , 100 percent , who the parents of baby birds were .
we now call this " serial monogamy . "
( laughter ) And the mechanism responsible ?
" it 's OPP , time for other people 's what you get it there 's no room for relationship , there 's just room to ... "
you down with EPC ?
you know , but for years , I 've been sitting up , and I think my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia .
and often , I 'm driving in a taxi , and I see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I 'd never seen happen before .
color is something that motivates me a lot .
but for the most part , I think , like , how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood ?
how can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ?
so actually , check this out .
so my mother was a little offended , and turned to her and said , " Are you kidding ? they have the greatest life together .
and I kind of try not to look back , you know ?
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot and I work with Mark Morris a lot , who is one of my best friends .
again , I don 't know where inspiration comes from .
there I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
and frankly , I don 't really know what to call myself .
that 's just that .
and I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .
Ro : no , not me , no .
I want to show you this last clip because it 's going to be my last goodbye .
IM : yeah , it is . exactly .
in any day , the cells in your body will collectively accumulate billions of these single @-@ letter swaps , which are also called " point mutations . "
base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe .
two companies I cofounded , Beam Therapeutics and pairwise Plants , are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases and to improve agriculture .
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them ?
so , next time you are really depressed , look in the mirror and you can look and say , hi , I 'm looking at a star here .
it 's a planet somewhat similar to Earth . it 's a little bit smaller , but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth , you know , if you don 't take the oceans into account .
this is one very large crater . geologists love craters , because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it , and you can see what 's below the surface .
so , this is called Victoria Crater , which is about a few football fields in size .
CE : that 's about what happened in the Houston operation room . it 's exactly like this .
so , we wanted to find out , actually , what is that ice made of , and could that have embedded in it some organic , you know , material .
so the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it .
EB : looks kind of like an ice cream cone , more or less .
we no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry , so we jettison the heat shield , exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars .
but that last one percent , as it always seems to be , is the tricky part .
it 's a very scary moment ; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time .
EB : and then it has to light up its engines , right itself , and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely .
BC : Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth .
so by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it 'll already be over .
it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product .
so we have to study all kinds of different materials , the shape that we want to do .
and that 's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one .
but there was something bizarre about it .
and they 're really good at it .
( laughter ) OK , alright . but enough about me .
this is a natural product that is in all plant roots .
why is now a good time to do a biological solution to this problem ?
those are the three traits we want to change : more suberin , more roots , and the last one , deep roots .
OK , so I think this is the science behind the whole thing .
and so when we do the experiments , we can 't actually take a loss in yield , because while we are doing these experiments , say , beginning about 10 years from now , the earth 's population will be even more than it is right now .
plants that are making more carbon , those soils become enriched in carbon .
so , OK .
and the genius of doing that and a solution that can scale where there 's already scale .
but it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the toughest problems we 're facing .
( laughter ) I hardly ever gave money to charity , and when I did , I didn 't feel that warm glow I was expecting .
we know that pleasure reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species , and it looked to me like giving might be one of those behaviors .
the Canadian government allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees .
we saw that the more money people gave to Spread the Net , the happier they reported feeling afterward .
it 's made me see the goodness that exists in our community .
you try without training wheels , I 'll buy you ice cream .
each night , a local business sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal .
let 's take a snapshot at aviation .
well , what did I do when I was a kid ?
solidifying into surface , molded by fire .
water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth .
new forms became bats . Civets .
we can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
( laughter ) And this is my -- ( Laughter ) -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space .
and I 'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist .
the tip of his sword meets a woman 's foot as she attempts to flee the devastation .
but her other leg appears rooted to the spot , locked in the corner of the canvas even as she stretches to move it .
some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a ghostly woman reaching out her window .
hundreds of viewers have grappled with its harsh imagery , shattering symbolism and complex political messaging .
( laughter ) What would they know ?
and I remembered how I couldn 't articulate the anxiety and fear that filled me as I tried to carve my tiny little life into a world that felt far too big for me .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) That was not my point .
( laughter ) Now , I 'm sure there 's quite a few of you who have already identified three ideas .
that 's a 2,000 @-@ foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
( laughter ) The weather station 's pretty interesting .
you need to come up the Lincoln Canyon .
you also see there a bighorn sheep .
you 'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock .
Wat , wait . just hold this for me .
thank you very much .
how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped , and so forth ?
if you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago , there 'd be no evidence of humans at all , because we don 't think there were humans yet .
it 's like you can 't see to the center of the Sun ; you have to use other techniques to know what 's going on inside the Sun .
and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth .
I always think of space @-@ time as being the real substance of space , and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .
it 's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on .
so here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies .
what happens is , you take pictures as the Earth rotates , you get a fan across the sky .
do you see the fan @-@ like scans made across the sky ?
remember , every spot on here is a galaxy , and you see the galaxies , you know , sort of in our neighborhood , and you sort of see the structure .
and you see this thing we call the Great Wall , and you see the complicated structure , and you see these voids .
there 's another survey which is very similar to this , called the Two @-@ degree Field of View Galaxy redshift Survey .
now we 're going to fly through it at warp a million .
how are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that ?
what 's the kind of technique ?
it 's called dark matter .
so the stuff that 's in this picture that 's white , that is the dark matter .
notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern .
there 's a very simple fluid to begin with .
and so from inside , it doesn 't look very complicated , right ?
it 's only when you look at it at a very large scale , and explore it and so forth , you realize it 's a very intricate , complicated kind of a design , right ?
and so here we are .
you see how the filament -- you see how several filaments are coming together , therefore making this Supercluster of galaxies .
and if you could see invisible matter , too .
it started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations , but expanding at a tremendous rate .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
so I 'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .
and you start seeing these networks , this cosmic web of structure forming .
so there it is .
but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form .
and at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger @-@ scale structure .
since then we 've had WMAP , which just gives us higher angular resolution .
and on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth , what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth .
but what we 're hoping when we get to Planck , we 'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth .
and what I found was quite surprising .
we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they 'd been improved , and very simple things turned out .
you 'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water , but it 's actually the opposite .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
and it was quite an experience to be there .
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city , and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away .
it was quite a compelling experience , but not really , I suppose , a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books .
now , just imagine what that $ 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education .
so given that we know and should believe -- because Moore 's Law 's been , like , a constant , I mean , it 's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .
we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 .
we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
in fact , if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that 's a property of carbon fiber also .
and so we begin to see , and we 've seen business plans already , where the kind of things Lisa Randall 's talking about are in there .
new materials that can make water , new materials that can make fuel cells work better , new materials that catalyze chemical reactions , that cut pollution and so on .
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .
and we 've dedicated -- we 've just raised a new fund , we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments .
the third area that we 're working on , and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York .
cocktails , more polyvalent vaccines .
we can 't fight at a million @-@ to @-@ one disadvantage .
today scientists , technologists , businessmen , engineers don 't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions .
our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information .
what I want to do is I want to weave computing , AI and internet as part of us .
as part of human cognition , freeing us to interact with the world around us .
integrate human and machine intelligence right inside our own bodies to augment us , instead of diminishing us or replacing us .
one of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks that we do as human beings .
these sensors pick up on these internal signals sourced deep within the mouth cavity , right from the surface of the skin .
people don 't want to be read , they want to write .
simply by internally asking that question .
what you see on the screen are the words that Eric is speaking to himself right now .
Arnav Kapur : what happened is that the AI sent the answer through audio , through the device , back to Eric .
perhaps a greeting , like , " Hello , how are you ? "
what Doug said that he wanted to use our system for is to reboot the old system he had , because that old system kept on crashing .
there are millions of people who might be able to communicate in real time like Doug , with other people , with their friends and with their families .
( laughter ) Not a lot of people are doing it .
that is until last year , when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur , the coveted French gastronomic prize .
right up to us , like right up to here .
right along the fence line .
radioactive yellow .
bright yellow .
it 's brilliant , right ?
and I say to you , I might not stick to this , but I don 't think I 'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo .
he was right .
and in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes , is this note that says , when asked , what do you think of conventional foie gras ?
the history of foie gras .
mega @-@ farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long @-@ distance travel , food processing .
that 's serendipitous .
we see them on the front of the bus , on the bakery 's facade , on the keyboard we write on , on our cell phones -- everywhere .
now , dealing with an unfamiliar language was at times very frustrating and uncomfortable .
[ no trespassing ! ] I could also tell when something was made to last forever .
after a few days in the city , I was on the lookout for something tasty to take back home .
so I walked and walked and walked until I found the perfect bakery .
let me show you how I work , how I " knead my bread . "
Alice falls in a burrow and begins an absurd journey through a world of fantasy , remember ?
in this situation , the title of the story is my raw material .
I use another sheet of paper to work more comfortably .
I mark some guidelines , delimiting the framework where the words will be .
I always make several sketches , where I 'll try different ideas or change elements .
lots of points and lines playing in the background help me convey that in this story , lots of things happen .
and of course , there 's Alice , looking at her wonderland .
I can say my favorite swear word in a very flowery way and be really corny when I talk about love .
if I couldn 't say it by speaking , this was my way of talking and telling things to the world .
and that 's why I always want them to have shapes that are truly beautiful and exquisite .
telling stories by drawing letters -- that 's my job .
and with that I look for a reaction in the reader , to wake them up somehow , to make them dream , make them feel moved .
currently owned and dominated by two mini dictators , who rule my life with an iron fist while wearing their Huggies diapers .
now , my friends who don 't want kids , all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies .
and yet , despite all this chaos , I still think we should have babies .
I believe we can and should fight for the earth and humanity , side by side .
where there was once hope , now there is convenient space , and good mileage , good mileage .
according to the World Health Organization , we need to average about 2.1 children per woman today just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation .
it seems every generation is indeed connected .
let 's stop in China .
check out some good old @-@ fashioned Chinese propaganda , lovely .
even after ending its one @-@ child policy in 2015 , China 's birth rates have largely declined .
and unlike other countries , it has not been able to replace its population numbers through immigrant workers .
some local governments in Japan have offered couples money to have babies , with the money increasing with each additional child being born .
( laughter ) Let 's take the Delorean to Europe , the continent of delicious cheeses I love to eat but CANNOT pronounce .
he said families where the women have four or more kids will no longer pay income tax .
that 's like buying a brand new Honda Odyssey minivan , OK ?
so , congratulations , you just had a baby , but the baby 's economic productivity is zero , and guess what ?
the United States is the only industrialized country in the world that does not require employers to offer paid parental leave .
( audience gasps ) It has been a challenging week .
but that 's not the reason you have babies .
we 're going to be stuck in the screens with our faces not seeing the world around us ?
and to realize this idea , I need to solve three big challenges .
( low notes changing in pitch ) So in this particular example , the orchid can communicate to you through images and sounds .
so everything can be hacked , and research is important , but the second challenge we have is how can we go from R and D , and prototypes , to real products ?
we worked with my collaborators , who were not engineers .
how can we go from one product to many products ?
I 'm not talking about creating another gadget you get bored with and throw in the back of your drawer and forget about .
now to make this ecosystem possible , we have to avoid fragmentation .
so let me show , for the first time , the real device which we 've built .
that 's what it looks like , and it 's a small device which will be connected to things we want to make smart and connected and interactive .
so when you plug them into different things , like here , the device will recognize where you 're plugging them and then reconfigure itself to enable specific functionality for this particular thing .
and what they 're going to make with them is up to them .
thank you .
to tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
( video ) Man : you know , rather than drive today , I 'm going to walk .
and they lived together happily ever after .
over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky took these questions up in what would become one of the best @-@ known works of Russian literature : " crime and Punishment . "
the experience left him with a far more pessimistic view of social reform , and his focus shifted toward spiritual concerns .
its legitimacy comes not from the outer frame of constitutional rules , but from the inner workings of civic spirit .
and that brings me to my second topic : how we can practice civic religion productively .
we are never asked to reflect on the content of our citizenship .
in the community of Athens , Tennessee , a feisty leader named Whitney Kimball Coe leads hers in an art and framing shop with a youth choir and lots of little flags .
binding ourselves this way actually liberates us .
the " them " is those who don 't .
I know civic religion is not enough to remedy the radical inequities of our age .
we CANNOT unpollute our politics if we clean only downstream .
( laughter ) That means that without sloths , there might be no avocado on toast today , leaving hipsters everywhere totally bereft at breakfast .
you 've got your Bradypus three @-@ toed sloths , they 're the ones with the Beatles haircuts and the Mona Lisa smiles .
this one has fallen asleep mid @-@ move , which is not uncommon .
so they are their own slow @-@ moving , miniature ecosystem .
now , this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery , and there are lots of theories as to why they do it .
she will climb to the top of a tree and scream for sex .
and we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction .
the secret to their success is their slothful nature .
I 'm a pretty speedy character .
a jaguar jumped over the fire pit , but couldn 't carry Tecciztecatl into the sky .
but the fifth world still wasn 't truly established .
a cheery thought .
so one approach we 're taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
that would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
and this is a connection that most people aren 't pursuing right now , but which we 're fascinated by .
you can see the range of the Coast Redwoods . it 's here , in red .
plant this small seed , wait 2,000 years , and you get this : the Lost Monarch .
I became very interested , and I wrote about a couple .
these are millennial structures -- portions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
I have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk .
well , I think they can tell us something about human time .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
you 've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that 's happening , and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .
the myth of the meritocracy is you can earn dignity by attaching yourself to prestigious brands .
the Greeks used to say , " You suffer your way to wisdom . "
she now runs a free pharmacy , she volunteers in the community , she helps women cope with violence , she teaches .
I believe the sky is the limit for what we can do with high @-@ tech tattoos .
I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues , and so I figured I 'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this .
the days of pilot projects are over , when people say , " We 'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works . "
and we 're doing it without a sales @-@ and @-@ marketing team .
and this has been in the press a great deal .
that 's what it is .
the two pieces that are probably notable : it 'll be a mesh network , so when the kids open up their laptops , they all become a network , and then just need one or two points of backhaul .
now , what we 're doing is , we 're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit .
that 's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now .
the games buttons are missing , but it 'll also be a games machine , book machine .
set it up this way , and it 's a television set .
so we 're targeting 50 dollars in 2010 .
are we dreaming ? is this real ?
one is that if you went into space you 'd be able to begin again .
so that 's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible .
it was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility .
we 're very sensitive to that as humans .
generically , what we use the Web for is to organize , exchange , create and consume information .
you are always there with other people .
you know , mapping in India -- that 's such a great example .
so I think that 's another big point .
one of my favorites . I had this feature that I built into Second Life -- I was really passionate about it .
it 's not easy to describe as a demographic .
I wasn 't , like , an obsessed -- you know , get A 's kind of guy .
to accurately identify an illness , labs @-@ on @-@ a @-@ chip may rely on several methods , including chemical fingerprinting , to sift through the large mix of trace substances in a sample of spit .
( laughter ) I have 1,000 of these , 500 in the focal plane of each telescope in each hemisphere .
there is a new sky every night .
she was able to do this because SDSS , since its beginning and by mandate from the Sloan Foundation , has made its data both publicly available and usable to a broad range of audiences .
but the fact remains : the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same .
I think this should be concerning , considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now .
in addition to higher resolution versions of this display , my father and I are working on a new patent @-@ pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon .
so I 'd love to talk to you all , and invite you to come down and take a closer look .
typically , pain helps the body avoid further injury or damage .
we 're only beginning to uncover the mechanisms behind the experience of pain , but there are some promising areas of research .
and with that , we can reconstruct my face under a myriad of lighting conditions .
it 's got an unfortunate level of detail , unfortunately .
( laughter ) You can see every pore , every wrinkle .
it 's business that must take a side .
and this is the difference between return on investment and return on kindness .
it is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world , and still played in the Southern mountains .
you see , we 'd just been to the grocery store , and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it .
she pulled the car over ; she said , " Get out of the car . "
good news : chariot 's coming .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn 't make some gunpowder for them .
curly hair ?
that sheen , perfect !
and you don 't have to be on one side of the spectrum or the other side of the spectrum , or fit into someone 's mold , your mom 's mold , whoever 's mold that you are trying to fit into .
we build friendships , navigate early romantic relationships , get married and bring babies home from the hospital with the expectation that we 'll figure it out .
you feel so lucky , like you 've hit the jackpot .
it 's also really important to start practicing using your voice to talk about your own needs .
you do this by making plans with friends and sticking to them and encouraging your partner to do the same .
orange 2 : I 'd be sad too . ( # thatslove ) Orange 1 : I 'd so depressed if we ever broke up .
these roles were stereotypes and couldn 't have been further from my own reality or from the roles I dreamt of playing .
" great , " I thought , " We did it !
and actually , my work took me to many countries because I used my work to fill my curiosity .
we place value on knowledge and resources above what we deem to be the soft skill of confidence .
but by most measures , we have more knowledge and more resources now than at any other point in history , and still injustice abounds and challenges persist .
so basically , PET plastic goes from being a big , tough , long @-@ lasting pollutant to a tasty meal for my bacteria .
as somebody who 's spent the last two decades advocating a shift away from industrial meat production , I wanted to believe that this clarion call was going to make a difference .
the thing is , I 've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades .
here 's 2018 from the journal " Nature , " 2017 from " Bioscience Journal , " 2016 from the National Academy of Sciences .
these antibiotics are then mutating into superbugs that threaten to render antibiotics obsolete within all of our lifetimes .
we don 't want to disrupt the meat industry , we want to transform it .
look , tens of thousands of people died from antibiotic @-@ resistant superbugs in North America just last year .
she was a black futurist .
I 'm scared .
that 's just common courtesy .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) I got lucky .
I 'd see an ad for a product I had just whispered to a friend about yesterday .
I would see a video of a police officer gunning down someone who looked just like me .
so I started a collection of as many of these stories as I could find .
how do you like them reverse racist apples ?
this is something that humans need four years of brain development to do to remember what happened during a particular event , where it happened and when it happened .
this is not a copy .
and it wouldn 't be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible .
you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in 1455 .
so the printing press , ladies and gentlemen , was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading .
the room is a theatre . it changes colors .
( applause ) TED is all about patterns in the clouds .
but we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine .
thanks , Chris .
HIV has caused millions of deaths and is one of the most devastating diseases that humanity has ever known .
achieving this goal and improving healthcare in general is in everyone 's best interest , from individual people to society as a whole .
Ch√¢teau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
they are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand @-@ dipped in natural indigo 24 times .
Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany .
and Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape .
and it 's not because they need a therapist , though that does sometimes happen , it 's really because anger is universal .
( laughter ) We feel it throughout our teenage years , as my mom can certainly attest to with me .
what makes you mad ? "
( laughter ) Super gross , right ?
this is a recipe for anger .
there are infinite ways that you can express your anger .
and we compare simulated universes like that -- I 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky .
but they will have a dark side .
metallic objects -- albeit very small ones , a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the Earth .
now , the idea is simple when we 're applying it to coin tosses , but in fact , it 's not very simple in everyday life .
would you drive to get it ? at this point , 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars .
in the German town of N√∂rdlingen in 1593 , an innkeeper named Maria H√∂ll found herself accused of witchcraft .
a witch hunt often began with a misfortune : a failed harvest , a sick cow , or a stillborn child .
they take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them .
now , to wrap this up , I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves .
did life start here and was it transported there ?
do you need to be alive ? I mean , that 's a spooky thought , right ?
I mean , I 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it 's not .
now , all this changes when a predator enters the scene .
they each do their own thing , flashing on and off , paying no attention to their neighbors .
interviewer : and not forwards and backwards ? boy : no .
but I hope that you 'll go outside and see the world in a new way , to see all the amazing synchrony around us . thank you .
beneath a surface layer of ice thicker than Mount Everest , there exists a liquid ocean as much as 100 kilometers deep .
they hope to send a probe to test whether the geysers " plumes of vapor contain life @-@ enabling material from that hidden sea .
although it 's the best known substance for nurturing life , water isn 't necessarily the only medium that can support living things .
they 've leapfrogged .
laptops are a luxury ; it 's like giving them iPods . no .
( laughter ) And it 's not completely gratuitous , because " wok " and " roll " -- Chinese food and Japanese foods , so it kind of works out .
the Chinese have their own version of broccoli , called Chinese broccoli , but they 've now discovered American broccoli , and are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy .
this guy is now five generations removed from the General ; this guy is about seven .
and as a matter of fact , then , this is one of the reasons we must exclude them from this country .
for example , there is French Chinese food , where they serve salt and pepper frog legs .
they looked at " The Young and The Restless . " it wasn 't that , either .
but at some point , all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant .
and all these restaurants were serving fortune cookies , which , of course , aren 't even Chinese to begin with .
someone 's like , " It 's sweet , it 's fried , it 's chicken -- Americans will love this . "
I was surprised to discover that not only in Philadelphia , but also in Atlanta .
for example , Lem Sen , who introduced chop Suey , Chef Peng , who introduced General Tso 's Chicken , and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies .
it doesn 't take a shrink to explain how I ended up in the field of conflict resolution .
so I began to wonder how we might change our everyday gatherings to focus on making meaning by human connection , not obsessing with the canap√©s .
birthday party ? cake and candles .
one brown table , 12 white men .
an expectant mother I know was dreading her baby shower .
it 's specific to them , just as your gathering should be specific to you .
it 's a good rule in that it preserves harmony , or that 's its intention .
I was once working with an architecture firm , and they were at a crossroads .
and there was real disagreement in the room , but you wouldn 't know , because no one was actually speaking up publicly .
so that 's work .
what about a hypothetical tense Thanksgiving dinner ?
the way we gather matters because how we gather is how we live .
and then suddenly we had a Zach , a perfect one @-@ year @-@ old boy / dinosaur , depending on his mood .
and then , out of the blue , some physician 's assistant called me at work to tell me that I had stage IV cancer , and that I was going to need to come to the hospital right away .
and then as I began the walk to the hospital , it crossed my mind for the first time , " Oh . how ironic . "
( laughter ) I had not yet fully grasped the way that the prosperity gospel had become the great civil religion , offering another transcendent account of the core of the American Dream .
( laughter ) I believed that hardships were only detours on what I was certain would be my long , long life .
I had to face the fact that my life is built with paper walls , and so is everyone else 's .
they want me to know without a doubt that there is a hidden logic to this seeming chaos .
but what I have learned in living with stage IV cancer is that there is no easy correlation between how hard I try and the length of my life .
( laughter ) But at the same time , I 've experienced love , so much love , love I find hard to explain .
my name is Safia Elhillo , and this poem is called " to make use of water . "
but the Danish word for design is " formgivning , " which literally means to give form to that which has not yet been given form .
but then we thought , like , what if the 100 @-@ foot minimum distance is really about minimum distance -- once we get 100 feet up in the air , we can grow the building back out .
and finally , we are going to deal with all the waste locally , with compost , recycling , and turning the waste into energy .
and any architecture is supposed to be able to fit on this platform .
I -- you know , when I -- after I had invented PCR , I kind of needed a change .
and when surfers are out waiting for waves , you probably wonder , if you 've never been out there , what are they doing ?
you know , sometimes there 's a 10- , 15 @-@ minute break out there when you 're waiting for a wave to come in .
people think they 're sort of lowbrows .
they didn 't have TV screens , and they didn 't have any football games to watch .
and like , there was big arguments about it in the -- you know , the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff .
he said , OK , we 're going to start having these meetings .
but the general idea that you could only -- you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis .
but -- all of us own stuff .
not a whole lot of people doing this stuff .
it 's like anything else that 's prohibited : you do it behind the garage .
and then I tried the melting business , and I melted it .
and then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid , brown .
( laughter ) So I started developing -- you know , George 's dad had a lot of help . I just had my brother .
but I wasn 't worried , by the way , about , you know , the explosion causing the destruction of the planet .
but if you go to authority , and you always don 't -- you don 't always get the right answer , see .
and then you figure out better and better ways to do it .
and I 'm basically honest .
now , let 's see ...
I 've got another five minutes , right ?
OK . all scientists aren 't like that .
you know -- and there is a lot -- ( Laughter ) There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened .
scientists , you know , made World War II as we know it quite possible .
and they weren 't the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air .
so the temperature has been , sort of , inching up .
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
it 's a paper that came out in February , and most of you probably hadn 't heard about it .
so you still get heated , but you don 't dissipate any .
so the planet should get warmer .
these papers should have been called , " The End to the Global Warming Fiasco , " you know .
they had to be very cautious .
it may seem like we 're all standing on solid earth right now , but we 're not .
and these empty spaces are filled with astronomical quantities of microbes , such as these ones .
this is a good point .
if you only lived for a day .
so when we say that these deep subsurface microbes are just dormant , are we like people who die after a day , trying to figure out how trees work ?
these are things that we literally kill each other to get ahold of up at the surface world .
but in the subsurface , of course , there 's no sunlight , so this ecosystem has to solve the problem of who is going to make the food for everybody else .
and they can do this with a ton of different elements .
they can do this with sulphur , iron , manganese , nitrogen , carbon , some of them can use pure electrons , straight up .
that lake that we 're standing next to is made of pure battery acid .
but the fact that it erupted illustrates perfectly that if you want to look for where carbon dioxide gas is coming out of this oceanic plate , then you should look no further than the volcanoes themselves .
we discovered that literally tons of carbon dioxide were coming out of this deeply buried oceanic plate .
and it may seem like life buried deep within the earth 's crust is so far away from our daily experiences that it 's kind of irrelevant .
everything is interconnected .
if people think they can 't do their work , there 's no chance of getting the local buy @-@ in you need for the area to be successful .
it already has .
Governments , local citizens , funders , and most importantly , our oceans .
Don 't forget : a computer came out ; it had no software .
I mean , this was great .
it 's , like , you know , Herbie the Apple II .
and isn 't it that strange moment when you publish your design ?
and so in Japan , I began to experiment with people .
in the end , he drew a house . it was the most boring thing .
and so I never developed the ability to have a staff .
he was the first digital media producer in Tokyo .
and so , I began to think more carefully about the computer .
so , if you can see here , you know , that program you 're seeing in the corner , if you spread it out , it 's all these things all at once .
it 's real simultaneity . it 's nothing we 're used to working with .
this I found , where nature had made a picture for me .
and I went after it with passion .
in fact , I think that most of it has to do with body size -- the size you are when you inherit a vacant EcoSpace from whatever natural disaster .
dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
and that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats .
a predator . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
we are extremely dinosaur @-@ like , and unusual in our two @-@ legged approach to life .
but one with an immense chalkboard in the middle , with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition .
some of them -- the most important -- are mental .
they 're usually students who 've never seen a desert .
narrator : ... as long as their boat .
man : look at that set of choppers ! yeah , he 's a big one .
it 's really an island continent .
now , I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution .
I thought , what a great way to get to school .
we flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 , when I really got it started .
we are now installing larger powerplants , which will make it possible for me to get back on board .
there 's an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s , when every aeronautical company was working on vertical @-@ takeoff aircraft .
we have four computers . we have two parachutes .
( laughter ) I 'd like to show you an animation in this next one , which is one element of the Skycar 's use , but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used .
we don 't know .
what we do know is this : when suicidal murderers really go all in , technology is the force multiplier .
here 's an example .
so these researchers edited H5N1 's genome and made it every bit as deadly , but also wildly contagious .
and they 're all moving in these headlong rates .
and the keys to the kingdom are these tiny , tiny data files .
let 's say it 's 2026 , to pick an arbitrary year , and a brilliant virologist , hoping to advance science and better understand pandemics , designs a new bug .
so these are just a couple of many great ideas that are out there .
( laughter ) I was raised by my grandparents , and they were antiques dealers , so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things .
it 's a lot of hard work , not being yourself .
how many versions of you are there ?
again , another medical example here .
so , the thing that we designed , much less sexy but much more human and practical , was this .
they 're now called kickstart .
and I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large @-@ scale construction .
Red drew me into this little composition , optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service 's mailbox , door service , plumbing .
Red can be comical : it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana .
Havana is a wonderful area .
but they 're real examples in urbanization and the change that 's occurred in the last number of years , and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
you know , so much of the discussion surrounding our future focuses on technology , efficiency and speed .
it was a fact that he didn 't make much of a fuss about , usually .
they handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes .
now , we 've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science , but I think it 's also true in the arts , it 's true in politics , it 's even true in personal endeavors .
and it 's that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves .
in the series , my stuffed bear cohost and I talk about the LGBT community , activism , gender and pronouns , consent and body positivity .
lesbian , gay and bisexual teens are more than three times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers , and transgender teens are almost six times more likely .
so the signature shape of a quartz crystal is a six @-@ sided column with pointed tips .
while we can 't directly observe growth conditions in the mantle , laboratory experiments have shown some evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures .
this is the school where I met Patrick .
if you don 't come back now , you 'll never come back . "
and he said , " My mother . "
he fixated on a story Douglass told of how , over Christmas , masters give slaves gin as a way to prove to them that they can 't handle freedom .
he said that there are people in jail who , like slaves , don 't want to think about their condition , because it 's too painful .
it was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me . "
he finished the book before I did , reading it in a concrete stairway with no light .
let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question .
did reading save his life ?
so people say a lot of things about reading that feel exaggerated to me .
reading gave him a language for what he had lost .
how precious are these lines from the poet Derek Walcott ?
the link between reading and writing is so powerful .
because whole grain -- it 's easy with white flour to make a good @-@ tasting bread . white flour is sweet .
and -- and you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once , but they won 't eat it again if they don 't like it , right ?
O.K. ? radical , not subtle .
I turned on the computer , went on Google and prepared to write my news clips .
and instead of a short answer , Jesus replied with a parable .
the first story , about the neighbor .
a road like in this country has been rooted in things like misogyny .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
in politics , the rare candidate who is serious , like Adlai Stevenson , is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn , like Eisenhower .
for one thing , it often happens spontaneously , intuitively , accidentally or incidentally .
it 's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind .
and first I was praised for it , then criticized for it , but the fact of the matter was , I had become solemn .
there was no format .
a neighborhood has a thing -- it 's got a landmark , it 's got a place , it 's got a restaurant . it doesn 't have a logo . I mean , what would that be ?
it will change every six months , and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh , and it will probably become a landmark in the area .
one of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water .
and then a funny thing happened -- they sold .
( laughter ) Same color , same message , same words .
this is from my second book .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense .
so , this was the contents page originally .
I hate this stuff . it 's hard to read .
I 've taken one shot ; I cropped it a few different ways .
got no way of tracking it , so I could be totally wrong .
it wasn 't some , you know , weird grunge type or something ; it looked like they might be real . anyway .
I do a lot of workshops all over the world , really , and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors .
it was a worldwide branding campaign .
they thought some people didn 't like them .
( laughter ) You could -- you could highlight it ; you could make it Helvetica or something : it is the actual article .
how could they send me here ?
a genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism .
we 've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule , that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever , since the beginning of us , of us as creatures .
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you 're from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that 's now starting to be understood .
a lot of very handsome and pretty people here , skinny , chubby , different races , cultures . we are all 99.9 % genetically equal .
some people will find very scary . I will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me , but that 's okay .
( laughter ) We can build a better vine .
all of these things could conceivably be done , and I will tell you I 'd pretty much bet that it will be done .
we can 't make the grape plant produce babies .
and if you travel through Asia today , you will also see the results of the third revolution : the revolution of good governance .
I personally experienced the shock and grief because I was in Manhattan when 9 / 11 happened .
( laughter ) Why minimalist ?
there 's only one place : the United Nations .
while the second Iraq war , fought by his son , President George W. Bush , failed ?
so a great future lies ahead for humanity .
a trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers .
superconducting circuits , meanwhile , make operations much faster than trapped ions , and it 's easier to scale up the number of circuits in a computer than the number of ions .
moreover , I 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success .
we can save the planet , but we can 't do it alone -- we need each other .
but this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress -- burnt down , forever lost -- each year .
now , why do I say that this is a big problem ?
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second microbial age .
this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Permian , 250 million years ago , a comet hit us .
hold still , you 're the scale .
the ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction .
so , I 'm swimming along , and it takes off my leg .
I got this email from him two years ago ; he said , " I think I 've got an answer to some of your questions . "
give us a few millennia -- and we humans should last those few millennia -- will it happen again ? if we continue , it 'll happen again .
and this gives me enormous hope .
and , of course , that makes sense , because hope is an abstract phenomenon ; it 's an abstract idea , it 's not a concrete word .
I interrupted , and I said , " Did you say this ? "
and I think that it 's going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we 've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days .
I call this hypersonic sound .
so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people , and there can be a public beach just off to the side , and they don 't even know it 's turned on .
she pawed at the grave , she brayed in distress , and there she stood .
I had not been elected .
I organized the first multiparty democratic elections in nearly 30 years .
how could we engage them and make them believe that the answers to transforming our nation was right in their hands ?
let me give you a few examples .
women and girls , who constitute 51 percent of our population , were not given equal opportunity to be educated .
but the only problem is we had no money to start the program .
I argued that for Sierra Leone to produce a highly skilled , innovative and productive workforce fit for the 21st century global economy , we needed to invest heavily in human capital development in Sierra Leone .
but even with all that water , the Romans had to construct miniature boats with special flat bottoms that wouldn 't scrape the Colosseum floor .
these warriors would duel across ships ; boarding them , fighting , drowning , and incapacitating their foes until only one faction was left standing .
animals walked on water , myths were re @-@ enacted by condemned prisoners , and at night , nude synchronized swimmers would perform by torchlight .
Don 't get it twisted , my jumper was wet .
a speck of paint , traveling at the right speed , impacting one of these objects , could render it absolutely useless .
now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit .
none whatsoever , OK ?
where are things going ? "
why is that ?
ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe -- government , industry and academia -- and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today .
what could I trust ?
so , why don 't you tell that story ?
that 's all I 'd ever known .
in fact , I 'd never even met another amputee until I was 17 .
he 's coached five Olympians , and the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he 's coached .
and no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level .
like , I almost came out of it , in front of , like , 5,000 people .
and he just sat there like this .
am : no , a year .
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May , and was sure that I was coming home with the gold .
I was the guinea pig . , I 'm telling you , this was , like -- talk about a tourist attraction .
and I 'm always looking around , like , where is my competition ?
this is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium , and they post the heat sheets . and I go over and look .
then I 'm looking : the next lane , lane two , is 12.8 .
all this training -- I had transformed my life .
and that was this collective glory -- that there was , you know , 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta .
( laughter ) No , these are my cosmetic legs , actually , and they 're absolutely beautiful .
and this is just a silicon piece of skin .
so , asking for help is basically the worst , right ?
and so I said , very helpfully , that I thought maybe she could go back upstairs and try to find something a little less somber .
technically , I can 't help you with that last one because I 'm not that kind of doctor , but I could point you in the direction of someone who could .
this is really important : please avoid disclaimers , apologies and bribes .
this is not true .
what is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed , that it had impact , that you were effective .
now , how do I feel about the time and effort I took to do that , when I really have no idea if I helped you , if it actually helped you get the thing that you wanted ?
but you know what else they do ?
they get pictures .
but the reality of modern work and modern life is that nobody does it alone .
a possible economic motivation to treat the patients .
meaning that most of the procedures performed on the chart I 've just shown could have been avoided , even in Stavanger .
and to turn it the other way around , how often do you think you 'll get a " no " from a doctor if you ask such a question ?
the patient is supposed to get advice from the doctor about what to do .
and if spots light up , we know there 's a certain virus in there .
and Kaposi 's sarcoma @-@ associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here .
all right , I can see a rhinovirus -- and here 's the blow @-@ up of the rhinovirus 's little barcode -- but what about different rhinoviruses ?
you have no idea what someone 's going to cough into a cup , and it 's probably really complex , right ?
well , it 's pretty simple .
so , let 's start off with the positive control first , where we know the person was healthy .
we put a ton of virus up this guy 's nose . so -- ( Laughter ) -- I mean , we wanted it to work . he really had a cold .
( laughter ) But by the time you get to block nine , you see that respiratory syncytial virus .
this individual has parainfluenza @-@ 1 , and you can see that there 's a little stripe over here for Sendai virus : that 's mouse parainfluenza .
it was " unrevealing " : that 's the pathologist 's report .
no one would even consider it , because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure .
it 's a classic gamma retrovirus , but it 's totally new ; no one 's ever seen it before .
this is a collaboration between myself and Don .
we have a three @-@ year window to cut emissions , three years .
so it 's not here . it 's not now .
this is felt as an inner discomfort .
first , we can flip distance to social .
we can also reframe climate as being about new tech opportunities , about safety and about new jobs .
they just passed the three million jobs mark .
we can flip identity with better stories .
I 'm proud that my hometown of Oslo is now embarking on a bold journey of electrifying all transport , whether cars , bikes or buses .
so thousands of climate communicators are now starting to use these solutions all over the world .
I started this talk with testing two ways of communicating climate with you .
this air , you can feel in this room , too , the air that moves right now in your nostrils .
it 's amazingly thin , compared to the size of the earth and the cosmos it shields us from , far thinner than the skin of an apple compared to its diameter .
inside this skin , we 're all closely connected .
thank you .
Jomny is an alien who has been sent to earth with a mission to study humans .
Jomny is feeling lost and alone and far from home , and I think we 've all felt this way .
I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien .
these developments laid the groundwork for the modern field of antibiotics- currently home to our most effective TB treatments .
and even when properly identified , traditional treatments can take up to 9 months , requiring multiple drugs and a high potential for side effects .
you don 't know what it does for me to see women in the position that you 're in today .
this is why it 's so wonderful to have a conversation with someone who has such a long view -- LC : a long time .
LC : they did , there .
and so that 's what we did in that restaurant .
he was a good movement .
PM : and you 've seen so many of those changes .
you know , that wasn 't too cool .
that 's why I 'm dressed like this , in my most un @-@ TED @-@ like garb .
it 's a testament , I think , to the seductive appeal of some powerful figure offering you easy , simple answers to life 's complex and subtle questions and anxieties .
put your weight on your left @-@ hand side and say " yes . "
and I 'm doing this now so I don 't have the clues as you stand up .
thank you .
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- " I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day ! "
and , you know what ?
( laughter ) Like the multi @-@ dimension stuff .
there was gas rationing in 1973 .
if we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells , that will become more practical .
they have to track the sun , because they have to point directly at the sun .
we needed to beat solar cells .
James Watt didn 't actually invent the steam engine , he just refined it .
that 's the most fundamental heat engine you could have .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you 're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
the exact converse is also true .
and is only affects the payback period , it doesn 't mean that you couldn 't use solar energy ; you could use it anywhere on Earth .
the potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable , and I 'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
and they 'll build a community out of what otherwise would be an isolating and lonely experience .
like in the case of Ramon Vasquez .
so testing for HPV would yield many , many positives , and although most of them won 't be cause for concern , there is still no treatment plan for clearing the body of the virus .
the body 's immune system is able to eradicate most strains of HPV before they cause any harm - and without people even knowing they 've been infected .
in some cases , the affected tissue may be removed .
researchers are also developing an injection for people who are already infected with HPV 16 and 18 , which would target the infected cells to stop them from developing into cancerous ones .
his character not only remembers everything he has ever seen , but every time he has seen it in perfect detail .
born in Argentina in 1899 , he admired the revolutionaries of his mother 's family but took after his father 's bookish clan .
though Borges was not interested in writing long books , he was an avid reader , recruiting friends to read to him after he went blind in middle age .
the narrator has spent his entire life wandering this vast labyrinth of information in a possibly futile search for meaning .
over the course of the story , he finds out the labyrinth is not a physical maze but a novel .
and part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past .
as recently as 1960 , 110 million children were born , and 20 million of those died before the age of five .
and I think that 's doable in well under 20 years .
it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years .
1990 , you 've gotten most of the northern areas .
( laughter ) And rich men are afflicted .
bed net funding is up .
so we 're going to have these new tools .
it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on , and we 'd understand very well .
we all had a wonderful education .
and even if you graduate from high school , if you 're low @-@ income , you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree .
and that doesn 't seem entirely fair .
we should retain those people .
what are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
teach for America : slight effect .
and it 's a system with very high turnover .
and so that 's sort of working in the opposite direction .
you know , the system doesn 't naturally make it happen .
Governments don 't naturally pick these things in the right way .
it 's an incredible discovery : an ancient , abandoned alien space station filled with precursor technology .
it 's possible to solve this riddle using as few as two cache points , and there are also valid solutions that use more .
since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5 , we can place these two cache points 5 parsecs apart .
you jump 3 parsecs , drop 9 units off at the cache point , and then jump the 3 units home , arriving with an empty tank .
repeating this process gets you 18 units of fuel at the cache point , and one more jump puts you at the 3 @-@ parsec cache with 30 total units of fuel .
you fill up your tank and jump forward again , arriving with 10 units of fuel in your tank .
the men I 'd written about wanted to teach me a lesson .
Pakistan is home to 200 million people .
and my barometer of anger led me , in 2014 , to honor killings .
and we began to think about using our film to change the way people perceived honor killings , to impact the loophole in the law .
many of the towns had never seen television or social media , and they were eager for their children to learn .
and in one of the villages that we were screening in , they shut it down and said they didn 't want the women to know about their rights .
he was an ordinary hero .
we are changing the way people in these villages interact , and we 're taking our learnings into other places .
thank you .
that 's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o 'clock in the morning , and I don 't want to go there .
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
and I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
but every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
he 's just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he 's never going to ascend to that height again .
( laughter ) Let 's move further down the torso .
why ?
no ?
you want to target the most irrational organs for shareholder value .
God , love , consumption , sex .
who was running for president ?
everything they 're doing is bothering us .
whose fault is it ? it 's our fault .
we 're electing regulators who don 't have the backbone to actually go after these companies .
approve the merger . "
they approve the merger and then -- spoiler alert ! -- they figure it out .
that 's one Yankee Stadium of workers .
imagine McDonald 's .
and they say , " Wait , wait -- we 're not a fast @-@ food restaurant , we 're a fast @-@ food platform . "
if Sheryl Sandberg had written a book on gun rights or on the pro @-@ life movement , would they be flying Sheryl to Cannes ?
and I 'm not doubting their progressive values , but it foots to shareholder value , because we as progressives are seen as weak .
they 're so nice -- remember Microsoft ?
they didn 't seem as nice , and regulators stepped in much earlier than the regulators now , who would never step in on those nice , nice people .
our Jesus Christ is Steve Jobs , and we 've decided this is holier than our person , our house or our computer .
Amazon has become so powerful in the marketplace , it can conduct Jedi mind tricks .
how did I know this ?
( Alexa ) I have purchased the outstanding stock of Whole Foods Incorporated at 42 dollars per share .
they 're not concerned with the condition of our souls .
we have set up a society that values shareholder value over everything , and they 're doing what they 're supposed to be doing .
I think they are trying to build something cool , and are probably , in moments of reflection , as horrified that some of the things that have happened as we might be .
Scott , thank you so much .
I wanted her to be seen in a clinic that specialized in trauma survivors .
but she took down the address and agreed to go .
if you 're thinking that , it 's probably because you have resources .
and he said , " Well , I have to work in order to pay the rent . "
I 'll sign it and I 'll fax it in for you . "
the word " applicant . "
and so now I had to have him take the two buses back to the office and sign the form so that we could then fax it in for him .
the proliferation of inexpensive cell phones has actually helped quite a lot .
low @-@ income people often have to move around a lot by necessity .
that chart assiduously documents that three letters were sent to her home , asking her to please come in for follow @-@ up .
but also , maybe there was something more important that day than their high blood pressure or a screening colonoscopy .
for non @-@ English @-@ speaking patients , translation is as important as a prescription pad .
but when they don 't , they have others who can advocate for them , who can get them that disability placard or make sure the disability application is completed .
he was by his own admission a gangbanger .
they were all desperately trying to save a woman 's life .
we spend more on health care than any other country in the world .
maybe it 's because my dad was a civil rights attorney and my parents were socially conscious and demanded that we stand up for what we believe in .
for example , if a pregnant woman in labor has really high blood pressure and we treat her with the right antihypertensive medication in a timely fashion , we can prevent stroke .
there are some success stories .
this is true overall in the United States , where about three quarters of all black women deliver in a specific set of hospitals , while less than one @-@ fifth of white women deliver in those same hospitals .
if every pregnant woman in every community received this kind of high @-@ quality care and delivered at facilities that utilized standard care practices , our maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity rates would plummet .
and she said , " What are you talking about ? "
now , it doesn 't look terribly interesting , but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters .
and here 's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ?
a romantic and a revolutionary , Neruda was one of the most celebrated poets of the 20th century , but also one of the most accessible and controversial .
although he continued to travel , after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the rest of his life .
in one demonstration , he caused a pig to lose its voice by tying off one of its nerves .
he was convinced that each organ had a specific function .
introduced by Hippocrates centuries earlier , this misguided hypothesis attributed most medical problems to an imbalance in four bodily fluids called humours .
Odontochelys is an early ancestor of the turtle .
it 's my role to shepherd it in time , and that feels more meaningful to me than just owning it for today .
today , actually , is a very special day for me , because it is my birthday .
well , we thought that , to some degree , our success is determined by the networks we 're part of -- that our networks can push us forward , they can pull us back .
but the way we actually started to explore , we realized that performance and success are very , very different animals when it comes to the mathematics of the problem .
and let me illustrate that .
and not only does he run only one percent faster than the second one , but he doesn 't run 10 times faster than I do -- and I 'm not a good runner , trust me on that .
so let 's see what were the sales for Nicholas Sparks .
why ?
and recently , I published a book that I devoted to that very question .
so what you see here is all the papers that I 've published from my very first paper , in 1989 ; I was still in Romania when I did so , till kind of this year .
I had the first 10 years where I had to work a lot and I don 't achieve much .
( laughter ) That time , I was doing material science , and then I kind of discovered for myself networks and then started publishing in networks .
and we don 't know , because there hasn 't been enough time passed yet to actually figure out how much impact those papers will get ; it takes time to acquire .
we 're not looking at real age .
it is the productivity that changes .
( applause ) So in the end , what is it that we see , actually ?
most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .
and this is Felix , actually .
and then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so I don 't have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvise , making it longer or shorter as I go .
it became clear to me she , too , was a victim of the policy .
it was printed on matches , playing cards , textbooks , posters .
and when you compare it to what was being done in America -- these are the typefaces from the same period in the United States in the 1920s , bold , brash , braggadocios .
and you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary .
and in many ways , there 's nothing wrong with this design .
everything seems centered , everything seems symmetrical .
and it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine .
in this case , illustrations by Pablo Picasso , moving across the page and breaking the gutter of the two pages .
when we think about what capital letters denote , they denote something important , whether it 's our names , or our titles .
actually , in some ways , America 's the home of capitalization .
and for them , this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America .
so for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea .
or even just new book covers , whether they were from Europe .
so for Americans who wanted to adopt this and make it part of their own system , something they could use in everyday typography , whether in ads or anything else , they actually had to have metal type .
so being good American capitalists , what did we do ?
so America took this typeface in , conquered it and made it its own .
but in this case , it was used on some of the most important maps , so this one , an air force map in 1962 , or used for the maps in Vietnam in ' 66 .
now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systems for each component they had in the space shuttles .
in fact , Futura had authority , had legitimacy and had power because of this choice .
so in some ways , this German typeface on an American plaque perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology .
( laughter ) In fact , people will ask me , " isn 't it depressing , working on obituaries and thinking about death all the time ? "
Obits aren 't about death , they 're about life , they 're interesting , they 're relatable .
that 's the impetus behind a project I created called " Overlooked , " which tells the stories of marginalized groups of people who never got an obit .
perhaps in a generation or two , we 'll start to see more women and people of color in our obituaries . "
and I thought , wow , one of the biggest sports in America was introduced by a woman ?
and it sent me on this deep dive through the archives .
there was this concern that , you know , the newspaper might look bad because it didn 't get it right the first time .
and once my team saw the value in it , they were all in .
my all @-@ time favorite is Grandma Gatewood .
but when the police arrived , they arrested her , not him .
and at the finish , they asked her , " How did you survive so rough a place ? "
something like 25 different publishers have reached out to me with interest in turning " Overlooked " into a book .
so next , I worked with a programmer to build this tool , called the diversity analysis tool .
and then I 'm hoping to partner with this programmer again , to build a similar tool to measure people of color in our obits .
again , it was a really powerful experience .
a lot of them had to make up stories about their past just to get ahead in life .
and there were these patterns of their struggles that came up again and again .
believe it or not , this brilliant man never got an obituary , even though his work decoding German messages during World War II helps end the war .
( applause continues ) Thank you very much .
( laughter ) So , I 'll talk about musical composition , even though I don 't know where to start .
listen , this is not to be romantic , but to assert a plausible scenario for the existential moment .
you pitch him the frequency of your telepathic goodbye , channel the love sustained in Marvin 's upper register under his skullcap .
thank you .
the janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .
real @-@ world problems are often ambiguous and ill @-@ defined and the context is always changing .
there 's a sense in which it 's obvious , and yet , let me tell you a little story .
we know why these scripts are there .
I 'll just give you one example because time is racing .
instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes .
it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality .
yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re @-@ foresting in Indonesia .
so there 's a lot here at TED , and at other places , to celebrate .
and , most important , they need to learn to respect learning .
Obama appealed to virtue .
and now ...
we 're going to start to pay them .
this guy runs the China Investment Corporation .
because that 's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff .
so they engineered these cells so that when they 're growing in the exponential phase , they would smell like wintergreen .
there have actually been 22 species of hominids that have been around , have evolved , have wandered in different places , have gone extinct .
think about that for a second .
but the benefit of carbon sequestration is not just limited to climate change mitigation .
it can hold on to a lot of water and nutrients .
many activists will tell you that the best antidote to grief is activism .
thank you .
in Atlanta , we saw that teachers felt desperate enough to have to help their students cheat on standardized tests that would impact their funding .
why don 't we try to reclaim the promise of public education and remember that it 's our greatest collective responsibility ?
and I 'm saying that as someone who doesn 't have kids yet but wants to worry a little bit less about the future when I do .
all my life I 've dreamed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had .
( laughter ) Currently , I 'm not watching the child .
she 's really focused .
( laughter ) She wasn 't doing anything , right ?
I 'm not watching the child .
coast is clear -- now she 's ready to play .
last but not least , children in study three chose to press a remote significantly more when the experimenter that expressed a positive value was watching , as opposed to the experimenter that had expressed a negative value .
( laughter ) From very early on , children , like adults , are sensitive to the values that we place on objects and behaviors .
psychologists study behavior to explore the contents of the mind , because our behavior often reflects our beliefs , our values and our desires .
or when we chose to offer candy , as opposed to nutritious food , as a reward for good behavior .
and in turn , this ends up shaping their own behavior .
and ground up mummies were far from the only remedy made from human flesh that was common throughout Europe .
a long time ago , there lived a Giant , a Selfish Giant , whose stunning garden was the most beautiful in all the land .
I was raised in a religious family , and I grew up reading both the Bible and the Quran .
for as long as we 've been communicating , there 's been the layering to the narrative , the stories beneath the stories and the ones beneath those .
some , like my grandmother and my siblings , seemed to be born reading , as though history stepped out of their way .
so as technology continues to speed ahead , I continue to read slowly , knowing that I am respecting the author 's work and the story 's lasting power .
and I read slowly to remember the Selfish Giant , how he finally tore that wall down and let the children run free through his garden .
yogi Berra was a world @-@ famous baseball player who said , " If you come to a fork in the road , take it . "
we have had CAR T cells stay in the bodies of our cancer patients now for more than eight years .
so one infusion can do the job ; they stay on patrol for the rest of your life .
then in 1997 , we first tested CAR T cells in patients with advanced HIV @-@ AIDS .
he had only weeks to live and had , in fact , already paid for his funeral .
but then , another fork in the road happened .
their bodies had become veritable bioreactors for these CAR T cells , producing millions and millions of CAR T cells in the bone marrow , blood and tumor masses .
the CAR T cell and its daughter progeny cells can divide and divide and divide in the body until the last tumor cell is gone .
and it was approved for the arthritis that my daughter had .
we 're so grateful to see patients who were formerly terminal return to healthy lives , as Emily has .
it was a normal Tuesday at the superconductor , until a bug in the system created a small situation .
luckily for you , there 's a half @-@ finished experimental teleportation robot that may be able to get you all home , if you can figure out how to work through the quirks of its design .
well ... mostly .
but my parents agreed with me and decided that my brothers should assist me .
and , unlike snowfall , rain melts ice , which just hurts the health of our glaciers .
but what does this mean ?
if the region falls sick , the entire planet will eventually suffer .
we 've made immense sacrifices to act locally ...
otherwise , the next time Nepal 's cabinet meets on Mount Everest , that spectacular backdrop ...
and while they can hold their cabinet meetings underwater to send an SOS to the world , their country can keep existing only if their islands keep existing .
thank you very much .
a model that excludes billions of people while making a handful unimaginably rich ?
stories are the means by which we navigate the world .
disorder afflicts the land , caused by powerful and nefarious forces working against the interests of humanity .
it 's the " Harry Potter " story .
without a restoration story that can tell us where we need to go , nothing is going to change , but with such a restoration story , almost everything can change .
and we might mean slightly different things by them , but at least we start with some language in common .
Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent mathematician , philosopher , and advisor to the city 's leaders .
Hypatia was born around 355 in Alexandria , then part of the Egyptian province of the Eastern Roman Empire , and an intellectual center .
I think we owe that to this generation .
it 's why experts and forecasters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out .
in an environment that defies so much forecasting , efficiency won 't just not help us , it specifically undermines and erodes our capacity to adapt and respond .
now , holding more capital looks and is inefficient .
countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions , multiple forms of renewable energy , not just one .
try some experiments .
the nurses hated it .
so now this form of nursing has proliferated across the Netherlands and around the world .
of course , not all experiments work .
failed experiments look inefficient , but they 're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works .
experiments like that require creativity and not a little bravery .
this was expensive , it was time @-@ consuming , and it could be a little risky putting a whole bunch of rugby players on a ski slope , right ?
they aren 't efficient , but they give us limitless capacity for adaptation , variation and invention .
and they just looked blank .
" they 're too busy . "
anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it , a spurious kind of manifest destiny .
the harder , deeper truth is that the future is uncharted , that we can 't map it till we get there .
and everybody is trying really hard to win points , but nobody is keeping track of who is winning games .
and as soon as the former adversaries were gathered around some small green tables , each of them could claim a victory , and the whole world could breathe more easily .
but long before that , really , the history of the modern world was best told through the bouncing white ball .
( laughter ) No exaggeration .
and Eastern Europeans grew so adept at hitting back everything that was hit at them that they almost brought the whole sport to a standstill .
but in Japan , I 'm encouraged to believe that , really , the point of a game is to make as many people as possible around you feel that they are winners .
you 're learning how to play with somebody , rather than against her .
I couldn 't exult after a tremendous upset victory against our strongest players , because six minutes later , with a new partner , I was falling behind again .
and when I flew away from Japan and started playing singles again with my English archrival , I noticed that after every defeat , I was really brokenhearted .
" well , " said the team spokesman , " because of his emphasis on winning . "
and they call the larger , white world outside the neighborhood " Gringolandia . "

Orpheus , charmer of nature and master of music .
but none of their adventures was so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason .
years before , Jason 's uncle Pelias had ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly from Jason 's grandfather .
if Jason retrieved the Fleece , Pelias promised to relinquish the throne .
these heroes , alongside countless sailors , soothsayers , and rebel demigods , named themselves the Argonauts after their sturdy ship .
bolstered by their victory , the triumphant heroes sailed onward- only to be blown back to the island several stormy nights later .
the young planet had widespread volcanic activity and an atmosphere that created hostile conditions .
and in order to grow and reproduce , all life needs a source of energy .
life forms are divided into two camps : autotrophs , like plants , that generate their own energy , and heterotrophs , like animals , that consume other organisms for energy .
so what locations meet these criteria ?
all violence against every child in every country . "
but I 'm always quick to make sure that people aren 't left with a sense of doom and gloom .
twelve years old , and forced to commit sexual acts on her uncle , which are live @-@ streamed to paying adults the other side of the world .
twice the number the year before .
but can we really do this on a global scale ?
look at what 's happened in the aid industry .
in the Philippines , there are 100 centers set up to protect women and children nationwide .
Faisal would go to school and he would thrive .
for example , regions such as the Gulf Atlantic might be cooled in the months before a hurricane season to reduce the force of storms .
right now , we have slow @-@ moving solutions to a fast @-@ moving problem .
this is also known as a moral hazard .
I for one don 't want them to act without real information and much better options .
yet today , the global level of investment in these interventions is effectively zero .
there is hope !
we could cleave the two halves apart .
and I 'd known I was in love , and that 's the whole reason I was going to these outrageous lengths .
she said , " Dude A 's dominance of your brain seems to essentially have been eradicated .
and North Koreans right now CANNOT speak for themselves .
two @-@ parter , not that deep .
because the truth is when I got this disease , I was all up in the mirror staring at every new spot trying to figure out what is going on .
so I needed to let other people have that same opportunity to get that visual understanding .
and the little girl says , " Duh @-@ duh @-@ hoy ? "
in 2016 , we all came together and celebrated World Vitiligo Day .
so that 's how I ended up in the living room of a social media propagandist in Southern California .
he was a married white guy in his late 30s .
and yet , with those tools , he was able to propel his fringe , noxious talking points into the heart of the American conversation .
and tweet they did -- hundreds and hundreds of tweets , a lot of them featuring images like this one .
so that 's George Soros .
a lot of what they do is measure engagement : clicks , comments , shares , retweets , that kind of thing .
some of them wanted to do away with democracy altogether .
a lot of them , before they went down some internet rabbit hole , they had been libertarian or they had been socialist or they had been something else entirely .
so the first one is to be a smart skeptic .
and I don 't want to drown you in technical epistemological information here , but I call them smart and dumb skepticism .
( applause ) So if you 're listening to my voice and you work at a social media company or you invest in one or , I don 't know , own one , this tip is for you .
in a desperate bid to reclaim independence and reunite the fractured Cossack state , their most recent leader , hetman Petro Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire .
on the other hand , by talking , a group could exchange knowledge , correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas .
what distinguished the groups that reached a consensus from those that didn 't ?
they 're gray not because they 're unsure , but because they believe that the moral dilemma faces two valid , opposing arguments .
the most intuitive idea is that it 's just the average of all the answers in the group , right ?
I led a five @-@ year National Geographic expedition , the Sustainable Seas expeditions , using these little subs .
the poet Auden said , " Thousands have lived without love ; none without water . "
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what 's happening , showing us our impact on the Earth .
and fortunately , in our time , we 've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
and with knowing comes caring .
but I asked him : " when are you going to finish it ?
to see -- wait a minute , we can go kshhplash ! -- right there , ha -- under the ocean , see what the whales see .
these are the gentle giants that I 've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater .
we need new deep @-@ diving submarines .
how about some X Prizes for ocean exploration ?
we need to see deep trenches , the undersea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea .
imagine what that means to our life support system .
natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , watersheds and wildlife .
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , National Marine Sanctuaries .
that 's another great idea .
the good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .
to cope with climate change , we need new ways to generate power .
perspectives can change .
and that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology .
why ?
we needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone .
so we aborted using motion capture .
any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are , if the knowledge of how to do so were present there .
the danger is not at all unprecedented .
and here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
they will float in seawater , but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills .
trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this .
all the king 's horses and all the king 's men ...
there is a problem with scuba , though , in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go .
now , it 's pretty obvious at this point there 's a zone here in the middle .
that 's fine , it 's how we 're designed .
well , in the context of diving , you get too much , you die also .
it happens because there 's too much concentration of oxygen in your body .
the nitrogen has two problems .
you don 't want to drive drunk , you don 't want to dive drunk .
it 's got the valves and knobs and things you need to inject the right gases at the right time .

( video ) Diver 1 : ( in squeaky voice ) Look at those ...
we were at 360 feet .
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .
this was probably the toughest place to explore .
it was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn , which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world , built in 1844 .
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces .
if they 're really interested , they get the update as a text message on their cell phone .
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium : you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you 're interested in .
it 's totally intimidating .
you have build something very fascinating , and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it .
and those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat , the largest accumulation of organic material in the world .
still , in this place , in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill , four years later , there is this one green blop on the Earth 's surface ...
( applause ) And there are all these animals , and all these people happy , and there 's this economic value .
this is how it looks like in practice . we have this grass we want to get rid of .
so the idea is : how to integrate these flows in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
but is it really that easy ?
the nursery , in here , is quite different .
and in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before .
we actually have it already with Google Earth .
I 'll just run them very quickly through .
there is no simple one recipe for one place .
because being soft meant that I was bullied .
because then in doing so I take away its power , and my display of vulnerability can in some cases give other men permission to do the same .
it was unconscious .
because of the overhanging leaves and branches , you 'll notice that the understory is very dark , it 's very still .
we 've done stripping experiments where we 've removed mats of epiphytes and looked at the rates of recolonization .
I 've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives .
( applause ) -- that we 've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing .
this is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design .
he saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest , and created this beautiful sculpture .
we brought musicians to the canopy , and they made their music -- and it 's fantastic music .
and I brought a little segment to give you of Duke Brady 's " Canopy Rap . "
what can I , as an ecologist , do about that ?
well , my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses , and that way we wouldn 't have to take them out of the wild .
they learned how to distinguish different species of mosses , which , to tell you the truth , is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do .
because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well , I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons .
the " Dirty Jobs " crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
the job in question : herding sheep .
I also call PETA just for fun , and they don 't like it , but they confirm it .
we 're on in five continents , dude !
I don 't like what I 'm thinking right now . "
and I 've been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn 't prepared for .
as a group , they 're the happiest people I know .
Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them to his swine .
( laughter ) No , I mean , really .
and he points out there .
how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it 's sort of an analog computer .
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping @-@ pong table and placed a projector above it , and on the ping @-@ pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it .
and as you play ping @-@ pong , whenever the ball hits part of the table , the ripples spread out and the fish run away .
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it .
that 's what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be -- what 's called depth @-@ first processing -- to focus , not be distracted .
biology -- we have co @-@ adapted through biology to like bright colors .
and the waiter can come by and say , " Would you like more water ? "
it 's that little voice in your head that 's the seat of consciousness .
and what 's so neat about it is how you accept that story .
and so people follow workplace norms .
because what Gelfand has found is that , when things are too loose , people crave order and structure .
they 've dealt with massive growth that overwhelmed existing communities and the rise of new business models .
for example , they noticed that successful public places generally have three different ways that they structure behavior .
my doctor said , " We know why people get like this .
and one day , he stood on a land mine left over from the war with the United States , and he got his leg blown off .
they explained that they went and sat with him .
but then , in the long journey for my book , all over the world , I kept meeting people who were doing exactly that , from Sydney , to San Francisco , to S√£o Paulo .
one day , Sam decided to pioneer a different approach .
and Lisa had been shut away in her home with crippling depression and anxiety for seven years .
they started to get their fingers in the soil .
the way Lisa put it to me , " As the garden began to bloom , we began to bloom . "
so everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick .
I could see how often in my own life , when I felt down , I tried to remedy it with some kind of show @-@ offy , grand external solution .
and I could see why that did not work well for me .
it 's like a glitch in a computer program , it 's just a wiring problem in your head . "
this is me talking to Mirko . Mirko didn 't want to be in the picture .
( laughter ) And we just don 't know if some of the pairs got married .
what matters here is that we relearn how to have these face @-@ to @-@ face discussions , without anyone else listening , with a stranger .
not only with a stranger we are introduced to by a Tinder for politics , but also with a stranger in a pub or in a gym or at a conference .
escape is impossible .
over the roughly one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half millennia of its existence , chess has been known as a tool of military strategy , a metaphor for human affairs , and a benchmark of genius .
today , chess software is capable of consistently defeating the best human players .
since returning to Gaul , she has received many offers of marriage- but she has decided to devote herself to her work , at least for now .
so I 'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence .
that fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal -- changes .
and that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times , at Virginia Tech .
when that mother and infant lock eyes , and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile , what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother .
we 're going to look at body play , which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .
and -- they don 't throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being playful .
the human hand , in manipulation of objects , is the hand in search of a brain ; the brain is in search of a hand ; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
I 'm sorry I don 't have a playful @-@ looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .
I think we 've got a lot of learning to do .
he put up a slide a little bit like this .
and I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly , " It 's really important to have a lot of data . "
third rule is that when I get back that information it 's not just got somebody 's height and weight and when they were born , it 's got relationships .
I wrote an article entitled " Linked Data " a couple of years ago and soon after that , things started to happen .
it 's not just a whole lot of other plants .
let 's start with government data .
that 's important . why is it important ?
well , you take that mouthful and you put it into Google .
at that point , I 'd been working for more than a decade on this seemingly intractable problem of dating violence .
was pornography to blame for any percentage of dating violence ?
so I could see why , on the one hand , we might be very worried about the messages that pornography is sending , and on the other hand , why we might be really worried about going overboard indicting it .
by the time they 're 18 years old , 93 percent of first year college males and 62 percent of females have seen pornography at least once .
or missing root causes of dating and sexual violence , which are the true public health crises .
that said , even my own research demonstrates that adolescents are turning to pornography for education and information about sex .
so let 's give it a try , let 's rock and roll , let 's flood the world with climate activists .
now , what the scientists are telling us we need to do over the next 80 @-@ odd years to the end of this century , is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by three percent every year , and draw three gigatons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year .
it does , it 's one of the best options , but there are many , many possibilities .
there are chemical pathways and biological pathways .
the biological pathways are fantastic because the energy source that 's needed to drive them , the sun , is effectively free .
there are also chemical pathways .
direct air capture is a great example of a chemical pathway , and people are using that right now to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and manufacture biofuels or manufacture plastics .
you know , it 's a fair question : can we plant our way out of this problem by using trees ?
you know , if we could cover nine percent of the world 's ocean in seaweed farms , we could draw down the equivalent of all of the greenhouse gases we put up in any one year , more than 50 gigatons .
and how close are we to that at the moment ?
how many ocean @-@ going seaweed farms do we actually have out there ?
there 's no nutrients there that were used up long ago .
and with just a little bit of clean , renewable energy , you can pump that water up and use the nutrients in it to irrigate your seaweed crop .
so I think this really has so many benefits .
it provides an ideal environment for growing marine protein .
the economics of all of this is going to be challenging .
you know , in the next 30 years , we have to go from being a carbon @-@ emitting economy to a carbon @-@ absorbing economy .
and that doesn 't seem like very long .
now , in 1919 , here in Edinburgh , you might have seen a canvas and wood biplane .
we can do a lot in a short period of time .
we had nothing that could help them stop this abuse .
and then came the internet , and the market exploded .
and that 's exactly what we 're doing at Thorn .
let 's talk for a minute -- ( Applause ) Thank you .
in a silo , it might work for the one agency that has control over it , but not connecting this data means we don 't know how many are unique .
the first is with law enforcement : helping them identify new victims faster , stopping abuse and stopping those producing this content .
the second is with companies : using it as clues to identify the hundreds of millions of files in circulation today , pulling it down and then stopping the upload of new material before it ever goes viral .
our dream was an alarm bell on the desks of officers all around the world so that if anyone dare post a new victim online , someone would start looking for them immediately .
so , I told you -- 45 million images and videos in the US alone last year .
these come from those companies that have the money to build the infrastructure that it takes to pull this content down .
this audacious commitment is part of that will .
it 's a declaration of war against one of humanity 's darkest evils .
and , of course , we are amused by jokes because they are funny .
if you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind , you wouldn 't see why they tasted sweet .
it 's a neural system that 's wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
all of her online accounts were flooded with screenshots of the video , with graphic rape and death threats and with slurs about her Muslim faith .
they find an audience primed to believe them .
and it 's that risk that professor Robert Chesney and I call the " liar 's dividend " : the risk that liars will invoke deepfakes to escape accountability for their wrongdoing .
yet , when she went to law enforcement in Delhi , she was told nothing could be done .
but of course , that 's just a small piece of the regulatory puzzle .
no way to explode a star in a lab to figure out why or how it blew up .
just pictures and movies of the sky .
imagine the cost .
these collaborations between domain experts and astrophysicists created transformational solutions to help improve people 's quality of life .
thank you .
( applause and cheers )
Aha , is it in fact a real rock ? "
but when we hear information , this is what happens .
now , there are generally only two emotional states that a neurodiverse brain can tabulate and keep count of at any given time , thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be emotionally , sometimes , attuned to the present situation .
( laughter ) And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain .
and when I finished hurting people a little bit , I would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ?
( laughter ) I kept on doing this for a while .
here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time .
it turns out that because we don 't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity , I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower .
how much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
we call this like a personal fudge factor .
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ?
our subjects doubled their cheating .
when we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
but in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
and the experimenter said , " If you 've finished everything , go home .
so , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
and they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
when we get bigger distance from cheating , from the object of money , for example , people cheat more .
what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
and the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them .
but it was actually more interesting than that , because she said , " I did not think that your intuition was right .
( laughter ) So it took me that long to own this thing that was what my purpose was .
and I was like , " You know what ?
so on my birthday , what did I do ?
I went Ziplining through the forests of Punta Cana .
and I feel like every day that I 'm speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me , I feel like I 'm falling out of that plane .

this access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented .
it gave people amazing content around the globe .
instead you 'd go to the local bar and cheer along with your fellow sports fans there .
if there is an activity that you really enjoy , you 're probably going to like watching other people do it with skill and panache .
instead , what I want you to picture is millions of campfires .
let 's try taking a seat by one of those campfires right now .
ES : so I 'm here at TED with about 1,000 of my closest friends , and we thought we 'd come and join you guys for a little stream .
Cohh : awesome ! it 's great to hear from you guys .
700 people that way -- but it 's great and really it 's just -- ES : so Cohh , what is going on in chat right now ?
the more people that hear about what you do , the better -- for everyone on here .
( applause ) ES : so that was a new way to interact .
and all of this stuff is going to happen around the metaphorical campfire .
today , we know that the heart is not the source of love or the other emotions , per se ; the ancients were mistaken .
as these pictures show , the grieving heart in the middle looks very different than the normal heart on the left .
but a week after the funeral , she looked at his picture and became tearful .

Hey , we have seen a lot of things happen in those 20 years .
political cartoons were born with democracy , and they are challenged when freedom is .
then something happened .
others , including in Israel , say no , it 's just a harsh criticism of Trump , who is shown as blindly following the Prime Minister of Israel .
Roy 's rich language and masterful storytelling earned her the prestigious Booker prize for " The God of Small Things . "
two in particular are iron and zinc .
there 's about one billion people who are zinc deficient .

cattle are already being affected because the quality of their forage is declining .
and , of course , it will be very helpful to know how these changes could affect our future health and the health of our children and the health of our grandchildren .
let 's invest in ourselves , in our children and in our planet .
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half .
the zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based , obviously , on the Hindenburg .
it 's the only Spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .

this is the only fashion cover I 've ever done .
meanwhile , the International Energy Agency , which tracks progress against SDG 7 , defines energy access as 50 kilowatt hours per person per year .
energy will be essential for Africa to adapt to climate change and build resilience .
Africans deserve this , and with one of every four people in the world projected to be African by the year 2100 , the planet needs it .
and so we proposed what 's at the lower diagram .
it 's literally built in a very inexpensive way -- it is a parking garage for books .
for anyone who gets motion sickness , I apologize .
there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle , but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain .
that was the main technology area in the building .
I 'm going to go very , very quickly through this .
now this is the Dallas Theater .
it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere , wherever you place it , the area under it is charged for theatrical performances .
open up entire portions for different kinds of events .
and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money , they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown .

" Europe has a lot of language groups clustered in a relatively small space . "
and of course , when I think of Monday , I 'll think of " Manic Monday " by the Bangles . it 's a good song .
( laughter ) Is it any wonder that our system is so poor ?
you know , most people who engage in corruption know they shouldn 't .
thank you .
I was wrong .
while it 's true that managing tomorrow 's water risk is going to require better data and more technology , today we 're barely using the little water data that we have .
what you might not be aware of is that the US Department of Defense is the world 's largest consumer of jet fuel .
but so far , the US Department of Defense has not been held accountable for PFAS contamination , nor has it been held liable .
and public spending is not going up nearly fast enough .
how many areas could our global community protect through these and other programs ?
why not create opportunities in opportunity zones ?
I quickly took down the number , because it said " flexible hours , " and I needed that to work around my basketball schedule .
and 500 million in East Africa .
the crop is already gone , which results in further poverty and more hunger .
in real life , though , the AI that we actually have is not nearly smart enough for that .
and it turns out that the way AI tends to solve this particular problem is by doing this : it assembles itself into a tower and then falls over and lands at Point B.
it 's really common .
why would it be looking for human fingers if it 's trying to identify a fish ?
but what it looks like happened is the AI was trained to recognize trucks on highway driving , where you would expect to see trucks from behind .
so in other words , we have to be prepared to work with AI that 's not the super @-@ competent , all @-@ knowing AI of science fiction .
my great @-@ grandfather made a living grafting peach orchards in Southeastern Pennsylvania .

with this factory and 100,000 planes a year , we could make all of America 's electricity in about 10 years .
but the Industrial Revolution really complicated our love life .
and the results can be amazing .
I hate the framing of this image .
first , we just don 't have a rational relationship to information , we have an emotional one .
and when we 're fearful , oversimplified narratives , conspiratorial explanations and language that demonizes others is far more effective .
and besides , many of these companies , their business model is attached to attention , which means these algorithms will always be skewed towards emotion .
they 're certainly trying .
they could offer insights around difficult content @-@ moderation decisions .
and what we do know , most of that has been carried out in the US , despite the fact that this is a global problem .
all of these efforts are wonderful , but they 're working in silos , and many of them are woefully underfunded .
and this opens up a question : if the universe is completely governed by these laws , couldn 't a powerful enough computer simulate it exactly ?
but Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy North - a land of witches and man @-@ eaters .

if the difficulty is just a lack of spontaneous desire for party , you know what to do : you put on your party clothes and show up for the party .
so I started with that experiment , I decided , by collecting materials that had a certain quality to them .

but if you lack power , or you know someone who lacks it and needs it , you might grab me by the shoulders and shake me , you 're so pumped .
power moves between us , depending on our roles and status .
some even shared that they had quit recently to work for competitors who paid more .
now , that surprised me at first .
and it also has one of the higher productivity rates as well .
once upon a time , I was a stubborn five @-@ year @-@ old who decided to become a marine biologist .

Jamii Bora understands that and understands that when we 're talking about poverty , we 've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum .
we 're so lucky to have you here with us .
and when you think about the issue of the border , I have more border than any other member of Congress .
so the question , then , is why does the administration continue to do it , when we 've seen 900 additional children separated from their parents since the summer of 2018 ?
that 's the other issue here .
I think we need more immigration judges in order to process these cases , and I think we need to ensure that folks can get representation .
when it comes to the drug issue you 're talking about , yes , it 's in our ports of entry , but it 's also coming in to our shores .
the lock has 100 positions , so Ethic could say " Check the dial 's color , then spin the dial forward once , for 100 repetitions .
that way if the door unlocks on 1 , he doesn 't need to cycle through all the rest of the numbers .
the world is in turmoil : robots have taken over , and only Ethic can set things right .
it took six months before we inspected this rock under a microscope , when one of my mentors at the time , Malcolm Walter , suggested the rock resembled geyserite .
but 100 years after Darwin 's letter , deep @-@ sea hydrothermal vents , or hot vents , were discovered in the ocean .
and this is for good reason : deep @-@ sea vents are well @-@ known in the ancient rock record , and it 's thought that the early Earth had a global ocean and very little land surface .
if the rocks could talk , I suspect they might say this : life on Earth is precious .
on the second of July , 2015 , his life was cut short when he was killed by a trophy hunter .
what if I had met Cecil when I was 10 years old , instead of 29 ?
could I or my classmates have changed his fate ?
when I was growing up , I didn 't even know that wildlife conservation was a career .
this is quite common in Zimbabwe , as many people are not exposed to wildlife , even though it 's part of our heritage .
I made a commitment that day that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals .
I think of my childhood school days in Zimbabwe and the other kids I was in school with .
high interest rates , meanwhile , increase costs for producers and consumers , slowing economic activity .
thank you .
excuse me one second .
Oh . where are you calling from ?
all right . ringer off . everyone wants in on the action .
they 're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method .
by the way , this is something that really bothers me .
it gives you the price , and the location and ratings .
I 've heard there 's something new -- a million times more rad than my phone .
I want an iPhone .
I want to say , " Look -- now I 'm cool " I stood in line and I 'll get mine .
who cares if it 's AT & amp ; T ?
so there and then , and actually with a lot of encouragement from a couple of TEDsters , I declared my own personal war on superbugs .
so let 's talk about superbugs for a moment .
and since then , drug @-@ resistant bacteria have continued to emerge , and so we 've been forced to develop newer and newer drugs to fight these new bacteria .
I 'm sure you 'll recognize at least some of these superbugs .
so it seems pretty clear that we 're not on a good road , and the drugs @-@ based approach to this problem is not working .
we 've actually known this for more than 100 years .
that wavelength is called far @-@ UVC light , and it 's just the short @-@ wavelength part of the ultraviolet spectrum .
and there 's a good , solid physics reason for that : far @-@ UVC light is incredibly , strongly absorbed by all biological materials , so it simply can 't go very far .
what about in practice ?
and we need to do short @-@ term tests , and we need to do long @-@ term tests to make sure you can 't develop melanoma many years on .
or , oh , crap , guess who 's been elected .

[ average age of an American gamer ] It 's older than me .
one stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming in the last sort of 15 , 20 years generally don 't stop .
as you 've been walking through that world , we 've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you 're not in to vanish , and the parts of it in front of you to appear .
and this is my personal favorite .
so , my final plea is really to those engineers , those scientists , those artists in the audience today .
the subsequent power struggle led to a Civil War , which split the country in two .
months after a debilitating stroke left him unable to govern , key members of his military defected to southern forces .
and that gives you a great deal of pleasure , to see them go on .
so you must have patience , and I believe that we must have faith .
sometimes when you get there , there 's almost a let down .
but I 'd want one that could play , too .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with HIV .
fortunately , I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that 's the only way that this work can really occur .
it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves .
it was our mission to serve people .
being inclusive of our audiences -- it 's always been an important part of the company .
and that was some outreach .
and it dawned on me , as we were there , I 'm going like , " Here we are in the seat of Mother Africa , and we 're trying to teach these people how to dance ? "
( laughter ) But it was our African Americanness that they were interested in , and the culture that we had developed over the last 400 years .
she 's exhausted , she 's a queen , and in this section , you 're going to see she is triumphant .
what I want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
and they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum .
we work in clay , which hasn 't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it , and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too .
OK , it 's not marketing ; there 's a very interesting car concept here , but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here .
now , now I get to the point . I want to talk about cars as art .
toothbrush , cool .
but right now it 's in dealing with our own people , our own teams who are doing the creating . so , to my story .
there 's good times ; there 's interesting times ; and there 's some stress times too .
you 've got to do cars in the rain ; you 've got to do cars in the snow .
this is sick beyond belief .
( laughter ) But because of this , the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension , a new meaning .
we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it , that I only had a phone number that connected me to them .
the bathroom was so big , she built the bed over the bathtub -- it 's quite fascinating .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in Tiburon , which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon ?
and so I had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
so I didn 't know any of this , and we got a presentation that had an agenda , looked like this .
you 're letting me down , you 're my designers , you 're supposed to be the creative ones , what the hell is going on around here ? "
love is not selfish . " and I thought about this , and I thought , " You know , I 'm not showing love here . I 'm seriously not showing love .
this CANNOT be . this CANNOT be that I 'm expecting a certain number of sketches , and to me that 's my quantification method for qualifying a team .
one of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs , the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that .
and so , in conclusion , my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you , was this one here . I 'm also going to steal a little quote out of " Little Prince . "
and The Police 's " Synchronicity " cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz .
and there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
and , lastly , under " Harmony , " they had this 13th @-@ century mandala from Tibet .
and I felt a little bit cheated , because the visualization -- that 's a really easy thing to do .
you know , that 's not a big deal to accomplish .
you don 't see the horizon .
people 's demeanor changes when they go in there .
and he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers , large ones and small ones .
( laughter ) I think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good .
you know , one is : just working without pressure .
and then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far .
" you have maligned a great woman . "
it 's called " The Neighbor . "
God knows though , there are worse twists your obsessions can take .
the girls , to my horror , averted their gaze .
still , to be able to die with no special contrition , not having been slaughtered , or enslaved .
it should be opinion @-@ driven ; less news , more views .
so now , on the following movie you will see that I 'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English .
enjoy , and thank you very much .
UE : the purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles .
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer , mocked it up in cardboard , we 'd come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
( laughter ) Anyway , I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype , and it 's called the Bambi prototype .
they didn 't want to go to a componentized system .
that scene sounds like science fiction , but is battlefield reality already .
the soldier in that case was a 42 @-@ pound robot called a PackBot .
we went in with zero unmanned ground systems . we now have 12,000 .
and the tech term " killer application " takes on new meaning in this space .
that 's where we 're at right now .
the U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now , but we know that in technology there 's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .
and this raises a bigger worry for me .
or another way of thinking about this is , what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India ?
we don 't have a draft . we don 't have declarations of war anymore .
they also record everything that they see .
but we have to remember , these are just the clips .
they lose the strategy .
as anyone who 's played Grand Theft Auto knows , we do things in the video world that we wouldn 't do face to face .
are we going to face the reality of 21st century war ?
and now , we 're using our creativity in a certain direction , to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities , maybe even one day an entirely new species .
my story begins when I opened the holy book for the first time ...
and I got to grow up in that environment .
you can -- if you love anything , you can work hard and you can accomplish anything you want .
they cried .
and cried .
I remember as the youngest of these five kids feeling heard for the first time .
so I 'd get this beta software and hardware from places like HP and Sun and Russell Brown at Adobe .
and I had no manual , so I 'd figure it out and I fell in love with it even more .
( laughter ) Always listen to your parents .
( laughter ) I wanted to be Zemeckis , Lucas and Spielberg .
the last thing I wanted to talk about was my own cultural identity , my ethnicity .
and then a couple years ago , I felt a little bit lost , creatively .
I heard from voices from the sky ...
OK , fine , it was Twitter .
and then I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I am Hollywood .
I felt lucky to be here , but at this moment , I realized that I was not just lucky to be here , I had the right to be here .
also , some tech founders out here started to post stuff on social media , write stuff about us in articles in the " LA Times , " in " The Hollywood Reporter " and " Entertainment Weekly . "
what an amazing thing to witness .
it became more physical when I went to the movie theater .
film was a gift given to me , and through the years I 've learned a lot of things .
I got to be who I wanted to be when I needed to be it .
and as I was doing the finishing touches on this talk , I realized that all the powerful connections in my life were through generosity and kindness and love and hope .
so I have a challenge for myself and for anyone here .
in fact , our future depends on it .
turns out , it really is all about location , location , location .
and I 'm here to tell you that nanoparticles are the fire trucks .
and they will continue to circulate in the blood , giving them more time to find the tumor .
and here we see the cancer drug , the firefighters , inside the fire truck , the nanoparticles .
there are certain very important but sensitive drugs that are easily degraded by enzymes in the blood .
and here we see the illustration of blocking the liver .
and that ends with a little clip of my father , of Lou , talking about something that is very dear to him , which is the accidents of life .
and those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what , to me , is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka , Bangladesh .
we were the first film crew in there .
NK : do you know anything about the architect ?
NK : thank you .
he is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
and this is the largest project he has got in here , the poorest country in the world .
but he was also human .
there is no other shortcut , no other way to really understand him .
but I think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that 's why , he has given love for us .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
despite that , 15 years ago , I left medical school , as I missed mathematics .
since then , I 've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data .
wow . ( laughs ) And sigh , and , whoo , going to get blown away there .
it would be really nice if there was just one chemical that they detected , but it 's not that simple .
so let 's stay as calm as possible . that would be great .
now three of the socks have been worn by children who were uninfected , and just one of the socks was worn by a child who was infected with malaria .
( laughter ) But it is really incredible , and when we do this , what we find is that these dogs can correctly tell us when somebody is infected with malaria 81 percent of the time .
( music : Richard Strauss " Also Sprach Zarathustra " ) Right ?
and if you couldn 't predict , you died .
( laughter ) You 're creating the meaning and projecting it onto me .
if you 're a conservative , you become more conservative .
and it 's the experience of awe .
and for thousands of years , we 've been thinking and writing and experiencing awe , and we know so little about it .
it 's becoming asymmetrical in its activity , biased towards the right , which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world , as opposed to step back .
well , others have demonstrated , for instance , Professors Haidt and Keltner , have told us that people feel small but connected to the world .
they actually seek risk , and they are better able at taking it .
they were more likely to give a positive response after the performance than they were [ before ] .
to enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty .
and the results are actually incredibly positive .
so where can we find awe , given how important it is ?
I know what it 's like to have the government say , " We 're going to kill you in the morning . "
it does not work in the long run .
part of the problem from creating us versus them is it 's hard to do .
accusing , attacking , on behalf of we the people .
these are absurdities .
and we 're looking at a bunch of statistics , but I want you to understand , this is happening to the housekeeper who brought up your kids .
this is happening to the gardener who took care of your house .
and the danger in this stuff is once you start normalizing absurdities and atrocities , people think that those instruments are legitimate .
some of them are immigrants .
this isn 't about kids and borders .
we would have been at that bridge in Selma .
in order to predict effectively , we need to use science .
but if you show them that it 's in their interest , then they 're responsive .
Sally 's giving her opinion to them , and they 're giving their opinion to Sally .
but Sally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three , and what they 're saying to Harry .
with five decision @-@ makers there are a lot of linkages -- 120 , as a matter of fact , if you remember your factorials .
five factorial is 120 .
now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep 120 things straight in their head .
does that mean we 've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know , from 120 to 240 ?
no . how about 10 times ?
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information .
and everybody 's best friend , Ahmadinejad . how are things going for him ?
you take a look at this , this is not based on statistics .
I want to be very clear here . I 'm not projecting some past data into the future .
and then the model makes predictions down the road .
that 's not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they 're not put under international pressure , if they 're allowed to pursue their own devices .
but in any event , by the end of this year , beginning of next year , we get to a stable equilibrium outcome .
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today , this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 , early parts of 2011 .
that power disappears completely ; nobody supports that by 2011 .
these folks are the moneyed interests in Iran , the bankers , the oil people , the bazaaries .
they are growing in political clout , as the mullahs are isolating themselves -- with the exception of one group of mullahs , who are not well known to Americans .
he is on the way down .
OK , so I 'd like you to take a little away from this .
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable .
I would like to leave you with one thought , which is for me , the dominant theme of this gathering , and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world .
I love that you put it out there .
ca : so you 're kind of trying to say , " People of Iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . "
ca : here 's hoping they hear it that way . thank you very much Bruce .
BBM : thank you .
I 'm from Detroit .
here 's the thing : because of Detroit 's recent history , it now finds itself with some very unique assets , open land being one of them .
they further go on to say that 40 square miles of the city is vacant .
so Detroit has this -- open land , fertile soil , proximity to water , willing labor and a desperate demand for healthy , fresh food .
and these aren 't plots of land where we 're just growing tomatoes and carrots either .
keep Growing Detroit is a nonprofit organization that had a lot to do with those farms .
my city is a long way from succeeding .
they never gave up .
when I was little , my sister and I would have contests to see who could spell " M @-@ i @-@ s @-@ s @-@ i @-@ s @-@ s @-@ i @-@ p @-@ p @-@ i " the fastest .
today , as a physical organic chemist , I 'm committed to use my training to help protect rivers , like the Mississippi , from excessive salt that can come from human activity .
if we add one teaspoon of salt to this Olympic @-@ size swimming pool of ocean water , the ocean water stays ocean water .
so the point here is , because rivers , the volume is so small compared to the oceans , it is especially vulnerable to human activity , and we need to take care to protect them .
the authors of this paper postulate that this could be due to using salt to deice roads .
and these membranes are negatively charged , and help to repel the negatively charged chloride ions that are in that dissolved salt .
even more than that , actually .
now , I 've introduced this to a number of industrial @-@ water users , and the common response is , " Yeah , but who is going to use my salt ? "
so you can see how circular salt can provide a barrier to our rivers from this excessive salty discharge .
for the same reason , big things are not much affected by small parts of themselves , i.e. , by details .
I could tell you story after story , but I haven 't forgotten Fernando .
children and parents live in family units and clusters of families are housed together .
they keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do .
and what all of them had in common was that as they slept , they 'd all been bitten by the only mammal that lives exclusively on a diet of blood : the vampire bat .
can we stop them ?
but it also means that those jumps between species , which are so important to understand , but so rare for most viruses , for rabies , they 're actually happening by the thousands .
" who 's been getting bitten by a bat lately ? "
and so all we had to do was go to the right house , open up a net and show up at night , and wait until the bats tried to fly in and feed on human blood .
so my second question was this : could we somehow cut the virus off at its source ?
and from genome sequences that we got from the viruses in those cow brains , I was able to work out that this is a virus that spreads between 10 and 20 miles each year .
it 's that vaccinating the animal source is the only thing that stops rabies .
so , can we vaccinate bats ?
it might sound like a crazy question , but the good news is that we actually already have edible rabies vaccines that are specially designed for bats .
and what 's even better is that these vaccines can actually spread from bat to bat .
now we have a whole laundry list of questions .
what time of the year do we need to be vaccinating ?
but it was very painful at times and continues to be so .
an imam was present who made it clear that their religion was wrong , and the only good path was to accept Islam and marry a Muslim man .
these women and girls are healing .
in her book , " Woman at Point Zero , " she wrote , " Life is very hard , and the only people who really live are those who are harder than life itself . "
because I share their sorrow , their language and their culture , we connect on the deepest human level .
you are .
and what I 've noticed is that most people 's stories tend to circle around two key themes .
" Oh , yeah ? when ? "
she asked me what she should do .
so what I want to do is I want to edit this woman 's letter together , right here , as a way to show how we can all revise our stories .
so the guy looks at his ink blot and he says , " Well , I definitely don 't see blood . "
I have a confession to make .
they 're the people who , when you try to offer them a suggestion , they reject it with , " Yeah , no , that will never work , because ... "
Jon Michael Reese : " the world is thinking wrong about race . "
and across the street , a happy slave life , in the form of 150 Southern black performers , picking cotton , singing and dancing minstrel shows in a recreated antebellum attraction called Old Plantation .
when I first encountered this story , I understood from my own life experience what was at stake to have members of the African diaspora see each other like this .
and so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do .
that molecule is there , and they 're making light .
what 's important for today 's talk is we know there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions .
it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies .
and we think by studying bacteria , we 're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body .
when we delved deeper , we realized that lack of accountability is at the core of it .
" we assure you that you will get your free drugs each time . "
and finally , we worked with elected representatives to launch these revived PHCs , who shared the citizen promises with the community with a lot of fanfare .
and how do you convince the mothers to actually bring their children for immunization ?
and a great way to trigger the motivation is to increase transparency to the citizen .
understanding this ancient type of biological computation is the critical first step .
and if we can realize this , we would enter in the era of an operating system that runs living software .
but mortal guards and ordinary weapons wouldn 't suffice , so the visionary god devised an indomitable new defender .
made of gleaming bronze ; endowed with superhuman strength , and powered by Ichor , the life fluid of the gods , this automaton was unlike anything Hephaestus had forged before .
Medea 's promise resonated deep within his core .
none of these creations were as famous as TALOS , who appeared on Greek coins , vase paintings , public frescoes , and in theatrical performances .
the web , mobile devices , virtual and augmented reality were rescripting our nervous systems .
to answer this , I had to build a machine .
( laughter ) I 've been developing an open @-@ source biometric lab , an AI system which I call the limbic Lab .
the more imprints added to the database across mediums from episodic television to games , the better the predictive models become .
this process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
and whale oil lit practically every building .
both national competitiveness and national security are at risk .
and serious competition from Europe , from Korea , and next is China , which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .
and after that comes India .
will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil , or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars ?
that seems to make more sense .
and we 'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year .
it 's financeable in the private capital market .
and these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
they make a little net money for the treasury .
let me focus a minute on the light vehicles , the cars and light trucks , because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here drives one .
so then of the energy that does get to the wheels , only an eighth of it , half of that , goes to heat the tires on the road , or to heat the air the car pushes aside .
so there 's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter .
ours is on the demand side .
so you 're six years old , you 're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves , and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world : Dwarves and Prince Charmings .
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK .
( laughter ) So this whole subject @-@ object thing has relevance to humor in this way .
I 'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) And you know people , this is the problem with quote , objectivity , unquote .
when you 're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you , or share the same set of assumptions as you , you start to think that that 's reality .
and this is instead of contradiction .
( laughter ) But here 's how I think I like to make change , and that is in making connections .
and they look quite similar .
it 's different , very different from the surrounding buildings , because other buildings are trying to build a wall around the nature .
but what we 're trying to do here is to make the building itself as a part of nature , so we can extend the nature from the park into the city .
that looks very fit into this painting .
it 's nature .
so architecture is no longer a functional machine for living .
this video went viral and infected the net .
they are monitored by private security firms in order to ensure that they don 't talk to journalists .
here 's a short clip of our film .

( video ) ( Air strike sounds ) ( Explosion ) ( People speaking in Arabic ) MR : yeah , we did some blurring for you .
civil rights groups often do not have any better option to quickly make their recordings accessible to a large audience than by uploading them to social media .
HB : yeah , I 'm more the opposite , I have zero interest in naked breasts or naked bodies at all .
( music ) We need to watch for it .
that is actually the device .
we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience , which will create the new world .
but a lot has to happen to these devices before they 're ready for any kind of code .
because without chemistry , what is an information superhighway that we love , would just be a really expensive , shiny paperweight .
chemistry enables all of these layers .
let 's start at the display .
well , I 'll tell you .
well it turns out it can do a lot more than just that .
but once true 5G is here , it 's going to be a lot more than how many movies we can put on our device .
think about building a house of Lego blocks , with all of the nooks and crannies that latch together , as opposed to smooth building blocks .
so Jewish activists studied and taught it to their children , raising the first native speakers in nearly 100 generations .
by the 1990s , Cornish had reawakened , but it wasn 't thriving .
( laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And the more they publish , the more they inspire other Tunica people to get involved .
when these solar storms are moving in space , some of them will inevitably encounter space probes that we humans have sent in order to explore other worlds .
what I mean by other worlds is , for example , planets , such as Venus or Mercury , but also objects , such as comets .
and while these space probes have been made for different scientific endeavors , they can also act like tiny cosmic meteorological stations and monitor the evolution of these space storms .
on a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon , I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .
you don 't do it as a human being . you do it as a machine .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electrons , something interesting happens .
just it doesn 't burn . it consumes itself step after step after step .
in Europe where taxes are in place , that 's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
he said hybrids are like mermaids .
that 's all the U.S. usage today .
for them to get a battery that goes 120 miles is an extension on range , not a reduction in range .
we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the U.S.
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
in Denmark , we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills , not from oil .
and we said , " What if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? "
and they said , " We tried . there isn 't any . "
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we 'll recover him .
( laughter ) He actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
200 years ago , in Parliament , in Great Britain , there was a long argument over economy versus morality .
came from a source of energy that was immoral : human slaves .
and what would it do to our economy ?
and the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth .
( music plays " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " ) ( quadcopters make tones ) I think they say , " Hello . "
and time to land .
( applause ) OK , guys , time to go home .
and you know , I saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
what we 're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .
to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that .
it didn 't happen .
and pretty soon it 's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .
the way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes , so we go from 46 to 47 or 48 .
that is simply not going to happen .
and they depend too much upon history , upon philosophy , upon religion , upon culture , upon politics .
and to lose touch with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health .
where there is this bloody , awful mess happens .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
so much carbon , so every year , roughly five billion tons of carbon from plants go into this network underground .
now this is where you need to understand that , like humans , plants and fungi are incredibly opportunistic .
there 's also evidence that the fungi are good at inflating the price of nutrients .
so rather than photosynthesizing , tap into the network , steal the carbon and give nothing in return .
so our group helped pioneer a method , a technology , whereby we could tag nutrients with nanoparticles , fluorescing nanoparticles called quantum dots .
this is important , because it suggests that evolving a trade partnership in nature can help organisms cope with the uncertainty of accessing resources .
our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin .
but in China it is a very different thing .
so this life plan shows the steps for us to secure our land , our biodiversity , our culture , our education .
and we have been trying to scream to the world that we need to protect our territory , our nature .
I guess this crisis is teaching humanity that now you need to listen to us and to support indigenous peoples directly , to support their initiatives directly .
you know , back in the late ' 80s , this Big Mac clamshell was the symbol of a garbage crisis .
the last 10 years , I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers .
but it all sounded intriguing to me because it brought me back to my roots .
me and my team thought , reusables ?
the kitchen area is dirty and grimy .
their behavior .
and make it from recycled office paper .
they care , they have passion , we 're just not different .
collaborate with them on solutions that could work for society and for business .
now , animal rights , obviously they don 't want animals used for meat .
but I really thought we could learn a lot .
and so I set up a breakfast meeting in New York City .
( laughter ) And I 'm just going to stick to the pastries .
and that is , they said , " You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin . "
and she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities .
so I end up meeting her , and she 's the very best type of critic , in a sense that she just loves the animals , wants to protect them , but she also understands the reality of the meat business .
by the way , two of McDonald 's suppliers lost business because they didn 't meet our standards .
and by the way , soy is a key ingredient for chicken feed , and that 's the connection to McDonald 's .
and I said , " How about working together ? "
and during our discussions , you couldn 't really tell , I don 't think , who was from Greenpeace and who was from McDonald 's .
now , you think these types of collaborations that I 've described would be commonplace today .
I was born premature . I was always very small .
if I have an art , it 's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me .
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left , maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible .
and so his entire body really is underwater .
I looked a lot like an orangutan , our close cousins , or the Incredible Hulk .
she was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice .
she came back . she goes , " Come on . I don 't have all day . "
and then I took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships .
that photo is of the semi @-@ finals of the Buenos Aires championships , four months later .
it 's pretty simple . there are nine , sort of , rules that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing .
the interesting thing about this climb is it 's not that hard .
but if you 're the leader on it , at the hardest move , you 're looking at about 100 foot fall , onto some low angle slabs .
so you 've got to focus .
this is a climb in the Needles , again in California .
fear really sucks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing .
so don 't hang on till the bitter end .
thank you very much .
just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the tallest models are about two or three feet high .
that one on the right is about five feet high .
the work involves hundreds of different crochet models .
and if the bleaching doesn 't go away -- if the temperatures don 't go down -- reefs start to die .
and they said they were having an exhibition about artists ' response to global warming , and they 'd like our coral reef to be part of it .
I 've written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times .
and I went home , and I told my sister Christine .
and she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A. ' s major art colleges , CalArts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square @-@ foot gallery .
and to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center 's 3,000 square foot gallery .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
so we went and taught the techniques . we did workshops and lectures .
why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
and they have different properties .
you all have a sense of what a flat space is , Euclidean space is .
that 's our definition of a parallel line .
and I have a point outside the line . how many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line ?
they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness , it 's called a geodesic .
so we ask the question again , " How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? "
but that 's only because I 'm projecting it onto a flat surface .
how could they see this ?
it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered Euclidean space .
I can touch it . I can play with it . "
they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
it also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and couldn 't do , what they thought it could and couldn 't represent .
we started out , Chrissy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathematically perfect models .
and all of our contributors , who are an amazing collection of people around the world , do their own embellishments .
we have these technologies . we use them .
but you can do it through playing with material objects .
and the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
so it would seem sensible to guess the lowest number possible .
economic game theorists have a way of modeling this interplay between rationality and practicality called k @-@ level reasoning .
in each case , participants must weigh their own understanding of the best course of action against how well they think other participants understand the situation .
instead , I 'm going to begin with me in graduate school in New Jersey in the mid @-@ 1990s , earnestly studying US history , which is what I currently teach as a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee .
but I realize now , they were also kind of a problem .
they work hard .
now , these are , of course , arguments that we hear every day .
immigrants and their advocates use them as they confront those who would deny immigrants their rights or even exclude them from society .
how can we use immigrants ?
the nativist answer to this question is no , immigrants have little or nothing to offer .
here , again , the nativist answer is no , immigrants are permanently different from us and inferior to us .
but the distinction itself is at the heart of the way nations define themselves .
it 's reinforced in everyday ways that we talk and act and behave , down to the bordered maps that we hang up in our schoolrooms .
the problem with this worldview is that it just doesn 't correspond to the way the world actually works , and the way it has worked in the past .
but so have immigrants .
second , we need to ask questions about responsibility .
global inequality is a wrenching , intensifying problem .
when immigrants send money or goods home to their family , it plays a significant role in narrowing these gaps , if a very incomplete one .
thank you .
( applause ) Bhakti Sharma : imagine , in the scorching Rajasthan heat , on a hot summer afternoon , a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year @-@ old riding on a moped behind her mom , not knowing where they were headed .
and so I have given over 25 years of my life to this sport , during which I have swum in all five oceans of the world , crossed the English Channel -- which is also known as the Mount Everest of swimming -- and set a world record in the freezing Antarctic ocean .
when you win a medal or set a world record , this mirror shows the happiness that you and your loved ones feel , but also reflects the tears that you shed all by yourself , alone in the water .
every stroke felt like pulling through oil .
but with that thought , also came a stronger , a more willful voice from deep within .
" now one more . "
so I took a second and a third stroke .
SRK : but what is your next goal as a swimmer ?
even the most common type , osteoarthritis , is trickier to prevent than one might think .
it 's a general misconception that arthritis is confined to old age .
this leads to the flood of enzymes and degradation seen in osteoarthritis , but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cytokines .
to a technique called microfracture , where surgeons create small holes in the bone , allowing bone marrow stem cells to leak out and form new cartilage .
but even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition , not the cause .
and the mission and the magic begin .
a typical day in space starts with the perfect commute .
so we take our urine , we store it , we filter it and then we drink it .
and it 's actually delicious .
the stark contrast between the poverty and desperation on one side of the border and the conspicuous wealth on the other always feels jarring .
I had a signed authorization to act as Anna 's attorney , so I rushed over to the port of entry to see if I could speak with my client .
seeing these horrors day in and day out has changed me .
more than 900 children have been taken from their parents since June of 2018 .
but even those who would be refugees under the international definition are not going to win asylum in the United States .
these refugees , many of whom are families , are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world , where they 're being raped , kidnapped and extorted by criminal groups .
but those of us in a position to advocate for those changes are too busy suing our government to keep the meager legal protections that refugees enjoy under the current law .
we need to call our elected representatives and demand these changes .
and it is our belief that if you want to find disruptive growth in the market , you have to go to the consumer and take a very agnostic view of the consumer .
gender is easy . it 's easy to design advertising based on gender , it 's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender .
this is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
this was eight years ago , some people were more Republican back then .
there is a big difference .
and likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , " Would you not vote for a qualified black president ? "
it 's about who you live with .
especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups .
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country , or of another racial group .
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
but the point is , this is all good news , because when something is predictable , it is what I call designable .
and I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis .
and when Shea wasn 't driving the bus , she would be watching over Zion , making sure she was studying .
from the Monongahela River to the Flint River , in the words of W.E.B. Du Bois , " The town , the whole valley , has turned its back upon the river .
General Motors has been cited for dumping chemicals in the Flint River for decades .
amber and I bonded over our battles with lupus .
the 30 @-@ foot billboard is made of three large color negatives with the message " Water Is Life , " spelled out in Nestle water bottles by The Sister Tour .
I also continued to keep it in the public eye by producing countdown flags that were raised on institutions across the country .
Moses , an officer , Ranger , veteran , was very clear about his water rescue mission : bring relief of free , clean water to the people in Flint .
it mechanically creates condensation , which produces 2,000 gallons of water per day .
I 've been at the machine , interviewing people , asking them , " What does it mean to see Moses and his machine in [ your ] community ? "
and , " What has it been like living without access to clean water ? "
no matter how dark a situation may be , a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive .
it can be something that they love , something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity .
as teachers , we work every day to provide support socially , emotionally and academically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances .
like most teachers , I have students who go home every day , and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy , well @-@ rounded meal for them .
they come to school with trauma , and when I go home every day , that goes home with me .
I think back to my undergraduate training at the University of Georgia , where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed .
I had a student who I 'll call " David . "
and it was on the last day of school , I told David to have a great summer .
so I changed almost everything about my teaching .
he started acting out in school because all he wanted was for his family to be together again .
and I needed someone to listen , somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend .
but when it comes to teaching professionals , that urgency is lagging .
they call it " secondary trauma " and " compassion fatigue , " the concept that we absorb the traumas our students share with us each day .
and after a while , our souls become weighed down by the heaviness of it all .
they found that approximately one in 10 reported clinically significant depressive symptoms .
they invite in community yoga teachers , they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together .
these schools are making space for conversations that matter .
the chain that hangs in my classroom is more than just a decoration .
they remember what they wrote on it .
and they have hope .
somebody to reach out and make sure that we 're OK .
every now and then , we all just need a little help holding the stapler .
thank you .
it was a fantastic new pink suit with big buttons and shoulder pads .
embarrassingly enough , I finished up with " If not this , what ?
if not us , who ?
and if not now , when ? "
the problem was that no one knew what they were expected to do .
and most importantly , they didn 't know that I needed them .
now , B Corps are a group of companies who believe in business as a force for good .
and the leaders in this space are doing a few things very differently from traditional heroic leaders .
interdependent leaders , on the other hand , start with a goal that 's really important , but is actually impossible to achieve by one company or one person alone .
they don 't see that their responsibility ends when a customer buys their clothes .
until 2014 , there was no protection for these workers .
once you 've seen problems like this , you can 't unsee them , so you have to ask others to help you to solve them .
the second big difference for collaborators is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan .
I remember the day really clearly .
heroes like making speeches .
people lean back in their chairs , maybe impressed but not engaged .
they know that meetings are not just mindless calendar fillers .
it 's where people collaborate and communicate and share ideas .
so we changed the way we ran our innovation and planning meetings in two important ways .
and I was the foreigner , and I was the boss and I apparently had that intimidating hero look .
and it 's not compelling and it 's not even interesting .
so , we changed it and we created these full @-@ day marketplaces , kind of like a big bazaar .
so I 'm immediately in interdependence land .
my dream is that one day , someone will stand on this stage and tell you how radical interdependence saved my beloved rhinos .
it requires us to be open and transparent and vulnerable , and that 's not what traditional leaders have been trained to do .
I thought that in the elevation and separation that comes from heroic leadership , that I would be untouchable .
this is an illusion .
and if we 're going to solve the challenges that the world is facing today , we have no alternative , so we had better start getting good at it .
thank you .
fifteen years ago , I completely changed both what I worked with and how I worked after a revelatory collaboration with a biologist .
our project gave me a different perspective on life , introducing a whole new world of possibility around how we can design and make things .
literally , fabricating with biology .
my own journey in biofabrication started with a project called " Biocouture . "
using a certain species of bacteria in a nutrient @-@ rich liquid , we fermented threads of cellulose that self @-@ organized into a sheet of fabric .
I dried the fabric I had grown and cut and sewed it into a range of garments , shoes and bags .
in fact , there 's a growing global community of innovators rethinking materials with biology .
they have higher melt temperatures than plastics .
the bacteria produce crystals that form around each grain of sand , locking together all the loose particles to form a solid brick .
we 're just beginning to realize the potential of nature @-@ based technologies .
in the last century , we expected material innovation to come from the likes of DuPont , Dow , BASF .
now , my wife and I agree on a lot of things , but using Uber was definitely not one of them .
if , in any market , you dramatically increase supply , you should expect prices , profitability and growth to go down for existing players .
where online marketplaces , like Gojek in Indonesia or Jumia in Africa , have helped their business ecosystems and the communities around them .
online marketplaces will continue to grow .
as a strategy consultant , I study businesses for a living .
for drivers and passengers , you get Uber , Grab in Southeast Asia or Didi in China .
for example , if you 're a taxi driver in San Francisco and you decide to work 10 hours per day , then you 're actually having a paying passenger in your car for four hours out of the 10 .
this is the same car becoming 40 percent more productive .
by design , they create more value for the economy .
you can give it to the drivers -- more passengers , more income .
the negative externality of Uber cars becoming more productive is taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop by as much as 30 percent in New York , for example .
then , maybe , a motorbike or a traditional taxi that you can order and pay for from within the same app .
and one of the reasons for that is because they have decided to actively invest in African entrepreneurs , to grow them into the digital age .
he wanted to be independent .
some common ideas include Captain Hook , Harry Potter and many well @-@ known characters in Chinese literature .
we are realizing that this is true .
there is so much information ; what do you do ?
how do you decide what is important ?
so what we built of course , Ushahidi , is crowdsourcing this information .
this is the kind of innovation that is , quite frankly -- it 's interesting that it 's coming from Africa .
higher than the likes of Singapore , countries in North America and even countries in Europe .
milk in India is produced by marginal milk farmers , with two or three cows or buffalos , who produce five to ten liters of milk a day .
Raj and I built a simple data intelligence platform that allowed us to map all the recyclers , giving us a bird 's eye view of every recycler in Hyderabad .
today , Banyan 's recycled granules have undergone stringent quality testing and have been certified by top global FMCG and automotive companies .
when I was young , I used to -- ( sings in Hindi ) .
so tell me , are you making a lot of money ?
and we 're very fortunate to have signed a really big , multimillion @-@ dollar contract with some of the top FMCG companies .
and just to give you some context , 27 percent of women work in India .
if you look at most of Asia , that number is around 48 percent .
so we heralded a group of mothers @-@ in @-@ law and a few mothers into the office , and we took them to our R and D labs .
do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries ?
so this leads me to my third question : " what do your elected officials know about nuclear weapons , and what types of decisions are they likely to take on your behalf ? "
ask them , " How would you choose to spend US national treasure ?
on a new nuclear arms race or another national security priority , such as cybersecurity or climate change ? "
after all , this is " national security . "
and the answer can 't be " Because they 're super rich and they live in your zip code . "
are those your kids ? they 're so cute .
Oh , that 's a great school , are you guys very involved there ?
Oh , at Santa Clara , that 's awesome .
I know this sounds a tad mercenary .
right ?
you don 't get extra points for knowing how to use Google .
I 'm looking for , like , a thumbs up , thumbs down .
what is the need ? "
once you 've made the ask -- " Would you consider supporting us at the 10,000 @-@ dollar level ?
let 's explore what these new medicines are made of , how they 're different and what 's causing this incoming tidal wave of new and exciting medicines .
breast milk is kind of miraculous : in addition to containing nutrients for the baby , it seems to contain food for the good microbes as well .
in the spring , I 'd smell the heady fragrance of lilacs .
an enzyme is a protein that 's a catalyst , it speeds up or accelerates a chemical reaction , just as the chymosin over here is accelerating the curdling of the milk .
those improved ones become our version 1.0s.
for example , Januvia , which is a medication to treat type 2 diabetes , is made partially with enzymes .
so now I 'm going to get back to the demo -- this is the fun part .
now , we were surprised when we won the New South Wales Entrepreneur of the Year in the young category for entrepreneurs under 40 .
at 65 , he had been running his business for 40 years .
( laughter ) Now , this was a pretty big light bulb moment for me for two reasons .
and two , I realized it doesn 't go away with any form of success .
in the early days , I was flying back and forth to San Francisco every week for Atlassian , and I racked up a lot of frequent flyer points and got access to the Qantas business lounge .
and if they don 't freeze , and they 're thankful , and they work harder and they stretch to be the best partner they can , it 's likely to be a very successful relationship .
so if you have this feeling , don 't freeze .
and in doing so , I managed to kick a very small rock off a very big hill that turned into an avalanche that I found myself tumbling in the middle of .
they know when the water is way too deep , and they 're not afraid to ask for advice .
but the problem persists .
and I think , as you 'll see , there 's reasons for optimism , because I believe that the best is yet to come .
and by that I mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people .
well let 's take a look . let 's take a look at the Great Depression .
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies .
and so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited , as a consequence , in their language abilities at an older age .
this lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed .
it is the basis of our real differentiation , one individual from another .
it 's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that 's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon .
and 700 or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails .
we can look down in the brain of the monkey .
in other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body .
the monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces .
now actually we 've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task .
this is constructed by physical change .
think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general .
what it 's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain .
it 's what you pay attention to .
it 's what 's rewarding to you .
it 's what the brain regards , itself , as positive and important to you .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we 're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .
most of them would be intellectual and academic failures .
the child 's native language is such a case is not English .
such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain .
of course they will . because as a receiver of language , they are receiving it and representing it , and in information it 's representing crap .
and learning modulation and control is deteriorating .
this results in declines in memory in cognition , and in postural ability and agility .
it means that most people who are at risk for senility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position .
I 'm specifically interested in things like autism , and cerebral palsy , these great childhood catastrophes .
and of course , a well @-@ ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key .
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here , I thought to myself that well , it 's TED .
and then I thought no , no . I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because , after all , this is the great unveiling .
Oh my ! there 's so many of you .
( laughter ) She has me here because she puts me in her show , what she calls her one @-@ woman show .
frankly , I 'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this , you know .
really , it 's amazing .
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities .
and she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe .
I noticed it 's very multicultural .
well , I don 't know how else to say it to you , so I 'll just say it my way : the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the , you know , the bankers and the Wall Street . you know it .
congratulations . Mazel tov .
thank you everybody .
I am Dominican @-@ American .
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath .
but then on top of that , you know , Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes .
so then I 'm like , should I be nervous , you know , because maybe it 's better .
and I 'm just trying not to panic and freak out . so I like , take a deep breath .
and , like , people would not believe , seriously , where I 'm from , that this even exists .
I like that .
and actually , I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything .
at my school -- actually I was part of co @-@ founding an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
so , basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican @-@ American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is , basically , we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me .
I mean , I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different , whatever .
right now it 's very exciting actually for me because I 'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that 's my new title .
so , I 'm very happy that you 're , you know , doing this kind of thing , making the talks available online .
for example , a friend of mine .
but then , I decided , just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , I try anyway .
but my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly .
so , I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend .
she said , " No Mom . I mean , I don 't like boys . I like girls .
so , I always teach my kids to respect American ideas , but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- ( Laughter ) -- that she is not gay , she is just confused by this American problem .
I am originally from Jordan .
but I feel a bit like a fish out of water .
so you will get the extra credit I promised you .
sometimes it was a little too fast , sometimes a little too slow .
Bouvard knew that his predictions were perfect .
the ill effects are suffered by all , rich and poor , city people and village folks , those inland and those on the coast .
in 2017 , more than 1.2 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution .
but we 're now up to 55 countries in the world , have had this virus emerge , in either birds , or people or both .
alright , so I 've got you nervous .
so there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher .
but we 're not there . and there hasn 't been the kind of investment to get us there .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than I 'd anticipated .
[ green is the new black ... ] ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I like that , too .
( laughter ) There started our 70 percent .
result ?
so I started asking a very simple question : what does it mean to you to be a good woman or a good man today ?
I 'm going to talk only about the middle and upper classes , because we are the ones most in denial .
for example , I do tell my daughter sometimes , " Yaar Tu hasti hai to mujhe accha lagta hai varna Bura lagta hai . "
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
this is the machine below Geneva .
it 's moved up again . the groups are more fragmented .
and how people act and react to speed varies by culture and among different people within the same culture .
sometimes , we 'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster .
so as we zoom into the future , let 's consider setting the technologies of speed , the purpose of speed and our expectations of speed to a more human pace .
those very same lights we see all the way from space are shining up into the atmosphere , where they bounce around and create this featureless smog of light .
alright , I want to be clear that there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of this modern technology .
and when these concepts underlie our teaching and what we think about the world , then we have a problem , because we stymie support for everything .
the arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity .
infrastructure , museums , theaters , movie houses across the country are disappearing .
we have more television stations with less to watch , we have more money spent on rewrites to get old television programs in the movies .
so we have to really stop and think : what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts ?
I just want to tell you quickly what I 'm doing -- ( Applause ) I want to tell you what I 've been doing a little bit since ...
my mother always told me , you have to be observant , know what 's going on in your mind and your body .
and as a dancer , I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body , just as I knew how to sense colors .
that 's the work I 've been doing now , as a company called BioSentient Corporation .
the arts and sciences are not separate .
but nothing 's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action .
as you can see the little tether , that it 's also magnetically levitated .
so as you turn around you 're seeing different colors .
and so I placed one more element of each one of them .
it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture , and then putting it into a communication system .
it has Buckminster Fuller 's Dymaxion Map edited here .
and then , this is like projects that are harder to build .
in the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests .
so if we could roll the next film here .
so it could land in a park , for example .
and then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
( laughter ) Video : actor : clean coal -- you 've heard a lot about it .
Al Gore : finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
video : narrator : it 's about repowering America .
for the first time , I identified as somebody living with depression , and I felt good about it -- like I wasn 't a bad person for it .
bring some hand sanitizer .
I have told people , " Hey , call or text any time , but I might not be able to get back to you that same day . "
give us a sense of control .
can I call you every day ?
what works for you ? "
so that 's a lot of dos and don 'ts and maybes , and it 's not by any means a definitive list .
and these atoms are extremely durable .
and that 's an incredibly bad day for a star .
that means that as astrophysicists , we have to rely on sophisticated computer simulations in order to understand these complex phenomena .
so thank you , neutrinos .
this implies that somewhere in the universe , there 's a supernova explosion every second or so .
the image that you see there was assembled by the Hubble Space Telescope over a span of three months .
and we can estimate that in order to assemble all the atoms of oxygen in our body , it took on the order of a 100 million supernova .
a myth from the Chichimeca culture , which is a very powerful Mesoamerican culture .
in a world where we marginalize the ideas of the Global South , we CANNOT create globally inclusive problem @-@ solving models .
and as they started tweeting , they immediately sent the stock market crashing , wiping out 140 billion dollars in equity value in a single day .
so we checked each one of these in turn .
so to understand people 's perceptions of false news , we looked at the information and the sentiment contained in the replies to true and false tweets .
think about it this way : when you go to the grocery store to buy food to consume , it 's extensively labeled .
we have none of that information when we are consuming information .
that is a potential avenue , but it comes with its challenges .
is it Facebook ?
for instance , Malaysia just instituted a six @-@ year prison sentence for anyone found spreading misinformation .
and that 's potentially incredibly dangerous .
we have to be vigilant in defending the truth against misinformation .
and all the complicated paper @-@ based formal procedures are supposed to solve that problem .
this distributed approach also avoids the problem of the single point of failure .
and this is the real picture of all the connections between public and private sector databases .
but this event put cybersecurity at the very top of agenda , both in terms of strengthening the platform and backing it up .
and the data into the hands of the rightful owner , the person they refer to .
( laughter ) So , I decided to inspect the problem from a different angle .
so , consulting with an engineer , I designed a slide system that would hook into my left hook , and I devised another pick @-@ holder system that would clip into my right hook .
( laughter ) Not I.
( laughter ) Now , when we started that club night , I could not DJ .
and , at the very least , you can scare the hell out of kids if you look like a pirate .
value creation .
we 've stopped actually asking really tough questions about what is the difference between value creation and value extraction , productive and unproductive activities .
now , what was interesting 300 years ago is the society was still an agricultural type of society .
and they produced what I think was probably the world 's first spreadsheet , called the " Tableau Economique , " and this was done by Fran√ßois Quesnay , one of the leaders of this movement .
the farmers , creating value , were called the " productive class . "
feminist economists and environmental economists have actually written about this quite a bit .
well , mechanization has for centuries , actually , taken jobs , but as long as profits were being reinvested back into production , then it didn 't matter : new jobs appeared .
and I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form .
as I will show to you , it is actually the mainstay of modern life .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre @-@ packaged , which I 'm told is called a Wonderbread .
it 's about a traditional way of living .
now you may prefer this loaf of bread .
and this is where I have to query all of you .
let 's go back to traditional farming .
let 's go back to small @-@ scale , to farmers ' markets , small bakeries and all that . " wonderful .
and we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
can we find a solution to produce more ?
we will not do that through small farmers ' markets because these people have no small farmers ' markets at their disposal .
and let me just do one simple conceptual thing : if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale .
we 've moved towards large @-@ scale and very high control .
we need more science and not less . and we need good science .
we have much cleverer irrigation .
you must go back and think about your own food chain .
and above all , to me , food is about respect .
and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have , to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution , is really not morally justified .
never before , as I said , has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few .
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
and that , I think , evolutionarily @-@ speaking is unique .
eat it , and feel privileged .
unfortunately I couldn 't go .
sometimes they get in trouble , but not often .
and I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything .
Nathan left and went to Tompkins County , New York -- a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States . and he did it again .
and I think about the idea that creating an idea , spreading an idea has a lot behind it .
we started with the factory idea : that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change .
we then went to the TV idea , that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece , if you could get on TV enough times , if you could buy enough ads , you could win .
well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars .
that people on the fringes can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
they 've got their own flag . they 've got the eye patches .
and he didn 't do it by buying a lot of ads .
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
they merely decided to lead them .
that heretics look at the status quo and say , " This will not stand . I can 't abide this status quo .
you get to tell the story on Blake 's behalf , on behalf of the people who got the shoes .
so I started my life as an architect , or training as an architect , and I was always interested in socially responsible design , and how you can really make an impact .
and I didn 't know what I was doing -- like I said , mid @-@ 20s -- and I 'm the Internet generation , so we started a website .
this wasn 't imposing an architecture on a community ; this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to .
it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa .
no , it 's not . look here .
I 've split Kenya in its provinces .
of course , some people will still need to seek asylum at the border .
picking fruit , cleaning crabs , landscaping in a 100 @-@ degree heat .
how much would a low @-@ wage job help a Honduran , like Juan or Cintia ?
the members of the resistance have positioned a crane over the train tracks that can pluck the artifact once it 's exposed .
fortunately , we now live in a time when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem .
in addition , academic research has shown that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention .
here , they 're supporting that with qualitative statements .
when we began developing , we started off by asking students what they liked , what they didn 't like and what they found confusing .
eventually we began asking what they wished they could do .
how could we support students in exploring all of their desires with these eye @-@ opening experiences and chances to learn from primary sources ?
extended reality has the potential to change the trajectory of our children 's lives and lead them to careers they never imagined by giving them the chance to see what they can be .
look around . what do you notice ?
and I didn 't know in the beginning if it was going to work or not , but it 's made me very happy to see what 's happening .
JF : well , I realize that not everybody can leave work and go and do what I 'm doing .
my grandkids just got arrested last weekend .
PM : and as you have done so many times in the past , Jane , you are leading these changes .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) PM : and you are in a city that is probably more divided than it has been in a very long time .
JF : yeah , I am optimistic .
what is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend .
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society , but you are not able to implement those things .
but today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
and that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see .
the final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you didn 't think of India as a market , you didn 't really bother about a single market , because it didn 't really matter .
the other thing that you can do is you can do this -- electroencephalography -- you can put these electrodes on your head , OK ?
and then you could also ask them about what they were experiencing .
right there .
fossil fuels will one day give way to renewable energy .
it 's actually connected to a suite of automated hardware and software that read in real time and feed back to a design team the growth conditions of the microbe .
so you can start to see how imaginative and inspiring modes of making exist in nature that we can use to build capacity around new bio @-@ based industries .
what we now have is the technology to design , build , test and scale these capabilities .
and crucially , how we would like the regulatory and ethical frameworks that govern these technologies to interact with our society .
it is a better business model .
we have to start to think about how do we connect to water .
and I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook .
now , the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away , it 's as if you haven 't learned anything in the last minute .
audience : brown . Dan Ariely : brown . thank you .
very , very hard .
vision is one of the best things we do .
we have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision -- bigger than dedicated to anything else .
it 's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein .
but if you look at this plot , you can see that countries that we think about as very similar , actually exhibit very different behavior .
you know the expression , " Begging only gets you so far . "
and what happens ?
they presented to them a case study of a patient .
all these medications , nothing seems to be working .
now , weekend in Paris , weekend in Rome -- these are different things .
( laughter ) But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this ?
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don 't know our preferences that well .
the silver lining is , I think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting .
in her Auntie An @-@ Mei 's home , Jing @-@ Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner of the mahjong table .
Jing @-@ Mei feels this pressure as she plays mahjong with her mother 's friends .
she had grown up in a stereotypical , very high @-@ level athletic world , and she was damaged .
it was a really snarky thought , and thankfully I didn 't say it out loud , because then I had clarity .
so I embarked on the painfully slow process of building trust and proving to her that first and foremost I cared about her as a whole human being .
she went on to earn the NCAA title on floor , and she helped our team win our seventh NCAA championship in 2018 .
they stimulated her gums with a toothpick , to see if that was doing it .
it 's so sad .
and this is -- I 'll demonstrate as best I can , not being dead .

they didn 't buy it .

and Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up .
( laughter ) I have an answer for you . I have two answers .
( laughter ) Okay .
in Denmark , the Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her , you will see a six @-@ percent increase in the farrowing rate , which is the number of piglets produced .
he 's going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout , lacking hands . okay .
why don 't you have the farmers do that ?
( laughter ) Shy but ambitious pig farmers , however , can purchase a -- this is true -- a sow vibrator , that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate .

so I was 18 ; I was very excited .
and I saw the power of the image , and it was incredible .
maybe I will never be able to do it , but I have plans for my children .
and then what hit me was , the night before , there had been some kind of bombing in Basra , and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people .
and when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world , we had such incredible reactions .
and I saw this with audiences .
I know where you guys are coming from .
I love to dance .
in the United States there are less than 200 people diagnosed .
the fact that someone who wasn 't me was putting limitations on my dreams and ambitions was preposterous .
so I ignored them .
however , it would be another five years until I officially declared my diagnosis to my employer .
and with that fateful decision began a four @-@ year commitment , tossing back and forth between fear and courage to undertake a 12 @-@ day expedition .
what can we do about it ?
and from time to time , there have been health scares made public about cigarettes , going back many decades .
the replacement smokers for addicted adult smokers who died or quit .
( applause ) About to be 77 , I realize that I have nothing left to prove , less to lose , and I 'm more impatient about everything .
the true , slow pace towards equality , the rise in sexism , racism , violence against women and girls ...
my women friends are my source of renewable energy .
so let 's use all our power .
let 's allocate more of our philanthropic dollars , our campaign donations , our investment funds , to increase economic and political equity .
he would live self @-@ sufficiently , close to nature , without materialism , vanity , or conformity .
but instead of asking for material goods , Diogenes only asked Alexander to get out of his sunshine .
still , the philosophy of cynicism had admirers , especially among those who wished to question the state of society .
Nietzsche admired Diogenes for sticking stubbornly to the here @-@ and @-@ now .
and that 's an example we can still follow : not to blindly follow conventional or majority views , but to think hard about what is truly valuable .

how many people are trying to learn English worldwide ?
Jay Walker : in Latin America , in India , in Southeast Asia , and most of all , in China .

that 's why this year , China will become the world 's largest English @-@ speaking country .
opportunity for a better life , a job , to be able to pay for school , or put better food on the table .
and these were the same qualities that I looked for in my own husband , Barack Obama .
he talked about " the world as it is " and " the world as it should be . "
you are the women who will build the world as it should be .
you 're going to write the next chapter in history .
the difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls .
I never cut class . sorry , I don 't know if anybody is cutting class .
I loved getting As .
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world .
it was built by the timber of Her Majesty 's Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria .
we are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be .
I had crippling cramps , I leaked blood onto my clothes and onto my bed sheets , and I had period diarrhea .
why was menstruation so different ?
my mother knew nothing about menstruation except that it was dirty and shameful and I shouldn 't talk about it .
( laughter ) I used to have to buy my menstrual products in the feminine hygiene aisle .
why can 't we talk about periods ?
and how do you get the highest quality embryos ?
( audience gasps ) Right .
you could have a condition called endometriosis , where the lining of the uterus is growing in the pelvic cavity , causing inflammation and scar tissue and adhesions .
and I 'm not going to stand for it .
what led to their global dominance for so many years ?
but perhaps the answer had to do with their internal anatomy -- a secret weapon , so to speak .
also , to reintroduce you to lungs in general , we will use my dog Mila of Troy , the face that launched a thousand treats , as our model .
that means it 's moving during the entire respiratory process , so that thin membrane , the blood @-@ gas barrier , CANNOT be too thin or it will break .
then there 's South Africa , Brazil , Venezuela .
and then we overlaid that with a map of places where journalists were being murdered .
they give charity . they solve disputes .
bar fights and neighborhood arguments turn deadly when violence has become normal and repercussions have evaporated .
because , after all , what else can you do ?
well , it turns out , quite a lot .
they start to control the prisons , and from there , the streets .
the fact is , we actually know a lot about what it takes to reduce violence .
and these seeds will be able to germinate , we believe , with many of the species , in thousands of years , and certainly in hundreds of years .
and within that one , to continually narrow the focus , learning more and more about less and less ; this , despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things .
as one moves up the ladder , values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion .
either we have lost touch with those values or , no better , believe they need not or CANNOT be taught .
and don 't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it .
but structures designed to connect , rather than divide mutually dependent circles , rather than isolating triangles .

what you 're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh , so I started to move away from North America ; I started to look at our world globally .
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense , and the working conditions were horrible .
I 'm going to move to some pictures of China .
so this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long , one of the largest reservoirs ever created .
this is a textile mill doing synthetic silk , an oil byproduct .
here 's something that 's far more labor @-@ intensive , which is the making of shoes .
this is a textile where they 're doing shirts -- Youngor , the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China .
that 's cubed metal . this is armatures , electrical armatures , where they 're getting the copper and the high @-@ end steel from electrical motors out , and recycling them .
I think there 's a chance to have a dialogue , a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
and to teach them , to me , would be a fantastic wish , and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into .
if I take 30 steps exponentially -- two , four , eight , 16 -- I get to a billion .
I mean this went through thick and thin , through war and peace , through boom times and recessions .

most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth .
one day , when I came back from a work assignment , I climbed up , I was at the top level of the three @-@ tier bunk , and there was Mr. Levine with a deck of cards .
( laughter ) You know , " What is he doing there ? "
I was sent to another camp where I worked in the stables , and then , in January 1945 , when the Russians advanced , 60,000 of us were sent on a death march .
and I went to a magic store , and I bought some magic tricks , and I showed them to my friends , and I bought some more magic tricks and I showed it to them .
( laughter ) Anyway , I got married , and I came to the United States , and one of the first jobs that I had demanded from me to speak to small groups of people .
what 's happening to the climate ?
so it was a big idea . we wanted to reduce that by 80 percent , which is exactly what we 've done .
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets .
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
we don 't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S. , unfortunately .
that is the slurry being poured onto paper , basically . that 's the line running .
these are people who worked this project for two to three years .
we happened to win , just recently , the Green Product of the Year for " The Re @-@ Invention of drywall , " from Popular Science .

so we considered all of this . and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself .
so here is what we did . we put a 10 @-@ cent digital transponder , a data tag , in the appliance plug .
now , every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network .
there are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone .
and I 'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition , the 2009 CES Innovation Award .
and at that age , you learn mostly by listening to others ' stories .
fortunately , we stopped .
and I found it in an economic formula called the " gross domestic product , " or the GDP .
so on one side of the boundary , everything where there was a market exchange was counted .
it doesn 't matter whether the exchange is legal or illegal .
how many of you have done a bit of cleaning , a bit of vacuuming , a bit of sweeping , a bit of tidying up the kitchen ?
( laughter ) Well , as far as economics is concerned , you were at leisure .
( laughter ) ( Applause and cheers ) Now , how about the women who have been pregnant and who have had children ?
yes .
now , in the New Zealand national accounts -- that 's what the figures are called , that 's where we get the GDP -- in the New Zealand national accounts , the milk of buffalo , goats , sheep and cows is of value but not human breast milk .
all of those activities are on the wrong side of the production boundary .
nothing was ever lost from the national accounting framework because of the loss of lives , the loss of land , the loss of buildings , the loss of special spaces .
to leave our natural environment alone , to sustain it , to protect it , is apparently worth nothing .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) " Relying on per capita GDP , relying on these growth figures , " they said , " doesn 't appear to be the best way to proceed to make public policy . "
you see , to measure GDP , you have to assume that some kind of production or service delivery or consumption occurs inside a nation @-@ state , and you know where that is .
we don 't behave in a way that assists GDP .
large numbers of people around the planet are now using household assets -- their cars , their homes , themselves -- for Uber , for Airbnb .
every one of us has exactly the same amount of it .
but once their population exceeds about 23,000 , it changes course .
I make sculptures like " FOREVER " as a way of giving physical , tangible forms to language and time .
and as you walk down that street , you notice something flashing up above you .
but maybe the hope for a brighter , more sustainable , more equitable future depends first on our ability to imagine it .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) Fred was like , " But I don 't understand , David . that 's the story . "
if Mabel would 've went to her community -- you were eight years old -- what do you think the eight @-@ year @-@ old African @-@ American children were calling her ?
and yet , you were calling her by her first name every single day that she worked , and you never thought about it . "
did she have children ?
and see , this is what they did to Rosa Parks .
this is what an aura looks like .
Stacy Sager : but for Christina Sidebottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine .
in part , we have the legacy of Freud , who was a pessimist , who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest , is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality .
so the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery .
we also find that people are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain .
the Freudian model is really one continuum that , as you get less miserable , you get happier .
absent from this list , and absent from any discussions of happiness , are happiness in another 's happiness .
babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures .
it wouldn 't eat . it wouldn 't sleep . it wouldn 't have sex .
there is a profound need to belong .
as the Roman Empire expanded north , some Scandinavians served in their new neighbors " armies - and brought home Roman maritime technology .
Viking longships could soon carry as many as 100 Vikings to battle .
creating a good cartoon involves repeated failures , draft after draft .
and I knew that I couldn 't allow my happiness to seep into my work , that I should take the higher road and respect people 's grief .
that 's why a cartoonist must exercise their power responsibly , showcasing the truth and drawing without the fear of consequences .
man : so you 're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko .
but she actually used these on smooth surfaces -- two of them -- to climb up , and pull herself up .
if we can show some of the video , you can see it climbing up the wall .
and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot .
we know that you can grab onto things with them .
so watch this kangaroo .
the engineers had a really good idea .
okay , there it goes .
but watch its front legs . can you see what they are doing ?
( laughter ) So then we wondered , " Can they actually maneuver with this ? "
so should we force our choices on them , or should we broaden their choices ?
it 's home to 300,000 people living over 650 acres of land .
and that was great .
and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean , but nothing with perfume .
I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program , under the U.N.
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human @-@ made fires .
and they like to keep everything beautifully raked . and they keep all the leaves away .
girls crying at a Justin Bieber concert ?
I , too , had suspected that they were a bit crazy .
( laughter ) Thanks .
because , according to my research , they are capable of building a shrine to Harry Styles 's vomit on the side of a freeway within two hours .
it is a hopeful sound .
you ready ? take a deep breath with me .
it 's easy to feel totally overwhelmed .
we talked about how we were feeling about the world , openly and honestly , and no one told me at any point to be more positive or more hopeful .
and this is the second concept , which is something called a double bind .
it 's a very intolerable human experience .
and we will do anything we can to get rid of it and just push it away .
and we become cheerleaders for solutions .
but inadvertently , this can backfire and lead to more numbing and inaction , which is very perplexing for a lot of people .
and so , this is because of this , you know , it 's not really touching what 's going on underneath .
so imagine that you go see a therapist , and you 've got a double bind .
what 's it going to take ? "
or you see a therapist and you 're feeling actually sad and grief .
here 's some simple things you can do .
this is a hard moment to be a human being , we 're waking up .
but here we are , and we 're all needed .
I 'm scared , but this is happening . "
so here 's the thing , all of this work exists , we have the tools to create these conditions that can allow us to show up as our brilliant selves .
we need each other .
let 's do this together .
the world is ready for us to do this .
I 'll start here . last November there was a presidential election .
and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression .
what matters here isn 't technical capital , it 's social capital .
these tools don 't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
then , a couple of hundred years ago , there was innovation in two @-@ way communication , conversational media : first the telegraph , then the telephone .
slow , text @-@ based conversations , then real @-@ time voice based conversations .
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to .
and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
if you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
and within half a day donation sites were up , and donations were pouring in from all around the world .
and so the protest kept going .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by amateurs .
now these changes don 't just affect people who want to censor messages .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
I understand where you are coming from .
through the capillaries , they reach larger blood vessels and exit the bone .
a bone marrow transplant can also lead to something called graft @-@ versus @-@ tumor activity , when new immune cells generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient 's original immune system couldn 't .
patients may take immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk of graft @-@ versus @-@ host disease .
so it 's crucial to find the best match possible in the first place .
thirteen point eight billion years ago , the universe as we know it began with a big bang , and everything that we know and are and are made of was created .
the hand of God shows up over and over and over again .
it connected an audience in an unprecedented way .
now we 're not talking about video games or computer @-@ generated actors , which look tremendously realistic .
somebody reads very fast .
we declared smallpox eradicated in 1980 .
this is confluent smallpox , in which there isn 't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions .
and hemorrhagic smallpox , the most cruel of all , which had a predilection for pregnant women .
you could vaccinate everybody in India , but one year later there 'd be 21 million new babies , which was then the population of Canada .
we made over one billion house calls .
but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication .
so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu , we find it and immediately contain it .
when he started GPHIN -- In 1997 , there was an outbreak of bird flu -- H5N1 .
then a number of years went by , and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu .
so they started sending in their reports early .
I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can .
that may have saved the writers , but it didn 't really save the surgeons terribly much .
the question had to be asked , " Well , can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions ? "
the learning curve was very long .
surgeons had to give up their 3D vision .
you 've got these long instruments , and you 're working off your centerline .
and the instruments are essentially working backwards .
how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon ?
and as you see it come out , in order to actually be able to do anything useful , it can 't all stay clustered up like this .
and we can take special cameras , and we can look at it .
now we know where we need to cut , even when it 's below the surface .
we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body .
and the prospect I 'm offering you , of an easier surgery ...
I don 't want anyone to think that I 'm not smart .
that is worth applauding or snapping your fingers about .
what are your fears ? what are your hopes ? what are your dreams ?
so if we break it down , go get a poster board .
[ 5 : it 's not what you make , it 's what you keep . ] It 's not about what you make , it 's about what you keep .
for a lot of us in that hood , there was only one person you could already turn to for food , shelter , warmth , love , discipline : our mothers .
up until then , my mother didn 't even know she existed .
you see , this is co @-@ parenting , and in an ideal world , my mother would have had a co @-@ parent , too .
Lilah 's mother gets to go rock climbing or study for the LSAT , and I get to stand in a room full of bold , dynamic and powerful women and talk about dad stuff .
" come on Adam , don 't be so wishy @-@ washy . take a bite . " " I did . "
there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded , in many ways .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT .
they were self @-@ confident and determined . and the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were future @-@ focused rather than present @-@ focused .
so what is time perspective ? that 's what I 'm going to talk about today .
so I want to end by saying : many of life 's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but I think the consequences are really profound .
and in January of 2018 , I read an article with some of his alleged victims .
so your Gmail account , your Twitter account , your Instagram account , your iCloud , your Apple ID , your Netflix , your TikTok -- I had to figure out what a TikTok was .
they don 't recognize it as a Trojan or as any of the other stuff that you would normally find that they would warn you about .
you can do that quite fast .
if the Security Council doesn 't commit to security over the course of a decade , you don 't get the reassurance which produces private investment .
and that is to focus on a few critical objectives .
one is jobs .
one is improvements in basic services -- especially health , which is a disaster during conflict .
there isn 't any construction going on . and so the sector shrivels away .
so we need to encourage the growth of local firms .
on the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s .
is that OK ?
in fact , every time we take a breath , we are inhaling toxic pollutants , and our poor pink and lovely lungs are suffering all of that .
we CANNOT stop breathing and , in addition , we need , every day , around 10,000 liters of air .
air pollution is not just affecting our lungs .
this is the first thing we need to do to protect yourself and to protect our beautiful brain .
the first is mass collaboration , represented here by Wikipedia .
think of it as peer @-@ to @-@ peer philanthropy .
and understand how they help us re @-@ perceive what organized philanthropy is .
the question is , is there a positive social singularity ?
is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
thank you very much .
young people would ask the most amazing questions .
it 's risk . it 's reward . it 's randomness .
so why is that overall ?
or it 's the amygdala , the emotional center of the brain , close to the hippocampus , the memory center of the brain .
what mattered most was that they were in menopause .
and this is important information to have , because so many women can feel these changes .
but still , it 's quite an insight to associate Alzheimer 's with menopause .
and the common example is a hysterectomy and / or an oophorectomy , which is the surgical removal of the uterus and / or the ovaries .
meanwhile , there are other things that we can do today to support our hormones and their effects on the brain that do not require medications but do require taking a good look at our lifestyle .
there are many diets out there , but studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet in particular is supportive of women 's health .
women on this diet have a much lower risk of cognitive decline , of depression , of heart disease , of stroke and of cancer , and they also have fewer hot flashes .
some phytoestrogens have been linked to a possible risk of cancer , but not the ones in this diet , which are safe .
nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
( laughter ) Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .
so again I am a believer in the radical architecture .
hand versus the computer .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
and I think that is really the nature of architecture .
it 's political . there is so many parties to this project .
there is so many interests . there 's money . there 's political power .
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others , looking at America from that point of view .
because this is not all about charity .
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon .
in turbulent times , isn 't it cheaper , and smarter , to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later ?
and I didn 't say that . Colin Powell said that .
someone 's put a brick through the window .
never before have we in the west been so scrutinized .
we can 't fix every problem , but the ones we can , I want to argue , we must .
they 've done incredible stuff , unbelievable stuff .
actually , I come from punk rock .
but idealism allied with pragmatism , with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . it 's very real . it 's very strong .
and it 's very present in a crowd like you .
we 're calling it the ONE Campaign .
this year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the G8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching .
you know , there 's lots out there .
video : this is the land .
Charles used to say , " The extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem . "
the " Powers of Ten " is a film they made .
video : your word is N. Carolina .
but here is what 's really great .
and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation .
no Powerpoint is used in two days .
blood types hadn 't been discovered by Halsted 's time , though people had been experimenting with transfusions for centuries - mostly unsuccessfully .
we still use heparin today .
with a wingspan of only 180 centimeters , this vulture migrated to Africa from his family nest in Portugal , using thermal updrafts to stay aloft for hours at a time .
in regions where vultures have gone extinct , corpses take three times longer to decay .
the Asian and African Vulture Crisis has led to an epidemic of rabies in India , where infections kill roughly 20,000 people each year .
we replaced that with a web form , and now most veterans find out if they can get access to their health benefits in 10 minutes .
they wanted a letter on official government letterhead .
the government can 't pay huge salary bonuses , so we ended up making our own awards .
but you can make a difference in public service right now .
she 'd led the team developing the pioneering in @-@ flight software , so she knew this mission had no room for error .
but when she heard that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help sending mankind to the moon , she immediately joined his team .
human lives were on the line , so every program had to be perfect .
she designed Priority Displays that would interrupt astronaut 's regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies .
it was these fail safes that triggered the alarms just before the lunar landing .
fortunately , the Apollo Guidance Computer was well equipped to manage this .
I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
the communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam , and American bombing campaigns .
Sophal Ear : so , notwithstanding the 1970s narration , on April 17th 1975 we lived in Phnom Penh .
I 'm happy , actually , today , to present her .
what if I could stick this molecule , slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me , that had just invaded my lungs ?
it 's like " mission accomplished . "
so , between coal and nuclear , compare their waste products .
that 's where you see some of the source , not from my fellow environmentalists , but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power .
well the good news is that the developing world , but frankly , the whole world , is busy building , and starting to build , nuclear reactors .
I want to point out one interesting thing , which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower .
it 's supposed to be , I don 't know , local solar and wind and cogeneration , and good things like that .
but frankly micro @-@ reactors which are just now coming on , might serve even better .
almost all of these are not only small , they are proliferation @-@ proof .
so I think microreactors is going to be important for the future .
half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia , soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads .
despite their best efforts , genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history .
I should say , it is more practical than people think .
I have a studio in Berlin -- let me cue on here -- which is down there in this snow , just last weekend .
when the circle goes away you will have another color , the complementary color .
I am saying something . and your eyes and your brain are saying something back .
since two years now , with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin , I 've been working on these films where we produce the film together .
obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative .
who decides what reality is ?
the idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture , and what it means to be in a space . what is the difference ?
and two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London , with the Serpentine Gallery : a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion .
it is how we touch each other .
and in your dreams , you actually unleash the potential of this inner voice .
that 's another work we are doing in our lab : trying to access this inner voice in dreams .
and you can even see this inner voice as the missing link between thought and actions .
harvest what you can , throw away what 's left .
Lenie 's other half , I don 't remember much about him except that he had a thing for white sleeveless shirts and gold chains around his neck .
in most cultures around the world , gender is this man @-@ woman dichotomy .
she had the prerogative to have a baby or not and then decide the baby 's name .
( laughter ) And while the babaylan was a female role , there were also , in fact , male practitioners in the spiritual realm .
in all , he appeared more a woman than a man . "
well , any other juicy details in the colonial archives ?
almost all are impotent for the reproductive act , and thus they marry other males and sleep with them as man and wife and have carnal knowledge . "
some countries like Australia , New Zealand , Pakistan , Nepal and Canada have begun introducing nonbinary options in their legal documents , such as their passports and their permanent resident cards .
in my people 's case , this social construct is an imposition .
they can be reconstructed to respond to communities that are becoming more diverse .
their blood runs through me as they run through so many of us .
we 're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums .
just on the data collection side , just where we are through the Galapagos , we 're finding that almost every 200 miles , we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean .
and these vary tremendously from region to region .
so we started doing transposon mutagenesis .
and we got these overlapping circles . and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms .
this organism is ubiquitous on the planet , and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there .
the glass started to burn and crack , while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier .
the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce .
so here I am with the couple , the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up , you know .
and more and more , less and less awareness of the pain of the other .
and she said , " Well , personally , I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university .
and she said , " And then intellectually , I don 't know enough about the negative imagination .
and she would hit her head on the tub . it happened continuously , repeatedly .
" OK . OK ? OK . OK .
they have a lot of respect , as I do , for Dr. Martin King .
I was swallowing the bitterness , sitting here alone and watching them .
and they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out .
and bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients , most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases .
but both of these narratives are flawed in the ways in which they dehumanize people if they don 't fit within a certain mold or succeed in a certain way .
I know this firsthand , because these laws and systems , well , they broke up my family , and they led my parents to return to Mexico .
and just in case you 're wondering what your answers are to those two questions , I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it .
Musa is a natural artistic guy .
Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I 've ever seen , and over the last one year , Musa 's business has grown .
but by looking inward and finding that what he had was the greatest asset and supporting him to turn it into a business , he 's not just living -- he 's thriving .
so next time class met , I apologized , and I made an announcement .
my black students tell me that when the word is quoted or spoken in class , they feel like a giant spotlight is shining on them .
and in fact this is probably why mostly men , boys , are psychopathic killers , or are very aggressive .
okay , now this gives one a little pause .
he was raised by very supportive and interested parents .
and the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book , " On the Origin of Species , " published 150 years ago .
so what did he make of all this ?
the earliest members of our lineage , the genus Homo , were darkly pigmented .
now what happened in our history ?
so if we 're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere , look at what 's happening to the ultraviolet radiation .
so we have , in skin pigmentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .
he said , " No , I want to abolish the poor . "
they said , " Let 's march . "
what is a snob ?
a meritocratic society is one in which , if you 've got talent and energy and skill , you will get to the top , nothing should hold you back .
the idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded , the good at the top , bad at the bottom , exactly done as it should be , is impossible .
in modern English that would mean it 's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to , dependent on their business card .
they 've slept with the wrong person , taken the wrong substance , passed the wrong piece of legislation -- whatever it is , and then are fit for ridicule .
the other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety , is that we have nothing at its center that is non @-@ human .
as he says here , most people answer without any hesitation .
and so I 've been beginning , with a variety of different projects , to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .
so I 'll just add a couple more . blink . blink .
and what they 're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life , and how he changed our thinking .
and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else .
I mean -- ( Laughter ) if I 'm a good Darwinist , I 've got to believe there 's a reason for that .
we 've got to go back to square one and start again . "
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him .
" that crazy woman . she 's off again . she 'll say anything won 't she ? "
do you think that 's significant ?
in the whale it 's complete : no fat inside at all , all in blubber outside .
try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver , and you can see that , compared with gorilla , we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .
it was not the savanna , it was not the water , it was this ! "
but in this life , in this world , butterflies are in really serious trouble .
sometimes , it 's called community science , which gets at the communal purpose of citizen science , which is to do something for our commons together .
so this person showed this to Darwin and said , " This proves that evolution does not come about in a natural way .
Milkweed is toxic .
you go to a native nursery in your area and find out what 's native to where you live , and you will bring beautiful things to yourself .
when we share data , we can see much bigger pictures of what 's going on .
certainly , we are connected to butterflies in deeper ways than we currently know , and the mystery of the butterfly will never be revealed if we don 't save them .
thank you .
let 's just pick one -- for example , the one in the green shirt .
and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules , the ways that rules can keep people in the dark , look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night .
in particular check out Asia .
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy , when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model .
demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy .
and they 're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules .
and we can scale this model .
people can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it .
the final thing we need are choices for leaders .
let 's take a particular leader , Raul Castro , who is the leader of Cuba .
allow many people to come in .
let us have a Hong Kong nearby .
others will hold back . but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country . "
well , Africa . I 've talked with leaders in Africa .
turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth .
if you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth .
so there are many other details like this .
I 'm not a physician . I 'm not a nurse .
my specialty is looking at populations and health systems , what happens when diseases move on the large level .
that 's why it 's novel .
and they 're both called respiratory syndromes , because that 's what coronaviruses do -- they go for your lungs .
some coronaviruses , like COVID @-@ 19 , also transmit person to person .
COVID @-@ 19 most likely skipped from animals into people at a wild animal market in Wuhan , China .
part of that is about climate change and the way a warming climate makes the world more hospitable to viruses and bacteria .
we can get better at quarantines and travel restrictions , and we should , but they 're not our only option , and they 're not our best option for dealing with these situations .
China 's taken a lot of criticism for its response to COVID @-@ 19 .
but , having identified it , they didn 't have the resources to respond .
first , they kill the poor people when the outbreaks start , and then they kill people all over the world when the outbreaks spread .
if a hospital -- or a country -- runs out of face masks or personal protective equipment , there 's no big warehouse full of boxes that we can go to to get more .
they would have shared honest information with citizens so that we didn 't see these crazy rumors spreading on social media in China .
and we 'd have real information going out to people everywhere , so we wouldn 't see embarrassing , shameful incidents of xenophobia , like Asian @-@ looking people getting attacked on the street in Philadelphia .
COVID @-@ 19 is scary stuff , at a time when pretty much all of our news feels like scary stuff .
[ question 3 : what are the risks that we need people to think about ? ] It 's not just whose hand you shake , it 's whose hand that person goes on to shake .
but I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people , and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point .
my mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry .
so I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade .
and after I 've actually sculpted them , I have to paint them .
in America they say a period stop .
I remember one time I was doing it , and the window was open .
good morning everybody .
that really stuck with me .
that 's not dirty enough . let 's just stir that up a little bit .
now as soon as I pop the teat , sterile drinking water is going to come out .
they can make their own sterile drinking water , and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives .
she picks the water up from there , desalinates it , for free , transports it over there , and dumps it onto the mountains , rivers , and streams .
and there was a wasp 's nest that I had let grow in my yard , right outside my door .
and most people knock them down when they 're small .
and he came up to me and he knocked .
this is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley .
he happened to be a birder .
and that pattern , the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere .
it 's got bumps on the back of its wing covers .
and those bumps act like a magnet for water .
they have water @-@ loving tips , and waxy sides .
and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter 's mouth .
they 're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms .
it 's self @-@ assembling .
and what we 're trying to do , in a TEDesque way , is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function .
and the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question , " What can we learn from this organism ? "
because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it , because I didn 't know what I was putting myself into .
what was actually killing us wasn 't the Muslims , wasn 't the Arabs .
and so , the importance of education to me is what I 'm willing to die for .
this time , the incentivized group kicked the other group 's butt .
because when the tacks are out of the box , it 's pretty easy isn 't it ?
the solution , if it exists at all , is surprising and not obvious .
in Madurai , a reward that is modest in North American standards , is more meaningful there .
here 's what they said : " we find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance . "
the good news is that the scientists who 've been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
a few times a year they tell their engineers , " Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want , as long as it 's not part of your regular job .
radical amounts of autonomy .
and at Google , as many of you know , about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that 20 % time : things like Gmail , Orkut , Google News .
but were able to light that , and do it very successfully .
so , imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling .
so that when you walk in or you come in from home , if you carry a purse , it works in your purse .
and for those of you who can 't read it , it says , " It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . "
the lists go on and on .
that was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
but of course , there 's a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
and I 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
the reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto -- or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it 's very inefficient .
we could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected every year .
and the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
and especially , it 's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years , because I have my oldest son now working for Google , after Google acquired this software .
so , how could we make better sense about this ?
and this is the number of people .
because it 's so different , what has happened there .
and providing data free of charge on the internet , for the world to use . thank you very much .
it 's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the ' 30s .
that has now disappeared , and they are now in great economic problem .
I love theater .
if Antoine de Saint @-@ Exupery , the author of " The Little Prince , " were here , he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside .
when I arrived at one of the schools , I certainly did not expect this : six hundred kids , packed in a gymnasium , waiting .
something happened along the way .
as a street performer , I have learned that everybody wants to connect .
and that usually , if you 're a bit extraordinary , if you 're not exactly of human appearance , then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .
it 's happening .
I 've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now , ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named Jack Harlan .
( laughter ) I don 't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ...
because I challenge you to think of an effective , efficient , sustainable solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity .
because , quite literally , if agriculture doesn 't adapt to climate change , neither will we .
as Uruk grew , its farmers began chopping down trees to make space for more crops .
in Anuradhapura , however , trees were sacred .
humanity has been uncovering these arboreal benefits for centuries .
next step in my process .
and they 're in fifteen countries . they 're spread around the world .
the technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
I grew up in a family where my father managed all of the money .
we would sit at the kitchen table , and he 'd show me all the bank books .
and every time he would show me something about money , he would end by saying , " And don 't you tell your mother . "
someone is dependent with choice when they hand over their financial power and their participation .
and how many of us know someone that has an elderly parent or a relative that can no longer take care of themselves , and they 're left to rely on others , sometimes handing over their homes , their money and other assets .
financial literacy is having the skills and the knowledge to make informed decisions about your money .
so whatever you think , this isn 't a faraway problem happening in China .
let 's all identify counterfeiters , and don 't give them our money .
focus @-@ tunable lenses add a bit of complexity to the equation .
using two of these , we can triangulate your gaze direction to get a focus estimate .
our participants could see more clearly , they could focus more quickly and they thought it was an easier and better focusing experience than their current correction .
to put it simply , when it comes to vision , autofocals don 't compromise like static corrections in use today do .
Ronald Reagan , again , said the two funniest sentences in the English language are , " I 'm from the government . and I 'm here to help . "
and , after all this , as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said , " Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish .
some , I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing .
we know our societies have to radically change .
now , I didn 't really understand that until I met this guy who was then an 80 @-@ year @-@ old , slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated .
nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont .
what it 's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social .
thank you .
this unique set of gestures has been used for centuries , each movement rich with meaning and history .
the ballerina moves in perfect harmony with the music , even mimicing the violins " trill with an elegant bourr√©e .
choreographer Marius Petipa and composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second of " The Sleeping Beauty . "
and the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
I was running political strategy for her .
so let me explain that .
but I put my hands on the levers of control that I 'd been given and pulled them , and nothing happened .
the truth is that future generations will look back at this precise moment with awe as we stand at the crossroads between a regenerative future and one where we have thrown it all away .
genuine success is possible in this transition , and genuine failure is possible , too , which makes this the most exciting time to be alive .
right now , all of these things are possible .
some semesters I used all of those rest days to the fullest .
but it was around this time that I began to realize mental health was much a bigger problem than just for me personally .
this not only will start teaching kids young how to take care of themselves and practice self @-@ care and stress management , but it could also literally save lives .
if you were put in a situation where you had to administer CPR , would you know at least a little bit of what to do ?
a parachute jump from the very edge of space .
that 's one of the most dangerous horse stunts , certainly .
we couldn 't do them without technology .
these are particularly dangerous because there is no mask on my face .
it was made by a Russian that 's designed most of the suits of the past 18 years for the Soviets .
and so we expect -- it 's not much fun .
thank you very much for your time .
whatever you call them , these rubber @-@ soled , casual shoes are worn by billions of people around the world .
the dispersion of factories fuels another problem as well : labor abuse .
most brands don 't own or operate their factories , so the plants they work with are in countries with little to no worker protection laws .
so no matter what your style , we can all take steps towards a sustainable future .
it is built on three major pillars .
over the next five years , we will train an additional 1,000 health workers to use Sentinel detection tools and empower them to train their colleagues .
so you two have been working together forever , and you really came together pretty aggressively with the Ebola crisis back in 2014 .
we are basically committed for 24 hours ' turnaround time in order to give results , and that requires for us to work around the clock nonstop .
so it 's a pretty challenging moment .
at least I have the privilege to see family today , and then I 'm sure tomorrow I 'm heading back in the trenches .
I believe that with technologies and knowledge and then sharing information , we can do better and then we can overcome .
so how are we going to do it ?
well , we 're creating a compound training library and with collaborators applying these molecules to SARS @-@ CoV @-@ 2 @-@ infected cells to see which of them exhibit effective activity .
we tested the ability of bacteria to evolve resistance against halicin as well as Cipro in the lab .
and that 's not all .
science and technology can give us an important advantage in the battle of human wits versus the genes of superbugs , a battle we can win .
there is great confusion when the two look at each other .
science tends to look at the world through the rational , the quantitative -- things that can be measured and described -- but it gives art a terrific context of understanding .
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking .
it 's been observed , it 's measured , it 's bomb @-@ proof information .
initially , I was working on a National Geographic assignment -- conventional , single frame , still photography .
actually , there 's still a camera out there right now .
there 's a lot of people working on this right now .
now , one bit of science before we get into the visuals .
but 280 is the peak .
Earth is having a fever .
that 's the crux , and someday I hope to emblazon that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places .
but anyway , off to the world of ice .
we 're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska .
this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months .
the calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off , but in fact , it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet .
a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it 's retreated and deflated , gone back up valley .
on up to Iceland .
you can see it deflating .
this is a terrific , terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future .
and actually , this is one I made earlier .
the temperature difference on a Moon base could be anything up to 200 degrees .
and if they came across an obstacle , like a rock , they had to sort it out themselves .
to make matters worse , 1692 brought one of the coldest winters on record .
these three victims were just the beginning .
sentences were amended , prisoners released , and arrests stopped .
the evil wizard MoldeVort has been trying to kill you for years , and today it looks like he 's going to succeed .
let 's start by trying 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to see what happens .
Moldevort could escape those numbers in just three moves .
how is that even possible ?
there are , in fact , points that are distance 5 from each other , which we know thanks to the Pythagorean Theorem .
but the four other smallest numbers , 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , might work .
so these four numbers work !
Ja : I was really young then .
and I have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice .
and the message was very clear : climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
and I remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers .
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out .
at the very best , I 'm going to end up losing some fingers .
narrator ( Video ) : we 're just sailing out of harbor now , and it 's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally .
you did it ! you did it man !
Britain , America , Japan , South Africa , the Congo .
we need to believe in ourselves .
we 've come a long way . we 're doing good .
but there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening : soap and water , and hand sanitizer .
one example is a device that uses salt , water , and a car battery to make chlorinated water that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand @-@ washing .
I 'm a progressive ; I live in a town full of progressives , and 15 years ago , I didn 't have any conservative friends .
and I live there now .
and I found myself wondering : how could vast numbers of people have the opportunity to really connect with people that have very different views ?
and then I met Joan .
( laughter ) During mating season , female lobsters want to mate with the biggest , baddest males , but these guys are really aggressive , and they 'll attack any lobster that approaches , male or female .
but if we don 't know that these kinds of strategies exist or how they work , we can 't know what kind of impacts we may be having , even in the deep sea .
these are animals like oysters , clams , mussels , small fish like mackerel .
build creative clusters in cities ; create more R & amp ; D parks , so on and so forth .
I think it 's always been wrong , because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative , and it 's probably been largely interactive .
had to start -- this is the third point -- with these pro @-@ ams .
consumption , in that sense , is an expression of their productive potential .
and it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
the first is : imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying , " I 've got a fantastic idea .
those were the two places .
they want to be part of that flow of information .
if this is so critical , do we not need it funded , organized , supported in much more structured ways ?
what 's the role of the BBC , for instance , in that world ?
it won 't be so clear @-@ cut ; it won 't be Microsoft versus Linux -- there 'll be all sorts of things in between .
didn 't go into the Internet , kept his money , decided to go into computer games .
he runs a company called Shanda , which is the largest computer games company in China .
what would that do to the resources available to the education system ?
it takes children a long time to break into the system .
I really love cheese sandwiches . "
and Ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest .
child : so he won 't know which one is his .
so the three @-@ year @-@ old does two things differently .
RS : should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua 's sandwich ?
grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder , which is sugar .
and we can compare that to another case , where everything in the real world is the same .
some people think she should deserve more blame , and other people less .
and the first thing is , people can still do this task overall .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : so , I have a question . when you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people 's moral judgments , that sounds alarming .
why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate ?
this isn 't just a nice way to get your to @-@ do list done .
work by Dr. Robert Sapolsky shows that individuals who CANNOT differentiate threat from non @-@ threat and react to everything with the same response have double the level of stress hormones .
Red -- immediately life @-@ threatening .
now it 's easy to be confused by noise , but what it noisiest is not always what is most red .
in fact , my severe asthmatic patient is most at risk when he 's quiet .
that was it .
no , no really , it was quite noisy , this picture on the far right is me wearing earplugs to focus on my book , while the floor is being mechanically dried around me .
now there 's one last triage level that we use in the worst scenarios .
and that is black .
that first feeling isn 't the problem .
and this is very important , because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas .
recently , Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work .
so just like with a bike , we don 't talk about it .
so for the first time , I got invited to speak at the National Parliament .
and what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert . it has no vegetation .
( applause ) Yes , maybe just to round off .
two more than people , and the same as a gorilla .
what 's the point of these radio waves that you 've found ? "
so I said , " What sort of things ? "
I see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
( laughter ) She said , " All these people with Eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . "
but she was blind .
OS : well , they don 't disturb me any more than my tinnitus , which I ignore .
this lack of industrialization , which itself creates a vicious @-@ cycle barrier to the emergence of industry , has caused the dependence on imports .
but he rose to the challenge , and with more technical guidance from an expanding engineering team , he 's grown over the years to lead a group of mechanics in R & amp ; D prototyping .
last year , I was coming back from a trip , and I was singled out by the TSA agent .
the lead TSA agent proceeds to ask - no , accuse - me of bringing a weapon into the airport .
when I insisted that I did not bring a weapon into the airport , he produces a piece of costume jewelry , a double ring that I had picked up for $ 4 on vacation .
it was like his " Gotcha " moment , and it was my superconfused moment .
he got more angry at my explanations , looked me in my face , and said , " You people always lie .
( laughter ) Right ?
and then he started to get very nervous .
so not only do I believe that we 've misdiagnosed the problem , I also think we have the wrong cure to it .
doing so does not mean that we necessarily dislodge education , but it means that if racism and white supremacy are a rock fortress , we assemble greater arsenal weapons to break the damn thing down .
in order to wage this big campaign against racial violence , the NAACP organized mass demonstrations in the streets .
and they petitioned three different presidents to make a statement against lynching .
it was this massive , extraordinary , in @-@ your @-@ face campaign that forced America to confront lynching and mob violence against African Americans .
but so many of these activists have denied the comforts of silence , and they are being active around this issue .
you 've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light , which then becomes shadowed by the angle you 're at .
you 're twisting your head up , arching your back , it 's exhausting . "
they began as casual vagina interviews , and they turned into vagina monologues .
mainly because no one 's ever asked them before .
( laughter ) Vagina , vagina , vagina .
( laughter ) I am worried about vaginas .
but it really didn 't begin there .
we were having a conversation about menopause , and we got onto the subject of her vagina , which you 'll do if you 're talking about menopause .
( laughter ) But I want to talk a little bit about happiness , and the relationship to this whole vagina journey , because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago .
they 're like the Mercedes @-@ Benz of the Rift Valley .
they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network .
I 'm pleased to say that , thanks to massive government funding , about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly .
" that 's right , " it said , " I am YouTube . "
and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project .
suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir @-@ fried with pimentos .
( laughter ) They 'll fund anything these days .
here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of Washington Square Park to another .
what it 's saying to you is what we heard yesterday , Demosthenes was saying to us .
to put it very simply , the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity , if you give them enough devices , democracy will inevitably follow .
and again , I think this is kind of false .
why are they engaging with cyberspace ?
so what happened is that a 24 @-@ year @-@ old man , a Chinese man , died in prison custody .
( laughter ) But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives , people who have grown up online .
that 's not an option being considered too strongly .
it 's going to be pornography , " Sex and the City , " or maybe watching funny videos of cats .
we have seven children in my family .
I read books , science books , especially physics .
( applause ) I could not get rid of them .
so I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
and part of my photographic work is I 'm not just documenting what 's there .
he recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country , and look at how we can scale it .
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable .
over 50 new countries were born .
so , the history of East Asia in fact , people don 't think about nations and borders .
trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region , so much of it being invested into China .
and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound , the economic rebound , not just in Asia , but potentially for the world .
then there is Turkmenistan , which most people think of as a frozen basket case .
so Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
and like our relationship with the ecosystem we 're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet .
but I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent .
the year is 1800 in the castle town of K√¥chi , capital of the Tosa domain in Japan .
to prepare for these diverse responsibilities , young samurai like Banshir√¥ study the " twin paths " of literary learning and the martial arts .
important ? not so very .
but this wasn 't always the way .
now this gentleman , Isambard Kingdom Brunel , designed many great things in his career in the 19th century , including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe .
what makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
because they brought the cost down from $ 200 a pair , down to just $ 4 a pair .
they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today ?
so they developed and iterated these ideas .
and if you 've got any ideas then feel free , you can post them to Twitter .
so I 'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest High Street products .
that is the Torah and everything else is only commentary . "
and we need to revive that spirit .
and I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking .
education because we 've so dropped out of compassion .
people often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody .
you also have to do it .
the same applies to educators .
but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl .
but are these great accomplishments in digital technology really the endgame in terms of what can be achieved ?
so what if I told you that you didn 't really need a million @-@ dollar robot to provide remote surgery ?
this reduces their travel time , improves their access , and saves money .
doctor 2 : if you see here , that 's the upper part , the most outer part of your tumor .
it connects people . it democratizes access .
( laughter ) And I 'm not that far .
and all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph .
and we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth @-@ like planet .
if , one day , and I think it will be within 15 years from now , or 20 years .
quite the similar idea , then , a perfume packaged in a book , in a die cut .
but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .
and then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house , and attacked me during my morning walks .
I think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sabbatical .
if I look at my cycle , seven years , one year sabbatical , it 's 12.5 percent of my time .
Scotch tape came out of this program , as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M .
anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical ?
that 's about five percent of everybody .
and I 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical .
this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies , and not for everybody else .
and mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto , where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning .
and I understood that the building itself was a logo .
colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software , the Casa da Musica Logo Generator .
this is after a week .
and the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between , " Should I really take as much money as I can ?
( laughter ) I think you see , you see them sweeping . you see them sweeping right here .
so we asked the goose to do it again , and hoped she would do somehow , a more elegant or pretty job .
Hank Willis Thomas : I 'm Deb 's son .
and really , it 's because everywhere we go , together or apart , we carry these monikers .
she 's taught me that love is an action , not a feeling .
dw : and also , the idea about love , photographers , they 're looking for love when they make photographs .
you know , I had my camera , and I knew I needed to prove to myself that I would make a difference in photography .
but I thought about also that black photographers were missing from the history books of photography , and I was looking for ways to tell a story .
I grew up in a house full of photographs .
( laughter ) Did you see her poke me ?
I grew up in a house full of photographs .
and then I found and I discovered black photographers like Augustus Washington , who made these beautiful daguerreotypes of the McGill family in the early 1840s and ' 50s .
it was the first time I had ever been on an airplane and the first time that I had left my country , Rwanda .
how are we going to build all of this ?
are we going to follow a model of unsustainable building and construction similar to what I witnessed in China ?
it 's a floating prototype structure that can be adapted to clinics , to housing , to markets and other vital infrastructure this community needs .
K√©r√© and his team working in the communities have developed prototype schools that the whole community , similar to every project in the villages of this country , comes together to build .
and one out of 36 of these mothers dies during childbirth .
however , the approach I built here is actually high @-@ resolution , low @-@ cost , and probably most importantly , very scalable .
now , you can see , I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together .
you can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool , where I 'm kind of warming something up , making it malleable , and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state .
these hyper @-@ spectral images are false @-@ colored so you can -- it 's really good for determining vegetative use .
and you notice what it does .
it was released at SIGGRAPH last year .
how do you feed a city ?
so how did we get here ?
this is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . they need each other .
and in fact , that 's true of every ancient city .
and the food obviously went off very quickly .
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre @-@ industrial world .
and the same of course was true for fish .
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this . anyway , and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes .
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .
and this changes everything .
it 's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
now it 's anonymous .
by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they 've actually distanced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature .
and also they 've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we 've seen , are unsustainable .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
by the way , these can be men as well .
and I want us to ask now , what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ?
what would an allegory of good government look like today ?
it will be despairing hostility .
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens .
I really don 't want to just say " I 'm great , " because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then I won 't have any friends .
I mean , surely these were just people who preached , " Life is great , " right ?
and we have to duke it out every day , so we resort to politics .
I don 't know anybody .
so it 's Stage Four . we 're great . who is not great ?
first of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
but the question on the table is this : what kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making ?
I had never been outside Nigeria .
and so we had , as was the norm , live @-@ in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
she asked where I had learned to speak English so well , and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language .
I 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
he felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
the American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North .
show of hands : how many people think it 's the gray one ?
let me show you what I mean .
there 's no inherent meaning in information .
because in the statistics of your past experience , it would have been useful to do so .
I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same .
now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red .
and what I 'm going to do is , I 'm going to hold it here , and I 'm going to spin it .
you 'll see one of the bees come out here .
so , illusions are often used , especially in art , in the words of a more contemporary artist , " to demonstrate the fragility of our senses . "
well , one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound , and we enable people to hear their visual world .
and then we just simply translate that into sound .
we can also make music with color .
because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
so , if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain , I 'd like to do this one .
because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter .
I 'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light .
do they look the same ?
here 's another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
and there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging @-@ out space inside .
there were definitely hang @-@ out spots .
and they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies .
and I 'd like to tell you the story in three acts , and if I have time still , an epilogue .
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals .
so , the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan , places that are close to water , places that are near the harbor to fish , places protected from the winter winds .
and we might think of these as abandoned .
where do they get their water ? where do they get their shelter ?
and you can look at what a wet meadow needs .
and that you can put these on a grid that 's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way .
they are the connections that actually make nature resilient .
and the structure of this is what makes nature work , seen with all its parts .
so then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps .
and we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III .
the next day , the farmer 's son rides one of the wild horses , is thrown off and breaks his leg .
they didn 't focus on all that was wrong with my kid .
and sometimes our medical institutions decide what lives are not worth living .
you have heard this ableist trope before : the boy with Down syndrome who 's one of God 's special children , or the girl with the walker and the communication device who is a precious little angel .
and there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy .
and I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again .
every country has a contextual alcoholic drink . in France it 's Pernod .
it tastes great within the borders of that country , but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else .
the second reason is , we CANNOT keep doing animal experimentation forever , and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model .
and the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder , and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical .
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders .
now , this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries .
" can the brain build such a perception ? "
they are highly reactive , and they are super @-@ plastic , and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us .
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they positioned ?
but as you do this , what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations , and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse .
so it 's very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circuitry .
I started off in Uganda .
( laughter ) How annoying would that be ?
( laughter ) " And stop speaking like that . "
it 's a process of academic inflation .
( laughter ) Actually , do you know that old philosophical thing , " If a tree falls in a forest , and nobody hears it , did it happen ? "
she did " Cats " and " Phantom of the Opera . "
it wasn 't an available condition .
and when they got out of the room , he said to her mother , " Just stand and watch her . "
and they watched for a few minutes , and he turned to her mother and said , " Mrs. Lynne , Gillian isn 't sick .
our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip @-@ mine the earth for a particular commodity .
if all human beings disappeared from the Earth , within 50 years , all forms of life would flourish . "
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely , and that we avert some of the scenarios that we 've talked about .
with all that other stuff going on , it would be amazing if our behavior didn 't change .
( jackhammer ) for more than a few seconds , you 'd feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you 'd be leaving the room in droves .
just a word on music .
music is very powerful , and unfortunately , it 's veneering commercial spaces , often inappropriately .
in these communities , the fishermen developed a kind of social contract that told each one of them to hold back a bit to prevent overfishing .
we find the same story around the world .
this is a story of the commons , and also how to avoid the so @-@ called tragedy of the commons .
so today , we pump millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the air , we dump plastics , fertilizers and industrial waste into the rivers and oceans , and we cut down forests that absorb CO2 .
we need to recreate the social contract of the fishing villages on the global scale .
but what does it mean in practice ?
this deforestation drives extinction .
I met global food companies , financial institutions and local government officials .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households .
and you 've got to admit , over the last year and a half , consumers have been doing some weird things .
what I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption .
so we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession .
everything is focused on betterment , training , development and moving forward .
then we look at the High Line in New York City , an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand @-@ new park in New York City .
in addition to this kind of high @-@ resolution geometry , since it 's all captured with cameras , we 've got a great texture map to use for the face .
and I go on the podium .
so that was a sort of a success .
I mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra .
you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body .
Riccardo Muti , please .
but -- ( Laughter ) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger .
now what does Riccardo Muti do ? he does something like this ...
( laughter ) " Why ? because you don 't let us develop .
well , can you do it with less control , or with a different kind of control ?
it 's not true . when he was a young man of about 30 , he wrote what he called " The Ten Commandments for Conductors . "
so it 's not about my story . it 's not about your story .
let 's see another super @-@ conductor , a German super @-@ conductor . Herbert von Karajan , please .
once like a Muti , and you 'll -- ( claps ) -- clap , just once .
when he does this , it 's not , " Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix , smash it on the floor . " it 's not that .
he says , " This is the gesture of the music .
that is another story .
when Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes , going from here ? ( singing ) You know what happens ? gravitation is no more .
( music ) Do you remember the face of Muti , at the beginning ?
it 's suffering , like , enjoying himself in a Jewish way , as they say .
now it 's a reversed thing . you 're telling the story . and you 're telling the story .
and for the last video , I think this is simply the best title .
it was my daughter who reminded me of how much I used to feel .
I turned off my cell phone , put in the calendar , " Day at the beach with the girls . "
so I curled up next to her and I drizzled sand on her other arm and then her legs .
and you can understand , obviously , the transmission problem between people in high @-@ virus areas .
and they are having great fun .
this is in technology . this is in the area of politics , where pundits , the CIA , MI6 always get it wrong .
forget about pensions . think about life and where it 's going to be going .
and of course we need to worry about the individuals , particularly the individuals that feel that they 've been left out in one way or another .
we know , and I know from my own experience , that amazing things can happen , when individuals and societies come together to change their future .
nothing new was learned .
the first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899 : radioactivity .
again : dots there rather than there , on a screen .
you have your interpretation . we have ours .
consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons .
Hwami has fantastic takes on what it means to be an African and an African life .
it is able to move around its environment .
and I was on death row at that time .
the basic thing I got to learn was that if I thought , and if you think , you can , you will .
so , first of all , before we start , how many of you in the audience have been in the past a victim of this bug here ?
we rolled up our trousers , and waited for mosquitoes that were coming to bite us so we could collect them to check if they were carrying malaria .
but I do this mostly to improve people 's lives and well @-@ being .
it turns out we actually know very little .
and that 's part of our duty .
new ways to try and get new options that we can use together with things such as bednets to be able to get to zero .
the males go there for a dance , the females fly into that dance and select a male mosquito of their choice , usually the best @-@ looking male in their view .
what does this tell us ?
and we 've put together a cohort of young scientists , male and female , who are champions , who are interested in coming together to make this vision come true .
I 've camped my whole life . and I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip .
one : that society equates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person .
three : I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
at first , living in the van was great .
and when several of the homeless men realized that , including a former university professor , they said , " You aren 't homeless . why are you really here ? "
by the summer of the following year I was a working journalist .
I was no longer homeless .
( laughter ) Well , except they 've been pre @-@ warned now , and they 'll know you 're making it up .
Sarah thought quite hard about the things I 'd explained -- and she concentrated , in those days , on listening .
either they 're the same , or this one 's bigger than this one , or this one 's bigger than that one .
there is . head @-@ tail @-@ head overlaps itself .
on this side , there 's a different experience .
and that 's an informal way of presenting it -- that 's why there 's a difference .
it 's another way of getting the intuition .
and I will give you two little snippets -- two examples -- of projects we 're involved in in my group in Oxford , both of which I think are rather exciting .
you know about the Human Genome Project .
why do we care about that ?
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
and in fact , if this is the prevalence of the disease , about 100 will have the disease and the rest won 't .
and it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong , in two different ways .
he looked at some research , which said the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clark 's is about one in 8,500 .
when you multiply 8,500 together twice , you get about 73 million . "
and to argue , then , that the chance of a second death is as if you didn 't know that information is really silly .
that 's the first problem .
in the disease example , we had to bear in mind two things , one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not .
the other explanation is that she was guilty .
now , we probably think a priori that 's unlikely .
it 's also true -- and , although , you , as a collective , are very special in many ways , you 're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right .
it 's very well documented that people get things wrong .
even if you believe the number , just like the 73 million to one , that 's not what it meant .
and there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that .
in the case of uncertainty , we get it wrong all the time -- and at the very least , we should be aware of that , and ideally , we might try and do something about it .
the young man 's name was Evariste Galois .
it wasn 't , in fact , revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous .
and he wrote to the academicians in Paris , trying to explain his theory .
symmetry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN .
here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in " The Magic Mountain . "
and I said to Professor Kurokawa , " Wow , the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they 'd made a mistake and put this one upside down . "
b , for example , rotates the little yellow dot to the B on the starfish . and so on .
so what if I do B , which is a sixth of a turn , followed by C , which is a third of a turn ?
well , the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with .
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
so rotate along halfway along the edge , and they all match up .
so , there was a sixth of a turn . a third of a turn where the Z pieces meet .
so I think it 's a great example of things unseen , which the power of mathematical language allows you to create .
18 . so it goes to this lady here .
if you look at all the world religions , all the main world religions , you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion .
therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
so , God thought , " Nope , I 'm going to create the world just with compassion . "
the idea of justice , which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what 's right about life , what 's right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
you have to act compassionately .
and , like Chief Seattle said , " We did not spin the web of life .
just a photograph .
the question was : " what is the greatest commandment ? "
but now , to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say , and to be a good American -- for me , is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family , that family together that understands the nature of our unity .
after many years of training , of disciplining , of search and struggle , he comes back .
it is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions .
we know it all .
and he said , " That 's ridiculous . you can 't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth . "
he thinks , " What can I do to fix up this dog ?
so he says , " Well , I 'll put my tongue on the dog 's flesh .
and he had to close his eyes , it 's so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
and then , suddenly , there 's a pfft , a noise like that .
and he said , " You didn 't have , until this moment , real compassion .
and then , among them , you think of your friends and loved ones , the circle at the table .
and then you try to say , " Well , the loved ones I love .
and then the Buddhists , of course , think that , because we 've all had infinite previous lives , we 've all been each other 's relatives , actually .
I 've been female , and I 've been every single one of yours ' mother in a previous life , the way the Buddhists reflect .
a theist Christian can think that all beings , even my enemies , are God 's children .
you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings .
but anyway , that 's the " lovely love . " and then finally , the fifth step is compassion , " universal compassion . "
and you then feel you must act .
and in Buddhism , they catch it in the future life .
so , practice compassion , read the charter , disseminate it and develop it within yourself .
OK so , a quick natural history , first of compassion .
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy .
the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family .
I mean , for example , none of us , probably , want to go to prison , but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison . right ?
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison .
good , because before I tell you about that good news , I 'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain .
it 's why social organization has grown from the hunter @-@ gatherer village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a globalized world .
and I 'm afraid we have another good news / bad news story , which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature .
I think it 's worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand .
it was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election , eliciting various counter @-@ measures by Israel .
now , in one sense , the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial .
if you 're just talking about social structure , OK , clearly that 's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels .
but then at some point , one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff , which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution : cultural evolution .
by cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas .
a lot of you have heard the term " memes . " the evolution of technology , I pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand axe .
now , back to the unfolding apocalypse .
and I would say the non @-@ zero @-@ sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
so , what do we do ? well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control , the international regulation of dangerous technologies .
I think we 're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world .
and something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of " democratization of intimacy . "
and I would actually , I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they 're doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
and this is exactly what we 've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends .
100 percent are using text .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy .
contestants also put themselves forward .
or is this research forever , or what ?
but recent advances in brain imaging technology have given neurolinguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language learning affect the bilingual brain .
the heightened workout a bilingual brain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases , like Alzheimer 's and dementia by as much as five years .
and I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues , when they were dealing with India .
may he be called to wash away his sins . "
look around you , look at your own countries .
there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes .
if you 're in the U.S. , it 's mostly the blacks .
we had somebody from public health . and Devdutt also mentioned public health .
and it was a simple idea . it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field .
because there is no profit in it .
[ video ] Woman : then get me one of those fancy water purifiers .
our drinking water safe we make .
so much peace in one place ?
and as for outsiders , white , black or brown , tar and feather them , and whip them out of town .
goodbye , Martin Luther King .
look what we 've ...
and there are stand @-@ up comics who are talking about racial issues , about ethnic issues .
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they 're seen .
currently there are 509 million cellphones in Indian hands , in India .
in fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the U.S. and China , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
you know , when I grew up in India , telephones were a rarity .
what 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
( laughter ) Definitely not perfect . so you would probably shut it , at this point .
indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry .
and the concept is to create a kind of onion , a kind of structure in layers .
I guess you won 't be surprised if I tell you that Pinocchio is one of my great influences .
and I tried to design a kind of canary .
it will be launched next September .
( laughter ) Just for my workshop .
I 'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .
they 're discoveries of people and the way people are , and new leadership .
Benki knew this .
and at that young age , 10 years old , Benki became the paje of his community .
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
and what am I doing ? "
we know climate change is going to affect all of us .
we need new models of being a leader and a human in the world .
not an obvious path , she said to me , " It 's all connected .
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages .
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages , and she had a real breakthrough .
and the young women in the village spoke up and said , " We 've changed our dream .
if you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how , how have you achieved so much ?
but he doesn 't want his nation ever to forget .
but they have qualities we 'd all recognize .
they 've tried to connect worlds they didn 't know existed before .
they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it .
they know people have come before them and will follow them .
and they know that they 're part of a whole , that they depend on other people .
and they have humility .
it just happens .
we can change the way we see ourselves in the world .
but , at the time , in the 13th century , it was the gadget of the day .
and the mater has some scales and puts it all together .
that 's the movable part of the sky .
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time .
the way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky .
and they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year .
and I will start the world like this .
and what happened ?
you can see that the health started to improve .
it was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
and the market reformer was successful there .
and it 's healthier than the United States .
and I can understand him , because Washington , D.C.
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
but what I 'm really worried about is war .
and it 's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate .
and it 's increasingly clear that we aren 't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever .
for every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
but of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
there is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that underpins this transition approach .
actually , if current trends continue , it could all be gone in five or 10 years ' time .
and we have the elves in the form of China .
and what are the stories that we tell ourselves now , as we look forward about where we 're going to go .
we can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
it 's viral . it seems to spread under the radar very , very quickly .
it 's open source . it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
transition groups in Chile , transition groups in the U.S. , transition groups here , what they 're doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
because if we cling to it , and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices , the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable .
but , how far away is it ?
here I am -- I 'm the second person on the left -- ( Laughter ) with the elders in Gidan @-@ Kara , a tiny village outside of Sokoto .
it took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune , which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location .
I 'm still on hold .
in the hardware world , it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller , smaller , smaller .
they don 't need the database and the website , but they 're like , " Well , I 'll upgrade , because , I might , you know , I might need that someday . "
we like to think of the Internet as a global village .
now , it would be inconsistent to put " United States " first , but it would be intelligent .
it 's like a 747 shuttle cockpit .
he says , " Nice talk . " and I said , " Thank you . what do you do here ? "
Chris Anderson : Oh yeah . DP : hold that and don 't let go .
did he say fun ? Rupert ? yes !
( laughter ) Or failing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
ca : I still just want to draw out on this issue .
all these things have happened .
but today , the way I want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
an ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star 's life .
now , this is wonderful , because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope , the smaller the detail that we can see .
with this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
so , we 're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius .
and the truth is , I 'm not quite there .
but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shouldn 't proceed in that environment .
and on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy .
and last but not least , none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that 's been made on the technology front .
and we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast , and holds a lot in store for the future .
if you are well @-@ versed with inches , nine inches , centimeters , 16 [ centimeters ] .
there are a number of techniques to harvest rain .
below the surface there is hard saline water .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it become like this .
whether water level goes up or down , the beauty is there throughout .
but perhaps they knew that on sixth , November , 2009 , there will be a TED green and blue session , so they painted it like this .
I 'm talking to you about modern @-@ day slavery .
Shaheen 's background I don 't even know .
Anjali 's father , a drunkard , sold his child for pornography .
yes , there were eight men who defiled me , raped me , but that didn 't go into my consciousness .
it 's in that context that I rescue children .
can you just encompass these people too ?
now , I should pause and say , what do I mean by puzzle ?
so here we have Penn and Teller , same upside @-@ down .
okay , let 's go back to the slides .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
it 's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece , a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically .
" Bejeweled " is a big hit . it was the game that really broke open what 's called casual games .
where is that ?
and she 's desperate to find more evidence for the link .
and somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday .
( laughter ) But , you know , he 's gone . now he 's gone .
he says , " We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan . "
5,000 maximum , and no rockets . no , no , not going to do it . "
but he says , " We want a nuclear @-@ free world . "
( laughter ) ... " who said , reach out and touch ... "
and I quickly found I was really quite useless , because there wasn 't all the equipment that I had become accustomed to available .
and I heard about a concept out of MIT , called the Fab Labs .
these are digital fabrication labs that allow , in a rather small space with not very expensive equipment , people to have access to these tools to be able to make almost anything , as the slogan goes .
and immediately , we had wonderful results .
so you can imagine my surprise when one day the dean of engineering came and said to me , " Kamau , the students who spend most of the time in the Fab Lab are failing their exams . "
and some of these places are really quite famous .
they just need a space at a desk , and so we provide that at a fee , and others take up bigger spaces and are able to set up their offices .
I 'm pretty sure he passed his exams .
so we 're really proud to be able to say that we have an original equipment manufacturer in Nairobi that 's provided what 's effectively an industrial robot to supply parts for General Motors .
and what you 're seeing in the image at the top left over there is very typical of semi @-@ skilled artisans who are making products for the marketplace that are really crude .
we have lots of discussions in our space around who we were as Africans , who we are today , and who we want to be vis @-@ √† @-@ vis things like consumerism and ethnicity and corruption and so on .
that 's just because , in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery , it 's created to look at American lives .
well , for one thing , we 're a youth @-@ obsessed culture .
I didn 't know what was going on , but I was so part of the process of getting that out .
he subsequently got married again at 102 , so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him .
I didn 't know who she was , and she said , " Did you get George Abbott to talk ? "
it was all part of Clare Boothe Luce 's look .
I don 't own a guesthouse .
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists .
now , I 'm reading this thing , and I 'm going , what is that all about ?
what are you doing with what you 've been given ?
if you 're wired to paint , you paint .
and I just watched their little bodies rise and lower , rise and lower .
Hello , everyone . because this is my first time at TED , I 've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit .
where I work , in the Arab region , people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western , nor are they traditionally Islamic .
the USA .
its videos are intended to show a kinder , gentler face of Islam , for young people to deal with life 's challenges .
" the 99 . " the characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah : justice , wisdom , mercy , among others .
" the 99 " and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross @-@ cultural hybridization .
as part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody , not even with their lawyers .
and I was one of those people .
in particular , one person had put it forward .
in fact , I read it in the newspaper .
at the same time , while I was interviewing the Red Brigades , I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
they were constantly short of cash .
it was a psychiatrist . he loved sailing .
he was a really keen sailor . and he had this beautiful boat .
you know , that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money , thinking about the economics of terrorism .
the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism .
and the third , of course , is the globalization of terrorism .
then comes the late 1970s , early ' 80s , and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism .
it has happened with Industrial Revolution .
now , I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime , terror , and illegal economy , before 9 @-@ 11 .
( laughter ) Now , until 9 @-@ 11 , the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States .
the entry point , of course , of most of this money were the off @-@ shore facilities .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
all the other countries , for example the United Kingdom , can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders .
and believe me , it 's going to be scary .
and at the end of a shoot , I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes @-@ sensational documentary .
and over there I experienced other people 's suffering , up close and personal , immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories , and at times I experienced great fear for my own life .
( laughter ) I basically decided that it was I , not the camera or the network , or anything that lay outside myself , that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning .
and he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on Earth today .
they use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response .
and that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non @-@ aggressively .
and then there was this : " Mister Splashy Pants . "
and it wasn 't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying , " We love Splashy Pants ! "
they said , " No , just kidding . we 'll give it another week of voting . "
but even more important was that they accomplished their mission .
and the cost of iteration is so cheap , you might as well .
so it comes from the southwest . it 's a southwest monsoon .
keep that in mind .
you 're too keen . you 're too keen . no . hang on . hang on .
it 's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia , including the Maldives .
but wind is , invariably , every time , is from the west .
are they coming from India against the wind ?
and there is a front between them , and the front moves .
but they are incredibly good fliers . this particular species , it can fly for thousands of kilometers .
what 's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here .
the sun is overhead there . summer rains in southern Africa .
it 's now back there . they come out , it 's time to come back .
so , now they don 't stop here , or even down here .
they have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from India to Africa . includes this one , the hobby .
he was flying off the coast of Goa , 21 years ago , 1988 . October , 1988 .
but metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words .
we all have synesthetic abilities .
sadly , it 's metaphorically true .
when life brought about a series of death and near @-@ death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India , similar to 911 in USA .
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right .
most definitely you don 't want to pay the bribe .
we 've been trying for 50 years .
you have to make it from something else .
and the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
we have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
seven nations are involved in building this .
we have to get to this .
I wish this were different . we really need it now .
I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gilgit , northern Pakistan .
my name is Zamin .
or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside ?
my name is Papusay .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that 's based on technology trends .
and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be , and maybe how you can do something about it .
you can see around 2001 it finally out @-@ sold the VCR .
( laughter ) Now they 've introduced these four ways of looking at technology , these four stages of technology 's life .
as you probably know , gene sequencing -- in a large part , because it 's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Moore 's Law @-@ like level .
that 's as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
and you 've seen the numbers .
and the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to India , is the pissed @-@ off programmer , is the outsourcing .
and on the other side there was a rising sun .
and in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
because in the balloon , like in life , we go very well in unforeseen directions .
and when we drop the ballast overboard we climb .
of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon , but in life itself .
but sometimes it 's very paradoxical .
when Brian Jones and I were flying around the world , the weather man asked us , one day , to fly quite low , and very slow .
( laughter ) And then he asked me -- and this is something I will never forget in my life -- he just asked me , " You 're the good pilot up there .
we are burning , as you heard , so much energy , not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life CANNOT last for long .
so , we went down actually .
that 's when you throw out all the ballast , all the certainties , in order to adapt to the new situation .
I had no idea how it was possible .
that has been achieved after two years of work .
it 's not designed by an artist , but it could be .
this is not an airplane .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
but much more , to get advices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air , of course it 's possible in the ground .
I 'd like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the University of California .
and each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain .
so , here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something , but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something .
but a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
so , here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy .
so , to avoid that -- I have to avoid it somehow -- is I use dead people .
it reminds me of my college days .
if you 're a mammal , if you 're a rat or an elephant , or a human , in between , it 's the same story .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
we found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles off the coast of Italy , on the island of Sardinia .
and one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people .
you go into the bars in Sardinia , instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar , you see the centenarian of the month calendar .
that 's called the grandmother effect .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
it 's a place where people have the longest disability @-@ free life expectancy in the world .
five times as many centenarians as we have in America .
once again , a plant @-@ based diet , full of vegetables with lots of color in them .
and they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do .
and that diet is known as the Hara , Hatchi , Bu diet .
and one of the questions , they were very culturally astute , the people who put the questionnaire .
they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning .
my editor at Geographic wanted me to find America 's Blue Zone .
( laughter ) So , we turned to the data again .
and we found America 's longest @-@ lived population among the Seventh @-@ Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda , California .
but for an Adventist woman , their life expectancy is 89 .
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old .
and predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
ed Rawlings , 103 years old now , an active cowboy , starts his morning with a swim .
her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here .
she rides her bicycle .
they don 't have any conveniences .
when you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti @-@ inflammatory state .
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .
this is an average size king cobra , about 12 feet long .
what 's the point of all this ?
but complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt .
this was actually just taken last year .
people scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it , something you wouldn 't do in most north Indian rivers .
and now [ these ] new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don 't drown in the net , then they simply cut their beaks off .
whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .
you think of , you know , urbanization , consumerism , the workplace , technology .
they want to get back to slower rhythms .
in medicine , I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick @-@ fix mentality you find in conventional medicine .
and if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway , you 'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going .
thank you very much .
now , when we started working deeper and digging deeper , we found that it 's an illegal act .
we weren 't sure at all . and we managed to convince him .
and we said , " Okay , here is some seed fund .
it transformed them . what you will see is their journey , and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world .
( music ) Atul Karwal : aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .
and we plan to extend this to other parts of the city .
so , on August 15th , again , Independence Day , 2009 , empowered with the same process , we empowered 100,000 children to say , " I can . "
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .
right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism , and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan .
child : our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
girl : are you ready ? audience : yes !
it was incredible .
70 years ago , it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of " We can . "
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India ?
Google MapMaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
( laughter ) Yes . I 'm sure ! just change it !
this , of course , is a map of the moon .
there 're some very delightful names .
( laughter ) Djabran Fluctus .
( laughter ) Now , we 're going to be going to Mars one day . and when we do , it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names .
( laughter ) Yeah , I 'm at the Depressio , and I want to get over to Amazonis so I plug it into the Mars map , and click the button and there 's my directions .
( laughter ) Left to the Thymiamata .
and you know they 're international because they put it " en Francais " as well .
and I think that Djabran Fluctus , that fits that mode .
" yeah , that 's the goat goddess right ? the Abacazanian ?
( laughter ) Also , from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest .
we 've got to change this stuff up fast .
" yeah , go to your room . "
you see the icosahedron again .
October 9th , in France , Jean @-@ Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe .
( laughter ) Ren√© Descartes , of course . once again these Grenada people , this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination .
Hey , you can 't make this up .
I actually go to bed every night thinking about what I 'm going to wear the next day .
clothing transforms me , defines me , gives me confidence .
MD affects his muscle strength , his pulmonary system , distorts his body and makes everyday life more challenging than most .
he came home from school one day and said very definitively that he was going to wear jeans to school like everybody else gets to wear .
in 2013 , I founded an organization called Runway of Dreams .
I met a young man who was 18 who has cerebral palsy .
he was going to Harvard University .
I knew that if I was going to make a change in the industry , I had to use my background and really figure out how to make these clothes modified .
the first were closures .
in Oaxaca , in Mexico , the teachers ' movement organized a protest after the president pushed down very undemocratic reforms .
the woman who filmed this was a very , very courageous eyewitness , and she had to go into hiding after she posted her video for fear of her life .
this is the story of Chrissy .
ten billion video views on Snapchat , per day .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
and all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet .
so , I don 't know , just stick with me . right ?
so , first of all , what are we looking for ? bright Green city .
we 're already an urban planet ; that 's especially true in the developed world .
here , for example , is Vancouver , which if you haven 't been there , you ought to go for a visit . it 's a fabulous city .
they 're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars , which is a pretty great thing .
you can start doing things like , you know , transit systems that actually work to transport people , in effective and reasonably comfortable manners .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we 're actually using .
so we have a model in potential , an emerging model that we 're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in , and turn them into Bright Green cities .
it 's every seven days .
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
so what we have , increasingly , is cell phones just permeating out through society .
the second thing is tools for collaboration , be they systems of collaboration , or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration . right ?
it 's doing something new . there 's new things happening .
and as we heard last night , as we 've heard earlier this week , are absolutely , fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions , is we 've got to craft new political realities .
basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
his core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees .
( laughter ) To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead .
by 7 : 08 , I started to black out .
so , I started to really get really paranoid .
and I started having ischemia to the heart .
the central motif of Bharti 's practice is the ready @-@ made store @-@ bought Bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
to the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse , or your shirt , but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .
you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
they are not nearly as complex as hollow organs .
( laughter ) I 'm a surgeon so that 's not that funny .
while I 'm talking I 'd like you to also be thinking about : how many places have you lived ?
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle @-@ age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
but none of that 's in my medical record .
he 's a colleague . he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . right ?
I 'd suggest that that 's a bad idea Bill , because of this report . "
so with that , I 'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
so they 're deprived of understanding their reality .
so I can go back to my story .
we were actually recording history .
so I prepared two plans for that meeting , two strategic plans : the small one and the big one .
and what these guys need , actually , is access to capital .
and I can , but I 'll give you just , maybe one , and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with .
I have no interest in being in media business .
and those can be environmental bonds .
once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix .
and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture .
and that 's that the company and the building was multiform .
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .
now , in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was female genitally mutilated .
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down crying .
we will not cut you .
and I want to do it for Sunitha .
I am connected to everything and everyone . I was born like that .
Don 't tell me not to cry , to calm it down , not to be so extreme , to be reasonable .
I love , I love , love , love being a girl !
and we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace .
he leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
as a researcher , every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting .
so , this incident that I 'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea .
you get it , either in pill form or you get it as an injection ; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels .
adherence rates . how many people are taking their insulin every day ?
it 's not just medicine .
you see , what 's going on here , and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world , some models that you use to understand the world .
one person walks into a car lot , and they 're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris .
I 'm going to take off some of that weight , and I 'm going to buy a Hummer that 's 11 miles per gallon . "
this is a typical insulin injection .
so , the patients print it out , because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network .
but the short story is : if you 're a patient , you want to be on the blue line .
and you take those data , and we find the patients like him , and we bring their data together . and we bring their histories into it .
and he took lithium , and he went down the line .
and it works almost every time .
happiness is supposed to make us better workers and parents and partners ; it 's supposed to make us live longer .
I think we could learn from this today .
it evokes the giddy disorientation that you feel in an unfamiliar place .
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
one discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally .
SS : so Kanzi is very interested in fire .
he 's learning the uses for a fire , just by watching what we do with fire .
( laughter ) This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo .
video : goodbye .
subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this .
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself .
what is she writing ?
" a frame " represents a hut in the woods .
compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
and so I regard that as done .
and the thing you 'd most like to analyze , we 're a fair distance from .
it 's what 's called " fever of undiagnosed origin . "
but even that 's complicated , because to me , colors might indicate " normal , " but after all , we 're all suffering from probably an excess of education .
how do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with ?
what you see here is another centimeter @-@ sized device , and the different colors are different colors of dye .
and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting , which is , the yellow seems to disappear , get through the blue , and then get through the red .
now , I have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business .
it works really , really well .
if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease , we can take it enormously the other direction , and obviously , that 's where we need to go , going forward .
so , the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease .
and I think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have strived to understand cancer .
people got upset , but this is the only way we 're going to go forward .
we have designed , and we have worked on the modeling -- and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team -- the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system .
you know , I 've been using it for two and a half months .
it 's really unsatisfactory having plug @-@ in art .
the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun .
TS : no . ( JH : no . ) TS : the first one I did was in the late 70 's , and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it .
but then I started dreaming of having six colors .
TS : so something like this .
you think of yourself as the servant .
TS : nature is -- well , it 's a godsend .
because there is this asymmetry , which creates , basically , failing governance .
no wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany , but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia , everywhere , systematically bribed .
and that 's why the law has changed .
thank you .
I 'm not a doctor ; I 'm a chef , I don 't have expensive equipment or medicine .
this is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world .
can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today ?
look at homicide at the bottom , for God 's sake .
I wanted to put heart and soul and people , your public , around the statistics that we 've become so used to .
she has six years to live .
Stacy does her best , but she 's third @-@ generation as well ; she was never taught to cook at home or at school .
Justin here , 12 years old , he 's 350 pounds .
he has to bury the people , OK ?
this is preventable disease . waste of life .
and the way I look at it is : if you don 't have knives and forks in your school , you 're purely endorsing , from a state level , fast food , because it 's handheld .
( sighs ) Ten percent of what we spend on health care , as I said earlier , is on obesity , and it 's going to double .
( video ) Who knows what this is ?
child : onion . Jo : onion ? no .
the big brands , you know , the food brands , need to put food education at the heart of their businesses .
definitely they shouldn 't be left out .
OK , notice there 's now a roof above us .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
also , these are intermittent sources .
now , this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you 're using .
innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there 's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
the main problem we have here -- it 's kind of like with AIDS : you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
if the trade @-@ off you get into is , " Let 's make energy super expensive , " then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
and even Lomborg has changed .
we have vast budget deficits .
that 's the argument I want to make tonight .
local power , central power , now , people power .
you weren 't in charge of policing , justice , education , health , welfare .
we have only , in government and in politics , started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution .
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see .
so those three ways -- transparency , accountability and choice -- will make a huge difference .
we 're being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book .
how do you do it ?
that sort of behavioral economics can transform people 's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government CANNOT possibly achieve .
so , it 's not just about the words .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
it 's part of our life .
and , perhaps , until we 're tested , we don 't know what we 're made of .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes .
and that 's what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
the teachers didn 't know a switch had been made .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
and what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what 's called a " catch mechanism , " or " click mechanism . "
but that was not the end of the story .
and so , I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out .
and actually , in a certain sense , technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas , if you can think about it that way .
you might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two .
the principal didn 't want to stand up to the parent because he didn 't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings .
you have to go in a school bus . "
the case went on for two years ; I think he 's still appealing the case .
I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing .
because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else 's freedom .
this is the hardest hurdle .
the problem is , we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values .
( applause ) So , what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .
I didn 't have one of those , but I got the Fitbit .
now , I had this brain scan done several years ago , and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex .
and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals .
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
people have a hard time figuring that out .
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle .
he studied Alzheimer 's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia .
and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain .
and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars .
but you know what ? I was getting work experience .
let 's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance .
they can do graphic design , all kinds of stuff with computers , photography , industrial design .
I CANNOT emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .
well , that 's the end of my talk .
( applause ) Chris Anderson : thank you so much for that .
the thing is , autism comes in different degrees .
but then you get these smart , geeky kids with a touch of autism , and that 's where you 've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things .
you know , the slaughter plants I worked with in the ' 80s ; they were absolutely awful .
how many cattle are MOOing their heads off ?
you directly observe a few simple things .
patient : their shapes ...
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information .
but for a long time we couldn 't quite figure out : wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?
( laughter ) I had to have long conversations with my wife .
so , it 's an important demonstration of the power of motion .
so what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn , glorified my school principal , put him right on top , and gifted it to him .
the rest of my family are boring academics , busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car .
so , I tried going to the art store .
so I decided , I 'm going to learn to paint by myself .
and I talked about the weakness of male sexuality .
I met Belinda when she was 16 .
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride , and touch children and be honest .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they 're really quite distinct .
that 's not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
you have that much uncertainty .
DK : you know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
again , this is not an optical trick . this is what you would see . in other words , it 's not a camera cut . it 's a perceptual trick .
we can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents . what do you see here ?
do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? it 's completely static .
it 's a static image . how many people see this illusion ? it 's completely static .
and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn 't respond .
well , there 's analog and digital . thought that was appropriate here .
and that 's exactly what cricket has done .
another half an hour and we would have won . "
princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers .
England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , " The world must play 20 overs cricket . "
and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
it was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
the other was Indian cricket .
and look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
they started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .
and so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more .
the best Indian players who played every test match -- every one of the internationals , the top of the line players -- standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year .
there 's no filth , there 's no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody 's gone . this tells you how the capitalist world rules .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info @-@ graphic .
( applause ) Now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , " Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? "
so I can step back , and expand on that .
so the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
I 'm going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
and so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wisdom to be found .
so with that , I thank you .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I didn 't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
and I 've learned that that deep @-@ ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
you know , it 's Arthur Clarke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
so , with " Terminator 2 , " which was my next film , we took that much farther .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , " This is going to be a whole new world , " this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . "
because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port .
and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn 't give me .
after the success of " Titanic , " I said , " OK , I 'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I 'm going to go be a full @-@ time explorer for a while . "
they don 't survive on sunlight @-@ based system the way we do .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , " What am I doing out here ?
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? "
and we became a family , over a four @-@ and @-@ half year period .
and it completely changed how I do movies .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
well , I think number one is curiosity .
let me repeat that : there is nothing that you have to get , do or be in order to be happy .
we define our life in the following way : here I am , here is where I want to go , these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go , and if I succeed , life is wonderful .
she 's investing in the process , not in the outcome .
so , today I 'm back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement afoot , now , around the world .
I also talked about community @-@ generated data -- in fact I edited some .
but they are not applicable in all situations .
and so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
well , at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars , that 's 8.3 hours per day . the average wage in the U.S.
so , it 's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign .
the question was , how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh ?
and if we are neighbors , I could just walk over to his house .
and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day , which is like 700 dollars per year .
and again , here are some of the lessons .
so you could feel good about selling it .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear @-@ cut forests .
it 's hard to overstate the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they 've collapsed .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn 't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
" that 's right , " he said . " we 're so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . "
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , " he said .
" sustainable proteins , " he said .
( laughter ) So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
he said he didn 't know . he would ask around .
let 's call him Don too .
( laughter ) I fell out of love with this fish .
I actually am .
it 's the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
it 's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
and then he 's off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants .
what 's the feed conversion ratio ? "
well , he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
they 're feasting . "
Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn 't even be there in the first place .
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I 'll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
you might say it 's a recipe for the future of good food , whether we 're talking about bass or beef cattle .
how are you going to feed the world ?
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
now , I don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
that 's been the motivation , it 's been the justification : it 's been the business plan of American agriculture .
instead , let 's look to the ecological model .
and if I 'm going to be really honest , they 're a better chef than I 'll ever be .
you know , I 'm okay with that , because if that 's the future of good food , it 's going to be delicious .
OK . we 've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .
so I 'll take you through that and we 'll see what it 's like when someone really summons the will to survive .
OK , this is Mount Everest .
camp Two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what 's called the Western cwm .
and , after actually two months of preparation , we built our camps all the way up the mountain .
these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun @-@ up .
that 's another crevasse .
and this is at Camp Four .
you can barely stand outside the tent .
you can see his hand is completely white ; his face , his nose , is burned .
he 's collapsed in the snow here . everything is quiet , there 's very little red anywhere .
this is the posterior part , where his muscles are going to be moving , and he 's going to be pacing himself .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive , but in suspended animation for as long as 250 million years .
the next day , she was doing so well , they wanted to run tests on her .
yet , it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
I 'd like to buy some concentrated , compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas , see , about wanting to suspend people .
so that 's kind of a tough day , but I said , " There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this . "
I mean , who knows ?
it stopped moving .
and with money we got from DARPA , we could show just that .
waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .
wow , what a great day that will be once we 're allowed to actually do those kinds of things .
and it 's the whole field that we 've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel .
I was like , " Actually it was your idea . you said it in a Fortune Magazine article .
the first word that comes up is " doctor . "
our entire health reform discussion right now , health I.T. , when we talk with policy makers , equals " How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe ? "
I can 't stop this from happening .
here 's why .
if you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows up is surprise .
it might sound like it 's a bad thing .
this supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System , of course .
Ja : if you think about it , Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America .
Ja : the ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point .
where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is , number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done .
and in fact , there 's a proposal on the table now for building number seven .
not so in human beings : you cut off an arm , you cut off a leg -- it doesn 't regrow .
the greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing , and it turns out that this is not so important any more .
except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in GenBank , Moore 's Law is right here : it 's the blue line .
this is on a log scale , and that 's what superexponential growth means .
this is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School .
( laughter ) So , you want to know where life is happening ?
and that 's the triangle between Salk , Scripps , UCSD , and it 's called Torrey Pines Road .
so , if there is something you should fear , it 's that you 're not keeping your eye on the ball .
it 's got nothing to do with inflation .
Oh , yeah , and it takes about 5.6 million Indians .
and I said , " I think she 's dancing . "
and the third said , " Let 's find another director . "
so I rethought the whole thing , and then we all came to a consensus .
and here was the introduction of this great British icon called " Elizabeth . "
I 'm doing it right now ; you can watch me . I 'm getting nervous , I don 't know what to say , I don 't know what I 'm doing , I don 't want to go there .
and as I go there , of course , my A.D. says , " You know what you 're going to do , sir . " I say , " Of course I do . "
you remember how India was . there was no pollution .
my father was a doctor .
what does forever mean ?
and I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity .
we all , everybody , has a story that they follow .
but that puts some kind of burden on me .
find that which is not .
and the mortal self was the girl that Walter Raleigh was sent , and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine .
of course , all the British press got really upset .
I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film .
are you with child ?
and how we tell stories visually , with music , with actors , and at each level it 's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other .
so the design has a story .
but you get up at 4 a.m.
that first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other .
there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals .
there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate .
very , very interesting planet .
( laughter ) This is Olympus Mons .
water is the key ingredient in the evolution , the origin of life on a planet .
sixteen percent , by weight , of the interior contains frozen water , or ice .
a lot of heating , frictional heating . it 's going 18 thousand miles an hour .
the rocket engine begins .
I have a scale model here .
well , that is precisely what has happened around the world .
there 's no need to play the market .
here 's the reality .
now , everything I 've been telling you , I admit , is pretty disheartening .
slavery , illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society .
it 's about helping people to build lives of dignity , stability , economic autonomy , citizenship .
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped .
we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch , and end up as second class citizens .
and that rooftop did not have any ceiling , only half a tin sheet .
but they know there is this myth that children from the slums CANNOT speak English well .
even if it takes me four and a half hours , or three and half hours to finish my book , I do it .
fathers have started to attend .
now they have started writing their signature .
we had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study .
it seems that with or without us , life will go on .
now , there he is calling to his friends .
now we 've got a movement .
and what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
for kids like me , being called childish can be a frequent occurrence .
which really bothers me .
kids already do a lot of learning from adults , and we have a lot to share .
( laughter ) Or just like you ? really ?
now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
now , the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well @-@ known , bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher .
( laughter ) There is nothing on the other side .
so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this .
and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .
and , again , it 's because of an alignment of the incentives .
not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
let 's just stop treating people . "
no , and I call it the " compassion conundrum . "
it 's all politics .
from the point of view of a public health nerd , junkies are doing dumb things .
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
we 're not all of them , of course , but TED is a community of opinion leaders .
a few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA , the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn 't take the risk of doing .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
and then the surgeon pointed out , with a lot of anger , he said , " Why is it ? at the end of the Civil War , they were shooting each other with muskets . if somebody lost an arm , we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it .
you 're going to give us an arm . "
and it was astounding how positive they are .
but I was saying to him , " You know , the first airplane went 100 feet in 1903 .
we 've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people . "
so with this , now the top body is lighted up ; it 's walking in our lab .
we do something to something , and just like magic , it moves .
instead of using electrical motors , electromechanical actuators , we 're using compressed air .
let 's see how it does .
it 's very impressive .
we have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .
nobody criticizes any opinion .
there was a great TED moment -- I think it was Sir Ken Robinson , was it ?
" the Sleepy Giant , " which is the song that I just sang , is one of his poems .
this is Rachel Field , Robert Graves -- a very young Robert Graves -- Christina Rossetti .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
‚ô´ Well , you 've been so ... ‚ô´ That 's innovative , don 't you think ?
there 's never been a time like this .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
thank you .
the horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact .
in the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
but images don 't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and I 'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we 're doing on the bottom .
so I marveled for a moment , and then decided it was time to release him , so I put him down .
and I remember that proverbial light going off in my head , thinking , " Wait a minute .
and after the first week , they ignored us .
and they would see a coral head , maybe 10 feet away , and start moving over toward that coral head .
and I always wondered what happened under that web .
but we 're just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid @-@ ocean ridge , which I think is even more extraordinary .
there 's no coral , algae growing on it , and the water 's pea soup .
I think Margaret Mead said it best .
my answer to that is don 't look at the big , overwhelming issues of the world .
and do that , and spread the word .
Jean @-@ Michel Basquiat , important to me because [ he was ] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into .
my interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history , who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art , but who have created new places for us to see and understand .
it looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art .
I 'm showing you two works , one on the right by Leon Golub , one on the left by Robert Colescott .
and she pointed to the image on the right as an example , to me , of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media .
this is Harlem , actually , on January 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way .
and I bring this up because it 's important to locate this practice in history .
after his lecture , a student got up and said to him , " Give us a poem . "
it is why I make exhibitions .
now , where , perhaps , does this end up right now ?
what do I think about when I think about art ?
that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world .
in the spirit of Jacques Cousteau , who said , " People protect what they love , " I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean , and that 's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light .
my addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp ; that 's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect .
we trained in a tank in Port Hueneme , and then my first open ocean dive was in Santa Barbara Channel .
it was an evening dive .
and the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence .
in the ocean , it 's the rule rather than the exception .
well , that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois , asked about this bioluminescent clam .
so , for example , this fish has a built @-@ in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate .
and I have no idea why there 's two , and that 's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light , but it can see red light .
this is a viperfish , and it 's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name .
and we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar , and I 'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people .
I do wish , with their budget , that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor , starving graduate student , who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that 's been preserved in formalin .
and this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it .
for this fish , it 's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes .
the other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote @-@ operated vehicles .
so , I 've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .
and I had my window into the deep sea .
for example , when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on , you assumed this was a microphone , which it is not .
but I 'm going to take some medication .
and she didn 't answer the damn question !
she doesn 't bring any useful information to us .
the second question that I 'd like to ask , rather simple : suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father @-@ in @-@ law , as an example .
is this a hunting game ?
John Edward , Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea , they are other operators .
if they call back any of my friends , they 're not going to ... Well , you see the story .
very simply won .
it 's very easy , win the million dollars .
she did this on the " Larry King Live " show on CNN six and a half years ago .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) The answer may surprise you .
he forgot to take his pill .
she did accept and then backed away .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
at the same time in South Africa , after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison , the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid .
hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated , slowly and painfully .
it exemplified the best that humanity has to offer .
as reports began to surface , again international aid went in .
a prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun .
a boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine .
a marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family .
and if they lose their booklets , their records can still be pulled by searching with their names .
at the time , we imported internet appliances called i @-@ Openers that were manufactured during the dot @-@ com era by a failed US company .
so dealing with a lack of water is quite ingrained in my soul .
we used to fill balloons with flour instead of water when we played .
if it saved water , they replaced it , eventually reducing their employees ' water consumption by half .
taking me to lesson three : look below the surface .
this is my favorite part . are you ready to be cured ?
( gasps ) All right .
so if you change those ingredients today , you 're basically teaching your brain how to predict differently tomorrow , and this is what I call being the architect of your experience .
( laughter ) That mind racing is prediction .
maybe you 're tired .
is it possible that you can transform emotional suffering into just mere physical discomfort ?
what intrigues me most is how women are doing this , despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating .
she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed .
if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to , the man 's family is cursed . "
that had an impact , too .
in fact , the whole world used to look like that .
SB : yeah , and I think we are crowding , and there is losses going on .
and then George Church says , " That 's all right .
and grasslands are made by grazers .
these people face grave threats to their safety , their livelihoods , their dignity .
right now , in the United States , in India , in Slovenia , people like Ravi are raising their children in the shadow of factories or mines that are poisoning their air and their water .
it 's issued by the state government , and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions .
Ravi said , " I believe in the law , I do , but it 's not getting us far enough . "
in those days , most cultural and public institutions didn 't really care to preserve these treasures .
so he created a mix of compas mixed with funk and jazz .
he knew the artist , at the time of the recording , was living in Montreal , so for months , he tried to track him down .
we then try and find out every little thing we can about that record -- the artist , the label and supervital information like " Who 's that playing trumpet on track three ? "
embrace curators ; we are alternative voices to the mainstream music channels , digital or otherwise .
go beyond the algorithm .
your job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects as you can think of .
well , even starting from Mathematica , this is still a huge amount of work .
you can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology showing up in more and more places , working both with this kind of public data , like on the website , and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on .
let me show you a couple of examples here .
if you go on , that 's a slightly more complicated program that 's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on .
I think it 's actually rather wonderful .
does your work relate to his ?
you 'll notice , they 've all got something that I don 't .
I thought there were them and there were us , and I was not one of them .
so for 11 years , I conformed .
and I think I knew from day one that it wasn 't the right job for me .
to try and answer that question of , " What am I supposed to be doing with my life ? "
then , when that gave out , I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those .
and finally : am I crazy ?
so , how do you top rowing across the Atlantic ?
whereas if you look in Google Earth , this is how the Pacific looks .
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive .
now wall switches , we all know , fail .
now , one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it 's going to do , in general .
I mean , with the health system , you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side , but in terms of the system itself ?
I 'll give you three examples .
the technology is there , the infrastructure is there , and yet it doesn 't happen .
in fact , that is the leading cause of under @-@ five mortality .
" not so fast , " say other people .
we made it easy -- I 'll tell you how in a moment .
so , that 's for bed nets . so you will think , " That 's great .
you know how to immunize kids , you know how to give bed nets . "
so let 's go back to Haiti for a moment .
this is where gut decisions come from .
and Samuel Pierpont Langley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success .
the next 34 % are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards .
they said , " We have a product that pauses live TV , skips commercials , rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking . "
they showed up for themselves .
( laughter ) Listen to politicians now , with their comprehensive 12 @-@ point plans .
when Al Gore won his well @-@ deserved Oscar for the " Inconvenient Truth " movie , I was thrilled , but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly .
over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -- all entirely preventable and treatable .
that 's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area .
we 're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho .
these people have been through a lot and none of us , most of all me , helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other .
we 're undoing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future .
and it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
and I ended up in Jamaica , in the West Indies , where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary , structurally , that I ever saw in my life .
we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past . "
and the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
this is from the coast of Brittany , which is being enveloped in this green , algal slime .
all that white coral .
so , obviously , you CANNOT have two principles of justice , one for yourself and one for others .
so , fairness to one and to the other is not divisible .
just do it 10 times ; you will realize the pain in this shoulder .
an anonymous , faceless , nameless person gets in contact with the network , and then gets an identity .
and if you cure him , I will get my wall painted . "
any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment , only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something .
and she 's so marvelous .
( applause ) Look at what Rojadeen has done .
so he thought , why don 't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine ?
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only .
so , when I die , my wife 's risk of death can double , for instance , in the first year .
and then the next line over says if your friend 's friend 's friend , someone you probably don 't even know , is obese , your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher .
in addition , because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic , there 's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic -- if we find that guy , there was a spread of obesity out from him -- it 's a multicentric epidemic .
you 'd rather be D , on the edge of the network .
now , what is the point of this ?
this was created using raw materials from Earth .
today , you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure , create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it .
there 's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find hemozoin .
sort of like doing dialysis , but for relieving the parasite load .
one of the problems that you have if you 're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don 't know what 's the most effective thing to do .
we 're going to the dry season now .
well , we could protect very high @-@ value targets like clinics .
audience : yeah !
and you 're not reading that in the Post .
they also , unfortunately , have higher rates of mental illness and suicide .
they make them worse .
what if we held them to a higher standard than we are right now ?
they 've just been sold a bag of goods .
( laughter ) I 'm the pro @-@ logic guy .
and no , I 'm not the anti @-@ weed guy , I 'm the pro @-@ thought guy .
so long as you 're an adult , just think .
something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
if Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
the corals are doing better here . lots of small fish .
if we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
when we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
the top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
if the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
I mean , it 's just a losing proposition .
for example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
this is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
this is really destructive .
( laughter ) In all seriousness . here 's an example from a physics textbook .
I 'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
none of it 's a distractor , so we lose that .
we need more patient problem solvers . thank you . ( applause )
it is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park ...
and she said , " Mom , have you done this before ? "
because she knows that I adopted her and that I can 't have kids .
and then she got all caught up in the legs . " but how would the legs go , Mom ?
one , two , three , four , five .
KS : that was spectacular .
moderator : you played all of that by yourself .
now , how many of you in this room consider yourself a carer ?
I am a former cared @-@ for patient myself .
in those situations , carers are also advocates for the patient .
there are currently more than 100 million carers providing 80 percent of care across Europe .
and this realization is allowing us to re @-@ conceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases , by controlling angiogenesis .
but what 's very cool is when we combine the two less potent teas together , the combination , the blend , is more potent than either one alone .
if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor , it loses weight .
stop the treatment , gains the weight back . restart the treatment , loses the weight .
best of all , I 'm healthier , I know that I 'm going to live longer , and I 've even lost a little weight .
we see beautiful beaches , cute animals , beautiful nature , cultural rites and stuff .
here we see , it says on the top , " Families in the world by income , " and we have the street represented just beneath it , you can see .
so let 's go there .
they look pretty much as we 're used to , right ?
so we go to China , we pick three families .
coming to our group up here , similar shoes , Jordan , US .
it 's great stuff .
Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another .
and the last one is a Richard Feynman quote : " what I CANNOT build , I CANNOT understand . "
but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we 're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool .
very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of .
the other big issue is conformity .
there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
one is fast food , where everything is standardized .
( laughter ) It worked out for Eric , that 's all I 'm saying .
and I wanted to just very quickly -- I was very struck by Natalie Merchant 's songs last night , recovering old poems .
( applause ) Thank you very much .
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada .
here 's what he had to say .
it forced him to be a little more innovative . ( music ) And that actually reminded me of jazz great , Charlie Parker .
now , the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they 've learned how to copy themselves .
in other countries there is protection for our artful designs . "
but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world , it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really ineffectual .
very low novelty standard , anybody can register anything .
the retailers have kind of quashed this notion though .
there 's a bunch of other industries that don 't have copyright protection , including the food industry .
it doesn 't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look , you CANNOT copyright the sculptural design .
( applause ) It ain 't pretty .
I want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film , " Children of the Taliban . "
then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
he looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic eruption , even of an asteroid hitting the Earth .
we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
but when was the last time you worried about smallpox , a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us ?
now , it 's interesting because there are 30 @-@ odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we 're still threatened by things like HIV and flu .
you took a pathogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
in addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models .
so what we 've got is a situation .
what if that wild bird flies by again ?
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
so , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem .
it 's such a large conference .
beautiful stuff .
it 's just gorgeous .
and very , very quickly -- I love puppets .
it dances to music .
indeed , I was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president .
( laughter ) Okay , speaker Lawrence Lessig , right .
okay .
okay , see ? it 's done . it 's almost done . here we go .
great , here we go .
they serve food to poor people .
I want to share with you my latest hero , Julian Sanchez , a libertarian who works at the , for many people , " evil " Cato Institute .
here 's lesson number one .
it should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who 's had a sing @-@ a @-@ long or a dance party with a group of good friends .
and to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter .
computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space .
has to come back out , whatever you put in .
if you presented it with a chess board , it tried to figure out what you might mean by that .
let 's just come down a bit and fly around .
and finally , I 'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery .
we can grab elements off the front , where upon they reanimate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here .
what do you think , what in your mind is the first killer app for this ?
ju : it 's been a great pleasure .
in reality , these animals have no terrestrial counterpart ; they 're unique in the world .
this was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
you have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end .
I actually jumped in and photographed this , and with the fisherman 's permission , I cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free .
it 's a video game move from " Star Fox . "
and we 've gone from one board to 48 boards .
two is you do not talk about / b / .
they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet .
but if I ask them , is the TED website going to go down ?
but anonymity basically allows people to say anything , all the rules gone .
and when you 've got that , you 've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money .
and it 's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
so that 's what we 're arguing about .
so below the ice , there 's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
and when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they emit light at particular colors .
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
that 's a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
that 's quite an incredible prediction .
what happens when you have a star that 's right on the edge of that mass ?
and what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit , and then it explodes .
in fact , that one is a carbon @-@ oxygen dwarf .
and it 's actually in the machine .
little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust , and they fall out of the tracks , the exact angles makes it hard to get right .
small stuff stinks , but , of course , it 's essential , right ?
and so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
( barking ) Dogs .
he was lured to a bogus address by a youth gang .
and sometimes , in deep trauma and deep tragedy , there is a spark of clarity .
and essentially we have three mandates .
it 's important to do . we lose so many on a daily basis .
and our third mandate is to teach the principles of nonviolence , of empathy , of compassion , of forgiveness .
he lost his grandson to the adult prison system .
and I remember that meeting because we were -- he 's 37 , still in prison -- but at that first meeting , we locked eyeballs .
I 'm looking in his eyes , he 's looking in my eyes , and I 'm looking in his eyes trying to find a murderer , and I didn 't .
so , are you ready for the lecture ?
it had to do with golf .
Charley : and I am . ( MS : okay . ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it 's interesting .
you only get one chance to make a first impression , and that 's true if you 're a robot as well as if you 're a person .
the first time that I met one of these robots was at a place called Willow Garage in 2008 .
and that was not a great first impression .
the thing that I learned about robots that day is that they kind of do their own thing , and they 're not totally aware of us .
and what I learned that day was that I had pretty high expectations for this little dude .
he was not only supposed to be able to navigate the physical world , but also be able to navigate my social world -- he 's in my space ; it 's a personal robot .
they get new names .
when you drive your car , it feels like you are operating machinery .
in contrast , the genetic difference between HIV subtypes from different patients may be as much as 35 percent .
within a person infected with HIV , the genetic difference between an infecting mother virus and subsequent daughter viruses has been shown to be as much as five percent .
it was a like a graduate course in ecological ethnography , and I got busy taking notes with a camera .
I want to go over the horizon and find new things , find weird stuff , like this volcanic caldera in Niger .
if you were to walk through those palm groves , you could drink fresh water out of your footsteps .
I also loved looking at how animals have adapted to the African landscape .
I never thought I would see date palms in snow , but the kids that day had a great time throwing snowballs at each other .
Don 't move . stand your ground .
we lived under apartheid regime .
during the same year almost every Himba had a rifle .
because it was wartime , the British .303 rifle was just all over the whole country .
then in the same time , around 1980 , we had a very big drought .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well ?
we have already reshaped conservation in the entire country .
( laughter ) But imagine with me that you 're a conservative member of Congress .
and you 're amazed that he admits in that speech -- a speech of 17 minutes of pure American exceptionalism -- that some of the materials needed for the spacecraft hadn 't been invented yet .
you are ready to lead .
play your part before it 's too late .
( applause ) Thank you very much .
just interested , did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all ?
it 's the lift , it 's a series of buttons in the lift .
and she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which , in a business context or a government context , would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing .
I said , " When people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they 'd probably quite like to look at .
let 's face it , most of us -- how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine ?
and if actually we created a Ministry of Detail and business actually had Chief Detail Officers , then that fourth quadrant , which is so woefully neglected at the moment , might finally get the attention it deserves .
and before we have the debate , I 'd like to actually take a show of hands -- on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
which means we 're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts , if at all .
this is based on ranges from data , but if you look at nuclear , it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
in a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
the one on the left . okay . so I 'll rotate it so it 'll be the one on the right .
you get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around .
let 's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance .
when there was one boat , not much of an impact .
it turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time , and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
even when business is booming , CSR just isn 't designed to scale .
so let me tell you the story about Mars .
if you 're like me , they make some important products , like coffee and chocolate .
and it 's successful for Standard Bank .
Don 't try to sell to the poor kids ; they don 't have cash .
( laughter ) My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop .
it was , " Which color would you like ? "
but it paid the bills .
they go around looking for what it is , then we negotiate what they 'll get paid .
because there 's huge opportunities in that .
I needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that I could go from there .
I present to you an excerpt of that work " Simhanandini . "
this is Van Quach .
she came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam .
they 're about demographics .
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May .
rammed it forwards . bounced down the runway . just took off .
( laughter ) And only from the air did I see the big picture .
Antarctica , if you include the ice shelves , is twice the size of Australia -- it 's a big place .
two of us are doing it .
you 're the only person that decides how far you go and what you 're capable of .
I 'm going to begin by reciting a poem .
these days , I call myself a graphic artist .
I don 't have time to explain it , but it has to do with DNA and RNA .
I 've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .
and this is for a chapter that I 'm doing in a book , and the chapter is on honor .
this is what you can do with some household tinfoil .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) So Valentine 's Day is coming up in a couple of days , and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world .
each one of them is completely different .
so I might ask : " who is it for ? "
so we certainly need more of that .
it will stratify society as much as it liberates it .
and the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the LEGO for the last time as a kid , and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid 's toy .
that stuff 's cool . "
walked into the LEGO store .
the dining room looked like this .
I suppose we are . "
I love the guy who 's like running away with his clasps , his hooks .
( laughter ) There 's a whole programming language and robotics tool , so if you want to teach someone how to program , kid , adult , whatever it is .
and the guy that made this , he made a slot machine out of LEGO .
there 's people getting drunk building LEGO , and you 've got to finish the thing before you puke .
this is my house .
and this is my house .
you know , I wanted him to know that the way we find our strength is through our challenges .
so here I am holding little Thelonious .
so , this is for grownups , but it 's also for Thelonious , when he 's old enough to read it : the world will say to you , " Be a better person . "
the world will say to you , " What are you going to do ? "
find truth beyond the stories you are told .
ask , " Is this fair ? "
we are all more than who we were yesterday .
not with my words and not with my actions . "
when you help just one person to be more secure , a nation is more secure .
those with boats got in their boats and started loading in every woman , man and child they came across .
near and far , people gave their dollars , they gave their cents , they gave their hearts , they gave their spirit .
change @-@ making does not belong to one group of people ; it belongs to all of us .
do you have any advice during these current times ? "
be good to as many people as possible . "
the story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .
now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
I call it cognitive surplus .
that 's the second half of cognitive surplus .
and using cognitive surplus , we 're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific , literary , artistic , political efforts .
designing .
there are other candidates of course , but LOLcats will do as a general case .
freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
this is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini , who set out to test , at the beginning of this decade , what they called " deterrence theory . "
simple , straightforward , commonsensical -- also , largely untested .
and so they went and studied 10 daycare centers in Haifa , Israel .
if you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late , we 're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill .
and the minute they did that , the behavior in those daycare centers changed .
and you can see immediately what happened , right ?
researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles .
and then there 's finally -- there 's the affordability question .
by 1980 , it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right .
I mean now we 're hoping we start to see it ; they 've already built City Hall , attracted two hotels .
so they 've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time .
but some of them were not whale meat at all .
we had these data a few years ago .
in 1932 , that 's the picture .
this morning , the world 's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats , I think concluded that ultimately , the solution is , people shouldn 't sit down .
they pointed out that , I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today , they will be steering cars by wire , without all that mechanical stuff .
( laughter ) That 's reassuring .
every other form of transportation 's been improved .
the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wilshire Boulevard , or Fifth Avenue , or Tokyo , or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns .
because technically I 've got motors ; I 've got wheels -- I 'm a motor vehicle .
and so I said , " Sure . "
they learned to start with cell phones .
if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30 @-@ minute walk becomes 10 minutes .
if you need more resource , you just apply more computer .
so , with that , in turn , 20 million dollars today does this ; 20 years from now we 'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything .
a farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify the world , not just get information about it on a screen .
real invention is happening in these labs .
the only problem with that is it breaks everybody 's boundaries .
the real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems .
it breaks every organizational boundary we can think of .
we maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe .
why grow homes ? because we can .
we 've got McPeople , McCars , McHouses .
it is the landscape , right ?
we use a modified inkjet printer , and we print geometry .
it could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial , but we kind of chose this shape .
that 's why we grow homes . thanks very much .
the simple action of an individual raising a hand led many others to do the same .
for example , if even one fish sees a predator and flees , this can alert many others to danger .
( laughter ) Now , honestly , I didn 't mind a C + .
we know that humans are innately innovative , because if we weren 't , we 'd all be using the same arrowheads that we were using 10,000 years ago .
be inclusive of our diversity -- the way we look , think and act .
they articulated what took us 20 years to identify .
for us , for me , it was about prioritizing children 's voices to give them the tools to help build a harmonious and sustainable world .
but it is not so .
some of them are artificial .
to begin with , artificial landscapes , which I invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time .
he did not know the mathematics ; it didn 't yet exist .
could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new ?
mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
the equation is hidden there , z goes into z squared , plus c .
and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that , and others it is that or that .
thank you very much .
and I 'm thinking , no , this is not possible .
I think it 's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides .
a fifth of kids under two drinks soda .
but I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long @-@ term at things like the food system and make change .
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
in the year 2007 , I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections .
that , I think , is movement .
this box contains one billion people .
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here .
and they will start to buy electric cars .
and they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation .
thank you very much .
to put that in context : more people visit the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory each year than are followers of the Jain religion in America .
( laughter ) Now , a couple of interesting things about Nones are : there are a lot of us , and we skew young .
even if they didn 't believe , they were hedging their bets .
women are still mistrusted , shamed , harmed and , in the worst cases , subjected to honor killings if they don 't bleed on their wedding night .
in Oslo , doctors are examining the hymens of young girls to reassure parents that their children are not ruined .
in Norwegian , it is even called " the virgin membrane . "
you may have wondered why we brought a hula hoop onstage today .
so if we wanted to do a virginity check on this hoop right here , right now , that would be very easy .
it 's more like this -- a scrunchie or a rubber band .
there is no virgin seal that magically disappears after sex , and half of virgins can easily have sex without bleeding .
we wish we could say that by removing these myths , everything would be OK , that shame , harm and honor killings would all just disappear .
and that is much harder to change .
we want them to know that the hymen can 't be used as a proof of virginity .
( laughter ) But how she answers that question is her choice .
this is the ocean as I used to know it .
and they can handle water .
they don 't have another thing they can do .
if you go to the Gulf and you look around , you do see a lot of oil .
parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic .
they 're finding that their world is really collapsing .
there 's a lot you can 't see , also , underwater .
so this is the Gulf of Mexico ...
until you add a dispersant ...
these guys have to swim around through it .
he said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago ; like about a week ago , and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what 's going on .
that guide 's entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
he said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that .
now , in the Exxon Valdez spill , about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months .
so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable .
I 'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water .
they get near shore -- Look at these two boats .
also , for all the shoreline that has booms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline -- all of the shoreline that has booms , there 's adjacent shoreline that doesn 't have any booms .
it 's really , really important that we express our compassion .
( applause ) Not just BP .
and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for , and who has gotten above the laws .
that 's certainly one of the things we need to do .
so I think that the oil blowout , the bank bailout , the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause .
so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it 's our government safeguarding our interests , and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost .
now there 's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place , but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed .
so it 's a continued fight .
it 's a historic moment right now .
we 're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy .
people who sell us fossil fuels .
we 've been here before with energy , and people saying the economy CANNOT withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery .
and that 's because they 're both designed to fit the human hand .
it 's an extraordinary phenomenon , but it 's true .
how does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
it 's not confined to its own lineage .
no other animal does it .
as Adam Smith said , " No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . "
chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
and why does exchange raise living standards ?
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
he can make his own spears and axes .
you render it down . you make a candle , etc. etc .
that 's what we 've achieved as a species .
but a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV 's pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
we 're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other 's living standards .
there 's no working for each other across the colonies .
and the reason for that is because there 's a reproductive division of labor .
it 's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
in all hunter @-@ gatherer societies today , there 's a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
it isn 't always quite that simple , but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
and the man knows that he doesn 't have to do any digging to get roots .
they were a highly cooperative species .
they were a highly intelligent species .
you also see seashells -- as discovered by a team here in Oxford -- moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
he 's totally wrong about this one .
it was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
who 's going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
he is a bridge figure .
he finds a local sporting team .
and it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
the concept centers on something called the Noor stones .
in a world like that , they 'll always be a job for Superman and The 99 .
or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here ?
or have they got longer lives and live up there ?
and the richest 20 percent , they take out of that about 74 percent .
you have to train health staff . you have to educate the population .
there are some web pages like this , you know , but they take some nourishment down from the databases , but people put prices on them , stupid passwords and boring statistics .
we have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here .
we need really to see it .
the first one was actually a funeral -- to be more precise , a reburial .
it basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size .
now the total planet number in our solar system was nine .
in the next 15 years , almost 500 planets were discovered orbiting other stars , with different methods .
but the statistical result is loud and clear .
so the question is : what do we do next ?
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them ?
and so , that 's what we are trying to do .
so why should you care about that ?
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .
it only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .
and the great thing about it is that we 've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about " disappear . "
and also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you 're having , in real time .
now blink left to turn back left .
but I saw parents on social media reaching out to other parents , asking if their autistic children could play together .
and they would tell these kids , some as young as six years old , that society doesn 't want them , and their own parents never wanted a broken child , so they should just kill themselves .
but I think that kids should not be punished , they should be talked to .
but we know we can 't treat people equally to do that .
so I went to his aunt , who is the contact that I have for him .
the celebrant got some of the facts wrong , and it made me really angry .
do you know how you want to be remembered ?
how many of you have a will ?
we wondered : does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one ?
even up to a year later , American parents were more likely to express negative emotions , as compared to their French counterparts .
thank you .
and I brought women into the laboratory , and I asked them , " Which one would you pick ? "
I 'm sorry to have a sad slide like this , but not everything is all that happy , especially in my work .
but lo and behold , I 'm one of the high @-@ end individuals .
and as you know , there 's been a very weak response , up until recently , to actually collect the oil .
it 's gotten much more aggressive .
and we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture .
that 's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects .
but my bad dreams go like this .
and what I 'd like to talk to you today about , a little bit , is really transforming the relationship , or the interplay , between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet .
mountain ranges , plate tectonics , moves the continents around , forms ore deposits .
all of them interact with one another .
that 's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
and many of you remember the early stages of oceanography , when we had to use what we had at our fingertips .
we will be present throughout the volume of the ocean , at will , communicating in real time .
and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites .
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species .
the way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure .
most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food .
people are a little risk @-@ averse . so what ?
many , many people have died on Mt . Everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .
and to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier .
and luckily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air .
and I don 't where I got it from , but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake .
and I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt . Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly .
when I was born , the world 's population was 3.5 billion people .
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri .
now , if you get a Ph.D. , and you decide not to teach , you don 't always end up in a place like this .
so I did it : I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps .
population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet , and right now , it 's a simple " not equal . "
how is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?
it 's got to be something we all care about .
we need Coke to work with Pepsi .
so , the where : we 've identified 35 places globally that we need to work .
why is 25 percent important ?
by companies asking for this , we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .
in salmon aquaculture , we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago .
three of the original eight entities were suing each other .
so it 's the demand that brings them to the table .
the good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago .
and in the next 18 months , we will have signed up to work with another 40 , and we think we 'll get those signed as well .
why is Cargill important ?
that 's not insignificant .
what they 've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance , they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa on 40 percent of the land .
these companies have begun to think differently .
but when we looked at their genes , it turns out that what they wanted to eat was the food we were already feeding them .
I mean , honestly , that is all speculation , but the only thing I know for certain is that there are a hundred billion billion billlion living microbial cells underlying all the world 's oceans .
there was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from Ma Bell .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
( laughter ) ( Applause ) There is one corner , by the way , that I 'm not going to tell anybody about , where the WiFi actually works .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
I 'll give you one very dramatic example of this , a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
( laughter ) He had no idea what that was .
they actually make us worse off .
and , you know , it happens for several reasons .
we don 't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed .
in Niger , one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth .
well , it just so happens , at that time , there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut .
heifer sent two goats to Africa .
they sold the milk for cash .
turns out that it 's a failed irrigation project .
one year , all the chickens died , and no one wanted to put the chickens in there .
join the movement .
feel happier and help save the world .
and there was a huge row online about , " Hey , this can 't be real . "
now , this tech incorporates three big elements .
this is Dimitri .
now , you notice he 's sitting .
you 're actually sculpting a human being here .
you stand up , and you skim the stone .
it 's that simple .
and notice two of them are wearing headscarves , and yes , even they can laugh .
then he opened it up . " born in Iran ? wait . "
I said , " Well , he 's passed away , but his name was Khosro . "
I want to rob a bank in a film , but do it with a gun , not with a bomb strapped around me , right ?
that 's what I try and show in my stand @-@ up , good people everywhere .
they have these GlowCaps which flash and email you and do cool things to remind you to take your medicine .
the eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color , shape and pattern .
should I take vitamin C ? should I be taking wheatgrass ?
so you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity , but you can also , if you grade the evidence , do a " worth it " line .
so the data is now alive ; this is a living image , and I can update it in a second .
their entire camp , every item of gear , was ferried 885 miles from McMurdo Station , the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica .
so you have living dinosaurs and space aliens , animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions .
it 's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all .
and this should be presented factually , straightforwardly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
the reason I 've taken this time is I 've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this .
another reviewer called it " hilarious . "
I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .
question : was domestication good for sheep ?
here 's what he said : " ten thousand years ago , at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass . "
life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet .
and it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse , makes it fearless , so it runs out in the open , where it 'll be eaten by a cat .
first of all , the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is -- it 's to bring purpose to the lives of millions , and he has succeeded .
there are lots of people out there who don 't have purpose in their life , and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal .
yes .
I wish he could do this with a revision , a Mark 2 version of his book .
well , the sense of which I agree with him , except I think it has an evolutionary explanation .
it 's an old move .
baptize them in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , and teach them to do everything I 've told you . ' " the Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world .
I am helpless over this . "
the oil industry is like a huge , gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else , but we actually see it in very moral terms .
this is an early @-@ on photograph -- you can see , we had these gushers .
early journalists looked at these spills , and they said , " This is a filthy industry . "
and we 've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs .
we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves ; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf .
I mean , we 've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations .
apart from shared experiences , trial and error , conventional farming extension services are boots on the ground and radio -- expensive and hard to scale in the face of population growth .
by the end of this year , we 'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions .
and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web , it 's very few .
we have focused on the worst @-@ case scenario .
but we 've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff .
and actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it 's also part of the good news .
it 's a very important period -- it 's roughly half the period when we 've been fully modern humans on the planet .
the system suddenly , very surprisingly , loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover .
the yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point , the pre @-@ industrial point , where we 're very safely in the safe operating space .
under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime .
but again , a crisis , new partnerships , actors locally , transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning .
you solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector , while at the same time , stimulating innovation -- examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level .
and these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel .
and what I mostly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me .
I 've had hundreds of people tell me what they don 't want to feel .
( laughter ) Only dead people never get stressed , never get broken hearts , never experience the disappointment that comes with failure .
these are essential skills for us , our families , our communities .
it costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid .
but then let 's go up from there .
what 's holding them back from supplying that demand ?
everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal .
and then because you 've felt that satisfaction , you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary .
( silence ) Exactly ! well done .
and I wanted to join that team .
Earth observation satellites .
these stories that I 've shared with you all illustrate that space truly is useful for sustainable development for the benefit of all peoples .
it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet .
and what you 're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon .
the Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus , killing certain species of trees in the forest .
the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection .
and aside from coral , the answer is no .
and then , you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old .
they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves , and they also contain records of natural and human events .
and it actually never sheds those leaves , so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom .
so , now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet .
but what 's unique about it is that it 's doing DNA repair below freezing .
and what that means is that it 's not dormant -- it 's actually been living and growing for half a million years .
well , that 's kind of an obvious statement up there .
I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi .
( laughter ) The second thing he said was that , " If children have interest , then education happens . "
at that time , a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India .
they said , " We look at it every day . "
I asked that girl , " Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass ? "
I said , " No , use the method of the grandmother . "
I said , " Well , what you 've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time .
so , having experimented in all sorts of remote places , I came to the most remote place that I could think of .
each group of four can use one computer and not four computers . "
remember , from the Hole in the Wall .
you can go to another group , peer over their shoulders , see what they 're doing , come back to you own group and claim it as your own work . "
and I explained to them that , you know , a lot of scientific research is done using that method .
the teachers said , " Is this deep learning ? "
( laughter ) The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time , sitting in their homes , one day in a week .
( video ) Teacher : you can 't catch me .
teacher : I 'm the gingerbread man .
you know , stuff which I don 't know anything about .
after watching eight TEDTalks , he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci .
( laughter ) ( Applause ) It 's pretty simple stuff .
this is what I 'm building now -- they 're called soles : self Organized Learning Environments .
if they want , they can call the granny cloud .
the mediator is from Pune , India .
so how far can we go ? one last little bit and I 'll stop .
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year @-@ old students .
I started writing English questions on the blackboard .
there was silence for a while , then they said , " You 've spelled it wrong .
and then , in 20 minutes , the right @-@ angled triangles began to appear on the screens .
but in the meanwhile , there is a method available .
I would say with a great smile , " I will definitely pass . "
so it went on like that , and I didn 't know where else to find myself .
and then school also started supporting me .
so it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school .
and one of those competitions , I just won a small , little transistor Philips radio .
I said , " It 's a prize from [ an ] art competition . "
I think you should study in a school of art .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
so this is called " Self In Progress . "
this is the trace of fire , this is the trace of sun .
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
you know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin , and this is the second , and there 's a third , and each creates a meaning .
and he turned to me , and he said , " Carne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . "
and as those numbers suggest , I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world .
I wanted to be an ambassador , and my mentors , my heroes , people who got to the top of my profession , and here I was throwing it all away .
but one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots , which went on for several days , took place -- was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future .
and it 's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump .
that means the power of others things is rising .
we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world .
but I want to be clear , just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood ; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance .
so I 'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean .
and we 've got it worked out , and we can say , " Yes , CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now . "
then there was similar mortality in ' 97- ' 98 .
so these events in our recent past really are unique .
and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it .
that the place where , during an earthquake in 1954 , this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly , and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .
it 's 11 meters in diameter , and we know that it started growing in the year 1584 .
you can see there 's some signals there .
you know , we 're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
so one of the things we 're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells .
so , Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year : " the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO2 release . "
so , let 's explore .
it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two .
and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear .
and it 's important to note that it 's not just the stars who are benefiting : because you can see the best , everyone can learn .
invite the crowd , let in the light , dial up the desire .
okay , step back a minute .
even he said that , and he would know .
it 's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation .
video is high @-@ bandwidth for a reason .
here , let me introduce you to Sam Haber .
face @-@ to @-@ face communication has been fine @-@ tuned by millions of years of evolution .
that 's what 's made it into this mysterious , powerful thing it is .
print scaled .
now , TED is just a small part of this .
schools can 't be silos .
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy .
so , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
and in @-@ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
but what I 'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic , but also actually early detection of an epidemic .
the epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left , over here .
( music ) Thank you . thank you .
in the Netherlands -- where I come from -- you actually never see a pig , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pigs .
in the brewing process , there 's lots of cloudy elements in the beer , so to get rid of these cloudy elements , what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness .
so it 's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee .
that 's really where innovation happens .
so they want to tell the story of the eureka moment .
about a decade or two ago , a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back and looked at Darwin 's notebooks from this period .
and what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany reading Malthus in October of 1838 .
and then someone says , " These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community . "
referencing Steven Johnson 's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from , I was in the shower at the time -- I was alone .
and once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children 's Choir who I simply adore .
they work even when you sleep .
women typically listen expansively .
noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe .
I think there 's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia .
professional hearing protectors are great ; I use some all the time .
protect your ears in that way .
all right : " I 'm more than my genes " -- all together .
what 's in that information ?
if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three @-@ dimensional image .
and so I think we 're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
girls ' brains are like spaghetti ; everything in their life is connected to everything else .
and a neuron , well , that 's smaller than brain .
it 's absurd .
likewise , every connectome changes over time .
what kinds of changes happen ?
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .
and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights , I will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think -- of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
well , I propose a direct test .
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes .
but it won 't be easy , because they 're not going to look like this .
( laughter ) What a mess -- have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this ?
one figure for that : 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition .
this is a picture I took in 2005 , walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul , and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation .
and they are working with me up to today .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho @-@ social care and psycho @-@ social counselors to the system .
now , there are places that make us feel unhappy , unhealthy or uninspiring .
over the past two years I had the opportunity to interview over 100 people from all walks of life about their experience of design .
their clients are orphaned children in Kenya , foster children in Chicago and pregnant women in Malawi .
one of my favorite conversation partners is my 90 @-@ year @-@ old grandmother , Audrey Gorwitz , from Oshkosh , Wisconsin .
and yet , in two million years , the human brain has nearly tripled in mass , going from the one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter @-@ pound brain of our ancestor here , Habilis , to the almost three @-@ pound meatloaf everybody here has between their ears .
Don 't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz , because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time .
would you like to see it again ?
they think they 're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind .
but we began with a family @-@ planning program , following a very successful maternal child health activity , sets of activities .
it 's a part of the Village Development Bank ; it 's not a real bank , but it 's a fund -- microcredit .
and you probably hardly see a Thai man there , it 's always women , women , women , women .
but it 's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior .
and after I gave them statistics , they said , " Yes . okay . you can use all the radio stations , television stations . "
one says , " Weapon of mass protection . "
according to the U.N. , new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent , and according to the World Bank , 7.7 million lives were saved .
they want to spend less and save more .
and we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope .
now bluefin , in general , goes to one place : Japan .
these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
and we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty .
what do they like to eat ?
that 's the closest you 'll probably ever get .
and from our data that gets collected , when that tag comes back , because a fisher returns it for a thousand @-@ dollar reward , we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now , on a backboned animal .
both the electronic tags I 'm talking about are expensive .
we 're going to do something that in recent years we 've started : take a mucus sample .
and my favorite scene , three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico .
same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use .
then there 's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging Leatherbacks that go right past where we are .
they 're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
they 're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles .
what we rely on is not an incomplete system .
but that 's too complicated for today , so I 'll simplify it for you , and I give you one average point for each survey .
and when the experts in the U.N.
and the reason here for Africa is especially important , because ' 90s was a bad decade , not only in Kenya , but across Africa .
but even this is not a fair representation of Africa , because it 's an average , it 's an average speed of reduction in Africa .
it 's not about just five years -- it 's long @-@ term investments .
they had low child mortality and small families .
welcome to a decent life .
there is no such thing as a " Western world " and " developing world . "
I 'd like for you to picture it in your mind .
you 'll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled .
does Amazon carry it ?
this is quite comforting for people like me -- I 'm a professor -- this to be over there on the top of creation .
some of them are much more sophisticated .
and it 's really so graceful ; it 's like a dancing angel .
now , there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen .
he wrote that , " It 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . "
but I am surprised by one thing that they do have : coca @-@ Cola .
take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband , Bill .
let 's look at a country like India .
but let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you .
let me tell you the story of Shriram , an 18 month boy in Bihar , a northern state in India .
so what 's the endgame ?
to me , that is deep happiness .
and after the quake , we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed , to examine what was safe and what wasn 't .
it 's so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it .
the history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms , as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe .
rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands , precisely because objects like rocks and hands CANNOT penetrate each other .
but here is the bombshell : you weren 't there .
the only difference , you see , is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain .
miracles are just events that are extremely improbable .
that 's not what we say .
we are evolved to second @-@ guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant , intuitive psychologists .
it 's happening all over the Developed World , probably for loss of habitat , but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been .
a choice we make over and over again .
and these turbans meant to represent our commitment to serve cast us as terrorists .
I was expecting blame .
and I have to reckon with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given .
" we already forgave you . "
all the points , all the lines -- it 's incredible .
and so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray , and he 's a preacher -- ( Laughter ) among other things .
when they smile -- right , you 've seen people stop -- all of a sudden , life is being lived there , somewhere up in that weird , dense network .
( laughter ) So here 's a series of projects over the last few years where I 've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection .
sometimes they 're very , very simple things .
and I promise you , if you take that walk inside Google Streetview , you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face .
and I collected those moments -- the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories , specifically .
it had ' Chad ' written in magic marker on it .
he died long after he left the pillow at my house , but we never got around to returning it . "
so I thought , " Well let 's just give it a try .
it can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person 's life and , in short to love .
because as that happens , I think we can feel free to interact in a way that 's more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
so because of having cooked food , it 's easier to digest .
it 's a very big signal ; it 's sent to the brain says , " Go and eat . "
we have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward , as you know .
actually , what happens is that a very intricate structure appears .
every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe .
and what happens next ?
( laughter ) No , but it 's true : the Internet has changed the world .
they are shaping our very desires .
and here we are now .
the length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
and that 's why I call it a transformational innovation .
here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot .
time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace , after all the human and animal testing , was 10 years , now it is 15 years .
psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin .
and therefore , the standard process , where you develop a molecule , put it into mice , into men , are not yielding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent .
and basically , what I 'd like to tell you is that power is changing , and there are two types of changes I want to discuss .
what happened ? the Industrial Revolution , which meant that all of a sudden , Europe and America became the dominant center of the world .
to understand power diffusion put this in your mind : computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century .
but to make it more real , if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power , you could buy a car today for five dollars .
so in 1970 , if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously , you could do it .
so let me step back and ask : what 's power ?
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what I call soft power .
it 's not whose army wins ; it 's also whose story wins .
history is not linear .
and that 's the good news I have . we can do that .
the who and the why are what 's important to me .
but what if we eat only in the green list ?
we have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we 've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
while we try to manage declining marine populations , the media 's recommending increased consumption of seafood .
this is what the green list says .
new industries are created , new tasks have to be done and that means often new roles have to be filled .
they 've fallen for the intelligence myth , the belief that machines have to copy the way that human beings think and reason in order to outperform them .
but if human beings can 't explain themselves , the tasks are called non @-@ routine , and they 're thought to be out reach .
yes , the lump of work might get bigger and change , but as machines become more capable , it 's likely that they 'll take on the extra lump of work themselves .
solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways .
now if we look at what 's going on in someone 's head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring .
I don 't know what 's inside them until I open them .
and in the end , it 's this word , " engagement , " that I want to leave you with .
so you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s , when I was seven or eight years old , watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on .
but when I got there , I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .
I needed to head towards conservation goals .
but before I do , I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment .
but the ocean @-@ protected area is basically flat line until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up .
but scuba diving , submersibles and all the work that we 're setting about to do here will help rectify that .
they 're very low to the water , and they 're all uninhabited , except one island has about 35 caretakers on it .
and we finished our trip .
you can see the Islands -- there are eight islands -- that pop out of the water .
in the west we have the Gilbert Islands .
in the center we have the Phoenix Islands , which is the subject that I 'm talking about .
and when I was first going up there , I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago , and people would ask me , " Why are you going to this place called Kiribati ? "
he coined the term " reverse fishing license . "
what we may need is a transformation from today 's system that largely cares for the sick , to a system that cares for the healthy .
to change our current " sick care " approach into a true " health care " approach .
in 2012 , 50 percent of all Americans had a single chronic disease , resulting in 86 percent of the $ 3 trillion US health care budget being spent for treating such chronic diseases .
this may work for solar farms , but when you think of buildings , of streets , of architecture , aesthetics does matter .
the resulting thin layer is the active layer , absorbing the energy of the sun .
and it 's semi @-@ transparent .
I hope organic photovoltaics will be a big part of this .
let me give you an example .
it 's a pretty simple conceptual framework .
if our predictions match our observations , great ! -- we got it right , so we can make further predictions by changing this or that aspect of the model .
( laughter ) But then something amazing happened .
because nothing worth doing is easy .
so those who fall a little behind find it near impossible to ever catch up and appreciate that beauty .
but why is this a problem ?
it 's clear that while we have demand for mathematics skills rapidly increasing , supply is in steady decline .
to put things in perspective , half of the students completing high school today in Australia are not prepared to understand any argument about rates of change in data .
there , you see it now , right ?
we need to put an end to high @-@ stakes tests and instead follow a mastery @-@ based learning approach .
and most of them don 't .
for instance , they found that incentivizing students for inputs , like effort , worked a lot better than incentivizing for outputs , like test scores .
I immediately got excited about the possibilities of implementing this in our program .
but once the excitement settled down , there were a few concerns that crept in our minds .
( laughter ) Secondly , how would we fund this thing ?
so it 's practically naught .
so , from a purely economic point of view : if we don 't use immediate incentives , we are underinvesting in student outcomes .
she said to me , " Mo ...
in fact , as our user base has grown , we found the percentage to be pretty steady , at around 75 percent .
there is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another , even when we know it 's going to make us feel worse .
one of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it .
none of us is immune to heartbreak .
it 's like " Love , Actually " meets " The Fast and the Furious . "
heartbreak is a complex psychological injury .
you 'll be more present with your friends , more engaged with your family , not to mention the billions of dollars of compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided .
this is , like , half the total spent on education in the US .
they could trust their colleagues .
and so we built it .
and there 's a helpful , friendly square that pushes the ball up the hill , and then a mean triangle pushes the ball back down .
even greater pain than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself .
this creates a beautiful fairness circle .
so if fairness is a keystone of life , why isn 't every leader making it their priority ?
wouldn 't it be nice to be able to knock on the door of a Chief Fairness Officer ?
promoting the guy who didn 't finish high school was a risk .
whether worn by refugees or world @-@ changing entrepreneurs , when people are allowed the freedom to present themselves in a manner that celebrates their own unique identities , a magical thing happens .
