it was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market .
I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web . you folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me , right ?
I 've been collaborating with the Mozilla community since 2004 , helping with website localization , QA , user support and community marketing . I 've also helped organize events in Spain and performed IT tasks within the Mozilla Hispano community .
I went to my first local Mozilla event in 2011 and was inspired to do more by all the amazing people I met and got to know . and now , I am the Mozilla Philippines Community Manager .

Thunderbird is a free email application that 's easy to set up and customize - and it 's loaded with great features !
Thunderbird is an open source project , which means anyone can contribute ideas , designs , code , and time helping fellow users .
Thunderbird is both free and freedom respecting , but we 're also completely funded by donations ! help us sustain the project and continue to improve .
Thunderbird is funded by users like you
Thunderbird is no longer funded by Mozilla . fortunately there is an active community keeping it running and developing it further . but to survive long term , the project needs funding .
Thunderbird is the leading open source , cross @-@ platform email and calendaring client , free for business and personal use . we want it to stay secure and become even better .
Thunderbird lives at the nonprofit < a href = " % ( foundation ) s " > Mozilla Foundation < / a > .
Thunderbird makes email better for you , bringing together speed , privacy and the latest technologies . focus on what matters and forget about complexity .
Thunderbird offers support for user privacy and remote image protection . to ensure a user 's privacy , Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in email messages .
