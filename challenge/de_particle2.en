The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.
I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued. "Lizzy!
"I want you to come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, "on account of his delicate health."
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it.
I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
Won't I tell mama? but first--" He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing.
I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.
Miss Abbot joined in-- "And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them.
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room.
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers.
I returned to my stool.
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?
I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without farther parley.
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it, smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."
Then he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night.
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.
I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in the carriage," interposed Bessie.
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie was gone.
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel that I think I shall never forget it."
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
"Little darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper."
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.
I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend.
Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof.
When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable.
I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.
To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow.
It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation.
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained.
As to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.
Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?
I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?"
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you."
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes.
Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit.
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects," continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood."
My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
I gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses.
My mother said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news for you."
"Child! what do you mean?
Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her sweetest songs.
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to the wall."
Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive.
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung with kisses.
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted me into the inside.
We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine.
At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the "stony street" of L-.
I answered "Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.
There was now visible a house or houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
She inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed me along with Miss Miller.
Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty.
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the books and removed them.
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs.
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took her seat.
I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board.
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait.
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her girdle.
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.
Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner.
I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.
I was still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.
In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her directly--
I returned it to her; she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.
Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small.
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately." "Burns, you poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."
I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.
And in five minutes more she shut it up.
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.
I suspected she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
I recalled her to my level.
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown it."
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this sentence.
I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but rather to converse with her own thoughts.
We set out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed.
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors' high stools.
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted.
Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity.
And extending his cane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed.
Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, "this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien.
You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse.
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
Turning at the door, my judge said--
What a strange light inspired them!
Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by.
Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards.
Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.
I felt the impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.
My uncle is dead, and he left me to her care."
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.
And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.
Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.
Why did I not spend these sweet days of liberty with her?
She was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos.
After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory.
At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.
I walked about the chamber most of the time.
I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.
My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits.
I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried, half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere.
Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began to falter.
At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by eight, and it was already half-past seven.
Various duties awaited me on my arrival. I had to sit with the girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.
There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England, yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town. ---shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me.
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.
The next day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she was my natural guardian.
A note was accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."
A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished.
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued Mrs. Leaven.
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends a deal of money."
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child."
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
"So he went?"
We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the "boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield.
I bethought myself to ring the bell.
He vanished, but reappeared instantly--
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton.
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.
About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.
We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.
A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
"I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon."
I'm sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining.
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs.
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven.
The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned.
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.
A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.
Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.
We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs."
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.
Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera.
This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry." Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine."
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c.
I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use.
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said she.
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome.
The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase.
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs.
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work," continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough.
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.
It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.
The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude.
The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near him again.
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before.
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?" pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
In two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
I put down my muff on the stile, and went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet.
The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last he laughed.
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you can."
I took up my muff and walked on.
When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them.
Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side- door, and went in.
It was so like it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me.
I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come.
"What dog is this?"
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morning.
A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom.
Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn.
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
The widow looked bewildered.
Go into the library--I mean, if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,' and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes. "You play _a little_, I see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well."
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better." He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land.
Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine.
Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.
His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester, "put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self- indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite- hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.
No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart.
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on.
Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant.
However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary.
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
It was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre.
The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one now, if you will excuse me."
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his boot against the hard ground.
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with my destiny.
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily) "I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness--yes, goodness.
After this digression he proceeded--
Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.
The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,' shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely.
Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.
I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden.
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.
When we went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English mind.
I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to myself.
The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to him.
I rose and sat up in bed, listening.
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen- door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings.
I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand.
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
If you are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.
I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return; be as still as a mouse.
I was left in total darkness.
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to the bed): "and now return to your own room.
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in both his own.
I bethought myself of an expedient. "I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.
I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's own gruff tones.
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her fixedly
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then she answered--
Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy."
She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?"
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's service.
He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her?
She looked up with a sort of start. "Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.
I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him.
I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen."
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.'
Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.'
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all the money she gets."
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.
Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below.
"Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.
The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I, "but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies."
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.
Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge.
I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to read.
She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were now full.
I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me.
It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with an air.
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.
I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong!
The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester.
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but he never turned his eyes.
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking straight before him.
I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.
Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban three times with portentous significancy.
He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights from the house.
"Then no more need be said: change the subject." Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her out.
Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near.
I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
"I am tired, sir." He looked at me for a minute.
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed beneath its roof!
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party.
He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
I shook my head. He did not insist, which I rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat.
One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
Somebody, unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm.
Its second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.
From the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears.
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.
Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the curtain again descended.
I knew Mr. Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised him.
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
And as the other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.
What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.
Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness.
She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own.
She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.
Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever- torturing pain arose.
I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam.
The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.
Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel.
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!" (apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low impostor?
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed in the Dowager Ingram.
The footman still lingered. "She looks such a rough one," said he.
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library. A comparative silence ensued.
Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under their breath, and looked a little frightened.
Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
All eyes met her with a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to her seat, and took it in silence.
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further conversation.
I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits. "I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.
She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.
The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she will not go till she has seen all.
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney- corner.
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one.
It looked all brown and black: elf- locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.
"I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you that is in you.
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
"A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as it were, out of existence?"
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."
It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study.
She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair. She began muttering,--
It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion.
I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart.
Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?
I expected no one; is he gone?"
I filled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said. He swallowed the contents and returned it to me.
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?"
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then leave me." "Yes, sir."
I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my apartment.
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey. One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are.
I did not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it.
I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his side.
I put my fingers into his.
"Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned the key and opened the door.
He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east.
This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth here!"
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when you go near her.
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named, and returned with them.
I retired as directed.
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with fur.
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to Mason.
He was dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
Be of good cheer, Richard; step out--that's it!"
Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard.
I, supposing he had done with me, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.
Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood before him.
Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.
At last I looked up at the tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he came back he was humming a tune.
Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket." As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying cheerfully--
The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.
To the billiard- room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game.
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the "person" was. He made a curious grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his cue and followed me from the room.
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. "Five shillings, sir."
He looked at me some minutes.
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled. "At your peril you advertise!
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
I was glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
I must be served at the fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by the name of "Miss Eyre."
A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.
I soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to- night.
It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.
So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.
And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.
But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm.
Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was unchanged and unchangeable.
I knew by her stony eye--opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source.
But there was something I wished to say--let me see--" The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame.
"Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to say.
I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.
She proposed a walk in the grounds.
In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.
She passed about five minutes each day in her mother's sick-room, and no more.
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town.
One day, however, as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do.
After my mother's death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other.
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls.
I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?
"Who--I?" was her answer. "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.
I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
"After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there."
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath, she went on thus--
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.
There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble."
And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.
Her plans required all her time and attention, she said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any one.
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her from it.
However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't much care."
I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service.
The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.
The question followed, "Where was I to go?" I dreamt of Miss Ingram all the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at both her and me.
I proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he tried.
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard.
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their petals.
A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise."
I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege for leaving him.
I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.
"It is always the way of events in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired."
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying--listen to me, Jane!
You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester; "and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you."
He seated me and himself.
I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death."
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her.
Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and seriously.
Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said--
None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not--I could not--marry Miss Ingram.
If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly. Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my happiness--I will make yours."
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I have her, and will hold her."
I only smiled at her, and ran upstairs.
I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.
How stern you look now!
And now he unknit his black brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well pleased at seeing a danger averted.
Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.
She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my father!
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and- twenty."
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.
The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him backwards and forwards.
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he to Adele.
She then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. "I'll send her to school yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two yards off me.
She nodded again at the moon.
I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his choice.
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this, 'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.
Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he could play as well as sing.
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and with the best success.
It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.
I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain.
The cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the house and put them away in the store-room.
I lingered; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
The event of last night again recurred to me.
He saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his hat off, and waved it round his head.
As John took his horse, and he followed me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined him.
"Is that a dream?" said he, placing it close to my eyes.
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed.
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed you.
I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence.
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?
I thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every moment."
I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit.
I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke."
But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the mirror.
Just at my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.
After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented smile.
Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
The moon shone peacefully.
I remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still sound repose.
"Stop!" she cried in French. "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have not taken one peep."
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there: return and tell me."
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the footman soon returned.
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.
When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the path to the porch.
Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law recognises, if you do not."
I again demand, what have you to say?"
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."
Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet us.
In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain.
In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and gazed wildly at her visitors.
At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a chair.
Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate. "That is _my wife_," said he.
We all withdrew.
He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.
I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.
The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I thought, for the last time.
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.
One idea only still throbbed life-like within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.
"Let me be torn away," then I cried. "Let another help me!"
And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.
You sit quietly where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.
I turned my face away and put his aside.
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily. "Oh, I know! you won't kiss the husband of Bertha Mason?
What do you say to that? I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use. I know you--I am on my guard."
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.
I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever!
It was only my station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I were some toad or ape."
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. "I keep telling her I am not married, and do not explain to her why.
when I found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest.
I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution.
You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like.
My father and brother had not made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.
That was my Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure.
But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now.
I impressed it on my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
I have not done.
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
Adele claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time.
I think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out. "I resumed my notice of you.
I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
What then is left?
"Oh, comply!" it said. "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his.
His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist.
My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed strength almost exhausted.
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the room.
I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.
The light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling.
I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever.
It gazed and gazed on me.
The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room. "Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!"
No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.
My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided on.
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.
Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty.
There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet.
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me; the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high.
Human life and human labour were near.
Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.
I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.
I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it.
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to enter any.
Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge.
Yet I drew near and knocked.
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.
Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog.
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop.
Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?"
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i' that way."
"How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me.
"Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to give her these porridge."
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.
To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it.
I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.
Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties.
I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.
I cannot call them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.
This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.
He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and fand him.
Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me.
You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill."
Mind you don't do wrong, that's all.
Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted it within.
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb and still.
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
"She does look white," said Hannah.
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had enough." And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
My strength sufficed for but short answers.
I thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy--and slept.
These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
The traces of the bog were removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent.
She bustled about, examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
She opened her eyes wide.
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had asked to see the clergyman.
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
While I picked the fruit, and she made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called the young people.
But she could remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry." Still, she allowed, "the owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."
There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own." Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by the kitchen door.
Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
"To be sure," added her sister.
There was no superfluous ornament in the room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn and well saved.
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.
I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.
I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit.
The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
Indoors we agreed equally well.
Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him.
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept."
I grew impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.
Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, 'Rise, follow Me!'"
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my heart."
Standing still, he again looked at me.
I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.
Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled.
At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.
A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me.
From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.
Your dog is quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me now."
There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty.
Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.
Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?" pointing to me.
His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave him this information.
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman.
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking up. "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.
She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.
She held out her hand. He just touched it.
She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned at all.
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own.
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken.
These soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners.
I found estimable characters amongst them--characters desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.
There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like.
She had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls.
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for "Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.
I looked up at him: he shunned my eye.
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me astonished.
"Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within. "I don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to considerable lengths."
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
I gazed at him in wonder.
You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to.
You missed your epithet.
As His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.
Once more he looked at the portrait.
I pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm continued all night.
I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down "Marmion," and beginning--
What do you see amiss in me?"
He soon stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding.
Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in- law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end.
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers. "I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.
Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone.
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.
Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every ring was perfect, the connection complete.
Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father.
I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot--"
Now you had better go; for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple."
My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point.
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.
I must enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday."
He looked grave. "What now?
"You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?"
I looked at him with surprise.
He is right to choose a missionary's career--I see it now."
The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight.
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.
Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away."
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he departed.
It was then nine o'clock: he did not return till midnight.
Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when he set out.
It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation.
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him: he was serene as glass.
Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish- looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table.
As I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.
He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted.
The craving to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me.
And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient, leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament.
He looked up the pass and down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step.
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column; his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.
Do you not see it, Jane?
I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea _his wife_.
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
Turning from me, he once more "Looked to river, looked to hill."
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.
He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him.
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner.
I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?
Diana clapped her hands. "That is just what we hoped and thought!
He has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no doubt.
and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.
I flew to the door and looked into the passage: it was dark.
I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet.
I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent.
I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness.
I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered station were at my command.
All is still: he again advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest.
The lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.
I could find it nowhere but at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.
I gasped. "Is he dead?"
I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time.
The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame.
The servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was after her continually.
It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head.
He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.
And then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are only some bits of walls standing now."
I summoned strength to ask what had caused this calamity.
As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all fell.
There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained.
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass-plat.
He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.
He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood.
He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
He groped his way back to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
I now drew near and knocked:
I asked John to go down to the turn- pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.
Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_ nothing, he returned and sighed.
He checked the water on its way to his lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood, he did not touch me.
Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it.--What, Janet!
But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.
I had meant to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity I could.
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said. "The rain is over and gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon."
But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.
Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the progress of my tale.
When I had done, that name was immediately taken up.
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own accord."
When I hear it, it carries me back a year.
My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
Famine for food, expectation for content.
I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
a voice--I cannot tell whence the voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where are you?'
I kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.
I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.
We entered the wood, and wended homeward.
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
He saw nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye.
He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was sure of it.
The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.
I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!
There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, 'I do wish they would put their heads down!
'I must be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)
'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.
'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.
'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
'It is a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:-- 'Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, "Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you. --Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do."
'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.
'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.
She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!"
But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!'
There was no label this time with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. 'I know something interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does.
She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!'
She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'
'That you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.
Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!'
'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
Let me see--how is it to be managed?
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important to say!'
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
'I kept all my limbs very supple
'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents!
'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!
After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; 'his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head.
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for days and days.'
'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.
'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve?
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
'If it had grown up,' she said to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on.
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
'I don't much care where--' said Alice.
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
'--so long as I get somewhere,' Alice added as an explanation.
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'
'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.'
'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.''Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the best butter, you know.'
For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'
'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--
'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't do a thing I ask!
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'
'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again before it's done.'
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.'
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: 'But I don't understand.
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-- you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!'
'That's none of your business, Two!' said Seven.
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.
Two began in a low voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
'And who are these?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them over!'
'You make me giddy.' And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What have you been doing here?'
'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. 'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter.
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a minute.
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself 'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'
'It's no use speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.
'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!'
'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.
'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.'
'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!'
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. 'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.
'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
It doesn't look like one, but it is.'
'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.
'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives.
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'
(If you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.
She pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know.
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.
'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the sea.
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.
Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:
'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.'
'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--' '--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.
'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'
'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:
'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!'
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in a wondering tone.
'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: 'explanations take such a dreadful time.'
Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.
'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next verse.'
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'
'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--
In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to herself, 'because of his great wig.'
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,' he said.
'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of my own.
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.
'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.
'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'
'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread- and-butter--'
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.
'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the King.
'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, 'Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.'
'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
Off with his whiskers!'
And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!'
'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.
'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until all the jurymen are back in their proper places-- all,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.
She soon got it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said to herself; 'I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.
'Unimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, 'important--unimportant-- unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word sounded best.
Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; 'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule Forty-two.
'You are,' said the King. 'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the outside.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked.
'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)
(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
'Then the words don't fit you,' said the King, looking round the court with a smile.
'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a "new fellow," not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if just surprised at his work.
The head-master made a sign to us to sit down.
His hair was cut square on his forehead like a village chorister's; he looked reliable, but very ill at ease.
Although he was not broad-shouldered, his short school jacket of green cloth with black buttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at the opening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare.
His legs, in blue stockings, looked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by braces, He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.
The new boy articulated in a stammering voice an unintelligible name.
The "new fellow" then took a supreme resolution, opened an inordinately large mouth, and shouted at the top of his voice as if calling someone in the word "Charbovari."
Charbovari"), then died away into single notes, growing quieter only with great difficulty, and now and again suddenly recommencing along the line of a form whence rose here and there, like a damp cracker going off, a stifled laugh.
"Five hundred lines for all the class!" shouted in a furious voice stopped, like the Quos ego*, a fresh outburst. "Silence!" continued the master indignantly, wiping his brow with his handkerchief, which he had just taken from his cap.
But he wiped his face with one hand and continued motionless, his eyes lowered.
We saw him working conscientiously, looking up every word in the dictionary, and taking the greatest pains.
His father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, retired assistant-surgeon-major, compromised about 1812 in certain conscription scandals, and forced at this time to leave the service, had taken advantage of his fine figure to get hold of a dowry of sixty thousand francs that offered in the person of a hosier's daughter who had fallen in love with his good looks. A fine man, a great talker, making his spurs ring as he walked, wearing whiskers that ran into his moustache, his fingers always garnished with rings and dressed in loud colours, he had the dash of a military man with the easy go of a commercial traveller. Once married, he lived for three or four years on his wife's fortune, dining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes, not coming in at night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes. The father-in-law died, leaving little; he was indignant at this, "went in for the business," lost some money in it, then retired to the country, where he thought he would make money. But, as he knew no more about farming than calico, as he rode his horses instead of sending them to plough, drank his cider in bottle instead of selling it in cask, ate the finest poultry in his farmyard, and greased his hunting-boots with the fat of his pigs, he was not long in finding out that he would do better to give up all speculation.
For two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the provinces of Caux and Picardy, in a kind of place half farm, half private house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets, cursing his luck, jealous of everyone, he shut himself up at the age of forty-five, sick of men, he said, and determined to live at peace.
But, peaceable by nature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions.
In her life's isolation she centered on the child's head all her shattered, broken little vanities.
She taught him to read, and even, on an old piano, she had taught him two or three little songs.
When he was twelve years old his mother had her own way; he began lessons.
Six months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to school at Rouen, where his father took him towards the end of October, at the time of the St. Romain fair.
But at the end of his third year his parents withdrew him from the school to make him study medicine, convinced that he could even take his degree by himself.
In the evening, after the poor dinner of his landlord, he went back to his room and set to work again in his wet clothes, which smoked as he sat in front of the hot stove.
He grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened look that made it nearly interesting.
Naturally, through indifference, he abandoned all the resolutions he had made.
Then many things hidden within him came out; he learnt couplets by heart and sang them to his boon companions, became enthusiastic about Beranger, learnt how to make punch, and, finally, how to make love.
She excused him, threw the blame of his failure on the injustice of the examiners, encouraged him a little, and took upon herself to set matters straight.
So Charles set to work again and crammed for his examination, ceaselessly learning all the old questions by heart.
They gave a grand dinner.
When Charles returned in the evening, she stretched forth two long thin arms from beneath the sheets, put them round his neck, and having made him sit down on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he was neglecting her, he loved another.
The servant opened the garret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below.
Natasie came downstairs shivering and undid the bars and bolts one after the other.
He pulled out from his wool cap with grey top-knots a letter wrapped up in a rag and presented it gingerly to Charles, who rested on his elbow on the pillow to read it.
Madame in modesty had turned to the wall and showed only her back.
It was a dark night; Madame Bovary junior was afraid of accidents for her husband.
The flat country stretched as far as eye could see, and the tufts of trees round the farms at long intervals seemed like dark violet stains on the cast grey surface, that on the horizon faded into the gloom of the sky.
Charles from time to time opened his eyes, his mind grew weary, and, sleep coming upon him, he soon fell into a doze wherein, his recent sensations blending with memories, he became conscious of a double self, at once student and married man, lying in his bed as but now, and crossing the operation theatre as of old.
The general practitioner, riding along, gathered from his guide's talk that Monsieur Rouault must be one of the well-to-do farmers.
Charles went up the first floor to see the patient.
In order to make some splints a bundle of laths was brought up from the cart-house.
Charles selected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment of windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew some pads.
As she was a long time before she found her work-case, her father grew impatient; she did not answer, but as she sewed she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her mouth to suck them.
Although brown, they seemed black because of the lashes, and her look came at you frankly, with a candid boldness.
This showed something of her full lips, that she had a habit of biting when silent.
Her neck stood out from a white turned-down collar.
She had, like a man, thrust in between two buttons of her bodice a tortoise-shell eyeglass.
She drew herself up, scarlet, and looked at him over her shoulder as she handed him his whip.
As to Charles, he did not stop to ask himself why it was a pleasure to him to go to the Bertaux. Had he done so, he would, no doubt, have attributed his zeal to the importance of the case, or perhaps to the money he hoped to make by it. Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life? On these days he rose early, set off at a gallop, urging on his horse, then got down to wipe his boots in the grass and put on black gloves before entering. He liked going into the courtyard, and noticing the gate turn against his shoulder, the cock crow on the wall, the lads run to meet him. He liked the granary and the stables; he liked old Rouault, who pressed his hand and called him his saviour; he like the small wooden shoes of Mademoiselle Emma on the scoured flags of the kitchen—her high heels made her a little taller; and when she walked in front of him, the wooden soles springing up quickly struck with a sharp sound against the leather of her boots.
But when she heard he had a daughter, she began to make inquiries, and she learnt the Mademoiselle Rouault, brought up at the Ursuline Convent, had received what is called "a good education"; and so knew dancing, geography, drawing, how to embroider and play the piano.
"So it is for this," she said to herself, "that his face beams when he goes to see her, and that he puts on his new waistcoat at the risk of spoiling it with the rain. Ah! that woman!
At first she solaced herself by allusions that Charles did not understand, then by casual observations that he let pass for fear of a storm, finally by open apostrophes to which he knew not what to answer.
For very weariness Charles left off going to the Bertaux.
Charles's mother came to see them from time to time, but after a few days the daughter-in-law seemed to put her own edge on her, and then, like two knives, they scarified him with their reflections and observations. It was wrong of him to eat so much.
The matter had to be gone into. The house at Dieppe was found to be eaten up with mortgages to its foundations; what she had placed with the notary God only knew, and her share in the boat did not exceed one thousand crowns.
"I know what it is," said he, clapping him on the shoulder; "I've been through it. When I lost my dear departed, I went into the fields to be quite alone. I fell at the foot of a tree; I cried; I called on God; I talked nonsense to Him. I wanted to be like the moles that I saw on the branches, their insides swarming with worms, dead, and an end of it. And when I thought that there were others at that very moment with their nice little wives holding them in their embrace, I struck great blows on the earth with my stick. I was pretty well mad with not eating; the very idea of going to a cafe disgusted me—you wouldn't believe it. Well, quite softly, one day following another, a spring on a winter, and an autumn after a summer, this wore away, piece by piece, crumb by crumb; it passed away, it is gone, I should say it has sunk; for something always remains at the bottom as one would say—a weight here, at one's heart. But since it is the lot of all of us, one must not give way altogether, and, because others have died, want to die too. You must pull yourself together, Monsieur Bovary. It will pass away. Come to see us; my daughter thinks of you now and again, d'ye know, and she says you are forgetting her. Spring will soon be here. We'll have some rabbit-shooting in the warrens to amuse you a bit."
He had an aimless hope, and was vaguely happy; he thought himself better looking as he brushed his whiskers before the looking-glass.
Between the window and the hearth Emma was sewing; she wore no fichu; he could see small drops of perspiration on her bare shoulders.
After the fashion of country folks she asked him to have something to drink.
So she went to fetch a bottle of curacao from the cupboard, reached down two small glasses, filled one to the brim, poured scarcely anything into the other, and, after having clinked glasses, carried hers to her mouth.
The air coming in under the door blew a little dust over the flags; he watched it drift along, and heard nothing but the throbbing in his head and the faint clucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the yard.
And, according to what she was saying, her voice was clear, sharp, or, on a sudden all languor, drawn out in modulations that ended almost in murmurs as she spoke to herself, now joyous, opening big naive eyes, then with her eyelids half closed, her look full of boredom, her thoughts wandering.
Old Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter, who was of no use to him in the house.
Far from having made a fortune by it, the good man was losing every year; for if he was good in bargaining, in which he enjoyed the dodges of the trade, on the other hand, agriculture properly so called, and the internal management of the farm, suited him less than most people.
He took his meals in the kitchen alone, opposite the fire, on a little table brought to him all ready laid as on the stage.
When, therefore, he perceived that Charles's cheeks grew red if near his daughter, which meant that he would propose for her one of these days, he chewed the cud of the matter beforehand. He certainly thought him a little meagre, and not quite the son-in-law he would have liked, but he was said to be well brought-up, economical, very learned, and no doubt would not make too many difficulties about the dowry. Now, as old Rouault would soon be forced to sell twenty-two acres of "his property," as he owed a good deal to the mason, to the harness-maker, and as the shaft of the cider-press wanted renewing, "If he asks for her," he said to himself, "I'll give her to him."
They stopped.
"I ask nothing better", the farmer went on. "Although, no doubt, the little one is of my mind, still we must ask her opinion.
Part of it was ordered at Rouen, and she made herself chemises and nightcaps after fashion-plates that she borrowed.
The guests arrived early in carriages, in one-horse chaises, two-wheeled cars, old open gigs, waggonettes with leather hoods, and the young people from the nearer villages in carts, in which they stood up in rows, holding on to the sides so as not to fall, going at a trot and well shaken up.
They got down from all sides, rubbing knees and stretching arms.
The lads, dressed like their papas, seemed uncomfortable in their new clothes (many that day hand-sewed their first pair of boots), and by their sides, speaking never a work, wearing the white dress of their first communion lengthened for the occasion were some big girls of fourteen or sixteen, cousins or elder sisters no doubt, rubicund, bewildered, their hair greasy with rose pomade, and very much afraid of dirtying their gloves.
As there were not enough stable-boys to unharness all the carriages, the gentlemen turned up their sleeves and set about it themselves.
And the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses!
Then came the married pair, the relations, the friends, all following pell-mell; the children stayed behind amusing themselves plucking the bell-flowers from oat-ears, or playing amongst themselves unseen.
Emma's dress, too long, trailed a little on the ground; from time to time she stopped to pull it up, and then delicately, with her gloved hands, she picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns, while Charles, empty handed, waited till she had finished.
The other wedding guests talked of their business or played tricks behind each other's backs, egging one another on in advance to be jolly.
When he saw that the rest were far behind he stopped to take breath, slowly rosined his bow, so that the strings should sound more shrilly, then set off again, by turns lowering and raising his neck, the better to mark time for himself.
As he had only just set up on the place, he had taken a lot of trouble, and at dessert he himself brought in a set dish that evoked loud cries of wonderment.
When any of them were too tired of sitting, they went out for a stroll in the yard, or for a game with corks in the granary, and then returned to table.
Some towards the finish went to sleep and snored.
At night when they left, the horses, stuffed up to the nostrils with oats, could hardly be got into the shafts; they kicked, reared, the harness broke, their masters laughed or swore; and all night in the light of the moon along country roads there were runaway carts at full gallop plunging into the ditches, jumping over yard after yard of stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning out from the tilt to catch hold of the reins.
Those who stayed at the Bertaux spent the night drinking in the kitchen. The children had fallen asleep under the seats.
Madame Bovary, senior, had not opened her mouth all day. She had been consulted neither as to the dress of her daughter-in-law nor as to the arrangement of the feast; she went to bed early. Her husband, instead of following her, sent to Saint-Victor for some cigars, and smoked till daybreak, drinking kirsch-punch, a mixture unknown to the company. This added greatly to the consideration in which he was held.
Charles, who was not of a facetious turn, did not shine at the wedding.
The next day, on the other hand, he seemed another man. It was he who might rather have been taken for the virgin of the evening before, whilst the bride gave no sign that revealed anything. The shrewdest did not know what to make of it, and they looked at her when she passed near them with an unbounded concentration of mind. But Charles concealed nothing. He called her "my wife", tutoyed* her, asked for her of everyone, looked for her everywhere, and often he dragged her into the yards, where he could be seen from far between the trees, putting his arm around her waist, and walking half-bending over her, ruffling the chemisette of her bodice with his head.
Two days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on account of his patients, could not be away longer.
The old servant presented herself, curtsied to her, apologised for not having dinner ready, and suggested that madame, in the meantime, should look over her house.
Charles noticed it; he took it and carried it up to the attic, while Emma seated in an arm-chair (they were putting her things down around her) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if she were to die.
Seen thus closely, her eyes looked to him enlarged, especially when, on waking up, she opened and shut them rapidly many times.
Black in the shade, dark blue in broad daylight, they had, as it were, depths of different colours, that, darker in the centre, grew paler towards the surface of the eye.
He rose. She came to the window to see him off, and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of geranium, clad in her dressing gown hanging loosely about her.
Charles, in the street buckled his spurs, his foot on the mounting stone, while she talked to him from above, picking with her mouth some scrap of flower or leaf that she blew out at him.
Charles from horseback threw her a kiss; she answered with a nod; she shut the window, and he set off.
He could not keep from constantly touching her comb, her ring, her fichu; sometimes he gave her great sounding kisses with all his mouth on her cheeks, or else little kisses in a row all along her bare arm from the tip of her fingers up to her shoulder, and she put him away half-smiling, half-vexed, as you do a child who hangs about you.
They stopped at an inn in the St. Gervais quarter, where, at their supper, they used painted plates that set forth the story of Mademoiselle de la Valliere.
She wanted to get some personal profit out of things, and she rejected as useless all that did not contribute to the immediate desires of her heart, being of a temperament more sentimental than artistic, looking for emotions, not landscapes.
In the music class, in the ballads she sang, there was nothing but little angels with golden wings, madonnas, lagunes, gondoliers;-mild compositions that allowed her to catch a glimpse athwart the obscurity of style and the weakness of the music of the attractive phantasmagoria of sentimental realities. Some of her companions brought "keepsakes" given them as new year's gifts to the convent. These had to be hidden; it was quite an undertaking; they were read in the dormitory. Delicately handling the beautiful satin bindings, Emma looked with dazzled eyes at the names of the unknown authors, who had signed their verses for the most part as counts or viscounts.
This nature, positive in the midst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the church for the sake of the flowers, and music for the words of the songs, and literature for its passional stimulus, rebelled against the mysteries of faith as it grew irritated by discipline, a thing antipathetic to her constitution. When her father took her from school, no one was sorry to see her go.
When Charles came to the Bertaux for the first time, she thought herself quite disillusioned, with nothing more to learn, and nothing more to feel.
But the uneasiness of her new position, or perhaps the disturbance caused by the presence of this man, had sufficed to make her believe that she at last felt that wondrous passion which, till then, like a great bird with rose-coloured wings, hung in the splendour of the skies of poesy; and now she could not think that the calm in which she lived was the happiness she had dreamed.
Emma, on the other hand, knew how to look after her house. She sent the patients' accounts in well-phrased letters that had no suggestion of a bill. When they had a neighbour to dinner on Sundays, she managed to have some tasty dish—piled up pyramids of greengages on vine leaves, served up preserves turned out into plates—and even spoke of buying finger-glasses for dessert. From all this much consideration was extended to Bovary.
He told her, one after the other, the people he had met, the villages where he had been, the prescriptions he had written, and, well pleased with himself, he finished the remainder of the boiled beef and onions, picked pieces off the cheese, munched an apple, emptied his water-bottle, and then went to bed, and lay on his back and snored.
Emma put up with these lessons.
By moonlight in the garden she recited all the passionate rhymes she knew by heart, and, sighing, sang to him many melancholy adagios; but she found herself as calm after as before, and Charles seemed no more amorous and no more moved.
She went as far as the beeches of Banneville, near the deserted pavilion which forms an angle of the wall on the side of the country. Amidst the vegetation of the ditch there are long reeds with leaves that cut you.
She found again in the same places the foxgloves and wallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round the big stones, and the patches of lichen along the three windows, whose shutters, always closed, were rotting away on their rusty iron bars.
Her thoughts, aimless at first, wandered at random, like her greyhound, who ran round and round in the fields, yelping after the yellow butterflies, chasing the shrew-mice, or nibbling the poppies on the edge of a cornfield.
She asked herself if by some other chance combination it would have not been possible to meet another man; and she tried to imagine what would have been these unrealised events, this different life, this unknown husband.
In town, with the noise of the streets, the buzz of the theatres and the lights of the ballroom, they were living lives where the heart expands, the senses bourgeon out.
Secretary of State under the Restoration, the Marquis, anxious to re-enter political life, set about preparing for his candidature to the Chamber of Deputies long beforehand.
In the winter he distributed a great deal of wood, and in the Conseil General always enthusiastically demanded new roads for his arrondissement.
The chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two projecting wings and three flights of steps, lay at the foot of an immense green-sward, on which some cows were grazing among groups of large trees set out at regular intervals, while large beds of arbutus, rhododendron, syringas, and guelder roses bulged out their irregular clusters of green along the curve of the gravel path. A river flowed under a bridge; through the mist one could distinguish buildings with thatched roofs scattered over the field bordered by two gently sloping, well timbered hillocks, and in the background amid the trees rose in two parallel lines the coach houses and stables, all that was left of the ruined old chateau.
And on another: "Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy d'Andervilliers de la Vaubyessard, Admiral of France and Chevalier of the Order of St. Michael, wounded at the battle of the Hougue-Saint-Vaast on the 29th of May, 1692; died at Vaubyessard on the 23rd of January 1693." One could hardly make out those that followed, for the light of the lamps lowered over the green cloth threw a dim shadow round the room.
The Marquis opened the drawing room door; one of the ladies (the Marchioness herself) came to meet Emma.
A fair young woman sat in a high-backed chair in a corner; and gentlemen with flowers in their buttonholes were talking to ladies round the fire.
Emma, on entering, felt herself wrapped round by the warm air, a blending of the perfume of flowers and of the fine linen, of the fumes of the viands, and the odour of the truffles. The silver dish covers reflected the lighted wax candles in the candelabra, the cut crystal covered with light steam reflected from one to the other pale rays; bouquets were placed in a row the whole length of the table; and in the large-bordered plates each napkin, arranged after the fashion of a bishop's mitre, held between its two gaping folds a small oval shaped roll. The red claws of lobsters hung over the dishes; rich fruit in open baskets was piled up on moss; there were quails in their plumage; smoke was rising; and in silk stockings, knee-breeches, white cravat, and frilled shirt, the steward, grave as a judge, offering ready carved dishes between the shoulders of the guests, with a touch of the spoon gave you the piece chosen. On the large stove of porcelain inlaid with copper baguettes the statue of a woman, draped to the chin, gazed motionless on the room full of life.
A servant behind his chair named aloud to him in his ear the dishes that he pointed to stammering, and constantly Emma's eyes turned involuntarily to this old man with hanging lips, as to something extraordinary. He had lived at court and slept in the bed of queens!
The powdered sugar even seemed to her whiter and finer than elsewhere.
The ladies afterwards went to their rooms to prepare for the ball.
Charles was silent. He walked up and down waiting for Emma to finish dressing.
Along the line of seated women painted fans were fluttering, bouquets half hid smiling faces, and gold stoppered scent-bottles were turned in partly-closed hands, whose white gloves outlined the nails and tightened on the flesh at the wrists.
A few men (some fifteen or so), of twenty-five to forty, scattered here and there among the dancers or talking at the doorways, distinguished themselves from the crowd by a certain air of breeding, whatever their differences in age, dress, or face.
But in the refulgence of the present hour her past life, so distinct until then, faded away completely, and she almost doubted having lived it. She was there; beyond the ball was only shadow overspreading all the rest.
The seats began to empty, some card-players were still left; the musicians were cooling the tips of their fingers on their tongues.
Charles was half asleep, his back propped against a door.
And then, still turning, but more slowly, he guided her back to her seat.
His "knees were going up into his body." He had spent five consecutive hours standing bolt upright at the card tables, watching them play whist, without understanding anything about it, and it was with a deep sigh of relief that he pulled off his boots.
Emma threw a shawl over her shoulders, opened the window, and leant out.
Emma watched the turning wheels in silence.
The loose reins hanging over his crupper were wet with foam, and the box fastened on behind the chaise gave great regular bumps against it.
"There are even two cigars in it," said he; "they'll do for this evening after dinner."
"Leave the room!" said Emma. "You are forgetting yourself.
Charles, seated opposite Emma, rubbed his hands gleefully.
Charles began to smoke.
He smoked with lips protruding, spitting every moment, recoiling at every puff.
He put down his cigar and ran to swallow a glass of cold water at the pump.
She walked about her little garden, up and down the same walks, stopping before the beds, before the espalier, before the plaster curate, looking with amazement at all these things of once-on-a-time that she knew so well.
Whenever the Wednesday came round she said to herself as she awoke, "Ah! I was there a week—a fortnight—three weeks ago."
She looked at it, opened it, and even smelt the odour of the lining—a mixture of verbena and tobacco.
At night, when the carriers passed under her windows in their carts singing the "Marjolaine," she awoke, and listened to the noise of the iron-bound wheels, which, as they gained the country road, was soon deadened by the soil. "They will be there to-morrow!" she said to herself.
At last she would close the lids of her weary eyes, and see in the darkness the gas jets flaring in the wind and the steps of carriages lowered with much noise before the peristyles of theatres.
Emma perceived only two or three that hid from her all the rest, and in themselves represented all humanity.
The world of ambassadors moved over polished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors, round oval tables covered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths.
Then came the society of the duchesses; all were pale; all got up at four o'clock; the women, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and the men, unappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward seeming, rode horses to death at pleasure parties, spent the summer season at Baden, and towards the forties married heiresses.
All her immediate surroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class imbeciles, the mediocrity of existence, seemed to her exceptional, a peculiar chance that had caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as far as eye could see, an immense land of joys and passions.
His work done, he did not come back again all day, for Charles on his return put up his horse himself, unsaddled him and put on the halter, while the servant-girl brought a bundle of straw and threw it as best she could into the manger.
To replace Nastasie (who left Tostes shedding torrents of tears) Emma took into her service a young girl of fourteen, an orphan with a sweet face. She forbade her wearing cotton caps, taught her to address her in the third person, to bring a glass of water on a plate, to knock before coming into a room, to iron, starch, and to dress her—wanted to make a lady's-maid of her. The new servant obeyed without a murmur, so as not to be sent away; and as madame usually left the key in the sideboard, Felicite every evening took a small supply of sugar that she ate alone in her bed after she had said her prayers.
Charles in snow and rain trotted across country.
He ate omelettes on farmhouse tables, poked his arm into damp beds, received the tepid spurt of blood-lettings in his face, listened to death-rattles, examined basins, turned over a good deal of dirty linen; but every evening he found a blazing fire, his dinner ready, easy-chairs, and a well-dressed woman, charming with an odour of freshness, though no one could say whence the perfume came, or if it were not her skin that made odorous her chemise.
The less Charles understood these refinements the more they seduced him.
He was well, looked well; his reputation was firmly established.
He petted the children, never went to the public house, and, moreover, his morals inspired confidence.
He read it a little after dinner, but in about five minutes the warmth of the room added to the effect of his dinner sent him to sleep; and he sat there, his chin on his two hands and his hair spreading like a mane to the foot of the lamp.
Emma looked at him and shrugged her shoulders.
But she was angered with shame; she felt a wild desire to strike him; she went to open the window in the passage and breathed in the fresh air to calm herself.
"What a man! What a man!" she said in a low voice, biting her lips.
Besides, she was becoming more irritated with him.
As he grew older his manner grew heavier; at dessert he cut the corks of the empty bottles; after eating he cleaned his teeth with his tongue; in taking soup he made a gurgling noise with every spoonful; and, as he was getting fatter, the puffed-out cheeks seemed to push the eyes, always small, up to the temples.
Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his waistcoat, rearranged his cravat, and threw away the dirty gloves he was going to put on; and this was not, as he fancied, for himself; it was for herself, by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation.
Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the horizon.
Spring came round. With the first warm weather, when the pear trees began to blossom, she suffered from dyspnoea.
Who would hear her?
And she sat there making the tongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling.
She listened with dull attention to each stroke of the cracked bell.
The wind on the highroad blew up clouds of dust.
Then she went up again, shut her door, put on coals, and fainting with the heat of the hearth, felt her boredom weigh more heavily than ever.
Every day at the same time the schoolmaster in a black skullcap opened the shutters of his house, and the rural policeman, wearing his sabre over his blouse, passed by.
He, too, the hairdresser, lamented his wasted calling, his hopeless future, and dreaming of some shop in a big town—at Rouen, for example, overlooking the harbour, near the theatre—he walked up and down all day from the mairie to the church, sombre and waiting for customers.
When Madame Bovary looked up, she always saw him there, like a sentinel on duty, with his skullcap over his ears and his vest of lasting.
She watched him going.
But it was above all the meal-times that were unbearable to her, in this small room on the ground floor, with its smoking stove, its creaking door, the walls that sweated, the damp flags; all the bitterness in life seemed served up on her plate, and with smoke of the boiled beef there rose from her secret soul whiffs of sickliness.
Often she persisted in not going out, then, stifling, threw open the windows and put on light dresses.
After she had well scolded her servant she gave her presents or sent her out to see neighbours, just as she sometimes threw beggars all the silver in her purse, although she was by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible to the feelings of others, like most country-bred people, who always retain in their souls something of the horny hardness of the paternal hands.
He smoked in the room, spat on the firedogs, talked farming, calves, cows, poultry, and municipal council, so that when he left she closed the door on him with a feeling of satisfaction that surprised even herself.
As she was constantly complaining about Tostes, Charles fancied that her illness was no doubt due to some local cause, and fixing on this idea, began to think seriously of setting up elsewhere.
After looking about him on this side and on that, Charles learnt that in the Neufchatel arrondissement there was a considerable market town called Yonville-l'Abbaye, whose doctor, a Polish refugee, had decamped a week before.
Then it was, like a red bush in the cinders, slowly devoured.
The little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold lace melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, fluttering like black butterflies at the back of the stove, at least flew up the chimney.
When they left Tostes at the month of March, Madame Bovary was pregnant.
Before us, on the verge of the horizon, lie the oaks of the forest of Argueil, with the steeps of the Saint-Jean hills scarred from top to bottom with red irregular lines; they are rain tracks, and these brick-tones standing out in narrow streaks against the grey colour of the mountain are due to the quantity of iron springs that flow beyond in the neighboring country.
Instead of improving the soil, they persist in keeping up the pasture lands, however depreciated they may be in value, and the lazy borough, growing away from the plain, has naturally spread riverwards.
The thatched roofs, like fur caps drawn over eyes, reach down over about a third of the low windows, whose coarse convex glasses have knots in the middle like the bottoms of bottles.
At the time of the cholera, in order to enlarge this, a piece of wall was pulled down, and three acres of land by its side purchased; but all the new portion is almost tenantless; the tombs, as heretofore, continue to crowd together towards the gate.
"You live on the dead, Lestiboudois!" the curie at last said to him one day. This grim remark made him reflect; it checked him for some time; but to this day he carries on the cultivation of his little tubers, and even maintains stoutly that they grow naturally.
"That wouldn't be much of a loss," replied Monsieur Homais. "You would buy another."
He wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his thin body, and his leather cap, with its lappets knotted over the top of his head with string, showed under the turned-up peak a bald forehead, flattened by the constant wearing of a helmet.
He went to the small parlour, but the three millers had to be got out first, and during the whole time necessary for laying the cloth, Binet remained silent in his place near the stove.
"Yet they say he has parts," objected the landlady.
"Besides, he could double up four men like you over his knee.
It was he who did the errands of the place in town.
They had whistled for him a quarter of an hour; Hivert had even gone back a mile and a half expecting every moment to catch sight of her; but it had been necessary to go on.
Homais introduced himself; he offered his homages to madame and his respects to monsieur; said he was charmed to have been able to render them some slight service, and added with a cordial air that he had ventured to invite himself, his wife being away.
"Oh, I adore the sea!" said Monsieur Leon.
"And then, does it not seem to you," continued Madame Bovary, "that the mind travels more freely on this limitless expanse, the contemplation of which elevates the soul, gives ideas of the infinite, the ideal?"
"Ah! don't you listen to him, Madame Bovary," interrupted Homais, bending over his plate.
Its greatest convenience for a doctor is a door giving on the Walk, where one can go in and out unseen.
"My wife doesn't care about it," said Charles; "although she has been advised to take exercise, she prefers always sitting in her room reading."
"What, indeed?" she said, fixing her large black eyes wide open upon him.
"Has it ever happened to you," Leon went on, "to come across some vague idea of one's own in a book, some dim image that comes back to you from afar, and as the completest expression of your own slightest sentiment?"
"Still in the long run it is tiring," continued Emma. "Now I, on the contrary, adore stories that rush breathlessly along, that frighten one.
When coffee was served Felicite went away to get ready the room in the new house, and the guests soon raised the siege.
The need of looking after others was not the only thing that urged the chemist to such obsequious cordiality; there was a plan underneath it all.
Little by little the memory of this reprimand grew fainter, and he continued, as heretofore, to give anodyne consultations in his back-parlour.
He remained seated for hours without speaking, went into his consulting room to sleep, or watched his wife sewing.
Madame Homais, as well as Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d'Or, almost immediately came running in to embrace her.
The chemist, as man of discretion, only offered a few provincial felicitations through the half-opened door.
They ran over the calendar from end to end, and then consulted outsiders.
At last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she had heard the Marchioness call a young lady Berthe; from that moment this name was chosen; and as old Rouault could not come, Monsieur Homais was requested to stand godfather.
At this moment Monsieur Leon came out from a neighbouring door with a bundle of papers under his arm.
He came to greet her, and stood in the shade in front of the Lheureux's shop under the projecting grey awning.
Through openings in the hedges one could see into the huts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or tethered cows rubbing their horns against the trunk of trees.
They recognized the house by an old walnut-tree which shaded it.
The room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had at its farther end, against the wall, a large bed without curtains, while a kneading-trough took up the side by the window, one pane of which was mended with a piece of blue paper.
She took it up in the wrapping that enveloped it and began singing softly as she rocked herself to and fro.
Leon walked up and down the room; it seemed strange to him to see this beautiful woman in her nankeen dress in the midst of all this poverty. Madam Bovary reddened; he turned away, thinking perhaps there had been an impertinent look in his eyes. Then she put back the little girl, who had just been sick over her collar.
"Well," the nurse went on, heaving sighs between each word, "I'm afraid he'll be put out seeing me have coffee alone, you know men—"
"Well," the latter continued, making a curtsey, "if it weren't asking too much," and she curtsied once more, "if you would"—and her eyes begged—"a jar of brandy," she said at last, "and I'd rub your little one's feet with it; they're as tender as one's tongue."
They returned to Yonville by the water-side.
When they arrived in front of her garden, Madame Bovary opened the little gate, ran up the steps and disappeared.
He thought he was to be pitied for living in this village, with Homais for a friend and Monsieru Guillaumin for master. The latter, entirely absorbed by his business, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles and red whiskers over a white cravat, understood nothing of mental refinements, although he affected a stiff English manner, which in the beginning had impressed the clerk.
But from the general background of all these human faces Emma's stood out isolated and yet farthest off; for between her and him he seemed to see a vague abyss.
When the first cold days set in Emma left her bedroom for the sitting-room, a long apartment with a low ceiling, in which there was on the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against the looking-glass.
Twice a day Leon went from his office to the Lion d'Or.
Emma could hear him coming from afar; she leant forward listening, and the young man glided past the curtain, always dressed in the same way, and without turning his head.
Skull-cap in hand, he came in on tiptoe, in order to disturb no one, always repeating the same phrase, "Good evening, everybody." Then, when he had taken his seat at the table between the pair, he asked the doctor about his patients, and the latter consulted his as to the probability of their payment.
The clerk never failed to be there.
As soon as he heard the bell he ran to meet Madame Bovary, took her shawl, and put away under the shop-counter the thick list shoes that she wore over her boots when there was snow.
Then her dress fell on both sides of her chair, puffing out full of folds, and reached the ground.
When Leon occasionally felt the sole of his boot resting on it, he drew back as if he had trodden upon some one.
When the game of cards was over, the druggist and the Doctor played dominoes, and Emma, changing her place, leant her elbow on the table, turning over the leaves of "L'Illustration".
Leon sat down near her; they looked at the engravings together, and waited for one another at the bottom of the pages.
She often begged him to read her the verses; Leon declaimed them in a languid voice, to which he carefully gave a dying fall in the love passages.
Leon stopped, pointing with a gesture to his sleeping audience; then they talked in low tones, and their conversation seemed the more sweet to them because it was unheard.
They decided that she must be his lover.
"What does it matter to me since I'm not in her set?"
He tortured himself to find out how he could make his declaration to her, and always halting between the fear of displeasing her and the shame of being such a coward, he wept with discouragement and desire.
Often he set out with the determination to dare all; but this resolution soon deserted him in Emma's presence, and when Charles, dropping in, invited him to jump into his chaise to go with him to see some patient in the neighbourhood, he at once accepted, bowed to madame, and went out.
A great piece of waste ground, on which pell-mell, amid a mass of sand and stones, were a few break-wheels, already rusty, surrounded by a quadrangular building pierced by a number of little windows.
She turned.
The cold that made him pale seemed to add a more gentle languor to his face; between his cravat and his neck the somewhat loose collar of his shirt showed the skin; the lobe of his ear looked out from beneath a lock of hair, and his large blue eyes, raised to the clouds, seemed to Emma more limpid and more beautiful than those mountain-lakes where the heavens are mirrored.
"Wretched boy!" suddenly cried the chemist. And he ran to his son, who had just precipitated himself into a heap of lime in order to whiten his boots.
But a knife was wanted; Charles offered his.
In the evening Madame Bovary did not go to her neighbour's, and when Charles had left and she felt herself alone, the comparison re-began with the clearness of a sensation almost actual, and with that lengthening of perspective which memory gives to things. Looking from her bed at the clean fire that was burning, she still saw, as she had down there, Leon standing up with one hand behind his cane, and with the other holding Athalie, who was quietly sucking a piece of ice. She thought him charming; she could not tear herself away from him; she recalled his other attitudes on other days, the words he had spoken, the sound of his voice, his whole person; and she repeated, pouting out her lips as if for a kiss—
The flame of the fire threw a joyous light upon the ceiling; she turned on her back, stretching out her arms.
Then began the eternal lamentation: "Oh, if Heaven had out willed it!
When Charles came home at midnight, she seemed to have just awakened, and as he made a noise undressing, she complained of a headache, then asked carelessly what had happened that evening.
What was certain was that he made complex calculations in his head that would have frightened Binet himself.
After leaving at the door his hat surrounded with crape, he put down a green bandbox on the table, and began by complaining to madame, with many civilities, that he should have remained till that day without gaining her confidence.
She reflected for a few moments, and ended by again declining Monsieur Lheureux's offer. He replied quite unconcernedly—
"I wanted to tell you," he went on good-naturedly, after his joke, "that it isn't the money I should trouble about.
But this tenderness on his behalf astonished him unpleasantly; nevertheless he took up on his praises, which he said everyone was singing, especially the chemist.
His waistcoat now never wanted lining, nor his shirt buttons, and it was quite a pleasure to see in the cupboard the night-caps arranged in piles of the same height.
And thus she seemed so virtuous and inaccessible to him that he lost all hope, even the faintest.
The chemist's wife seemed happy to her to sleep under the same roof, and her thoughts constantly centered upon this house, like the "Lion d'Or" pigeons, who came there to dip their red feet and white wings in its gutters.
She was left broken, breathless, inert, sobbing in a low voice, with flowing tears.
She was so sad, so sad, to see her standing upright on the threshold of her house, she seemed to you like a winding-sheet spread out before the door.
Then, picking up a catechism all in rags that he had struck with is foot, "They respect nothing!" But as soon as he caught sight of Madame Bovary, "Excuse me," he said; "I did not recognise you."
Grease and tobacco stains followed along his broad chest the lines of the buttons, and grew more numerous the farther they were from his neckcloth, in which the massive folds of his red chin rested; this was dotted with yellow spots, that disappeared beneath the coarse hair of his greyish beard.
Yet he could learn quickly if he would, for he is very sharp. And so sometimes for a joke I call him Riboudet (like the road one takes to go to Maromme) and I even say 'Mon Riboudet.'
She fixed her pleading eyes upon the priest.
But the priest suddenly distributed a shower of cuffs among them. Seizing them by the collars of their coats, he lifted them from the ground, and deposited them on their knees on the stones of the choir, firmly, as if he meant planting them there.
The whitish light of the window-panes fell with soft undulations.
"Leave me alone," said the latter, putting her from her with her hand.
The little girl soon came up closer against her knees, and leaning on them with her arms, she looked up with her large blue eyes, while a small thread of pure saliva dribbled from her lips on to the silk apron.
"Will you leave me alone?" she said, pushing her with her elbow.
Berthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle, cutting her cheek, which began to bleed, against it.
It was the dinner-hour; he had come home.
Then watching her sleep, the little anxiety she felt gradually wore off, and she seemed very stupid to herself, and very good to have been so worried just now at so little.
"I should like to speak to you," he had whispered in the clerk's ear, who went upstairs in front of him.
All the same, his companion seemed very strange to him, for Leon often threw himself back in his chair, and stretching out his arms. Complained vaguely of life.
Leon was weary of loving without any result; moreover he was beginning to feel that depression caused by the repetition of the same kind of life, when no interest inspires and no hope sustains it. He was so bored with Yonville and its inhabitants, that the sight of certain persons, of certain houses, irritated him beyond endurance; and the chemist, good fellow though he was, was becoming absolutely unbearable to him. Yet the prospect of a new condition of life frightened as much as it seduced him.
This apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris from afar sounded its fanfare of masked balls with the laugh of grisettes.
What prevented him? And he began making home-preparations; he arranged his occupations beforehand.
He did not hurry. Every day for a month Hivert carried boxes, valises, parcels for him from Yonville to Rouen and from Rouen to Yonville; and when Leon had packed up his wardrobe, had his three arm-chairs restuffed, bought a stock of neckties, in a word, had made more preparations than for a voyage around the world, he put it off from week to week, until he received a second letter from his mother urging him to leave, since he wanted to pass his examination before the vacation.
As he came in, Madame Bovary arose hurriedly.
She bit her lips, and a rush of blood flowing under her skin made her red from the roots of her hair to the top of her collar.
They looked at one another and their thoughts, confounded in the same agony, clung close together like two throbbing breasts.
"Good-bye, poor child! good-bye, dear little one! good-bye!" And he gave her back to her mother.
She turned around, her chin lowered, her forehead bent forward.
They advanced towards each other; he held out his hand; she hesitated.
He thought he saw a shadow behind the window in the room; but the curtain, sliding along the pole as though no one were touching it, slowly opened its long oblique folds that spread out with a single movement, and thus hung straight and motionless as a plaster wall.
They gathered around the sunset on the side of Rouen and then swiftly rolled back their black columns, behind which the great rays of the sun looked out like the golden arrows of a suspended trophy, while the rest of the empty heavens was white as porcelain.
Then the sun reappeared, the hens clucked, sparrows shook their wings in the damp thickets, and the pools of water on the gravel as they flowed away carried off the pink flowers of an acacia.
He approaches you, he insinuates himself; offers you a pinch of snuff, or picks up your hat.
Then you become more intimate; he takes you to a cafe, invites you to his country-house, introduces you, between two drinks, to all sorts of people; and three-fourths of the time it's only to plunder your watch or lead you into some pernicious step.
"Because of the change of regimen," continued the chemist, "and of the perturbation that results therefrom in the whole system.
I can't go out for a minute!
I can see, thank you; Justin has the lantern."
Henceforth the memory of Leon was the centre of her boredom; it burnt there more brightly than the fire travellers have left on the snow of a Russian steppe. She sprang towards him, she pressed against him, she stirred carefully the dying embers, sought all around her anything that could revive it; and the most distant reminiscences, like the most immediate occasions, what she experienced as well as what she imagined, her voluptuous desires that were unsatisfied, her projects of happiness that crackled in the wind like dead boughs, her sterile virtue, her lost hopes, the domestic tete-a-tete—she gathered it all up, took everything, and made it all serve as fuel for her melancholy.
She thought herself now far more unhappy; for she had the experience of grief, with the certainty that it would not end.
A woman who had laid on herself such sacrifices could well allow herself certain whims. She bought a Gothic prie-dieu, and in a month spent fourteen francs on lemons for polishing her nails; she wrote to Rouen for a blue cashmere gown; she chose one of Lheureux's finest scarves, and wore it knotted around her waist over her dressing-gown; and, with closed blinds and a book in her hand, she lay stretched out on a couch in this garb.
She maintained one day, in opposition to her husband, that she could drink off a large glass of brandy, and, as Charles was stupid enough to dare her to, she swallowed the brandy to the last drop.
In spite of her vapourish airs (as the housewives of Yonville called them), Emma, all the same, never seemed gay, and usually she had at the corners of her mouth that immobile contraction that puckers the faces of old maids, and those of men whose ambition has failed.
Charles fled to his study and wept there, both his elbows on the table, sitting in an arm-chair at his bureau under the phrenological head.
Then he wrote to his mother begging her to come, and they had many long consultations together on the subject of Emma.
He had on yellow gloves, although he wore heavy gaiters; he was coming towards the doctor's house, followed by a peasant walking with a bent head and quite a thoughtful air.
And with an air of bravado he held out his great arm.
At the prick of the lancet the blood spurted out, splashing against the looking-glass.
"Sometimes," answered the doctor, "one feels nothing at first, and then syncope sets in, and more especially with people of strong constitution like this man."
"Some vinegar," he cried.
The ploughman revived, but Justin's syncope still lasted, and his eyeballs disappeared in the pale sclerotics like blue flowers in milk.
With the movement she made in bending down, her dress (it was a summer dress with four flounces, yellow, long in the waist and wide in the skirt) spread out around her on the flags of the room; and as Emma stooping, staggered a little as she stretched out her arms.
Then she went to fetch a bottle of water, and she was melting some pieces of sugar when the chemist arrived.
Then he put three francs on the corner of the table, bowed negligently, and went out.
He was soon on the other side of the river (this was his way back to La Huchette), and Emma saw him in the meadow, walking under the poplars, slackening his pace now and then as one who reflects.
She is tired of him, no doubt.
Yes; but how to get rid of her afterwards?"
I'll send them venison, poultry; I'll have myself bled, if need be.
One saw the red epaulettes and the black breastplates pass and re-pass alternately; there was no end to it, and it constantly began again.
Several citizens had scoured their houses the evening before; tri-coloured flags hung from half-open windows; all the public-houses were full; and in the lovely weather the starched caps, the golden crosses, and the coloured neckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and relieved with the motley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats and blue smocks.
The neighbouring farmers' wives, when they got off their horses, pulled out the long pins that fastened around them their dresses, turned up for fear of mud; and the husbands, for their part, in order to save their hats, kept their handkerchiefs around them, holding one corner between their teeth.
Standing on her kitchen-steps she muttered to herself,
"It seems odd to you, doesn't it, I who am always more cooped up in my laboratory than the man's rat in his cheese."
Mere Lefrancois looked at him for a few moments, and ended by saying with a smile—
But what does agriculture matter to you?
Homais drew back with stupefaction.
"What a terrible catastrophe!" cried the druggist, who always found expressions in harmony with all imaginable circumstances.
Why, she's taking Monsieur Boulanger's arm."
And he looked at her out of the corner of his eyes.
When they reached the farrier's house, instead of following the road up to the fence, Rodolphe suddenly turned down a path, drawing with him Madame Bovary. He called out—
Between the two lines the committee-men were walking with heavy steps, examining each animal, then consulting one another in a low voice.
As soon as he recognised Rodolphe he came forward quickly, and smiling amiably, said—
"Ah! yes.
And she protested that she was not mocking him, when the report of a cannon resounded. Immediately all began hustling one another pell-mell towards the village.
It was a false alarm. The prefect seemed not to be coming, and the members of the jury felt much embarrassed, not knowing if they ought to begin the meeting or still wait.
A few even forgot their collars; but the equipage of the prefect seemed to anticipate the crowd, and the two yoked jades, trapesing in their harness, came up at a little trot in front of the peristyle of the town hall at the very moment when the National Guard and firemen deployed, beating drums and marking time.
Then was seen stepping down from the carriage a gentleman in a short coat with silver braiding, with bald brow, and wearing a tuft of hair at the back of his head, of a sallow complexion and the most benign appearance.
Monsieur Tuvache answered them with compliments; the other confessed himself nervous; and they remained thus, face to face, their foreheads almost touching, with the members of the jury all round, the municipal council, the notable personages, the National Guard and the crowd.
The ladies of the company stood at the back under the vestibule between the pillars while the common herd was opposite, standing up or sitting on chairs.
As a matter of fact, Lestiboudois had brought thither all those that he had moved from the field, and he even kept running back every minute to fetch others from the church.
He fetched three stools from the round table under the bust of the monarch, and having carried them to one of the windows, they sat down by each other.
There was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much parleying.
"But, gentlemen," continued the councillor, "if, banishing from my memory the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes back to the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see there?
"And this is what you have understood," said the councillor. "You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a work that belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress and morality, you have understood, I say, that political storms are even more redoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!"
They are a lot of old blockheads in flannel vests and of old women with foot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone into our ears 'Duty, duty!'
His lieutenant, the youngest son of Monsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his was enormous, and shook on his head, and from it an end of his cotton scarf peeped out.
He smiled beneath it with a perfectly infantine sweetness, and his pale little face, whence drops were running, wore an expression of enjoyment and sleepiness.
Rodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low voice, speaking rapidly—
His arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face towards Emma, close by her, he looked fixedly at her.
He said—"Continue, persevere; listen neither to the suggestions of routine, nor to the over-hasty councils of a rash empiricism.
Going back to the cradle of society, the orator painted those fierce times when men lived on acorns in the heart of woods.
Monsieur Derozerays set himself this problem.
From magnetism little by little Rodolphe had come to affinities, and while the president was citing Cincinnatus and his plough, Diocletian, planting his cabbages, and the Emperors of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the young man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible attractions find their cause in some previous state of existence.
It was because across the infinite, like two streams that flow but to unite; our special bents of mind had driven us towards each other."
Rodolphe was pressing her hand, and he felt it all warm and quivering like a captive dove that wants to fly away; but, whether she was trying to take it away or whether she was answering his pressure; she made a movement with her fingers.
You do not repulse me!
A gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on the table, and in the square below all the great caps of the peasant women were uplifted by it like the wings of white butterflies fluttering.
They looked at one another.
Then there came forward on the platform a little old woman with timid bearing, who seemed to shrink within her poor clothes.
Her pale face framed in a borderless cap was more wrinkled than a withered russet apple.
"Are you deaf?" said Tuvache, fidgeting in his armchair; and he began shouting in her ear, "Fifty-four years of service. A silver medal!
Then, when she had her medal, she looked at it, and a smile of beatitude spread over her face; and as she walked away they could hear her muttering "I'll give it to our cure up home, to say some masses for me!"
The meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the speeches had been read, each one fell back into his place again, and everything into the old grooves; the masters bullied the servants, and these struck the animals, indolent victors, going back to the stalls, a green-crown on their horns.
The feast was long, noisy, ill served; the guests were so crowded that they could hardly move their elbows; and the narrow planks used for forms almost broke down under their weight.
The pyrotechnic pieces sent to Monsieur Tuvache had, through an excess of caution, been shut up in his cellar, and so the damp powder would not light, and the principal set piece, that was to represent a dragon biting his tail, failed completely. Now and then a meagre Roman-candle went off; then the gaping crowd sent up a shout that mingled with the cry of the women, whose waists were being squeezed in the darkness. Emma silently nestled against Charles's shoulder; then, raising her chin, she watched the luminous rays of the rockets against the dark sky. Rodolphe gazed at her in the light of the burning lanterns.
At this moment the councillor's carriage came out from the inn.
Then touching on the entry of the councillor, he did not forget "the martial air of our militia;" nor "our most merry village maidens;" nor the "bald-headed old men like patriarchs who were there, and of whom some, the remnants of our phalanxes, still felt their hearts beat at the manly sound of the drums." He cited himself among the first of the members of the jury, and he even called attention in a note to the fact that Monsieur Homais, chemist, had sent a memoir on cider to the agricultural society.
Let us state that no untoward event disturbed this family meeting."
He looked at her again, but so hard that she lowered her head, blushing.
"Sir," she said, drawing back a little.
And as she objected that she had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe offered one.
She refused his offer; he did not insist.
When the habit was ready, Charles wrote to Monsieur Boulanger that his wife was at his command, and that they counted on his good-nature.
Rodolphe had put on high soft boots, saying to himself that no doubt she had never seen anything like them. In fact, Emma was charmed with his appearance as he stood on the landing in his great velvet coat and white corduroy breeches.
As soon as he felt the ground, Emma's horse set off at a gallop.
Sometimes through a rift in the clouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of Yonville, with the gardens at the water's edge, the yards, the walls and the church steeple.
Clumps of trees here and there stood out like black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose above the mist were like a beach stirred by the wind.
She turned away from time to time to avoid his look, and then she saw only the pine trunks in lines, whose monotonous succession made her a little giddy. The horses were panting; the leather of the saddles creaked.
Just as they were entering the forest the sun shone out.
At other times, to turn aside the branches, he passed close to her, and Emma felt his knee brushing against her leg.
There were spaces full of heather in flower, and plots of violets alternated with the confused patches of the trees that were grey, fawn, or golden coloured, according to the nature of their leaves.
They dismounted.
Rodolphe fastened up the horses.
He was calm, serious, melancholy.
But at the words, "Are not our destinies now one?"
Then, having gazed at him for a few moments with an amorous and humid look, she said hurriedly—
She gave him her arm.
He said—
She feebly tried to disengage herself.
He supported her thus as they walked along.
But they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves.
She threw back her white neck, swelling with a sigh, and faltering, in tears, with a long shudder and hiding her face, she gave herself up to him—
She was charming on horseback—upright, with her slender waist, her knee bent on the mane of her horse, her face somewhat flushed by the fresh air in the red of the evening.
People looked at her from the windows.
He has an old cob, still very fine, only a little broken-kneed, and that could be bought; I am sure, for a hundred crowns." He added, "And thinking it might please you, I have bespoken it—bought it.
"Are you going out to-night?" she asked.
And as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and shut herself up in her room.
At first she felt stunned; she saw the trees, the paths, the ditches, Rodolphe, and she again felt the pressure of his arm, while the leaves rustled and the reeds whistled.
An azure infinity encompassed her, the heights of sentiment sparkled under her thought, and ordinary existence appeared only afar off, down below in the shade, through the interspaces of these heights.
But now she triumphed, and the love so long pent up burst forth in full joyous bubblings.
Rodolphe interrupted her with kisses; and she looking at him through half-closed eyes, asked him to call her again by her name—to say that he loved her They were in the forest, as yesterday, in the shed of some woodenshoe maker.
Rodolphe came to fetch it, and put another there, that she always found fault with as too short.
Emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes, while the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole around her face.
Then she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the tables, combed her hair with his comb, and looked at herself in his shaving-glass.
When she came back from his house she looked all about her, anxiously watching every form that passed in the horizon, and every village window from which she could be seen.
Emma, half-fainting with terror, nevertheless walked on, and a man stepped out of the tub like a Jack-in-the-box.
"You ought to have called out long ago!" he exclaimed; "When one sees a gun, one should always give warning."
The tax-collector was thus trying to hide the fright he had had, for a prefectorial order having prohibited duckhunting except in boats, Monsieur Binet, despite his respect for the laws, was infringing them, and so he every moment expected to see the rural guard turn up. But this anxiety whetted his pleasure, and, all alone in his tub, he congratulated himself on his luck and on his cuteness. At sight of Emma he seemed relieved from a great weight, and at once entered upon a conversation.
"Good evening, Monsieur Binet," she interrupted him, turning on her heel.
She remained until evening racking her brain with every conceivable lying project, and had constantly before her eyes that imbecile with the game-bag.
Then Emma, relieved, uttered a deep sigh.
The cold of the nights made them clasp closer; the sighs of their lips seemed to them deeper; their eyes that they could hardly see, larger; and in the midst of the silence low words were spoken that fell on their souls sonorous, crystalline, and that reverberated in multiplied vibrations.
She lighted one of the kitchen candles that she had hidden behind the books.
He blew out the light.
Rodolphe reflected a good deal on the affair of the pistols.
She often spoke to him of the evening chimes, of the voices of nature.
He had no longer, as formerly, words so gentle that they made her cry, nor passionate caresses that made her mad, so that their great love, which engrossed her life, seemed to lessen beneath her like the water of a stream absorbed into its channel, and she could see the bed of it.
It was not affection; it was like a continual seduction.
The writing had been dried with ashes from the hearth, for a little grey powder slipped from the letter on to her dress, and she almost thought she saw her father bending over the hearth to take up the tongs.
In fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the midst of the grass that was being turned.
Lestiboudois was raking by her side, and every time he came near she lent forward, beating the air with both her arms.
"Bring her to me," said her mother, rushing to embrace her. "How I love you, my poor child!
Then noticing that the tips of her ears were rather dirty, she rang at once for warm water, and washed her, changed her linen, her stockings, her shoes, asked a thousand questions about her health, as if on the return from a long journey, and finally, kissing her again and crying a little, she gave her back to the servant, who stood quite thunderstricken at this excess of tenderness.
"For," said he to Emma, "what risk is there? See—" (and he enumerated on his fingers the advantages of the attempt), "success, almost certain relief and beautifying of the patient, celebrity acquired by the operator. Why, for example, should not your husband relieve poor Hippolyte of the 'Lion d'Or'? Note that he would not fail to tell about his cure to all the travellers, and then" (Homais lowered his voice and looked round him) "who is to prevent me from sending a short paragraph on the subject to the paper? Eh! goodness me! an article gets about; it is talked of; it ends by making a snowball! And who knows? who knows?"
"However," continued the chemist, "it doesn't concern me.
And Homais retired, declaring that he could not understand this obstinacy, this blindness in refusing the benefactions of science.
He had a foot forming almost a straight line with the leg, which, however, did not prevent it from being turned in, so that it was an equinus together with something of a varus, or else a slight varus with a strong tendency to equinus.
Charles pierced the skin; a dry crackling was heard.
Then Charles, having buckled his patient into the machine, went home, where Emma, all anxiety, awaited him at the door.
"Read it yourself," said Bovary.
The patient, strangely enough—we affirm it as an eye-witness—complained of no pain. His condition up to the present time leaves nothing to be desired.
The outlines of the foot disappeared in such a swelling that the entire skin seemed about to burst, and it was covered with ecchymosis, caused by the famous machine.
The livid tumefaction spread over the leg, with blisters here and there, whence there oozed a black liquid. Matters were taking a serious turn.
He lay there moaning under his heavy coverings, pale with long beard, sunken eyes, and from time to time turning his perspiring head on the dirty pillow, where the flies alighted.
She brought him linen for his poultices; she comforted, and encouraged him.
Hippolyte looked at him with eyes full of terror, sobbing—
And the doctor left, always recommending him to diet himself.
From a spirit of contradiction she hung up near the bedside of the patient a basin filled with holy-water and a branch of box.
Religion, however, seemed no more able to succour him than surgery, and the invincible gangrene still spread from the extremities towards the stomach.
Then having flatly declared that it must be amputated, he went off to the chemist's to rail at the asses who could have reduced a poor man to such a state.
These are the ideas of those gentry of the capital!
We are practitioners; we cure people, and we should not dream of operating on anyone who is in perfect health.
He came in his gig, which he drove himself.
I get up every day at four o'clock; I shave with cold water (and am never cold).
Then, without any consideration for Hippolyte, who was sweating with agony between his sheets, these gentlemen entered into a conversation, in which the druggist compared the coolness of a surgeon to that of a general; and this comparison was pleasing to Canivet, who launched out on the exigencies of his art. He looked upon, it as a sacred office, although the ordinary practitioners dishonoured it. At last, coming back to the patient, he examined the bandages brought by Homais, the same that had appeared for the club-foot, and asked for someone to hold the limb for him. Lestiboudois was sent for, and Monsieur Canivet having turned up his sleeves, passed into the billiard-room, while the druggist stayed with Artemise and the landlady, both whiter than their aprons, and with ears strained towards the door.
Bovary during this time did not dare to stir from his house.
He kept downstairs in the sitting-room by the side of the fireless chimney, his chin on his breast, his hands clasped, his eyes staring.
Charles was walking up and down the room; his boots creaked on the floor.
"But it was perhaps a valgus!" suddenly exclaimed Bovary, who was meditating.
At the unexpected shock of this phrase falling on her thought like a leaden bullet on a silver plate, Emma, shuddering, raised her head in order to find out what he meant to say; and they looked at the other in silence, almost amazed to see each other, so far sundered were they by their inner thoughts. Charles gazed at her with the dull look of a drunken man, while he listened motionless to the last cries of the sufferer, that followed each other in long-drawn modulations, broken by sharp spasms like the far-off howling of some beast being slaughtered. Emma bit her wan lips, and rolling between her fingers a piece of coral that she had broken, fixed on Charles the burning glance of her eyes like two arrows of fire about to dart forth. Everything in him irritated her now; his face, his dress, what he did not say, his whole person, his existence, in fine. She repented of her past virtue as of a crime, and what still remained of it rumbled away beneath the furious blows of her pride. She revelled in all the evil ironies of triumphant adultery. The memory of her lover came back to her with dazzling attractions; she threw her whole soul into it, borne away towards this image with a fresh enthusiasm; and Charles seemed to her as much removed from her life, as absent forever, as impossible and annihilated, as if he had been about to die and were passing under her eyes.
Homais, behind him, was carrying a large red box in his hand, and both were going towards the chemist's.
Charles sank back into his arm-chair overwhelmed, trying to discover what could be wrong with her, fancying some nervous illness, weeping, and vaguely feeling something fatal and incomprehensible whirling round him.
Often, even in the middle of the day, Emma suddenly wrote to him, then from the window made a sign to Justin, who, taking his apron off, quickly ran to La Huchette.
"But what can I do?" he cried one day impatiently.
She returned to the subject; he pretended not to understand, and turned the conversation.
Never had Charles seemed to her so disagreeable, to have such stodgy fingers, such vulgar ways, to be so dull as when they found themselves together after her meeting with Rodolphe.
With his elbows on the long board on which she was ironing, he greedily watched all these women's clothes spread about him, the dimity petticoats, the fichus, the collars, and the drawers with running strings, wide at the hips and growing narrower below.
And he at once took down from the shelf Emma's boots, all coated with mud, the mud of the rendezvous, that crumbled into powder beneath his fingers, and that he watched as it gently rose in a ray of sunlight.
Emma had a number in her cupboard that she squandered one after the other, without Charles allowing himself the slightest observation.
The doctor, of course, had again to defray the expense of this purchase.
And, certain of his discovery, he went out repeating to himself in an undertone, and with his usual low whistle—
She was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming in put on the mantelpiece a small roll of blue paper "from Monsieur Derozeray's."
Emma pounced upon and opened it.
She heard Charles on the stairs; threw the gold to the back of her drawer, and took out the key.
Then, to conceal his disappointment, he was profuse in apologies and proffers of service, all of which Emma declined; then she remained a few moments fingering in the pocket of her apron the two five-franc pieces that he had given her in change. She promised herself she would economise in order to pay back later on.
"Did you think you'd got a virgin?" he exclaimed laughing.
Emma was stamping her feet as she repeated—
And in fact she held out her hand to her mother-in-law with the dignity of a marchioness as she said—
And she began telling him everything, hurriedly, disjointedly, exaggerating the facts, inventing many, and so prodigal of parentheses that he understood nothing of it.
I can bear it no longer!
She clung to Rodolphe. Her eyes, full of tears, flashed like flames beneath a wave; her breast heaved; he had never loved her so much, so that he lost his head and said "What is, it? What do you wish?"
She reflected a few moments, then replied—
It was an eternal subject for conversation with Rodolphe.
He pictured her to himself working in the evening by their side beneath the light of the lamp; she would embroider him slippers; she would look after the house; she would fill all the home with her charm and her gaiety.
Emma was not asleep; she pretended to be; and while he dozed off by her side she awakened to other dreams.
They went at a walking-pace because of the great flag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of flowers, offered you by women dressed in red bodices.
They would row in gondolas, swing in hammocks, and their existence would be easy and large as their silk gowns, warm and star-spangled as the nights they would contemplate.
But the child began to cough in her cot or Bovary snored more loudly, and Emma did not fall asleep till morning, when the dawn whitened the windows, and when little Justin was already in the square taking down the shutters of the chemist's shop.
But the tradesman cried out that she was wrong; they knew one another; did he doubt her? What childishness! She insisted, however, on his taking at least the chain, and Lheureux had already put it in his pocket and was going, when she called him back.
At length the Saturday before arrived.
And yet he looked at her strangely in a tender fashion.
Emma, her eyes half closed, breathed in with deep sighs the fresh wind that was blowing.
He was already on the other side of the river and walking fast across the meadow.
After a few moments Rodolphe stopped; and when he saw her with her white gown gradually fade away in the shade like a ghost, he was seized with such a beating of the heart that he leant against a tree lest he should fall.
He was saying these things to give himself firmness.
Near it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature given him by Emma: her toilette seemed to him pretentious, and her languishing look in the worst possible taste.
Finally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations relating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business notes.
Thus dallying with his souvenirs, he examined the writing and the style of the letters, as varied as their orthography. They were tender or jovial, facetious, melancholy; there were some that asked for love, others that asked for money. A word recalled faces to him, certain gestures, the sound of a voice; sometimes, however, he remembered nothing at all.
In fact, these women, rushing at once into his thoughts, cramped each other and lessened, as reduced to a uniform level of love that equalised them all. So taking handfuls of the mixed-up letters, he amused himself for some moments with letting them fall in cascades from his right into his left hand. At last, bored and weary, Rodolphe took back the box to the cupboard, saying to himself, "What a lot of rubbish!" Which summed up his opinion; for pleasures, like schoolboys in a school courtyard, had so trampled upon his heart that no green thing grew there, and that which passed through it, more heedless than children, did not even, like them, leave a name carved upon the wall.
"Come," said he, "let's begin."
"Perhaps she'll think I'm giving it up from avarice.
Rodolphe got up to, shut the window, and when he had sat down again—
"I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have wished to flee as quickly as possible to shun the temptation of seeing you again.
Then, having emptied some water into a glass, Rodolphe dipped his finger into it, and let a big drop fall on the paper, that made a pale stain on the ink.
The next day when he was up (at about two o'clock—he had slept late), Rodolphe had a basket of apricots picked.
Girard put on his new blouse, knotted his handkerchief round the apricots, and walking with great heavy steps in his thick iron-bound galoshes, made his way to Yonville.
She was seized with apprehension, and as she sought in her pocket for some coppers, she looked at the peasant with haggard eyes, while he himself looked at her with amazement, not understanding how such a present could so move anyone.
Felicite remained.
She could bear it no longer; she ran into the sitting room as if to take the apricots there, overturned the basket, tore away the leaves, found the letter, opened it, and, as if some fearful fire were behind her, Emma flew to her room terrified.
Emma pushed open the door and went in.
She drew back the bolt, and the dazzling light burst in with a leap.
She was free. She advanced, looking at the paving-stones, saying to herself, "Come! come!"
Then she unfolded her napkin as if to examine the darns, and she really thought of applying herself to this work, counting the threads in the linen.
Suddenly the remembrance of the letter returned to her.
"It is nothing," she said, "it is nothing!
Emma uttered a cry and fell back rigid to the ground.
The table with all the plates was upset; sauce, meat, knives, the salt, and cruet-stand were strewn over the room; Charles was calling for help; Berthe, scared, was crying; and Felicite, whose hands trembled, was unlacing her mistress, whose whole body shivered convulsively.
Then as she opened her eyes on smelling the bottle—
The child stretched out her arms to her mother to cling to her neck.
But turning away her head, Emma said in a broken voice "No, no! no one!"
It is to stupefy the senses and to bring on ecstasies—a thing, moreover, very easy in persons of the weaker sex, who are more delicate than the other.
"And not only," the druggist went on, "are human beings subject to such anomalies, but animals also.
They thought she was delirious; and she was by midnight.
For forty-three days Charles did not leave her. He gave up all his patients; he no longer went to bed; he was constantly feeling her pulse, putting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He sent Justin as far as Neufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the way; he sent him back again. He called Monsieur Canivet into consultation; he sent for Dr. Lariviere, his old master, from Rouen; he was in despair. What alarmed him most was Emma's prostration, for she did not speak, did not listen, did not even seem to suffer, as if her body and soul were both resting together after all their troubles.
Her strength returned to her; she got up for a few hours of an afternoon, and one day, when she felt better, he tried to take her, leaning on his arm, for a walk round the garden.
She smiled all the time.
"You will tire yourself, my darling!" said Bovary. And, pushing her gently to make her go into the arbour, "Sit down on this seat; you'll be comfortable."
"Oh! no; not there!" she said in a faltering voice.
Charles several times asked himself by what means he should next year be able to pay back so much money.
All her ideas seemed to be limited to the care of herself.
She had made up her mind to resignation, to universal indulgence.
She said to her child, "Is your stomach-ache better, my angel?"
Besides the companionship of her mother-in-law, who strengthened her a little by the rectitude of her judgment and her grave ways, Emma almost every day had other visitors.
She began by taking out her comb, shaking her head with a quick movement, and when he for the first time saw all this mass of hair that fell to her knees unrolling in black ringlets, it was to him, poor child! like a sudden entrance into something new and strange, whose splendour terrified him.
And without waiting for any answer from Felicite, who was blushing, she added, "There! run along; enjoy yourself!"
Binet was there; that is to say, a little lower down against the terrace wall, fishing for crayfish.
He was, in fact, a good fellow and one day he was not even scandalised at the chemist, who advised Charles to give madame some distraction by taking her to the theatre at Rouen to hear the illustrious tenor, Lagardy. Homais, surprised at this silence, wanted to know his opinion, and the priest declared that he considered music less dangerous for morals than literature.
"'Castigat ridendo mores,'* Monsieur Bournisien! Thus consider the greater part of Voltaire's tragedies; they are cleverly strewn with philosophical reflections, that made them a vast school of morals and diplomacy for the people."
"I," said Binet, "once saw a piece called the 'Gamin de Paris,' in which there was the character of an old general that is really hit off to a T. He sets down a young swell who had seduced a working girl, who at the ending—"
"Why," asked the druggist, "should she excommunicate actors? For formerly they openly took part in religious ceremonies.
The ecclesiastic contented himself with uttering a groan, and the chemist went on—
"Come, come!" said the cure.
"That is true! that is true!" agreed the good fellow, sitting down again on his chair.
All these great artists burn the candle at both ends; they require a dissolute life, that suits the imagination to some extent.
The idea of the theatre quickly germinated in Bovary's head, for he at once communicated it to his wife, who at first refused, alleging the fatigue, the worry, the expense; but, for a wonder, Charles did not give in, so sure was he that this recreation would be good for her. He saw nothing to prevent it: his mother had sent them three hundred francs which he had no longer expected; the current debts were not very large, and the falling in of Lheureux's bills was still so far off that there was no need to think about them. Besides, imagining that she was refusing from delicacy, he insisted the more; so that by dint of worrying her she at last made up her mind, and the next day at eight o'clock they set out in the "Hirondelle."
The druggist, whom nothing whatever kept at Yonville, but who thought himself bound not to budge from it, sighed as he saw them go.
"You are as lovely as a Venus.
The diligence stopped at the "Croix-Rouge" in the Place Beauvoisine. It was the inn that is in every provincial faubourg, with large stables and small bedrooms, where one sees in the middle of the court chickens pilfering the oats under the muddy gigs of the commercial travellers—a good old house, with worm-eaten balconies that creak in the wind on winter nights, always full of people, noise, and feeding, whose black tables are sticky with coffee and brandy, the thick windows made yellow by the flies, the damp napkins stained with cheap wine, and that always smells of the village, like ploughboys dressed in Sundayclothes, has a cafe on the street, and towards the countryside a kitchen-garden. Charles at once set out. He muddled up the stage-boxes with the gallery, the pit with the boxes; asked for explanations, did not understand them; was sent from the box-office to the acting-manager; came back to the inn, returned to the theatre, and thus several times traversed the whole length of the town from the theatre to the boulevard.
The weather was fine, the people were hot, perspiration trickled amid the curls, and handkerchiefs taken from pockets were mopping red foreheads; and now and then a warm wind that blew from the river gently stirred the border of the tick awnings hanging from the doors of the public-houses.
A little lower down, however, one was refreshed by a current of icy air that smelt of tallow, leather, and oil.
For fear of seeming ridiculous, Emma before going in wished to have a little stroll in the harbour, and Bovary prudently kept his tickets in his hand, in the pocket of his trousers, which he pressed against his stomach.
She breathed in with all her might the dusty smell of the lobbies, and when she was seated in her box she bent forward with the air of a duchess.
Now the lights of the orchestra were lit, the lustre, let down from the ceiling, throwing by the glimmering of its facets a sudden gaiety over the theatre; then the musicians came in one after the other; and first there was the protracted hubbub of the basses grumbling, violins squeaking, cornets trumpeting, flutes and flageolets fifing. But three knocks were heard on the stage, a rolling of drums began, the brass instruments played some chords, and the curtain rising, discovered a country-scene.
She seemed to hear through the mist the sound of the Scotch bagpipes re-echoing over the heather.
He pressed Lucy in his arms, he left her, he came back, he seemed desperate; he had outbursts of rage, then elegiac gurglings of infinite sweetness, and the notes escaped from his bare neck full of sobs and kisses.
Emma leant forward to see him, clutching the velvet of the box with her nails.
The theatre rang with cheers; they recommenced the entire movement; the lovers spoke of the flowers on their tomb, of vows, exile, fate, hopes; and when they uttered the final adieu, Emma gave a sharp cry that mingled with the vibrations of the last chords.
Ah! if in the freshness of her beauty, before the soiling of marriage and the disillusions of adultery, she could have anchored her life upon some great, strong heart, then virtue, tenderness, voluptuousness, and duty blending, she would never have fallen from so high a happiness. But that happiness, no doubt, was a lie invented for the despair of all desire.
Edgar, flashing with fury, dominated all the others with his clearer voice; Ashton hurled homicidal provocations at him in deep notes; Lucie uttered her shrill plaint, Arthur at one side, his modulated tones in the middle register, and the bass of the minister pealed forth like an organ, while the voices of the women repeating his words took them up in chorus delightfully.
The outraged lover brandished his naked sword; his guipure ruffle rose with jerks to the movements of his chest, and he walked from right to left with long strides, clanking against the boards the silver-gilt spurs of his soft boots, widening out at the ankles. He, she thought must have an inexhaustible love to lavish it upon the crowd with such effusion.
Emma wanted to go out; the crowd filled the corridors, and she fell back in her arm-chair with palpitations that choked her.
He had great difficulty in getting back to his seat, for his elbows were jerked at every step because of the glass he held in his hands, and he even spilt three-fourths on the shoulders of a Rouen lady in short sleeves, who feeling the cold liquid running down to her loins, uttered cries like a peacock, as if she were being assassinated. Her husband, who was a millowner, railed at the clumsy fellow, and while she was with her handkerchief wiping up the stains from her handsome cherry-coloured taffeta gown, he angrily muttered about indemnity, costs, reimbursement. At last Charles reached his wife, saying to her, quite out of breath—
But soon recalling herself to the necessities of the situation, with an effort she shook off the torpor of her memories, and began stammering a few hurried words.
People were looking at them.
But from that moment she listened no more; and the chorus of the guests, the scene between Ashton and his servant, the grand duet in D major, all were for her as far off as if the instruments had grown less sonorous and the characters more remote.
Monsieur Leon put her long lace shawl carefully about her shoulders, and all three went off to sit down in the harbour, in the open air, outside the windows of a cafe.
People coming out of the theatre passed along the pavement, humming or shouting at the top of their voices, "O bel ange, ma Lucie!*" Then Leon, playing the dilettante, began to talk music. He had seen Tambourini, Rubini, Persiani, Grisi, and, compared with them, Lagardy, despite his grand outbursts, was nowhere.
Then Charles insisted—
The tables round them, however, were emptying; a waiter came and stood discreetly near them.
Monsieur Leon, while studying law, had gone pretty often to the dancing-rooms, where he was even a great success amongst the grisettes, who thought he had a distinguished air.
Self-possession depends on its environment.
This seemed to him a good omen.
Often I went out; I went away. I dragged myself along the quays, seeking distraction amid the din of the crowd without being able to banish the heaviness that weighed upon me.
"I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you.
Then, when he had taken a deep breath—
"At that time you were to me I know not what incomprehensible force that took captive my life.
"You were downstairs in the ante-room, ready to go out, standing on the last stair; you were wearing a bonnet with small blue flowers; and without any invitation from you, in spite of myself, I went with you.
When you went into a shop, I waited in the street, and I watched you through the window taking off your gloves and counting the change on the counter.
Then you rang at Madame Tuvache's; you were let in, and I stood like an idiot in front of the great heavy door that had closed after you."
Night was darkening over the walls, on which still shone, half hidden in the shade, the coarse colours of four bills representing four scenes from the "Tour de Nesle," with a motto in Spanish and French at the bottom.
No doubt Emma did not herself know, quite absorbed as she was by the charm of the seduction, and the necessity of defending herself from it; and contemplating the young man with a moved look, she gently repulsed the timid caresses that his trembling hands attempted.
"Ah! forgive me!" he cried, drawing back.
"Will you—" She seemed to reflect; then abruptly, "To-morrow at eleven o'clock in the cathedral."
Then bending his head over her shoulder, he seemed to beg the consent of her eyes.
Leon stepped back to go out.
In the evening Emma wrote the clerk an interminable letter, in which she cancelled the rendezvous; all was over; they must not, for the sake of their happiness, meet again.
The next morning, at the open window, and humming on his balcony, Leon himself varnished his pumps with several coatings.
He put on white trousers, fine socks, a green coat, emptied all the scent he had into his handkerchief, then having had his hair curled, he uncurled it again, in order to give it a more natural elegance.
He read an old fashion journal, went out, smoked a cigar, walked up three streets, thought it was time, and went slowly towards the porch of Notre Dame.
It was a beautiful summer morning. Silver plate sparkled in the jeweller's windows, and the light falling obliquely on the cathedral made mirrors of the corners of the grey stones; a flock of birds fluttered in the grey sky round the trefoil bell-turrets; the square, resounding with cries, was fragrant with the flowers that bordered its pavement, roses, jasmines, pinks, narcissi, and tube-roses, unevenly spaced out between moist grasses, catmint, and chickweed for the birds; the fountains gurgled in the centre, and under large umbrellas, amidst melons, piled up in heaps, flower-women, bare-headed, were twisting paper round bunches of violets.
And he first went round the lower aisles. Then he went out to look at the Place.
Leon with solemn steps walked along by the walls.
Emma was pale. She walked fast.
She rose, and they were about to leave, when the beadle came forward, hurriedly saying—
"Oh, no!" cried the clerk.
Then, in order to proceed "by rule," the beadle conducted them right to the entrance near the square, where, pointing out with his cane a large circle of block-stones without inscription or carving—
"At all events, go out by the north porch," cried the beadle, who was left alone on the threshold, "so as to see the Resurrection, the Last Judgment, Paradise, King David, and the Condemned in Hell-flames."
The cab went on again, and as soon as it reached the Carrefour Lafayette, set off down-hill, and entered the station at a gallop.
The cab came out by the gate, and soon having reached the Cours, trotted quietly beneath the elm-trees.
The coachman wiped his brow, put his leather hat between his knees, and drove his carriage beyond the side alley by the meadow to the margin of the waters.
But suddenly it turned with a dash across Quatremares, Sotteville, La Grande-Chaussee, the Rue d'Elbeuf, and made its third halt in front of the Jardin des Plantes.
And at once resuming its course, it passed by Saint-Sever, by the Quai'des Curandiers, the Quai aux Meules, once more over the bridge, by the Place du Champ de Mars, and behind the hospital gardens, where old men in black coats were walking in the sun along the terrace all green with ivy.
Then he lashed his perspiring jades afresh, but indifferent to their jolting, running up against things here and there, not caring if he did, demoralised, and almost weeping with thirst, fatigue, and depression.
Once in the middle of the day, in the open country, just as the sun beat most fiercely against the old plated lanterns, a bared hand passed beneath the small blinds of yellow canvas, and threw out some scraps of paper that scattered in the wind, and farther off lighted like white butterflies on a field of red clover all in bloom.
She packed her box quickly, paid her bill, took a cab in the yard, hurrying on the driver, urging him on, every moment inquiring about the time and the miles traversed. He succeeded in catching up the "Hirondelle" as it neared the first houses of Quincampoix.
Hivert pulled in his horses and, the servant, climbing up to the window, said mysteriously—
She pushed open the lobby door, and in the middle of the kitchen, amid brown jars full of picked currants, of powdered sugar and lump sugar, of the scales on the table, and of the pans on the fire, she saw all the Homais, small and large, with aprons reaching to their chins, and with forks in their hands.
Justin was standing up with bowed head, and the chemist was screaming—
"What is it?" replied the druggist.
Then he, from indolence, from laziness, went and took, hanging on its nail in my laboratory, the key of the Capharnaum."
It was thus the druggist called a small room under the leads, full of the utensils and the goods of his trade. He often spent long hours there alone, labelling, decanting, and doing up again; and he looked upon it not as a simple store, but as a veritable sanctuary, whence there afterwards issued, elaborated by his hands, all sorts of pills, boluses, infusions, lotions, and potions, that would bear far and wide his celebrity. No one in the world set foot there, and he respected it so, that he swept it himself. Finally, if the pharmacy, open to all comers, was the spot where he displayed his pride, the Capharnaum was the refuge where, egoistically concentrating himself, Homais delighted in the exercise of his predilections, so that Justin's thoughtlessness seemed to him a monstrous piece of irreverence, and, redder than the currants, he repeated—
"Next to it!" cried Madame Homais, clasping her hands. "Arsenic!
"Or poison a patient!" continued the druggist. "Do you want to see me in the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice?
Emma no longer dreamed of asking what they wanted her for, and the druggist went on in breathless phrases—
She could not finish, the druggist was thundering—"Empty it!
The lad stooped, but Homais was the quicker, and, having picked up the volume, contemplated it with staring eyes and open mouth.
"No, do not touch it!"
First he walked up and down with the open volume in his hand, rolling his eyes, choking, tumid, apoplectic.
Then he came straight to his pupil, and, planting himself in front of him with crossed arms—
However, he was growing calmer, and was now grumbling in a paternal tone whilst he fanned himself with his skull-cap.
When Emma knocked at the door. Charles, who was waiting for her, came forward with open arms and said to her with tears in his voice—
Emma gave him back the letter; then at dinner, for appearance's sake, she affected a certain repugnance.
But as he urged her to try, she resolutely began eating, while Charles opposite her sat motionless in a dejected attitude.
Now and then he raised his head and gave her a long look full of distress.
A quarter of an hour after he added, "My poor mother! what will become of her now?"
Charles picked up the flowers, and freshening his eyes, red with tears, against them, smelt them delicately.
She took them quickly from his hand and put them in a glass of water.
Madame Bovary senior was thinking of her husband.
Emma was thinking that it was scarcely forty-eight hours since they had been together, far from the world, all in a frenzy of joy, and not having eyes enough to gaze upon each other.
She was unpicking the lining of a dress, and the strips were scattered around her.
He came to offer his services "under the sad circumstances."
He never mentioned the bill; she did not think of it.
Madame Bovary seemed surprised at this, and attributed the change in her ways to the religious sentiments she had contracted during her illness.
She insisted.
At last she cried with affected waywardness—
She took off her bonnet, and they landed on their island.
The boat glided along the shores of the islands.
At times the shadow of the willows hid her completely; then she reappeared suddenly, like a vision in the moonlight.
Leon, on the floor by her side, found under his hand a ribbon of scarlet silk.
Mere Lefrancois, when she saw him, uttered many exclamations.
She thought he "had grown and was thinner," while Artemise, on the contrary, thought him stouter and darker.
He dined in the little room as of yore, but alone, without the tax-gatherer; for Binet, tired of waiting for the "Hirondelle," had definitely put forward his meal one hour, and now he dined punctually at five, and yet he declared usually the rickety old concern "was late."
He saw her alone in the evening, very late, behind the garden in the lane; in the lane, as she had the other one!
The next day when he came home he looked at her shyly, and at last could no longer keep back the words.
So Charles returned once more to this question of the piano.
She went on Thursdays. She got up and dressed silently, in order not to awaken Charles, who would have made remarks about her getting ready too early.
The girl then made up the coals covered by the cinders, and Emma remained alone in the kitchen.
Hivert was leisurely harnessing his horses, listening, moreover, to Mere Lefrancois, who, passing her head and nightcap through a grating, was charging him with commissions and giving him explanations that would have confused anyone else.
The "Hirondelle" started at a slow trot, and for about a mile stopped here and there to pick up passengers who waited for it, standing at the border of the road, in front of their yard gates.
The four seats, however, filled up.
Then on a sudden the town appeared.
Then the open country spread away with a monotonous movement till it touched in the distance the vague line of the pale sky.
Seen thus from above, the whole landscape looked immovable as a picture; the anchored ships were massed in one corner, the river curved round the foot of the green hills, and the isles, oblique in shape, lay on the water, like large, motionless, black fishes.
Sometimes a gust of wind drove the clouds towards the Saint Catherine hills, like aerial waves that broke silently against a cliff.
They stopped at the barrier; Emma undid her overshoes, put on other gloves, rearranged her shawl, and some twenty paces farther she got down from the "Hirondelle."
Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the shop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at intervals uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She walked with downcast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her lowered black veil.
She plunged into dark alleys, and, all perspiring, reached the bottom of the Rue Nationale, near the fountain that stands there.
She turned down a street; she recognised him by his curling hair that escaped from beneath his hat.
He went up, opened the door, entered—What an embrace!
The curtains were in red levantine, that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too much towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing in the world was so lovely as her brown head and white skin standing out against this purple colour, when, with a movement of shame, she crossed her bare arms, hiding her face in her hands.
On the chimney between the candelabra there were two of those pink shells in which one hears the murmur of the sea if one holds them to the ear.
They lunched by the fireside on a little round table, inlaid with rosewood.
He knelt on the ground before her, and with both elbows on her knees looked at her with a smile, his face upturned.
They had laughed at it many a time, but when they had to part everything seemed serious to them.
Motionless in front of each other, they kept repeating, "Till Thursday, till Thursday."
Often, as he did her hair, the man offered her tickets for a masked ball.
She went up the streets; reached the Croix-Rouge, put on her overshoes, that she had hidden in the morning under the seat, and sank into her place among the impatient passengers.
She sobbed; called on Leon, sent him tender words and kisses lost in the wind.
On the hillside a poor devil wandered about with his stick in the midst of the diligences.
To speak to you he threw back his head with an idiotic laugh; then his bluish eyeballs, rolling constantly, at the temples beat against the edge of the open wound.
Sometimes he appeared suddenly behind Emma, bareheaded, and she drew back with a cry.
Often they had started when, with a sudden movement, his hat entered the diligence through the small window, while he clung with his other arm to the footboard, between the wheels splashing mud. His voice, feeble at first and quavering, grew sharp; it resounded in the night like the indistinct moan of a vague distress; and through the ringing of the bells, the murmur of the trees, and the rumbling of the empty vehicle, it had a far-off sound that disturbed Emma. It went to the bottom of her soul, like a whirlwind in an abyss, and carried her away into the distances of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert, noticing a weight behind, gave the blind man sharp cuts with his whip. The thong lashed his wounds, and he fell back into the mud with a yell. Then the passengers in the "Hirondelle" ended by falling asleep, some with open mouths, others with lowered chins, leaning against their neighbour's shoulder, or with their arm passed through the strap, oscillating regularly with the jolting of the carriage; and the reflection of the lantern swinging without, on the crupper of the wheeler; penetrating into the interior through the chocolate calico curtains, threw sanguineous shadows over all these motionless people. Emma, drunk with grief, shivered in her clothes, feeling her feet grow colder and colder, and death in her soul.
He put the matches ready, the candlestick, a book, arranged her nightgown, turned back the bedclothes.
For he stood there, his hands hanging down and his eyes wide open, as if enmeshed in the innumerable threads of a sudden reverie.
One day, as they were talking philosophically of earthly disillusions, to experiment on his jealousy, or yielding, perhaps, to an over-strong need to pour out her heart, she told him that formerly, before him, she had loved someone. "Not like you," she went on quickly, protesting by the head of her child that "nothing had passed between them."
She made him pistachio-creams, and played him waltzes after dinner.
And she went to the writing-table, ransacked all the drawers, rummaged the papers, and at last lost her head so completely that Charles earnestly begged her not to take so much trouble about those wretched receipts.
Lheureux burst into lamentations and reminded her of all the kindnesses he had shown her.
"But if you haven't any ready money, you have an estate." And he reminded her of a miserable little hovel situated at Barneville, near Aumale, that brought in almost nothing.
"If I were in your place," he said, "I should clear myself of my debts, and have money left over."
He came back the following week and boasted of having, after much trouble, at last discovered a certain Langlois, who, for a long time, had had an eye on the property, but without mentioning his price.
The thing was worth a journey, and, as she could not undertake it, he offered to go to the place to have an interview with Langlois.
On his return he announced that the purchaser proposed four thousand francs.
"Frankly," he added, "that's a good price."
She drew half the sum at once, and when she was about to pay her account the shopkeeper said—
Don't you think I know what household affairs are?" And he looked at her fixedly, while in his hand he held two long papers that he slid between his nails.
At last, opening his pocket-book, he spread out on the table four bills to order, each for a thousand francs.
Emma grew rather confused in her calculations, and her ears tingled as if gold pieces, bursting from their bags, rang all round her on the floor.
If she had not told him about this bill, it was only to spare him such domestic worries; she sat on his knees, caressed him, cooed to him, gave him a long enumeration of all the indispensable things that had been got on credit.
The next morning at daybreak Emma ran to Lheureux to beg him to make out another account for not more than a thousand francs, for to show the one for four thousand it would be necessary to say that she had paid two-thirds, and confess, consequently, the sale of the estate—a negotiation admirably carried out by the shopkeeper, and which, in fact, was only actually known later on.
Emma opened the window, called Charles, and the poor fellow was obliged to confess the promise torn from him by his mother.
But Charles, rebelling for the first time, took his wife's part, so that Madame Bovary, senior, said she would leave.
One night she did not return to Yonville at all.
At last, at eleven o'clock, able to bear it no longer, Charles harnessed his chaise, jumped in, whipped up his horse, and reached the "Croix-Rouge" about two o'clock in the morning.
Happily, Charles remembered his employer's address, and rushed off there.
Day was breaking, and he could distinguish the escutcheons over the door, and knocked.
An idea occurred to him.
As he was turning into the street, Emma herself appeared at the other end of it.
He threw himself upon her rather than embraced her, crying—
"She went out just now; but for the future don't worry.
When she was seized with the desire to see Leon, she set out upon any pretext; and as he was not expecting her on that day, she went to fetch him at his office.
She wanted him to dress all in black, and grow a pointed beard, to look like the portraits of Louis XIII.
But he never succeeded in getting a rhyme for the second verse; and at last ended by copying a sonnet in a "Keepsake."
"Oh, my dear!" tenderly murmured Madame Homais, alarmed at the vague perils he was preparing to brave.
The druggist would formerly have taken good care not to use such an expression, but he was cultivating a gay Parisian style, which he thought in the best taste; and, like his neighbour, Madame Bovary, he questioned the clerk curiously about the customs of the capital; he even talked slang to dazzle the bourgeois, saying bender, crummy, dandy, macaroni, the cheese, cut my stick and "I'll hook it," for "I am going."
The idea of seeing again the place where his youth had been spent no doubt excited him, for during the whole journey he never ceased talking, and as soon as he had arrived, he jumped quickly out of the diligence to go in search of Leon.
Then the young man, to be alone, alleged he had some business engagement.
But she turned away; he drew her back, and, sinking on his knees, clasped her waist with his arms in a languorous pose, full of concupiscence and supplication.
She was standing up, her large flashing eyes looked at him seriously, almost terribly. Then tears obscured them, her red eyelids were lowered, she gave him her hands, and Leon was pressing them to his lips when a servant appeared to tell the gentleman that he was wanted.
Twenty times Leon tried to escape, but the other seized him by the arm saying—
At last he managed to get rid of him, and rushed straight to the hotel.
Then, growing calmer, she at length discovered that she had, no doubt, calumniated him.
She undressed brutally, tearing off the thin laces of her corset that nestled around her hips like a gliding snake.
She did not fail, in truth, to lavish all sorts of attentions upon him, from the delicacies of food to the coquettries of dress and languishing looks.
She brought roses to her breast from Yonville, which she threw into his face; was anxious about his health, gave him advice as to his conduct; and, in order the more surely to keep her hold on him, hoping perhaps that heaven would take her part, she tied a medal of the Virgin round his neck.
"Don't see them; don't go out; think only of ourselves; love me!"
But her pride revolted at this.
Once, however, a wretched-looking man, rubicund and bald, came to her house, saying he had been sent by Monsieur Vincart of Rouen.
But the next day at twelve o'clock she received a summons, and the sight of the stamped paper, on which appeared several times in large letters, "Maitre Hareng, bailiff at Buchy," so frightened her that she rushed in hot haste to the linendraper's.
She found him in his shop, doing up a parcel.
Then, his clogs clattering on the shop-boards, he went up in front of Madame Bovary to the first door, and introduced her into a narrow closet, where, in a large bureau in sapon-wood, lay some ledgers, protected by a horizontal padlocked iron bar. Against the wall, under some remnants of calico, one glimpsed a safe, but of such dimensions that it must contain something besides bills and money. Monsieur Lheureux, in fact, went in for pawnbroking, and it was there that he had put Madame Bovary's gold chain, together with the earrings of poor old Tellier, who, at last forced to sell out, had bought a meagre store of grocery at Quincampoix, where he was dying of catarrh amongst his candles, that were less yellow than his face.
And she showed him the paper.
And opening one of his ledgers, "See," he said.
"Not to speak of the bills signed by Monsieur Bovary, one for seven hundred francs, and another for three hundred.
On this he closed his eyes to reflect, wrote down a few figures, and declaring it would be very difficult for him, that the affair was shady, and that he was being bled, he wrote out four bills for two hundred and fifty francs each, to fall due month by month.
"Yes, another time," he replied, turning on his heel.
She renewed the bills, and thus it was continually.
Handkerchiefs were lying about on the stoves, and little Berthe, to the great scandal of Madame Homais, wore stockings with holes in them.
After dinner he walked about alone in the garden; he took little Berthe on his knees, and unfolding his medical journal, tried to teach her to read.
Then he comforted her; went to fetch water in her can to make rivers on the sand path, or broke off branches from the privet hedges to plant trees in the beds.
Autumn was setting in, and the leaves were already falling, as they did two years ago when she was ill.
And he walked up and down, his hands behind his back.
She stayed there all day long, torpid, half dressed, and from time to time burning Turkish pastilles which she had bought at Rouen in an Algerian's shop.
Often, seized with fear, she cried out, and Charles hurried to her.
Or at other times, consumed more ardently than ever by that inner flame to which adultery added fuel, panting, tremulous, all desire, she threw open her window, breathed in the cold air, shook loose in the wind her masses of hair, too heavy, and, gazing upon the stars, longed for some princely love. She thought of him, of Leon.
Then, on, reflection, he began to think his mistress's ways were growing odd, and that they were perhaps not wrong in wishing to separate him from her.
On Mid-Lent she did not return to Yonville, but in the evening went to a masked ball. She wore velvet breeches, red stockings, a club wig, and three-cornered hat cocked on one side. She danced all night to the wild tones of the trombones; people gathered round her, and in the morning she found herself on the steps of the theatre together with five or six masks, debardeuses* and sailors, Leon's comrades, who were talking about having supper.
Then she was frightened, pushed back her chair, and cast down her eyes.
What judgment? As a matter of fact, the evening before another paper had been brought that she had not yet seen, and she was stunned by these words—
He was walking up and down from the window to the bureau, repeating all the while—
I'll show him!" Then he approached her, and in a soft voice said—
And he looked at her in so keen, so terrible a fashion, that she shuddered to her very heart.
And he pushed her gently towards the staircase.
"What do I care?" said he, shutting the door.
They began with Bovary's consulting-room, and did not write down the phrenological head, which was considered an "instrument of his profession"; but in the kitchen they counted the plates; the saucepans, the chairs, the candlesticks, and in the bedroom all the nick-nacks on the whatnot. They examined her dresses, the linen, the dressing-room; and her whole existence to its most intimate details, was, like a corpse on whom a post-mortem is made, outspread before the eyes of these three men.
"But allow me, for I must make sure the box contains nothing else." And he tipped up the papers lightly, as if to shake out napoleons.
Emma had sent her out to watch for Bovary in order to keep him off, and they hurriedly installed the man in possession under the roof, where he swore he would remain.
She was not discouraged; and those whom she did manage to see she asked for money, declaring she must have some, and that she would pay it back.
At length he appeared.
He went out, and came back at the end of an hour, saying, with solemn face—
"At your office." And she looked at him.
She turned away; the street was empty.
She was so overwhelmed, so sad, that she had to lean against a wall to keep herself from falling.
But when the blind man appeared as usual at the foot of the hill he exclaimed—
And though he knew the poor devil, he pretended to see him for the first time, murmured something about "cornea," "opaque cornea," "sclerotic," "facies," then asked him in a paternal tone—
He advised him to take good wine, good beer, and good joints.
"Now," said Hivert, "for all this trouble you'll give us your performance."
The blind man sank down on his haunches, with his head thrown back, whilst he rolled his greenish eyes, lolled out his tongue, and rubbed his stomach with both hands as he uttered a kind of hollow yell like a famished dog.
Emma, filled with disgust, threw him over her shoulder a five-franc piece.
It seemed to her very fine thus to throw it away.
The sight of the well-known objects that defiled before her eyes gradually diverted Emma from her present trouble.
An intolerable fatigue overwhelmed her, and she reached her home stupefied, discouraged, almost asleep.
Monsieur Homais came out of his shop, and Mere Lefrangois, in the midst of the crowd, seemed to be perorating.
Then they looked at one another silently.
She dressed, put on her black gown, and her hood with jet beads, and that she might not be seen (there was still a crowd on the Place), she took the path by the river, outside the village.
The notary came in pressing his palm-leaf dressing-gown to his breast with his left arm, while with the other hand he raised and quickly put on again his brown velvet cap, pretentiously cocked on the right side, whence looked out the ends of three fair curls drawn from the back of the head, following the line of his bald skull.
Then she tried to move him, and, growing moved herself, she began telling him about the poorness of her home, her worries, her wants. He could understand that; an elegant woman! and, without leaving off eating, he had turned completely round towards her, so that his knee brushed against her boot, whose sole curled round as it smoked against the stove.
"You are taking a shameless advantage of my distress, sir!
The notary remained quite stupefied, his eyes fixed on his fine embroidered slippers.
And for a quarter of an hour the two of them went over the various persons in Yonville who might perhaps be inclined to help her.
He was alone in his garret, busy imitating in wood one of those indescribable bits of ivory, composed of crescents, of spheres hollowed out one within the other, the whole as straight as an obelisk, and of no use whatever; and he was beginning on the last piece—he was nearing his goal. In the twilight of the workshop the white dust was flying from his tools like a shower of sparks under the hoofs of a galloping horse; the two wheels were turning, droning; Binet smiled, his chin lowered, his nostrils distended, and, in a word, seemed lost in one of those complete happinesses that, no doubt, belong only to commonplace occupations, which amuse the mind with facile difficulties, and satisfy by a realisation of that beyond which such minds have not a dream.
The tax-collector seemed to be listening with wide-open eyes, as if he did not understand. She went on in a tender, suppliant manner. She came nearer to him, her breast heaving; they no longer spoke.
"Madame! what do you mean?"
"Nurse Rollet," she said on reaching the nurse's, "I am choking; unlace me!"
Nurse Rollet covered her with a petticoat and remained standing by her side.
Mere Rollet went out, raised the fingers of her right hand to that side of the sky that was brightest, and came back slowly, saying—
The nurse, however, was a long while gone. But, as there was no clock in the cot, Emma feared she was perhaps exaggerating the length of time. She began walking round the garden, step by step; she went into the path by the hedge, and returned quickly, hoping that the woman would have come back by another road. At last, weary of waiting, assailed by fears that she thrust from her, no longer conscious whether she had been here a century or a moment, she sat down in a corner, closed her eyes, and stopped her ears. The gate grated; she sprang up. Before she had spoken Mere Rollet said to her—
She went up the large straight staircase with wooden balusters that led to the corridor paved with dusty flags, into which several doors in a row opened, as in a monastery or an inn.
And, despite all her efforts, it was impossible for her to open her lips.
"Oh," she replied bitterly, "they are poor charms since you disdained them."
"No matter!" she said, looking at him sadly. "I have suffered much."
"But—but—" said he, getting up slowly, while his face assumed a grave expression.
"You know," she went on quickly, "that my husband had placed his whole fortune at a notary's.
First she looked at him for some moments.
And then when I come back to him—to him, rich, happy, free—to implore the help the first stranger would give, a suppliant, and bringing back to him all my tenderness, he repulses me because it would cost him three thousand francs!"
Everything in her head, of memories, ideas, went off at once like a thousand pieces of fireworks.
Madness was coming upon her; she grew afraid, and managed to recover herself, in a confused way, it is true, for she did not in the least remember the cause of the terrible condition she was in, that is to say, the question of money.
Then in an ecstasy of heroism, that made her almost joyous, she ran down the hill, crossed the cow-plank, the foot-path, the alley, the market, and reached the chemist's shop.
Justin in his shirt-sleeves was carrying out a dish.
She seemed to him extraordinarily beautiful and majestic as a phantom.
The key turned in the lock, and she went straight to the third shelf, so well did her memory guide her, seized the blue jar, tore out the cork, plunged in her hand, and withdrawing it full of a white powder, she began eating it.
At last, unable to bear it any longer, and fancying she had gone to Rouen, he set out along the highroad, walked a mile, met no one, again waited, and returned home.
She drank a mouthful of water and turned to the wall. The frightful taste of ink continued.
"Ah! it is beginning," she murmured.
She turned her head from side to side with a gentle movement full of agony, while constantly opening her mouth as if something very heavy were weighing upon her tongue.
At eight o'clock the vomiting began again.
He flew to the writing-table, tore open the seal, and read aloud: "Accuse no one." He stopped, passed his hands across his eyes, and read it over again.
He could only keep repeating the word: "Poisoned! poisoned!" Felicite ran to Homais, who proclaimed it in the market-place; Madame Lefrancois heard it at the "Lion d'Or"; some got up to go and tell their neighbours, and all night the village was on the alert.
He lost his head, and made more than fifteen rough copies.
Hippolyte went to Neufchatel, and Justin so spurred Bovary's horse that he left it foundered and three parts dead by the hill at Bois-Guillaume.
Then going back to her, he sank upon the carpet, and lay there with his head leaning against the edge of her bed, sobbing.
She hated no one now; a twilight dimness was settling upon her thoughts, and, of all earthly noises, Emma heard none but the intermittent lamentations of this poor heart, sweet and indistinct like the echo of a symphony dying away.
"Bring me the child," she said, raising herself on her elbow.
And at this name, that carried her back to the memory of her adulteries and her calamities, Madame Bovary turned away her head, as at the loathing of another bitterer poison that rose to her mouth.
Then the symptoms ceased for a moment; she seemed less agitated; and at every insignificant word, at every respiration a little more easy, he regained hope.
She soon began vomiting blood.
Her limbs were convulsed, her whole body covered with brown spots, and her pulse slipped beneath the fingers like a stretched thread, like a harp-string nearly breaking.
She cursed the poison, railed at it, and implored it to be quick, and thrust away with her stiffened arms everything that Charles, in more agony than herself, tried to make her drink.
Felicite was running hither and thither in the room. Homais, motionless, uttered great sighs; and Monsieur Canivet, always retaining his self-command, nevertheless began to feel uneasy.
Bovary raised his hands; Canivet stopped short; and Homais pulled off his skull-cap long before the doctor had come in.
He belonged to that great school of surgery begotten of Bichat, to that generation, now extinct, of philosophical practitioners, who, loving their art with a fanatical love, exercised it with enthusiasm and wisdom.
Charles caught him in both his arms, and gazed at him wildly, imploringly, half-fainting against his breast.
The chemist rejoined them on the Place.
"What's the matter?" said the chemist.
Homais dilated in Amphytrionic pride, and the affecting thought of Bovary vaguely contributed to his pleasure by a kind of egotistic reflex upon himself.
He displayed his erudition, cited pell-mell cantharides, upas, the manchineel, vipers.
He was making his blood too thick by going to sleep every evening after dinner.
Nevertheless, not shrinking from what he called his mission, he returned to Bovary's in company with Canivet whom Monsieur Lariviere, before leaving, had strongly urged to make this visit; and he would, but for his wife's objections, have taken his two sons with him, in order to accustom them to great occasions; that this might be a lesson, an example, a solemn picture, that should remain in their heads later on.
Emma, her chin sunken upon her breast, had her eyes inordinately wide open, and her poor hands wandered over the sheets with that hideous and soft movement of the dying, that seems as if they wanted already to cover themselves with the shroud.
Then he recited the Misereatur and the Indulgentiam, dipped his right thumb in the oil, and began to give extreme unction.
The priest did not fail to point this out; he even explained to Bovary that the Lord sometimes prolonged the life of persons when he thought it meet for their salvation; and Charles remembered the day when, so near death, she had received the communion. Perhaps there was no need to despair, he thought.
In fact, she looked around her slowly, as one awakening from a dream; then in a distinct voice she asked for her looking-glass, and remained some time bending over it, until the big tears fell from her eyes.
Then she turned away her head with a sigh and fell back upon the pillows.
Suddenly on the pavement was heard a loud noise of clogs and the clattering of a stick; and a voice rose—a raucous voice—that sang—
Emma raised herself like a galvanised corpse, her hair undone, her eyes fixed, staring.
And Emma began to laugh, an atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh, thinking she saw the hideous face of the poor wretch that stood out against the eternal night like a menace.
She fell back upon the mattress in a convulsion.
"Yes." said he, struggling, "I'll be quiet.
Weaker than a child, Charles let himself be led downstairs into the sitting-room, and Monsieur Homais soon went home.
The druggist, at his wit's end, began softly to draw aside the small window-curtain.
He shut himself up in his consulting-room, took a pen, and after sobbing for some time, wrote—
Charles burst out into blasphemies: "I hate your God!"
Bovary was far away.
A fine rain was falling: Charles, whose chest was bare, at last began to shiver; he went in and sat down in the kitchen.
So bearing no grudge to poor Charles, he came back again in the evening to sit up with the body; bringing with him three volumes and a pocket-book for taking notes.
Monsieur Bournisien was there, and two large candles were burning at the head of the bed, that had been taken out of the alcove. The druggist, on whom the silence weighed, was not long before he began formulating some regrets about this "unfortunate young woman." and the priest replied that there was nothing to do now but pray for her.
"But," objected the chemist, "since God knows all our needs, what can be the good of prayer?"
Charles came in, and advancing towards the bed, slowly drew the curtains.
Emma's head was turned towards her right shoulder, the corner of her mouth, which was open, seemed like a black hole at the lower part of her face; her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands; a kind of white dust besprinkled her lashes, and her eyes were beginning to disappear in that viscous pallor that looks like a thin web, as if spiders had spun it over. The sheet sunk in from her breast to her knees, and then rose at the tips of her toes, and it seemed to Charles that infinite masses, an enormous load, were weighing upon her.
He stood opposite her, the better to see her, and he lost himself in a contemplation so deep that it was no longer painful.
At daybreak Madame Bovary senior arrived.
Charles as he embraced her burst into another flood of tears.
With lowered faces, and swinging one leg crossed over the other knee, they uttered deep sighs at intervals; each one was inordinately bored, and yet none would be the first to go.
He also carried a large jar full of chlorine water, to keep off all miasmata. Just then the servant, Madame Lefrancois, and Madame Bovary senior were busy about Emma, finishing dressing her, and they were drawing down the long stiff veil that covered her to her satin shoes.
They had to raise the head a little, and a rush of black liquid issued, as if she were vomiting, from her mouth.
Homais fell foul of the confessional.
Bournisien defended it; he enlarged on the acts of restitution that it brought about.
They sat opposite one another, with protruding stomachs, puffed-up faces, and frowning looks, after so much disagreement uniting at last in the same human weakness, and they moved no more than the corpse by their side, that seemed to be sleeping.
At last, stiffening himself against emotion, Homais gave two or three great cuts at random that left white patches amongst that beautiful black hair.
The chemist and the cure plunged anew into their occupations, not without sleeping from time to time, of which they accused each other reciprocally at each fresh awakening.
And the druggist, who could not hold out any longer, about four in the morning sighed—
He entered Maromme shouting for the people of the inn, burst open the door with a thrust of his shoulder, made for a sack of oats, emptied a bottle of sweet cider into the manger, and again mounted his nag, whose feet struck fire as it dashed along.
When he had recovered consciousness, he fell, weeping, into Bovary's arms: "My girl! Emma! my child! tell me—"
Monsieur Bournisien, in full vestments, was singing in a shrill voice.
Lestiboudois went about the church with his whalebone stick.
At times he thought he felt nothing more, and he enjoyed this lull in his pain, whilst at the same time he reproached himself for being a wretch.
The sharp noise of an iron-ferruled stick was heard on the stones, striking them at irregular intervals.
I am in pain!" cried Bovary, angrily throwing him a five-franc piece.
The women followed in black cloaks with turned-down hoods; each of them carried in her hands a large lighted candle, and Charles felt himself growing weaker at this continual repetition of prayers and torches, beneath this oppressive odour of wax and of cassocks.
The black cloth bestrewn with white beads blew up from time to time, laying bare the coffin.
The ecclesiastic passed the holy water sprinkler to his neighbour.
Old Rouault on his way back began quietly smoking a pipe, which Homais in his innermost conscience thought not quite the thing.
He also noticed that Monsieur Binet had not been present, and that Tuvache had "made off" after mass, and that Theodore, the notary's servant wore a blue coat, "as if one could not have got a black coat, since that is the custom, by Jove!" And to share his observations with others he went from group to group.
Charles on getting home undressed, and old Rouault put on his blue blouse.
But when he reached the top of the hill he turned back, as he had turned once before on the road of Saint-Victor when he had parted from her.
Despite their fatigue, Charles and his mother stayed very long that evening talking together.
Then everyone began "taking advantage" of him.
He sent in accounts for professional attendance.
Charles, among the other congratulations he sent him, wrote this sentence—
She corrupted him from beyond the grave.
He sat down opposite it.
Berthe by his side was painting prints.
He suffered, poor man, at seeing her so badly dressed, with laceless boots, and the arm-holes of her pinafore torn down to the hips; for the charwoman took no care of her.
But she was so sweet, so pretty, and her little head bent forward so gracefully, letting the dear fair hair fall over her rosy cheeks, that an infinite joy came upon him, a happiness mingled with bitterness, like those ill-made wines that taste of resin.
He mended her toys, made her puppets from cardboard, or sewed up half-torn dolls.
Then, if his eyes fell upon the workbox, a ribbon lying about, or even a pin left in a crack of the table, he began to dream, and looked so sad that she became as sad as he.
Some are seen going about alone, and these are not, perhaps, the least dangerous.
But he was released.
He was enthusiastic about the hydro-electric Pulvermacher chains; he wore one himself, and when at night he took off his flannel vest, Madame Homais stood quite dazzled before the golden spiral beneath which he was hidden, and felt her ardour redouble for this man more bandaged than a Scythian, and splendid as one of the Magi.
First he proposed a broken column with some drapery, next a pyramid, then a Temple of Vesta, a sort of rotunda, or else a "mass of ruins."
As to the inscription, Homais could think of nothing so fine as Sta viator*, and he got no further; he racked his brain, he constantly repeated Sta viator. At last he hit upon Amabilen conjugem calcas**, which was adopted.
Monsieur Bournisien even paid him two or three visits, then gave him up.
In spite of the economy with which Bovary lived, he was far from being able to pay off his old debts.
She made the first overtures of reconciliation by offering to have the little girl, who could help her in the house, to live with her.
As his affections vanished, he clung more closely to the love of his child.
"First, having at the time of the cholera distinguished myself by a boundless devotion; second, by having published, at my expense, various works of public utility, such as" (and he recalled his pamphlet entitled, "Cider, its manufacture and effects," besides observation on the lanigerous plant-louse, sent to the Academy; his volume of statistics, and down to his pharmaceutical thesis); "without counting that I am a member of several learned societies" (he was member of a single one).
He even addressed a petition to the sovereign in which he implored him to "do him justice"; he called him "our good king," and compared him to Henri IV.
He walked round it with folded arms, meditating on the folly of the Government and the ingratitude of men.
One day, however, he sat down before it, turned the key, and pressed the spring.
He found a box and broke it open with a kick.
He never went out, saw no one, refused even to visit his patients.
Sometimes, however, some curious person climbed on to the garden hedge, and saw with amazement this long-bearded, shabbily clothed, wild man, who wept aloud as he walked up and down.
But the landlady only listened with half an ear, having troubles like himself.
For Lheureux had at last established the "Favorites du Commerce," and Hivert, who enjoyed a great reputation for doing errands, insisted on a rise of wages, and was threatening to go over "to the opposition shop."
Leaning on the table opposite him, he chewed his cigar as he talked, and Charles was lost in reverie at this face that she had loved.
This gradually grew redder; the nostrils throbbed fast, the lips quivered.
He even added a fine phrase, the only one he ever made—
The good woman died the same year; old Rouault was paralysed, and it was an aunt who took charge of her.
So the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of the three spots designated.
The palace place, encumbered with people, offered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every moment fresh floods of heads.
In the centre of the lofty Gothic* façade of the palace, the grand staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which, after parting on the intermediate landing−place, flowed in broad waves along its lateral slopes,−−the grand staircase, I say, trickled incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake.
"Upon my soul, so it's you, 'Joannes Frollo de Molendino!'" cried one of them, to a sort of little, light−haired imp, with a well−favored and malign countenance, clinging to the acanthus leaves of a capital; "you are well named John of the Mill, for your two arms and your two legs have the air of four wings fluttering on the breeze.
"He! of course," continued the small imp on the capital, "What are they laughing at?
"Master Andry," pursued Jean Jehan, still clinging to his capital, "hold your tongue, or I'll drop on your head!"
Master Andry raised his eyes, seemed to measure in an instant the height of the pillar, the weight of the scamp, mentally multiplied that weight by the square of the velocity and remained silent.
"Where are you bound for in that fashion, Thibaut, ~Tybalde ad dados~, with your back turned to the university, and trotting towards the town?"
In the meantime, wrath had succeeded to impatience.
A tempest, which was only rumbling in the distance as yet, was floating on the surface of this crowd.
"We must have the mystery instantly," resumed the student; "or else, my advice is that we should hang the bailiff of the courts, by way of a morality and a comedy."
The crowd hurled itself towards them, and they already beheld the frail wooden railing, which separated them from it, giving way and bending before the pressure of the throng.
At that moment, the tapestry of the dressing−room, which we have described above, was raised, and afforded passage to a personage, the mere sight of whom suddenly stopped the crowd, and changed its wrath into curiosity as by enchantment.
"Begin instantly!
"Begin at once," went on the other. "Satisfy the populace; I undertake to appease the bailiff, who will appease monsieur the cardinal."
"Messeigneurs the bourgeois," he cried, at the top of his lungs to the crowd, which continued to hoot him, "we are going to begin at once."
The two young girls dropped their eyes.
The man, who asked nothing better than to enter into conversation, looked at them with a smile. "So you have nothing to say to me, damsels?"
The tall, light−haired young man retreated a step; but the two curious maidens had no mind to let slip their prize.
"Of sirens," said Liénarde. "And all naked," added the young man.
Liénarde lowered her eyes modestly.
"Without doubt," he replied; then he added, with a certain emphasis,−−"I am the author of it, damsels."
Remarkable fact: that whole crowd, so tumultuous but a few moments before, now waited amiably on the word of the comedian; which proves the eternal truth, still experienced every day in our theatres, that the best means of making the public wait patiently is to assure them that one is about to begin instantly.
The music of high and low instruments immediately became audible from the interior of the stage; the tapestry was raised; four personages, in motley attire and painted faces, emerged from it, climbed the steep ladder of the theatre, and, arrived upon the upper platform, arranged themselves in a line before the public, whom they saluted with profound reverences; then the symphony ceased.
The amiable applause which had greeted the beginning of his prologue was still echoing in his bosom, and he was completely absorbed in that species of ecstatic contemplation with which an author beholds his ideas fall, one by one, from the mouth of the actor into the vast silence of the audience.
The prologue stopped short, and all heads turned tumultuously towards the beggar, who, far from being disconcerted by this, saw, in this incident, a good opportunity for reaping his harvest, and who began to whine in a doleful way, half closing his eyes the while,−−"Charity, please!"
The mendicant received both the alms and the sarcasm without wincing, and continued, in lamentable tones,−−
On recovering from his first stupefaction, he bestirred himself to shout, to the four personages on the stage, "Go on! What the devil!−−go on!" −−without even deigning to cast a glance of disdain upon the two interrupters.
At that moment, he felt some one pluck at the hem of his surtout; he turned round, and not without ill−humor, and found considerable difficulty in smiling; but he was obliged to do so, nevertheless.
Besides, the people listened patiently.
He entered, then, bowed to those present with the hereditary smile of the great for the people, and directed his course slowly towards his scarlet velvet arm−chair, with the air of thinking of something quite different.
His cortege−−what we should nowadays call his staff−−of bishops and abbés invaded the estrade in his train, not without causing redoubled tumult and curiosity among the audience.
A deep silence settled over the assembly, accompanied by stifled laughter at the preposterous names and all the bourgeois designations which each of these personages transmitted with imperturbable gravity to the usher, who then tossed names and titles pell−mell and mutilated to the crowd below.
Presuming that he was some groom who had stolen in, the usher stopped him.
The man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside.
"Announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the city of Ghent," he whispered, very low.
Then, while Guillaume Rym, a "sage and malicious man," as Philippe de Comines puts it, watched them both with a smile of raillery and superiority, each sought his place, the cardinal quite abashed and troubled, Coppenole tranquil and haughty, and thinking, no doubt, that his title of hosier was as good as any other, after all, and that Marie of Burgundy, mother to that Marguerite whom Coppenole was to−day bestowing in marriage, would have been less afraid of the cardinal than of the hosier; for it is not a cardinal who would have stirred up a revolt among the men of Ghent against the favorites of the daughter of Charles the Bold; it is not a cardinal who could have fortified the populace with a word against her tears and prayers, when the Maid of Flanders came to supplicate her people in their behalf, even at the very foot of the scaffold; while the hosier had only to raise his leather elbow, in order to cause to fall your two heads, most illustrious seigneurs, Guy d'Hymbercourt and Chancellor Guillaume Hugonet.
But Gringoire had multiplied himself, and only shouted the more vigorously: "Begin again! begin again!"
So the personages on the stage took up their parts, and Gringoire hoped that the rest of his work, at least, would be listened to.
Jupiter, whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing−room, supported her claim, and Venus was on the point of carrying it off,−−that is to say, without allegory, of marrying monsieur the dauphin, when a young child clad in white damask, and holding in her hand a daisy (a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of Flanders) came to contest it with Venus.
With the exception of Gisquette and Liénarde, who turned round from time to time when Gringoire plucked them by the sleeve; with the exception of the big, patient neighbor, no one listened, no one looked at the poor, deserted morality full face. Gringoire saw only profiles.
A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads.
Coppenole, from his post, ordered all, directed all, arranged all.
Gringoire was forced to content himself with this eulogy; for a thunder of applause, mingled with a prodigious acclamation, cut their conversation short.
The acclamation was unanimous; people rushed towards the chapel.
"As wicked as he is ugly," retorted another.
One scholar (Robin Poussepain, I think), came and laughed in his face, and too close.
Nevertheless, he began to grow impatient with Coppenole's behavior, and suddenly turned towards him with so formidable a gnashing of teeth, that the Flemish giant recoiled, like a bull−dog before a cat.
"What a devil of a man!" said Robin Poussepain still all bruised with his fall. "He shows himself; he's a hunchback.
"And he has one eye too many," added Robin Poussepain.
Then the ragged and howling procession set out on its march, according to custom, around the inner galleries of the Courts, before making the circuit of the streets and squares.
"Good," he said to himself, "there go all the mischief− makers." Unfortunately, all the mischief−makers constituted the entire audience.
To tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered, others in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children, who had had enough of the uproar and tumult.
An instant later, a symphony which had been intended to produce the greatest effect on the arrival of the Virgin, was lacking.
This word produced a magical effect.
He returned towards the marble table, and saw that the representation had been interrupted.
Then he beat a retreat, with drooping head, but the last in the field, like a general who has fought well.
He was on the point of turning to the Pont Saint−Michel; children were running about here and there with fire lances and rockets.
"Pest on firework candles!" said Gringoire; and he fell back on the Pont au Change.
"Happy painter, Jehan Fourbault!" said Gringoire with a deep sigh; and he turned his back upon the bannerets and pennons.
By day, one could admire the variety of its edifices, all sculptured in stone or wood, and already presenting complete specimens of the different domestic architectures of the Middle Ages, running back from the fifteenth to the eleventh century, from the casement which had begun to dethrone the arch, to the Roman semicircle, which had been supplanted by the ogive, and which still occupies, below it, the first story of that ancient house de la Tour Roland, at the corner of the Place upon the Seine, on the side of the street with the Tannerie.
She danced, she turned, she whirled rapidly about on an old Persian rug, spread negligently under her feet; and each time that her radiant face passed before you, as she whirled, her great black eyes darted a flash of lightning at you.
The young girl, stopped at length, breathless, and the people applauded her lovingly.
And, seating herself, she gracefully presented her tambourine to the goat.
"Djali," pursued the Egyptian, with still another movement of the tambourine, "what hour of the day is it?"
The goat seated himself on his hind quarters, and began to bleat, waving his fore feet in so strange a manner, that, with the exception of the bad French, and worse Latin, Jacques Charmolue was there complete,−−gesture, accent, and attitude.
"Sacrilege! profanation!" resumed the voice of the bald man.
"Ah!" said she, "'tis that villanous man!" Then, thrusting her under lip out beyond the upper, she made a little pout, which appeared to be familiar to her, executed a pirouette on her heel, and set about collecting in her tambourine the gifts of the multitude.
All at once, she passed in front of Gringoire.
In the meantime, the pretty girl stood there, gazing at him with her big eyes, and holding out her tambourine to him and waiting. Gringoire broke into a violent perspiration.
All rushed towards the Pillar House.
Nothing remained upon the wall but slender fleurs−de−lis, mingled with rose bushes, painted in 1434 by Mathieu Biterne. It was a meagre supper.
The words which she sang were in a tongue unknown to Gringoire, and which seemed to him to be unknown to herself, so little relation did the expression which she imparted to her song bear to the sense of the words.
He listened in a sort of rapture, and forgetfulness of everything.
"Will you hold your tongue, you cricket of hell?" it cried, still from the same obscure corner of the place.
Gringoire covered up his ears.
This procession, which our readers have seen set out from the Palais de Justice, had organized on the way, and had been recruited by all the knaves, idle thieves, and unemployed vagabonds in Paris; so that it presented a very respectable aspect when it arrived at the Grève.
Guillaume Rousseau, Emperor of the Empire of Galilee, marched majestically in his robe of purple, spotted with wine, preceded by buffoons wrestling and executing military dances; surrounded by his macebearers, his pickpockets and clerks of the chamber of accounts.
He made one bound as far as the priest, looked at him, and fell upon his knees.
Quasimodo placed himself in front of the priest, set in play the muscles of his athletic fists, and glared upon the assailants with the snarl of an angry tiger.
The priest resumed his sombre gravity, made a sign to Quasimodo, and retired in silence.
Quasimodo walked in front of him, scattering the crowd as he passed.
So he walked along, very thoughtfully, behind the young girl, who hastened her pace and made her goat trot as she saw the bourgeois returning home and the taverns−−the only shops which had been open that day−−closing.
Fortunately, he speedily found it again, and he knotted it together without difficulty, thanks to the gypsy, thanks to Djali, who still walked in front of him; two fine, delicate, and charming creatures, whose tiny feet, beautiful forms, and graceful manners he was engaged in admiring, almost confusing them in his contemplation; believing them to be both young girls, from their intelligence and good friendship; regarding them both as goats,−−so far as the lightness, agility, and dexterity of their walk were concerned.
One of the men who held the young girl turned towards him.
Quasimodo came up to him, tossed him four paces away on the pavement with a backward turn of the hand, and plunged rapidly into the gloom, bearing the young girl folded across one arm like a silken scarf.
His companion followed him, and the poor goat ran after them all, bleating plaintively.
"Halt, rascals, and yield me that wench!" suddenly shouted in a voice of thunder, a cavalier who appeared suddenly from a neighboring square.
He tore the gypsy from the arms of the dazed Quasimodo, threw her across his saddle, and at the moment when the terrible hunchback, recovering from his surprise, rushed upon him to regain his prey, fifteen or sixteen archers, who followed their captain closely, made their appearance, with their two−edged swords in their fists.
The gypsy gracefully raised herself upright upon the officer's saddle, placed both hands upon the young man's shoulders, and gazed fixedly at him for several seconds, as though enchanted with his good looks and with the aid which he had just rendered her.
Moreover, his hand was tolerably free; he stopped up his nose and resigned himself.
He recalled the violent scene which he had just witnessed in part; that the gypsy was struggling with two men, that Quasimodo had a companion; and the morose and haughty face of the archdeacon passed confusedly through his memory.
And on that fact and that basis he began to construct a fantastic edifice of hypothesis, that card−castle of philosophers; then, suddenly returning once more to reality, "Come! I'm freezing!" he ejaculated.
Each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from Gringoire's loins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion.
Then he retraced his steps, and feeling his way and searching, with his nose to the wind and his ears on the alert, he tried to find the blessed pallet again, but in vain.
It was not deserted; here and there along its extent crawled certain vague and formless masses, all directing their course towards the light which flickered at the end of the street, like those heavy insects which drag along by night, from blade to blade of grass, towards the shepherd's fire.
He overtook another of these itinerant masses, and examined it.
That said, he turned his back upon the blind man, and pursued his way.
But the blind man began to increase his stride at the same time; and, behold! the cripple and the legless man, in his bowl, came up on their side in great haste, and with great clamor of bowl and crutches, upon the pavement.
Gringoire stopped up his ears. "Oh, tower of Babel!" he exclaimed.
The lame man ran! The cripple in the bowl ran!
And then, in proportion as he plunged deeper into the street, cripples in bowls, blind men and lame men, swarmed about him, and men with one arm, and with one eye, and the leprous with their sores, some emerging from little streets adjacent, some from the air−holes of cellars, howling, bellowing, yelping, all limping and halting, all flinging themselves towards the light, and humped up in the mire, like snails after a shower.
The poor poet cast his eyes about him.
But his efforts were vain; the thread of his memory and of his thought was broken; and, doubting everything, wavering between what he saw and what he felt, he put to himself this unanswerable question,−−
But the three beggars did not loose their hold and tore him from the rest, howling, "He belongs to us!"
Reality made its way to the light around him, struck his eyes, struck his feet, and demolished, bit by bit, all that frightful poetry with which he had, at first, believed himself to be surrounded.
"Never," adds an eye witness of 1653, "have the sudden metamorphoses of the Court of Miracles been more happily presented.
Benserade prepared us for it by some very gallant verses."
The three who had Gringoire in their clutches led him in front of this hogshead, and the entire bacchanal rout fell silent for a moment, with the exception of the cauldron inhabited by the child.
Then he shouted shrilly: "Silence!" and, as the cauldron and the frying−pan did not heed him, and continued their duet, he jumped down from his hogshead, gave a kick to the boiler, which rolled ten paces away bearing the child with it, a kick to the frying−pan, which upset in the fire with all its grease, and gravely remounted his throne, without troubling himself about the stifled tears of the child, or the grumbling of the old woman, whose supper was wasting away in a fine white flame.
Trouillefou made a sign, and the duke, the emperor, and the passed masters of pickpockets, and the isolated robbers, came and ranged themselves around him in a horseshoe, of which Gringoire, still roughly held by the body, formed the centre.
"You recognize yourself as a member of the free bourgeoisie?"* added the King of Thunes.
"I must call your attention to the fact," continued the king, "that you will be hung all the same."
"Only," continued Clopin imperturbably, "you will be hung later on, with more ceremony, at the expense of the good city of Paris, on a handsome stone gibbet, and by honest men.
What Hungarian Jew patter are you jabbering at us?
Several thieves detached themselves from the circle, and returned a moment later.
They brought two thick posts, terminated at their lower extremities in spreading timber supports, which made them stand readily upon the ground; to the upper extremity of the two posts they fitted a cross−beam, and the whole constituted a very pretty portable gibbet, which Gringoire had the satisfaction of beholding rise before him, in a twinkling.
"Now," went on the King of Thunes, "twist your right foot round your left leg, and rise on the tip of your left foot."
The band of thieves applauded Clopin's words, and arranged themselves in a circle round the gibbet, with a laugh so pitiless that Gringoire perceived that he amused them too much not to have everything to fear from them.
"Oh!" he said, in a very low voice, "is it possible that my life depends on the slightest vibration of the least of these bells? Oh!" he added, with clasped hands, "bells, do not ring, hand−bells do not clang, mule−bells do not quiver!"
Perceiving that no respite, nor reprieve, nor subterfuge was possible, he bravely decided upon his course of action; he wound his right foot round his left leg, raised himself on his left foot, and stretched out his arm: but at the moment when his hand touched the manikin, his body, which was now supported upon one leg only, wavered on the stool which had but three; he made an involuntary effort to support himself by the manikin, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened by the fatal vibration of the thousand bells of the manikin, which, yielding to the impulse imparted by his hand, described first a rotary motion, and then swayed majestically between the two posts.
Meanwhile, he heard the dreadful peal above his head, the diabolical laughter of the vagabonds, and the voice of Trouillefou saying,−−
The thieves made him mount the stool, Clopin came to him, passed the rope about his neck, and, tapping him on the shoulder,−−
"Now," resumed Clopin Trouillefou, "as soon as I clap my hands, you, Andry the Red, will fling the stool to the ground with a blow of your knee; you, François Chante−Prune, will cling to the feet of the rascal; and you, Bellevigne, will fling yourself on his shoulders; and all three at once, do you hear?"
Nevertheless, three emerged from the throng and came to smell of him.
"Let them hang you, then, and say 'Thank you!'" retorted the vagabond wench, turning her back on him.
She gazed at him for a moment with an air of pity, then dropped her eyes, made a plait in her petticoat, and remained in indecision.
Guillaume Longuejoue would beat me." She retreated into the crowd.
and, turning towards the gibbet with a sign of his hand, "Gone!" Bellevigne de l'Etoile, Andry the Red, François Chante−Prune, stepped up to Gringoire.
They undid the noose, and made the poet step down from the stool.
The gypsy offered it to Gringoire:
His reason,tossed about in imaginary space, now hung only by this thread.
At the same time, the white goat placed itself in front of her, and presented to Gringoire a hostile front, bristling with two pretty horns, gilded and very sharp.
She made her disdainful little grimace, drew up her head like a bird, then burst out laughing, and the tiny poniard disappeared as it had come, without Gringoire being able to see where the wasp concealed its sting.
The young girl seated opposite him, watched him in silence, visibly preoccupied with another thought, at which she smiled from time to time, while her soft hand caressed the intelligent head of the goat, gently pressed between her knees.
"So you don't want me for your husband?" The young girl looked at him intently, and said, "No."
She gazed fixedly at him again, and said, after a momentary reflection, "Perhaps." This "perhaps," so dear to philosophers, emboldened Gringoire.
"I don't know," said the young girl, and she added hastily, "but you were following me also, why were you following me?"
"Don't touch it! It is an amulet.
In despair, I became an apprentice of the woodcutters, but I was not strong enough; I had more of an inclination to become aschoolmaster; 'tis true that I did not know how to read, but that's no reason.
"It is the name of a handsome archer, who was a god," added Gringoire.
At that moment, one of her bracelets became unfastened and fell.
Thus, in order to indicate here only the principal details, while the little Red Door almost attains to thelimits of the Gothic delicacy of the fifteenth century, the pillars of the nave, by their size and weight, go back to the Carlovingian Abbey of Saint−Germain des Prés.
Each wave of time contributes its alluvium, each race deposits its layer on the monument, each individual brings his stone.
Art often undergoes a transformation while they are pending, ~pendent opera interrupta~; they proceed quietly in accordance with the transformed art.
Then, beyond the Grand, beyond the Petit−Châtelet, a first circle of walls and towers began to infringe upon the country on the two sides of the Seine.
Philip Augustus makes a new dike for it. He imprisons Paris in a circular chain of great towers, both lofty and solid.
There they plant themselves squarely, cut themselves gardens from the fields, and take their ease.
Beginning with 1367, the city spreads to such an extent into the suburbs, that a new wall becomes necessary, particularly on the right bank;
In the sixteenth, it seems to retreat visibly, and to bury itself deeper and deeper in the old city, so thick had the new city already become outside of it.
The Town, which was the largest of the three fragments of Paris, held the right bank.
A large, deep moat, with a brisk current during the high water of winter, bathed the base of the wall round Paris; the Seine furnished the water.
From a bird's−eye view, these three burgs, the City, the Town, and the University, each presented to the eye an inextricable skein of eccentrically tangled streets.
The second, which was called the Rue de la Harpe on the left bank, Rue de la Barillerié in the island, Rue Saint− Denis on the right bank, Pont Saint−Michel on one arm of the Seine, Pont au Change on the other, ran from the Porte Saint−Michel in the University, to the Porte Saint−Denis in the Town.
All the other veins of the triple city either derived their supply from them or emptied into them.
For the spectator who arrived, panting, upon that pinnacle, it was first a dazzling confusing view of roofs, chimneys, streets, bridges, places, spires, bell towers.
In front of Notre−Dame, and very near at hand, three streets opened into the cathedral square,−−a fine square, lined with ancient houses.
Then, on the right and the left, to east and west, within that wall of the City, which was yet so contracted, rose the bell towers of its one and twenty churches, of every date, of every form, of every size, from the low and wormeaten belfry of Saint−Denis du Pas (~Carcer Glaueini~) to the slender needles of Saint−Pierre aux Boeufs and Saint−Landry.
There were five or six of these mansions on the quay, from the house of Lorraine, which shared with the Bernardins the grand enclosure adjoining the Tournelle, to the Hôtel de Nesle, whose principal tower ended Paris, and whose pointed roofs were in a position, during three months of the year, to encroach, with their black triangles, upon the scarlet disk of the setting sun.
There was a great uproar of laundresses; they screamed, and talked, and sang from morning till night along the beach, and beat a great deal of linen there, just as in our day.
Unfortunately, hardly anything remains of these monuments, where Gothic art combined with so just a balance, richness and economy.
The churches (and they were numerous and splendid in the University, and they were graded there also in all the ages of architecture, from the round arches of Saint−Julian to the pointed arches of Saint−Séverin), the churches dominated the whole; and, like one harmony more in this mass of harmonies, they pierced in quick succession the multiple open work of the gables with slashed spires, with open−work bell towers, with slender pinnacles, whose line was also only a magnificent exaggeration of the acute angle of the roofs.
Beyond, the fields gleamed green; beyond, fled the roads, along which were scattered a few more suburban houses, which became more infrequent as they became more distant.
When, at length, after having contemplated the University for a long time, you turned towards the right bank, towards the Town, the character of the spectacle was abruptly altered.
These four edifices filled the space from the Rue des Nonaindières, to the abbey of the Celestins, whose spire gracefully relieved their line of gables and battlements.
Behind these palaces, extended in all directions, now broken, fenced in, battlemented like a citadel, now veiled by great trees like a Carthusian convent, the immense and multiform enclosure of that miraculous Hôtel de Saint−Pol, where the King of France possessed the means of lodging superbly two and twenty princes of the rank of the dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy, with their domestics and their suites, without counting the great lords, and the emperor when he came to view Paris, and the lions, who had their separate Hôtel at the royal Hôtel.
Beyond the Tournelles, as far as the wall of Charles V., spread out, with rich compartments of verdure and of flowers, a velvet carpet of cultivated land and royal parks, in the midst of which one recognized, by its labyrinth of trees and alleys, the famous Daedalus garden which Louis XI. had given to Coictier.
The Rues Saint−Denis and Saint−Martin, with their innumerable ramifications, rose one after the other, like trees intertwining their branches; and then the tortuous lines, the Rues de la Plâtrerie, de la Verrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., meandered over all.
Lastly, between the Rue Saint−Denis, and the Rue Montorgueil, stood the Filles−Dieu.
Finally, the fourth compartment, which stretched itself out in the agglomeration of the roofs on the right bank, and which occupied the western angle of the enclosure, and the banks of the river down stream, was a fresh cluster of palaces and Hôtels pressed close about the base of the Louvre.
This hydra of towers, giant guardian of Paris, with its four and twenty heads, always erect, with its monstrous haunches, loaded or scaled with slates, and all streaming with metallic reflections, terminated with wonderful effect the configuration of the Town towards the west.
All about an immense plain, patched with a thousand sorts of cultivated plots, sown with fine villages. On the left, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirarde, Montrouge, Gentilly, with its round tower and its square tower, etc.; on the right, twenty others, from Conflans to Ville−l'Evêque.
As for the Celtic layer, no specimens were any longer to be found, even when sinking wells.
To each of these characteristic monuments there is attached by a similarity of taste, fashion, and attitude, a certain number of houses scattered about in different quarters and which the eyes of the connoisseur easily distinguishes and furnishes with a date.
The dome of the wheat market is an English jockey cap, on a grand scale.
However, admirable as the Paris of to−day may seem to you, reconstruct the Paris of the fifteenth century, call it up before you in thought; look at the sky athwart that surprising forest of spires, towers, and belfries; spread out in the centre of the city, tear away at the point of the islands, fold at the arches of the bridges, the Seine, with its broad green and yellow expanses, more variable than the skin of a serpent; project clearly against an azure horizon the Gothic profile of this ancient Paris. Make its contour float in a winter's mist which clings to its numerous chimneys; drown it in profound night and watch the odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre labyrinth of edifices; cast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to emerge from the fog the great heads of the towers; or take that black silhouette again, enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables, and make it start out more toothed than a shark's jaw against a copper−colored western sky,−−and then compare.
I do not see why history has not transmitted to posterity the names of these four discreet and venerable damsels.
"To think that Monsieur of Reims sent this enormity to Monsieur of Paris," added la Gaultière, clasping her hands.
"It's not a wart," returned Master Robert Mistricolle, "it is an egg which contains another demon exactly similar, who bears another little egg which contains another devil, and so on."
"A fine, flaming fagot," added the old woman.
He thrust the crowd silently aside, scrutinized the "little magician," and stretched out his hand upon him.
"I adopt this child," said the priest.
Only, he imagined, for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.
Therefore, he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession.
There existed between him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy, so many magnetic affinities, so many material affinities, that he adhered to it somewhat as a tortoise adheres to its shell. The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell.
In closing, it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo.
For, in order not to make others laugh, the very moment that he found himself to be deaf, he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone.
He entered perfectly breathless into the aerial chamber of the great bell; he gazed at her a moment, devoutly and lovingly; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand, like a good horse, which is about to set out on a long journey.
After these first caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story of the tower, to begin.
However, the movement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described a wider angle, Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely, phosphoric and flaming.
At length the grand peal began; the whole tower trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit.
Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after second, to howl in his ear.
And all this came from Quasimodo.
But the little brother, like those young trees which deceive the gardener's hopes and turn obstinately to the quarter whence they receive sun and air, the little brother did not grow and did not multiply, but only put forth fine bushy and luxuriant branches on the side of laziness, ignorance, and debauchery.
What that cell contained, no one knew; but from the strand of the Terrain, at night, there was often seen to appear, disappear, and reappear at brief and regular intervals, at a little dormer window opening upon the back of the tower, a certain red, intermittent, singular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a bellows, and to proceed from a flame, rather than from a light.
However, he redoubled his severity, and had never been more exemplary.
But the insult generally passed unnoticed both by the priest and the bellringer. Quasimodo was too deaf to hear all these gracious things, and Claude was too dreamy.
This cell, with the exception, possibly, of some glass phials, relegated to a corner, and filled with a decidedly equivocal powder, which strongly resembled the alchemist's "powder of projection," presented nothing strange or mysterious.
There then ensued between the physician and the archdeacon one of those congratulatory prologues which, in accordance with custom, at that epoch preceded all conversations between learned men, and which did not prevent them from detesting each other in the most cordial manner in the world.
These words, uttered in a tone of surprise and reproach, drew upon this unknown personage the attention of the archdeacon which, to tell the truth, had not been diverted from him a single moment since the stranger had set foot across the threshold of his cell.
He seemed to meditate for a moment, and then resumed: "Gossip Tourangeau, since that is your name, turn your head, you will find my reply already written on the wall."
"Then it is not true," resumed Coictier hotly, "that gout is an internal eruption; that a wound caused by artillery is to be cured by the application of a young mouse roasted; that young blood, properly injected, restores youth to aged veins; it is not true that two and two make four, and that emprostathonos follows opistathonos."
Coictier gave a forced laugh.
"And what then, do you believe in?" exclaimed Gossip Tourangeau.
"~Dominum nostrum~," added Gossip Tourangeau, making the sign of the cross.
"No," said the archdeacon, grasping the arm of Gossip Tourangeau, and a ray of enthusiasm lighted up his gloomy eyes, "no, I do not reject science.
Don't get angry, but listen to me.
And he fell back in his armchair in a commanding and inspired attitude.
"If I had made it," replied the archdeacon, articulating his words slowly, like a man who is reflecting, "the king of France would be named Claude and not Louis."
"What am I saying?" resumed Dom Claude, with a smile of disdain. "What would the throne of France be to me when I could rebuild the empire of the Orient?"
Claude assumed the majestic and pontifical attitude of a Samuel.
You shall come when you will," he continued, turning to Tourangeau, "I will show you the little parcels of gold which remained at the bottom of Nicholas Flamel's alembic, and you shall compare them with the gold of Guillaume de Paris.
The archdeacon gazed at the gigantic edifice for some time in silence, then extending his right hand, with a sigh, towards the printed book which lay open on the table, and his left towards Notre−Dame, and turning a sad glance from the book to the church,−−"Alas," he said, "this will kill that."
"You have said it," replied Claude, who seemed absorbed in a profound meditation, and stood resting, his forefinger bent backward on the folio which had come from the famous press of Nuremberg.
The archdeacon returned to his chamber dumbfounded, comprehending at last who Gossip Tourangeau was, and recalling that passage of the register of Sainte−Martin, of Tours:−− ~Abbas beati Martini, SCILICET REX FRANCIAE, est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam proebendam quam habet sanctus Venantius, et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii~.
In this connection the archdeacon's vague formula had a second sense. It meant, "Printing will kill architecture."
Architecture began like all writing. It was first an alphabet.
Traditions had brought forth symbols, beneath which they disappeared like the trunk of a tree beneath its foliage; all these symbols in which humanity placed faith continued to grow, to multiply, to intersect, to become more and more complicated; the first monuments no longer sufficed to contain them, they were overflowing in every part; these monuments hardly expressed now the primitive tradition, simple like themselves, naked and prone upon the earth.
Then architecture was developed in proportion with human thought; it became a giant with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, and fixed all this floating symbolism in an eternal, visible, palpable form.
Let us take as an example the Middle Ages, where we see more clearly because it is nearer to us.
But the Crusades arrive.
Each race writes its line upon the book, as it passes; it erases the ancient Romanesque hieroglyphs on the frontispieces of cathedrals, and at the most one only sees dogma cropping out here and there, beneath the new symbol which it has deposited.
Having thus only this resource, masonry, in order to make its way to the light, flung itself upon it from all quarters.
All the material forces, all the intellectual forces of society converged towards the same point: architecture.
Genius, scattered in the masses, repressed in every quarter under feudalism as under a ~testudo~ of brazen bucklers, finding no issue except in the direction of architecture,−−gushed forth through that art, and its Iliads assumed the form of cathedrals.
Between theocratic architecture and this there is the difference that lies between a sacred language and a vulgar language, between hieroglyphics and art, between Solomon and Phidias.
Now it converts itself into a flock of birds, scatters itself to the four winds, and occupies all points of air and space at once.
It passes from duration in time to immortality.
The chill is almost imperceptible in the fifteenth century; the press is, as yet, too weak, and, at the most, draws from powerful architecture a superabundance of life.
But practically beginning with the sixteenth century, the malady of architecture is visible; it is no longer the expression of society; it becomes classic art in a miserable manner; from being Gallic, European, indigenous, it becomes Greek and Roman; from being true and modern, it becomes pseudo−classic.
So they emancipate themselves, break the yoke of the architect, and take themselves off, each one in its own direction.
Take away the press; heresy is enervated.
It no longer expresses anything, not even the memory of the art of another time.
All the life which is leaving architecture comes to it.
That capital of forces which human thought had been expending in edifices, it henceforth expends in books.
In the nineteenth, it begins to reconstruct.
The press, that giant machine, which incessantly pumps all the intellectual sap of society, belches forth without pause fresh materials for its work.
The humblest fills his hole, or places his stone.
The same day on which Robert d'Estouteville took the place of Jacques de Villiers in the provostship of Paris, Master Jehan Dauvet replaced Messire Helye de Thorrettes in the first presidency of the Court of Parliament, Jehan Jouvenel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers in the office of chancellor of France, Regnault des Dormans ousted Pierre Puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the king's household.
His lieutenants, civil, criminal, and private, were doing his work, according to usage; and from eight o'clock in the morning, some scores of bourgeois and ~bourgeoises~, heaped and crowded into an obscure corner of the audience chamber of Embas du Châtelet, between a stout oaken barrier and the wall, had been gazing blissfully at the varied and cheerful spectacle of civil and criminal justice dispensed by Master Florian Barbedienne, auditor of the Châtelet, lieutenant of monsieur the provost, in a somewhat confused and utterly haphazard manner.
Good! Another amorous woman!
Hence he took great care to conceal his deafness from the eyes of all, and he generally succeeded so well that he had reached the point of deluding himself, which is, by the way, easier than is supposed.
All hunchbacks walk with their heads held high, all stutterers harangue, all deaf people speak low.
Now this was a case which had not been "provided for by law," where a deaf man should be obliged to question a deaf man.
Quasimodo, whom nothing warned that a question had been addressed to him, continued to stare intently at the judge, and made no reply.
The judge, being deaf, and being in no way warned of the deafness of the accused, thought that the latter had answered, as all accused do in general, and therefore he pursued, with his mechanical and stupid self−possession,−−
"That will do," went on the imperturbable auditor, when he supposed that the accused had finished his third reply. "You are accused before us, ~primo~, of nocturnal disturbance; ~secundo~, of a dishonorable act of violence upon the person of a foolish woman, ~in proejudicium meretricis; tertio~, of rebellion and disloyalty towards the archers of the police of our lord, the king.
Quasimodo turned round, shrugging his hump with disdain, while Master Florian, equally astonished, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators had been provoked by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered visible to him by that shrug of the shoulders, apostrophized him indignantly,−−"You have uttered a reply, knave, which deserves the halter.
And he seated himself, utterly breathless, wiping away the great drops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched, like tears, the parchments spread out before him.
"I believe the knave said '~Ventre Dieu~' Clerk, add twelve deniers Parisian for the oath, and let the vestry of Saint Eustache have the half of it; I have a particular devotion for Saint Eustache."
One went straight to the point then, and at the end of every path there was immediately visible, without thickets and without turnings; the wheel, the gibbet, or the pillory.
Quasimodo gazed on the whole with an indifferent and astonished air.
A goodly number of bourgeois are "sauntering," as we say, here and there, turning over with their feet the extinct brands of the bonfire, going into raptures in front of the Pillar House, over the memory of the fine hangings of the day before, and to−day staring at the nails that secured them a last pleasure.
The merchants converse and call to each other from the thresholds of their shops.
It took the thing in the block, honored, venerated, hallowed the sacrifice at need, but did not analyze the sufferings, and felt but moderate pity for them.
Everything was then viewed without metaphysics, without exaggeration, without magnifying glass, with the naked eye.
At that time every edifice was a thought.
Fortunately, that discreet damoiselle, Oudarde Musnier, turned the conversation in time.
"Yes," said Mahiette. "He has the eye of a Saturn."
Eh, be quick, Mahiette! redouble your pace and drag along your boy.
Come, Eustache!" And she set out on a run along the quay towards the Grève, until she had left the bridge far behind her.
Oudarde and Gervaise rejoined her.
The old father died when Paquette was still a mere child; she had then no one but her mother, the sister of M. Pradon, master−brazier and coppersmith in Paris, Rue Farm− Garlin, who died last year.
The mother was a good simple woman, unfortunately, and she taught Paquette nothing but a bit of embroidery and toy−making which did not prevent the little one from growing very large and remaining very poor.
She and her mother earned a precarious living; they had been very destitute since the death of the minstrel; their embroidery did not bring them in more than six farthings a week, which does not amount to quite two eagle liards.
Where were the days when Father Guybertant had earned twelve sous parisian, in a single coronation, with a song?
First it was the young Vicomte de Cormontreuil, who has his bell tower three leagues distant from Reims; then Messire Henri de Triancourt, equerry to the King; then less than that, Chiart de Beaulion, sergeant−at−arms; then, still descending, Guery Aubergeon, carver to the King; then, Mace de Frépus, barber to monsieur the dauphin; then, Thévenin le Moine, King's cook; then, the men growing continually younger and less noble, she fell to Guillaume Racine, minstrel of the hurdy gurdy and to Thierry de Mer, lamplighter.
Mahiette sighed, and wiped away a tear which trickled from her eyes.
"Patience!" resumed Mahiette, "you will see one child.−−In '66, 'twill be sixteen years ago this month, at Sainte− Paule's day, Paquette was brought to bed of a little girl.
Folly began to bring her in no more than her trade of embroidery in former days; for every wrinkle that came, a crown fled; winter became hard to her once more, wood became rare again in her brazier, and bread in her cupboard.
Gallantry claimed her once more; men came to see la Chantefleurie; she found customers again for her merchandise, and out of all these horrors she made baby clothes, caps and bibs, bodices with shoulder−straps of lace, and tiny bonnets of satin, without even thinking of buying herself another coverlet.−−Master Eustache, I have already told you not to eat that cake.−−It is certain that little Agnes, that was the child's name, a baptismal name, for it was a long time since la Chantefleurie had had any surname−−it is certain that that little one was more swathed in ribbons and embroideries than a dauphiness of Dauphiny!
She kissed her, caressed her, tickled her, washed her, decked her out,devoured her!
She put them into the tiny shoes, took them out, admired them, marvelled at them, looked at the light through them, was curious to see them try to walk on her bed, and would gladly have passed her life on her knees, putting on and taking off the shoes from those feet, as though they had been those of an Infant Jesus."
She already lisped a little, laughed at her mother like a little mad thing, was plump and quite round, and possessed a thousand charming little gestures of the angels of paradise.
So she returned to her attic in the Rue Folle−Peine, very proud of bearing with her a queen.
She flew out of the room, dashed down the stairs, and began to beat her head against the wall, crying: 'My child! who has my child?
She was breathless, dishevelled, frightful to see, and there was a fire in her eyes which dried her tears. She stopped the passers−by and cried: 'My daughter! my daughter! my pretty little daughter!
If any one will give me back my daughter, I will he his servant, the servant of his dog, and he shall eat my heart if he will.'
In the evening she returned home.
The mother, burst into shrieks of laughter, ascended the stairs as though on wings, and entered.−−A frightful thing to tell, Oudarde!
Suddenly she trembled all over, covered her relic with furious kisses, and burst out sobbing as though her heart were broken.
"Who certainly," added Gervaise, "have teeth long enough to eat little children.
Nevertheless, there were people of the Cabaret les Vantes, who said that they had seen her pass along the road to Paris, walking on the pebbles with her bare feet.
In their absorption, they had passed the public breviary of the Tour−Roland without stopping, and took their way mechanically towards the pillory around which the throng was growing more dense with every moment.
The three women retraced their steps, and, on arriving in the vicinity of the Tour−Roland, Oudarde said to the other two,−−
She proceeded alone to the window.
At the moment when she looked in, a profound pity was depicted on all her features, and her frank, gay visage altered its expression and color as abruptly as though it had passed from a ray of sunlight to a ray of moonlight; her eye became humid; her mouth contracted, like that of a person on the point of weeping.
A long shiver traversed her frame from head to foot; her teeth chattered; she half raised her head and said, pressing her elbows against her hips, and clasping her feet in her hands as though to warm them,−−
"Well," resumed Oudarde, presenting her with a flagon; "here is some hippocras which will warm you; drink it."
Again she shook her head, looked at Oudarde fixedly and replied, "Water." Oudarde persisted,−−"No, sister, that is no beverage for January.
She refused the cake which Mahiette offered to her, and said, "Black bread."
She refused the cloak as she had refused the flagon and the cake, and replied, "A sack."
Then she fell face downward on the earth, and her forehead struck the stone, with the sound of one stone against another stone.
"Wait," said she. Then bending towards the window, "Paquette!" she said, "Paquette le Chantefleurie!"
Her brow contracted with horror, she stretched her two skeleton arms from her cell, and shrieked in a voice which resembled a death−rattle, "So 'tis thou once more, daughter of Egypt!
The victim finally arrived, bound to the tail of a cart, and when he had been hoisted upon the platform, where he could be seen from all points of the Place, bound with cords and straps upon the wheel of the pillory, a prodigious hoot, mingled with laughter and acclamations, burst forth upon the Place.
Soon Michel Noiret, sworn trumpeter to the king, our lord, imposed silence on the louts, and proclaimed the sentence, in accordance with the order and command of monsieur the provost.
Then he withdrew behind the cart, with his men in livery surcoats.
All resistance had been rendered impossible to him by what was then called, in the style of the criminal chancellery, "the vehemence and firmness of the bonds" which means that the thongs and chains probably cut into his flesh; moreover, it is a tradition of jail and wardens, which has not been lost, and which the handcuffs still preciously preserve among us, a civilized, gentle, humane people (the galleys and the guillotine in parentheses).
They removed his shirt and doublet as far as his girdle; he allowed them to have their way.
He began by depositing on an angle of the pillory a black hour−glass, the upper lobe of which was filled with red sand, which it allowed to glide into the lower receptacle; then he removed his parti−colored surtout, and there became visible, suspended from his right hand, a thin and tapering whip of long, white, shining, knotted, plaited thongs, armed with metal nails.
And the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.
At length the torturer stamped his foot.
All at once, at the moment when the wheel in its revolution presented to Master Pierrat, the humped back of Quasimodo, Master Pierrat raised his arm; the fine thongs whistled sharply through the air, like a handful of adders, and fell with fury upon the wretch's shoulders.
Quasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start.
He writhed in his bonds; a violent contraction of surprise and pain distorted the muscles of his face, but he uttered not a single sigh.
He merely turned his head backward, to the right, then to the left, balancing it as a bull does who has been stung in the flanks by a gadfly.
Soon the blood burst forth, and could be seen trickling in a thousand threads down the hunchback's black shoulders; and the slender thongs, in their rotatory motion which rent the air, sprinkled drops of it upon the crowd.
At length a bailiff from the Châtelet clad in black, mounted on a black horse, who had been stationed beside the ladder since the beginning of the execution, extended his ebony wand towards the hour−glass.
Two lackeys of the official torturer bathed the bleeding shoulders of the patient, anointed them with some unguent which immediately closed all the wounds, and threw upon his back a sort of yellow vestment, in cut like a chasuble.
So the hour−glass was turned over once more, and they left the hunchback fastened to the plank, in order that justice might be accomplished to the very end.
Here, as in the Grand Hall, the women rendered themselves particularly prominent.
"This is the grimace of the pillory. When shall we have that of the gibbet?"
All this only increased the derision and hooting.
But wrath, hatred, despair, slowly lowered over that hideous visage a cloud which grew ever more and more sombre, ever more and more charged with electricity, which burst forth in a thousand lightning flashes from the eye of the cyclops.
Nevertheless, that cloud cleared away for a moment, at the passage of a mule which traversed the crowd, bearing a priest.
And all began to laugh.
A young girl, fantastically dressed, emerged from the throng.
Wrath and spite suffocate him.
She approached, without uttering a syllable, the victim who writhed in a vain effort to escape her, and detaching a gourd from her girdle, she raised it gently to the parched lips of the miserable man.
But the young girl, who was, perhaps, somewhat distrustful, and who remembered the violent attempt of the night, withdrew her hand with the frightened gesture of a child who is afraid of being bitten by a beast.
The very populace were captivated by it, and began to clap their hands, crying,−− "Noel! Noel!"
It was at that moment that the recluse caught sight, from the window of her bole, of the gypsy on the pillory, and hurled at her her sinister imprecation,−−
His whole air was expressive of constraint and weariness, which our lieutenants of the garrison would to−day translate admirably as, "What a beastly bore!"
Can one be more white and blonde? are not her hands perfect? and that neck−−does it not assume all the curves of the swan in ravishing fashion?
"But do say something," said Madame Aloise, suddenly giving his shoulder a push; "you have grown very timid."
Fleur−de−Lys raised her beautiful eyes, full of reproach, "Is that all of which you can assure me?" she said, in a low voice.
The captain, more and more embarrassed, fell back upon the subject of the tapestry,−−"'Tis, in sooth, a charming work!" he exclaimed.
"And where there is that big, old tower of the ancient wall of Paris," added Amelotte de Montmichel, a pretty fresh and curly−headed brunette, who had a habit of sighing just as the other laughed, without knowing why.
"Some gypsy from Bohemia," said Fleur−de−Lys, turning carelessly toward the square.
"Look! look!" exclaimed her lively companions; and they all ran to the edge of the balcony, while Fleur−de−Lys, rendered thoughtful by the coldness of her betrothed, followed them slowly, and the latter, relieved by this incident, which put an end to an embarrassing conversation, retreated to the farther end of the room, with the satisfied air of a soldier released from duty.
A man was, in truth, leaning on the balustrade which surmounted the northern tower, looking on the Grève.
"'Tis a great shame for that man to look upon her thus," added Amelotte de Montmichel, "for she dances delightfully."
She turned her head towards the point whence this call proceeded, her brilliant eyes rested on Phoebus, and she stopped short.
The young girl looked at him again, then she blushed as though a flame had mounted into her cheeks, and, taking her tambourine under her arm, she made her way through the astonished spectators towards the door of the house where Phoebus was calling her, with slow, tottering steps, and with the troubled look of a bird which is yielding to the fascination of a serpent.
They surveyed her from head to foot, then exchanged glances, and all was said; they understood each other.
The gypsy advanced towards the noble dame.
"Fair child," said Phoebus, with emphasis, taking several steps towards her, "I do not know whether I have the supreme honor of being recognized by you."
I have been told that by birth he is the bastard of an archdeacon and a devil.
The name of some festival when the bells are pealed! So he took the liberty of carrying you off, as though you were made for beadles!
The captain burst out laughing. "Corne−de−boeuf! here's pity as well placed as a feather in a pig's tail!
"He talks to that creature in her own tongue!" added Fleur−de−Lys, in a low tone, her irritation increasing every moment.
Not being able to impugn her beauty, they attacked her costume.
"That petticoat is so short that it makes one tremble," added la Gaillefontaine.
"My dear," continued Fleur−de−Lys, with decided sharpness, "You will get yourself taken up by the sumptuary police for your gilded girdle."
It was, in truth, a spectacle worthy of a more intelligent spectator than Phoebus, to see how these beautiful maidens, with their envenomed and angry tongues, wound, serpent−like, and glided and writhed around the street dancer. They were cruel and graceful; they searched and rummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and tinsel.
Sarcasms rained down upon the gypsy, and haughty condescension and malevolent looks.
"Good gracious!" exclaimed the blonde Gaillefontaine, drawing up her swan−like throat, with a bitter smile. "I see that messieurs the archers of the king's police easily take fire at the handsome eyes of gypsies!"
The gypsy crouched down on her knees and leaned her cheek against the fondling head of the goat.
Meanwhile, the good dame had risen angrily,−−" Come now, gypsy, if neither you nor your goat can dance for us, what are you doing here?" The gypsy walked slowly towards the door, without making any reply.
"True God!" exclaimed the captain, "that's not the way to depart.
Come back and dance something for us.
Then, bursting into sobs: "Oh!" she stammered mournfully, hiding her face in both her beautiful hands, "she is a magician!" And she heard another and a still more bitter voice at the bottom of her heart, saying,−− "She is a rival!"
In a twinkling, La Esmeralda gathered up the unlucky letters, made a sign to Djali, and went out through one door, while Fleur−de−Lys was being carried out through the other.
Every day, an hour before sunset, the archdeacon ascended the staircase to the tower, and shut himself up in this cell, where he sometimes passed whole nights.
The crowd was swarming around her; from time to time, a man accoutred in red and yellow made them form into a circle, and then returned, seated himself on a chair a few paces from the dancer, and took the goat's head on his knees.
Only the great rose window of the façade, whose thousand colors were steeped in a ray of horizontal sunlight, glittered in the gloom like a mass of diamonds, and threw its dazzling reflection to the other end of the nave.
When they had advanced a few paces, Dom Claude placed his back against a pillar, and gazed intently at Gringoire.
This garment presented itself, I took it, and I left my ancient black smock, which, for a hermetic like myself, was far from being hermetically closed.
All at once his deep−set eye assumed so sagacious and penetrating an expression, that Gringoire felt himself, so to speak, searched to the bottom of the soul by that glance.
Every morning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the gypsy; he helped her make her collections of targes* and little blanks** in the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her, allowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep ofthe just. A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery.
"What concern is it of yours?"
One would have said that there was no longer a musician in the belfry.
He went and came, he beat his hands together, he ran from rope to rope, he animated the six singers with voice and gesture, like the leader of an orchestra who is urging on intelligent musicians.
"Go on," said he, "go on, go on, Gabrielle, pour out all thy noise into the Place, 'tis a festival to−day.
This sight suddenly changed the course of his ideas, and congealed his enthusiasm as a breath of air congeals melted rosin.
He halted, turned his back to the bells, and crouched down behind the projecting roof of slate, fixing upon the dancer that dreamy, sweet, and tender look which had already astonished the archdeacon on one occasion.
He dressed himself sadly.
Then he hastily donned his long jacket with furred half− sleeves, picked up his cap, and went out like a man driven to desperation.
He descended the Rue de la Harpe toward the City.
As he passed the Rue de la Huchette, the odor of those admirable spits, which were incessantly turning, tickled his olfactory apparatus, and he bestowed a loving glance toward the Cyclopean roast, which one day drew from the Franciscan friar, Calatagirone, this pathetic exclamation: ~Veramente, queste rotisserie sono cosa stupenda~!* But Jehan had not the wherewithal to buy a breakfast, and he plunged, with a profound sigh, under the gateway of the Petit−Châtelet, that enormous double trefoil of massive towers which guarded the entrance to the City.
Then indecision seized upon him once more, and he paced for several minutes round the statue of M. Legris, repeating to himself with anguish: "The sermon is sure, the crown is doubtful."
He stopped a beadle who emerged from the cloister,−−"Where is monsieur the archdeacon of Josas?"
Jehan clapped his hands.
On arriving at the gallery of slender columns, he took breath for a moment, and swore against the interminable staircase by I know not how many million cartloads of devils; then he resumed his ascent through the narrow door of the north tower, now closed to the public.
The key was in the lock, the door was very close to him; he gave it a gentle push and thrust his head through the opening.
It represents a gloomy cell; in the centre is a table loaded with hideous objects; skulls, spheres, alembics, compasses, hieroglyphic parchments.
Something very similar to Faust's cell presented itself to Jehan's view, when he ventured his head through the half− open door.
At the point where these currents intersect each other in the heavens, they produce light; at their points of intersection on earth, they produce gold.
But what is one to do in order to extract from science the secret of this general law?
"Others have thought," continued the dreamy archdeacon, "that it would be better worth while to operate upon a ray of Sirius.
And he closed the book violently.
"Hence," continued the priest, "one wretched thought is sufficient to render a man weak and beside himself!
"Let us see, let us try!" resumed the archdeacon briskly. "Were I to succeed, I should behold the blue spark flash from the head of the nail.
Suddenly, Dom Claude sprang up, seized a compass and engraved in silence upon the wall in capital letters, this Greek word
"My brother is mad," said Jehan to himself; "it would have been far more simple to write ~Fatum~, every one is not obliged to know Greek."
Seeing that the archdeacon had fallen back into his former immobility, he withdrew his head very softly, and made some noise with his feet outside the door, like a person who has just arrived and is giving warning of his approach.
"Jehan, complaints are brought me about you every day.
"Who," pursued the archdeacon, "is that Mahiet Fargel, whose gown you have torn? ~Tunicam dechiraverunt~, saith the complaint."
"Yes," pursued the priest shaking his head, "that is the state of learning and letters at the present day.
The scholar raised his eyes boldly. "Monsieur my brother, doth it please you that I shall explain in good French vernacular that Greek word which is written yonder on the wall?"
"Well, in point of fact, this!" replied Jehan bravely, "I stand in need of money." At this audacious declaration, the archdeacon's visage assumed a thoroughly pedagogical and paternal expression.
"You know that the official has decided that our twenty−one houses should he moved full into the fief of the Bishopric, and that we could redeem this homage only by paying the reverend bishop two marks of silver gilt of the price of six livres parisis.
He resumed his dainty, caressing air.
"And then," pursued the sagacious Claude, "what sort of an infant's outfit is it that is to cost three forms, and that for the child of a Haudriette? Since when have the Haudriette widows taken to having babes in swaddling−clothes?"
"Young man," resumed the archdeacon, "at the king's last entry, there was a young gentleman, named Philippe de Comines, who wore embroidered on the housings of his horse this device, upon which I counsel you to meditate: ~Qui non laborat, non manducet~."
All at once he turned round to Claude with the agile quickness of a wagtail.
"What indeed!" said the scholar; and he lifted to Claude his impudent eyes into which he had just thrust his fists in order to communicate to them the redness of tears; "'tis Greek! 'tis an anapaest of AEschylus which expresses grief perfectly." And here he burst into a laugh so droll and violent that it made the archdeacon smile.
"Oh! good Brother Claude," resumed Jehan, emboldened by this smile, "look at my worn out boots. Is there a cothurnus in the world more tragic than these boots, whose soles are hanging out their tongues?"
"Only a poor little parisis, brother," continued the suppliant Jehan. "I will learn Gratian by heart, I will believe firmly in God, I will be a regular Pythagoras of science and virtue.
The archdeacon surveyed him with a gloomy air.
"Oh, come now," cried the student, gazing in turn at his brother and the alembics on the furnace, "everything is preposterous here, both ideas and bottles!"
Listen, Jehan," he added, in a low voice; "have a care never to speak of what you shall have seen or heard here.
The scholar concealed himself; just then a happy idea occurred to him.
"Take it, then!" said the archdeacon angrily, flinging his purse at him.
When Jehan saw that it was only this, that is to say, no doubt a physician or a magistrate, and that this man had a nose very far from his mouth, a sign of stupidity, he nestled down in his hole, in despair at being obliged to pass an indefinite time in such an uncomfortable attitude, and in such bad company.
"I will tell you that hereafter," he stammered, in a voice that was barely articulate; then he resumed with an effort, "Busy yourself with Marc Cenaine."
He turned to Charmolue,−−
On the agitation of his web, the enormous spider made an abrupt move from his central cell, then with one bound, rushed upon the fly, which he folded together with his fore antennae, while his hideous proboscis dug into the victim's bead. "Poor fly!" said the king's procurator in the ecclesiastical court; and he raised his hand to save it.
The archdeacon, as though roused with a start, withheld his arm with convulsive violence.
"Oh, yes!" continued the priest, in a voice which seemed to proceed from the depths of his being, "behold here a symbol of all.
She flies, she is joyous, she is just born; she seeks the spring, the open air, liberty: oh, yes! but let her come in contact with the fatal network, and the spider issues from it, the hideous spider!
But release my arm, master, for pity's sake!
"Oh, madman!" he went on, without removing his gaze from the window. "And even couldst thou have broken through that formidable web, with thy gnat's wings, thou believest that thou couldst have reached the light?
"~Te Deum Laudamus~!" exclaimed Master Jehan, creeping out from his hole, "the screech−owls have departed.
He cast a glance of tenderness and admiration into the interior of the precious pouch, readjusted his toilet, rubbed up his boots, dusted his poor half sleeves, all gray with ashes, whistled an air, indulged in a sportive pirouette, looked about to see whether there were not something more in the cell to take, gathered up here and there on the furnace some amulet in glass which might serve to bestow, in the guise of a trinket, on Isabeau la Thierrye, finally pushed open the door which his brother had left unfastened, as a last indulgence, and which he, in his turn, left open as a last piece of malice, and descended the circular staircase, skipping like a bird.
In the midst of the gloom of the spiral staircase, he elbowed something which drew aside with a growl; he took it for granted that it was Quasimodo, and it struck him as so droll that he descended the remainder of the staircase holding his sides with laughter.
He stamped his foot when he found himself on the ground once again. "Oh!" said he, "good and honorable pavement of Paris, cursed staircase, fit to put the angels of Jacob's ladder out of breath!
He advanced a few paces, and caught sight of the two screech owls, that is to say, Dom Claude and Master Jacques Charmolue, absorbed in contemplation before a carving on the façade.
Job represents the philosopher's stone, which must also be tried and martyrized in order to become perfect, as saith Raymond Lulle: ~Sub conservatione formoe speciftoe salva anima~."
Dom Claude started, interrupted himself and, to the great amazement of Charmolue, turned round and beheld his brother Jehan accosting a tall officer at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.
"Pardon me, good comrade Jehan," exclaimed Phoebus, shaking his hand, "a horse going at a gallop cannot halt short.
And without adding another word, he emptied the purse on a neighboring post, with the air of a Roman saving his country.
The archdeacon followed them, gloomy and haggard.
Moreover, nothing was easier than to hear everything they said, as they talked loudly, not in the least concerned that the passers−by were taken into their confidence.
Here the archdeacon saw Phoebus sneer, bend down to Jehan's ear, and say a few words to him in a low voice; then Phoebus burst into a laugh, and shook his head with a triumphant air.
"Captain Phoebus, you are a happy gendarme!" The archdeacon heard the whole of this conversation.
He halted for a moment, leaned against a post like a drunken man, then followed the two merry knaves.
Through the mist which the warmth of the room spread over the window in front, a hundred confused figures could be seen swarming, and from time to time a burst of noisy laughter broke forth from it.
Nevertheless, one man paced imperturbably back and forth in front of the tavern, gazing at it incessantly, and going no further from it than a pikernan from his sentry−box.
From time to time he paused in front of the dim window with its leaden lattice, listened, looked, and stamped his foot.
"I tell you," repeated his companion, with a thick tongue, "that I don't live in the Rue des Mauvaises Paroles, ~indignus qui inter mala verba habitat~.
By listening to them attentively, the man in the mantle could catch in its entirety the following interesting conversation,−−
Tell me, Jehan of the devil! have you any money left?
The captain adjusted Jehan's head upon an inclined plane of cabbage−stumps, and on the very instant, the scholar fell to snoring in a magnificent bass.
Meanwhile, all malice was not extinguished in the captain's heart. "So much the worse if the devil's cart picks you up on its passage!" he said to the poor, sleeping clerk; and he strode off.
The man in the mantle, who had not ceased to follow him, halted for a moment before the prostrate scholar, as though agitated by indecision; then, uttering a profound sigh, he also strode off in pursuit of the captain.
The hand of the shadow emerged from beneath its mantle and descended upon the arm of Phoebus with the grip of an eagle's talon; at the same time the shadow spoke,−−
"I know not your name alone," continued the man in the mantle, with his sepulchral voice. "You have a rendezvous this evening."
"Captain," pursued the man, "to−morrow, the day after to−morrow, a month hence, ten years hence, you will find me ready to cut your throat; but go first to your rendezvous."
Phoebus halted before a low door, and knocked roughly; a light made its appearance through the cracks of the door.
While her back was turned, the bushy−headed and ragged little boy who was playing in the ashes, adroitly approached the drawer, abstracted the crown, and put in its place a dry leaf which he had plucked from a fagot.
Claude Frollo (for we presume that the reader, more intelligent than Phoebus, has seen in this whole adventure no other surly monk than the archdeacon), Claude Frollo groped about for several moments in the dark lair into which the captain had bolted him.
What was taking place at that moment in the gloomy soul of the archdeacon? God and himself could alone know.
The cat−faced old crone was the first to emerge from the trap−door, lamp in hand; then Phoebus, twirling his moustache, then a third person, that beautiful and graceful figure, la Esmeralda.
Mechanically, and with a charmingly unconscious gesture, she traced with the tip of her finger incoherent lines on the bench, and watched her finger.
It is a perpetual "I love you." A musical phrase which is very insipid and very bald for indifferent listeners, when it is not ornamented with some ~fioriture~; but Claude was not an indifferent listener.)
The young girl looked at him in affright: "Hate me! what have I done?"
"Phoebus," continued the Bohemian, gently releasing her waist from the captain's tenacious hands, "You are good, you are generous, you are handsome; you saved me, me who am only a poor child lost in Bohemia.
Pray walk a little, that I may see you at full height, and that I may hear your spurs jingle.
The captain rose to please her, chiding her with a smile of satisfaction,−−
Phoebus returned and seated himself beside her, but much closer than before.
"Do I love thee, angel of my life!" exclaimed the captain, half kneeling. "My body, my blood, my soul, all are thine; all are for thee.
"Die!" exclaimed the amorous captain, "What are you saying, my lovely angel?
Die at the beginning of so sweet a thing! ~Corne−de−boeuf~, what a jest!
Listen then, my dear Similar; I adore you passionately.
Suddenly she turned towards him,−−
"My religion!" exclaimed the captain, bursting with laughter, "I instruct you in my religion! ~Corne et tonnerre~!
The captain's face assumed an expression of mingled surprise and disdain, of carelessness and libertine passion.
"My beautiful love," resumed Phoebus, tenderly, "what nonsense is this?
While speaking thus in his softest voice, he approached extremely near the gypsy; his caressing hands resumed their place around her supple and delicate waist, his eye flashed more and more, and everything announced that Monsieur Phoebus was on the verge of one of those moments when Jupiter himself commits so many follies that Homer is obliged to summon a cloud to his rescue.
Oh, take me! take all! do what you will with me, I am thine.
So saying, she threw her arms round the officer's neck; she looked up at him, supplicatingly, with a beautiful smile, and all in tears.
When she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain, bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,
The scholar went his way, and Gringoire set out to follow the crowd which was mounting the staircase of the great chamber.
The populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence.
After a slow and tiresome march through a long, gloomy corridor, which wound through the court−house like the intestinal canal of the ancient edifice, he arrived near a low door, opening upon a hall which his lofty stature permitted him to survey with a glance over the waving heads of the rabble.
"Monsieur," Gringoire inquired of one of his neighbors, "who are all those persons ranged yonder, like prelates in council?"
You cannot see her. She has her back turned to us, and she is hidden from us by the crowd.
The officer, who was as handsome as a great lord, goes down stairs again with me.
The girl does not concern me, but the goat!
A bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile, who made a doleful shake of the head, and passed it on to the president, who gave it to the procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, and thus it made the circuit of the hail.
"You have the documents, gentlemen," added the king's advocate, as he took his seat; "you can consult the testimony of Phoebus de Châteaupers."
She was pale; her tresses, formerly so gracefully braided and spangled with sequins, hung in disorder; her lips were blue, her hollow eyes were terrible.
The unhappy girl fell back on her criminal's seat, speechless, tearless, white as a wax figure.
The president bent down to a man at his feet, who wore a gold cap and a black gown, a chain on his neck and a wand in his hand.
The elegant beast halted for a moment on the threshold, stretching out its neck as though, perched on the summit of a rock, it had before its eyes an immense horizon.
Sometimes, they went even further than animals.
Meanwhile the procurator had exclaimed: "If the demon which possesses this goat, and which has resisted all exorcisms, persists in its deeds of witchcraft, if it alarms the court with them, we warn it that we shall be forced to put in requisition against it the gallows or the stake. Gringoire broke out into a cold perspiration.
The goat looked at it with an intelligent eye, raised its gilded hoof, and struck seven blows.
Master Jacques Charmolue interposed sweetly,−− "In view of the sad obstinacy of the accused, I demand the application of the torture."
This chamber, circular in form, occupied the ground floor of one of those great towers, which, even in our own century, still pierce through the layer of modern edifices with which modern Paris has covered ancient Paris.
His underlings, two gnomes with square faces, leather aprons, and linen breeches, were moving the iron instruments on the coals.
The sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side, the priests of the officiality on the other.
That leather bed on which so many unhappy wretches had writhed, frightened her.
She cast a frightened look around the chamber.
"Mademoiselle," resumed the caressing voice of the procucrator of the Ecclesiastical court, "for the third time, do you persist in denying the deeds of which you are accused?"
"Take that off!" she cried angrily; and drawing herself up, with her hair all dishevelled: "Mercy!" She darted from the bed to fling herself at the feet of the king's procurator, but her leg was fast in the heavy block of oak and iron, and she sank down upon the boot, more crushed than a bee with a lump of lead on its wing.
"For the last time, do you confess the facts in the case?" demanded Charmolue, with his imperturbable benignity.
Pierrat turned the handle of the screw−jack, the boot was contracted, and the unhappy girl uttered one of those horrible cries which have no orthography in any human language.
And she fell back upon the leather bed, dying, doubled up, allowing herself to hang suspended from the strap buckled round her waist.
"Come, fair one, hold up a little," said Master Pierrat, raising her. "You have the air of the lamb of the Golden Fleece which hangs from Monsieur de Bourgogne's neck."
Young Bohemian maid, you confess your participation in the feasts, witches' sabbaths, and witchcrafts of hell, with ghosts, hags, and vampires?
And, addressing the torturers, "Release the prisoner, and take her back to the court."
A few apathetic faces of judges alone could be dimly discerned.
When Charmolue had installed himself in a magisterial manner in his own, he seated himself, then rose and said, without exhibiting too much self−complacency at his success,−−"The accused has confessed all."
Master Charmolue exhibited an alarming note book, and began to read, with many gestures and the exaggerated accentuation of the pleader, an oration in Latin, wherein all the proofs of the suit were piled up in Ciceronian periphrases, flanked with quotations from Plautus, his favorite comic author.
The orator pronounced it with marvellous action.
All at once, in the middle of a fine period, he interrupted himself, and his glance, ordinarily so gentle and even stupid, became menacing.
So saying, he pointed to the little goat, who, on seeing Charmolue gesticulating, had, in point of fact, thought it appropriate to do the same, and had seated himself on his haunches, reproducing to the best of his ability, with his forepaws and his bearded head the pathetic pantomine of the king's procurator in the ecclesiastical court.
This incident, this last proof, produced a great effect.
The goat's hoofs were tied, and the king's procurator resumed the thread of his eloquence.
He put on his cap again and seated himself.
A miserable human existence, once interred there; farewell light, air, life, ~ogni speranza~−−every hope; it only came forth to the scaffold or the stake.
Cold as night, cold as death, not a breath of air in her tresses, not a human sound in her ear, no longer a ray of light in her eyes; snapped in twain, crushed with chains, crouching beside a jug and a loaf, on a little straw, in a pool of water, which was formed under her by the sweating of the prison walls; without motion, almost without breath, she had no longer the power to suffer; Phoebus, the sun, midday, the open air, the streets of Paris, the dances with applause, the sweet babblings of love with the officer; then the priest, the old crone, the poignard, the blood, the torture, the gibbet; all this did, indeed, pass before her mind, sometimes as a charming and golden vision, sometimes as a hideous nightmare; but it was no longer anything but a vague and horrible struggle, lost in the gloom, or distant music played up above ground, and which was no longer audible at the depth where the unhappy girl had fallen.
A monk's black cloak fell to his feet, a cowl of the same color concealed his face.
The priest continued, in a hollow voice,−− "Are you prepared?"
Her head, which had been raised with joy, fell back upon her breast. "'Tis very far away yet!" she murmured; "why could they not have done it to−day?"
The priest appeared to cast his eyes around the dungeon from beneath his cowl.
"Do you know," resumed the priest, after a fresh silence, "why you are here?"
The priest threw back his cowl; she looked.
This apparition, always so fatal for her, and which had thus driven her on from misfortune to misfortune, even to torture, roused her from her stupor.
Here, bursting into sobs, and raising her eyes to the priest,−− "Oh! wretch, who are you?
Here the priest paused, and the prisoner heard sighs of anguish break from his breast with a sound of the death rattle.
All that should have awakened was lulled to sleep; and like those who die in the snow, I felt pleasure in allowing this sleep to draw on.
Then I fell back into the embrasure of the window, more rigid, more feeble than a statue torn from its base.
Then−−how stop myself on that slope of hell?−−then I no longer belonged to myself.
I waited for you under porches, I stood on the lookout for you at the street corners, I watched for you from the summit of my tower.
Every evening I returned to myself more charmed, more despairing, more bewitched, more lost!
Finally, no longer knowing what to do, and what was to become of me, I denounced you to the official.
"Accordingly, I denounced you.
The plot which I was weaving against you, the storm which I was heaping up above your head, burst from me in threats and lightningglances.
The prisoner recoiled with horror.
The priest dragged himself towards her on his knees.
"Well, yes!" he resumed at last, with strange gentleness, "insult me, scoff at me, overwhelm me with scorn! but come, come.
He was not listening to her.
"Begone, monster! Begone, assassin!
All at once, the young girl beheld his head reappear; it wore a frightful expression, and he cried, hoarse with rage and despair,−−
She fell face downwards upon the floor, and there was no longer any sound audible in the cell than the sob of the drop of water which made the pool palpitate amid the darkness.
If it is summer time, it crawls about the yard, in the garden, plucks up the grass between the paving−stones, gazes innocently at the big dogs, the big horses, without fear, plays with the shells, with the flowers, and makes the gardener grumble because he finds sand in the flower−beds and earth in the paths.
She was somewhat aroused by it, knotted her hair upon her ears in order to deafen herself, and resumed her contemplation, on her knees, of the inanimate object which she had adored for fifteen years.
Give her back to me one day, one hour, one minute; one minute, Lord! and then cast me to the demon for all eternity!
"Some children said that it was a gypsy," went on the recluse.
Then Paquette la Chantefleurie burst into hyena−like laughter.
"Do I hate them!" exclaimed the recluse, " they are vampires, stealers of children!
His head fell upon his bosom and he moved slowly away.
Thanks, priest!" she cried.
But as soon as his heart was vacant in that direction, Fleur−de−Lys returned to it.
He paid no attention to a tolerably numerous rabble which had assembled in the Place du Parvis, before the portal of Notre−Dame; he remembered that it was the month of May; he supposed that it was some procession, some Pentecost, some festival, hitched his horse to the ring at the door, and gayly ascended the stairs to his beautiful betrothed.
"Oh! do not be frightened at that," said Phoebus, carelessly, "it was nothing.
The two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager.
She turned round, entreating and smiling.
She was in her shift; her long black hair (the fashion then was to cut it off only at the foot of the gallows) fell in disorder upon her half−bared throat and shoulders.
The condemned girl held together with her teeth her imperfectly fastened shift.
So saying, she turned to Phoebus.
He made a step to re−enter the room, but Fleur−de−Lys, whose jealousy, previously so vividly aroused by this same gypsy, had just been re−awakened, Fleur−de−Lys gave him a look full of penetration and distrust.
The escort ranged themselves in line on both sides.
Then there became visible in all its length, the deep, gloomy church, hung in black, sparely lighted with a few candles gleaming afar off on the principal altar, opened in the midst of the Place which was dazzling with light, like the mouth of a cavern.
At the same time, another voice, separate from the choir, intoned upon the steps of the chief altar, this melancholy offertory,−
They untied her hands, made her alight, accompanied by her goat, which had also been unbound, and which bleated with joy at finding itself free: and they made her walk barefoot on the hard pavement to the foot of the steps leading to the door.
The rope about her neck trailed behind her.
Then the chanting in the church ceased.
The halberds of the motley beadles clanked; and, a few moments later, a long procession of priests in chasubles, and deacons in dalmatics, marched gravely towards the condemned girl, as they drawled their song, spread out before her view and that of the crowd.
He bent down to her ear, and added (the spectators supposed that he was receiving her last confession): "Will you have me?
She looked intently at him: "Begone, demon, or I will denounce you!"
He staggered, passed his hand across his eyes, looked again, muttered a curse, and all his features were violently contorted.
He turned his back on the condemned girl, his head sank upon his breast once more, he crossed his hands and rejoined his escort of priests, and a moment later he was seen to disappear, with the cross, the candles, and the copes, beneath the misty arches of the cathedral, and his sonorous voice was extinguished by degrees in the choir, as he chanted this verse of despair,−−
At the same time, the intermittent clash of the iron butts of the beadles' halberds, gradually dying away among the columns of the nave, produced the effect of a clock hammer striking the last hour of the condemned.
She raised her dry, red eyes to heaven, to the sun, to the silvery clouds, cut here and there by a blue trapezium or triangle; then she lowered them to objects around her, to the earth, the throng, the houses; all at once, while the yellow man was binding her elbows, she uttered a terrible cry, a cry of joy.
She fell lifeless on the pavement.
She raised her eyelids, looked at Quasimodo, then closed them again suddenly, as though terrified by her deliverer.
All temporal jurisdiction expired upon its threshold.
Then the women laughed and wept, the crowd stamped with enthusiasm, for, at that moment Quasimodo had a beauty of his own.
All at once, he was seen to re−appear at one of the extremities of the gallery of the kings of France; he traversed it, running like a madman, raising his conquest high in his arms and shouting: "Sanctuary!" The crowd broke forth into fresh applause.
In this manner he skirted Mount Sainte−Geneviève, and finally emerged from the town by the Porte Saint−Victor.
He continued his flight as long as he could see, when he turned round, the turreted enclosure of the University, and the rare houses of the suburb; but, when, at length, a rise of ground had completely concealed from him that odious Paris, when he could believe himself to be a hundred leagues distant from it, in the fields, in the desert, he halted, and it seemed to him that he breathed more freely.
He stirred up in the depths of his heart all his hatred, all his malevolence; and, with the cold glance of a physician who examines a patient, he recognized the fact that this malevolence was nothing but vitiated love; that love, that source of every virtue in man, turned to horrible things in the heart of a priest, and that a man constituted like himself, in making himself a priest, made himself a demon.
Then he laughed frightfully, and suddenly became pale again, when he considered the most sinister side of his fatal passion, of that corrosive, venomous malignant, implacable love, which had ended only in the gibbet for one of them and in hell for the other; condemnation for her, damnation for him.
Then from the captain, his thought passed to the people, and there came to him a jealousy of an unprecedented sort. He reflected that the people also, the entire populace, had had before their eyes the woman whom he loved exposed almost naked.
And when he sought to picture to himself the happiness which he might have found upon earth, if she had not been a gypsy, and if he had not been a priest, if Phoebus had not existed and if she had loved him; when he pictured to himself that a life of serenity and love would have been possible to him also, even to him; that there were at that very moment, here and there upon the earth, happy couples spending the hours in sweet converse beneath orange trees, on the banks of brooks, in the presence of a setting sun, of a starry night; and that if God had so willed, he might have formed with her one of those blessed couples,−−his heart melted in tenderness and despair.
At his feet, some chickens were searching the thickets and pecking, enamelled beetles ran about in the sun; overhead, some groups of dappled gray clouds were floating across the blue sky; on the horizon, the spire of the Abbey Saint−Victor pierced the ridge of the hill with its slate obelisk; and the miller of the Copeaue hillock was whistling as he watched the laborious wings of his mill turning.
Sometimes he flung himself face downward on the, earth, and tore up the young blades of wheat with his nails.
Those two images united, presented to him a frightful group; and the more he concentrated what attention and thought was left to him, the more he beheld them grow, in accordance with a fantastic progression, the one in grace, in charm, in beauty, in light, the other in deformity and horror; so that at last la Esmeralda appeared to him like a star, the gibbet like an enormous, fleshless arm.
He believed himself to be far away from Paris; on taking his bearings, he perceived that he had only circled the enclosure of the University.
The spire of Saint−Sulpice, and the three lofty needles of Saint Germain−des−Prés, rose above the horizon on his right.
He turned his steps in that direction.
When he heard the brisk challenge of the men−at−arms of the abbey, around the crenelated, circumscribing wall of Saint−Germain, he turned aside, took a path which presented itself between the abbey and the lazar−house of the bourg, and at the expiration of a few minutes found himself on the verge of the Pré−aux−Clercs.
He skirted the Pré−aux−Clercs, took the deserted path which separated it from the Dieu−Neuf, and at last reached the water's edge.
When the boatman had taken his departure, he remained standing stupidly on the strand, staring straight before him and perceiving objects only through magnifying oscillations which rendered everything a sort of phantasmagoria to him.
The fatigue of a great grief not infrequently produces this effect on the mind.
The chimneys of the houses, the battlements of the walls, the faceted gables of the roofs, the spire of the Augustines, the tower of Nesle, all these projections which broke the profile of the colossal obelisk added to the illusion by displaying in eccentric fashion to the eye the indentations of a luxuriant and fantastic sculpture.
Then he became alarmed, he put his hands on his ears that he might no longer hear, turned his back that he might no longer see, and fled from the frightful vision with hasty strides.
How dark it is; the people are lighting their candles, and the good God his stars."
Then Jehan came back to the hag, smashed a bottle standing on the table, exclaiming,−−
He's bald," he added, bending down, "'tis an old man! ~Fortunate senex~!"
Then the archdeacon rose to his feet, and ran without halting, towards Notre−Dame, whose enormous towers he beheld rising above the houses through the gloom.
His knees gave way beneath him, and he sank upon the pavement, thinking of her who had died that day.
He rose; and, as he was afraid, he took the lamp from the breviary to light his way.
All at once, a gust of wind extinguished his lamp, and almost at the same instant, he beheld a shade, a whiteness, a form, a woman, appear from the opposite angle of the tower.
She came towards him, slowly, with her gaze fixed on the sky.
In this way he retreated once more beneath the gloomy arch of the stairway.
It was the abuse of impunity by the side of the abuse of punishment; two bad things which strove to correct each other.
His foot once within the asylum, the criminal was sacred; but he must beware of leaving it; one step outside the sanctuary, and he fell back into the flood.
The wheel, the gibbet, the strappado, kept good guard around the place of refuge, and lay in watch incessantly for their prey, like sharks around a vessel.
Sometimes, however, as in the affair of the assassins of Petit−Jean, the headsman of Paris, and in that of Emery Rousseau, the murderer of Jean Valleret, justice overleaped the church and passed on to the execution of its sentences; but unless by virtue of a decree of Parliament, woe to him who violated a place of asylum with armed force!
As long as that course lasted, the young girl had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air, floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the earth.
Then her eyelids drooped again; she thought that all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that the misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold of her and was bearing her away.
He gazed at her with anxiety, as though seeking to divine what she was saying to him.
Then she dropped her eyes upon herself and saw that she was almost naked, and blushed.
She made haste to dress herself.
He set the basket on the floor and said, "Eat!" He spread the mattress on the flagging and said, "Sleep."
Do not look at me; only listen to me.
She found herself alone once more, meditating upon the singular words of this almost monstrous being, and struck by the sound of his voice, which was so hoarse yet so gentle.
She approached the opening, and beheld the poor hunchback crouching in an angle of the wall, in a sad and resigned attitude.
From the movement of the gypsy's lips, Quasimodo thought that she was driving him away; then he rose and retiredlimping, slowly, with drooping head, without even daring to raise to the young girl his gaze full of despair.
"Do come," she cried, but he continued to retreat.
Then she darted from her cell, ran to him, and grasped his arm.
Then she crouched down gracefully on her couch, with her goat asleep at her feet.
"You think that that was all that I lacked, do you not?
He watched her attentively while she was speaking.
She listened to him with profound tenderness.
He laid the whistle on the floor and fled.
Calm gradually returned to the soul of la Esmeralda.
Love is like a tree; it sprouts forth of itself, sends its roots out deeply through our whole being, and often continues to flourish greenly over a heart in ruins.
At the sight of that villanous form which made its appearance so abruptly in the middle of her song, the young girl paused with an involuntary gesture of alarm.
The unhappy bellringer fell upon his knees on the threshold, and clasped his large, misshapen hands with a suppliant air. "Oh!" he said, sorrowfully, "continue, I implore you, and do not drive me away."
He had placed himself in that position in order to spare the young girl, as far as possible, the displeasure of seeing him.
All at once the gypsy started, a tear and a flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes, she knelt on the brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the Place with anguish, exclaiming: "Phoebus! come! come! a word, a single word in the name of heaven!
I will love you for it!"
Then he turned his head and plunged down the staircase with great strides, stifling with sobs.
When he reached the Place, he no longer saw anything except the handsome horse hitched at the door of the Gondelaurier house; the captain had just entered there.
In the Gondelaurier house it was one of those gala days which precede a wedding.
Quasimodo looked on from below at this scene which was all the more pleasing to witness because it was not meant to be seen.
Fortunately, for the young girl was beginning to resist but feebly, the door of the balcony suddenly opened once more and an old dame appeared; the beauty seemed confused, the officer assumed an air of displeasure, and all three withdrew.
The captain halted.
"Come, captain, 'tis a woman who is waiting for you." He added with an effort: "A woman who loves you."
"Oh!" said the poor deaf man, in a very low voice; "to refuse that!" He re−entered Notre−Dame, lighted his lamp and climbed to the tower again.
She flew to meet him as far off as she could see him.
Moreover, Quasimodo did not deceive himself on this point.
When he heard this news, he shut himself in his cell in the cloister.
With what thoughts was the unfortunate man contending?
Lastly, he pictured the young girl in her shift, with the rope about her neck, shoulders bare, feet bare, almost nude, as he had seen her on that last day.
The moment that the figure saw that la Esmeralda had perceived it, it blew out the lamp.
She fell back on her bed, chilled.
She stopped his two arms with superhuman force.
Then she struck him with the fury of a child.
She made her beautiful hands stiff to bruise his face. "Begone, demon!"
Quasimodo looked him full in the face, a trembling seized him, and he released the priest and shrank back.
So saying, he presented his knife to the priest.
The priest, beside himself, was about to seize it.
But the young girl was quicker than be; she wrenched the knife from Quasimodo's hands and burst into a frantic laugh,−−"Approach," she said to the priest.
Then she added with a pitiless expression, well aware that she was about to pierce the priest's heart with thousands of red−hot irons,−− "Ah!
I know that Phoebus is not dead! The priest overturned Quasimodo on the floor with a kick, and, quivering with rage, darted back under the vault of the staircase.
When he was gone, Quasimodo picked up the whistle which had just saved the gypsy. "It was getting rusty," he said, as he handed it back to her; then he left her alone.
"So you have no care, Master Pierre?" resumed the archdeacon, gazing intently at Gringoire.
"And if you were to see the interior of the chapel!" resumed the poet, with his garrulous enthusiasm.
Its beauty and simplicity consist in the interspacing of both, being a foot or more wide, which are interlaced, interlocked, fitted together, enchained enchased, interlined one upon another, and bite into each other in a manner that is truly firm and graceful."
After a silence, the priest resumed,−− "You are, nevertheless, tolerably poor?"
From the moment of that troop's passing, some agitation had pierced through the archdeacon's glacial envelope.
By the way," added Gringoire, looking at the archdeacon in a half bantering way, "are you still thinking of her?"
"That concerns us not."
"Listen, Dom Claude," replied the poet in utter consternation. You cling to that idea, and you are wrong.
Gringoire listened to him at first with an undecided air, then he became touched, and wound up with a grimace which made his pallid face resemble that of a new−born infant with an attack of the colic.
That's a queer idea of yours.−−After all," he continued after a pause, "who knows? perhaps they will not hang me.
The archdeacon gave him his hand: "It is settled, then?
This gesture recalled Gringoire to reality.
"Farewell, then!" and the archdeacon added between his teeth: "I'll find you again!"
"I do not want that devil of a man to find me," thought Gringoire; and he ran after Dom Claude. "Stay, monsieur the archdeacon, no ill−feeling between old friends!
The priest tore out the buttons of his cassock with impatience: "Stream of words!
Gringoire turned majestically towards him: "Leave me!
"What is that to me?"
"Malediction!" exclaimed Dom Claude. "You are the executioner.
"Brother," said Jehan timidly, "I am come to see you." The archdeacon did not even raise his eyes.
"Brother," resumed the hypocrite, "you are so good to me, and you give me such wise counsels that I always return to you."
As he uttered these monstrous words, he assumed the mien of Ajax, expecting to see the lightnings descend upon his head.
At the same time, the priest flung Jehan a purse, which gave the scholar a big bump on the forehead, and with which Jehan retreated, both vexed and content, like a dog who had been stoned with marrow bones.
The knave was seated on a table with his legs crossed, and in a loud voice was bestowing his knowledge of magic, both black and white, on many a gaping face which surrounded him.
The dripping−pan, where crackled a rain of grease, filled with its continual sputtering the intervals of these thousand dialogues, which intermingled from one end of the apartment to the other.
Listen to me, my friends; I am a vagabond to the bottom of my heart, I am a member of the slang thief gang in my soul, I was born an independent thief.
There was a moment of partial silence, during which the sharp voice of the Duke of Egypt rose, as he gave instructions to his Bohemians.
Here they served Jehan with his supper.
I quote the text.
"Friend Pierre," said the King of Thunes, "what the devil are you thinking about?"
Gringoire turned to him with a melancholy smile.
Gringoire, torn from his meditations, began to watch the wild and noisy scene which surrounded him, muttering between his teeth: "~Luxuriosa res vinum et tumultuosa ebrietas~.
At that moment, Clopin returned and shouted in a voice of thunder: "Midnight!"
Ten minutes later, the cavaliers of the watch fled in terror before a long procession of black and silent men which was descending towards the Pont an Change, through the tortuous streets which pierce the close−built neighborhood of the markets in every direction.
Paris which, so to speak was not lighted at that epoch, presented to the eye a confused collection of black masses, cut here and there by the whitish curve of the Seine.
It lasted for some time on the quay; then it gradually ceased, as though that which was passing were entering the interior of the island; then it stopped altogether, and the line of the quay became straight and motionless again.
Then his fears returned to him, the idea of an attempt against the gypsy presented itself once more to his mind.
Quasimodo picked up his lantern and descended to the platform between the towers, in order to get a nearer view, and to spy out a means of defence.
In Paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty−one lords who laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to a manor and to administering justice, from the Bishop of Paris, who had five hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre− Dame des Champs, who had four.
All these feudal justices recognized the suzerain authority of the king only in name. All possessed the right of control over the roads.
Let us return to Notre−Dame.
That is why we call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church, or we will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church, which will be a good thing.
In token of which I here plant my banner, and may God preserve you, bishop of Paris,"
That done, the King of Thunes turned round and cast his eyes over his army, a fierce multitude whose glances flashed almost equally with their pikes.
Thirty bold men, square shouldered, and with pick−lock faces, stepped from the ranks, with hammers, pincers, and bars of iron on their shoulders.
They betook themselves to the principal door of the church, ascended the steps, and were soon to be seen squatting under the arch, working at the door with pincers and levers; a throng of vagabonds followed them to help or look on.
An enormous beam had just fallen from above; it had crushed a dozen vagabonds on the pavement with the sound of a cannon, breaking in addition, legs here and there in the crowd of beggars, who sprang aside with cries of terror.
The locksmiths, although protected by the deep vaults of the portal, abandoned the door and Clopin himself retired to a respectful distance from the church.
"'Tis the moon which threw this log at us," said Andry the Red.
The windows were immediately closed, and the poor bourgeois, who had hardly had time to cast a frightened glance on this scene of gleams and tumult, returned, perspiring with fear to their wives, asking themselves whether the witches' sabbath was now being held in the parvis of Notre−Dame, or whether there was an assault of Burgundians, as in '64. Then the husbands thought of theft; the wives, of rape; and all trembled.
They stared at the beam, they stared at the church.
The King of Thunes ran boldly to the formidable beam, and placed his foot upon it: "Here is one!" he exclaimed; "'tis the canons who send it to you." And, making a mocking salute in the direction of the church, "Thanks, canons!"
Quasimodo hastened to that tower.
With a strength which the sense of danger increased tenfold, he seized one of the beams−−the longest and heaviest; he pushed it out through a loophole, then, grasping it again outside of the tower, he made it slide along the angle of the balustrade which surrounds the platform, and let it fly into the abyss.
At last it reached the ground, the horrible cry arose, and the black beam, as it rebounded from the pavement, resembled a serpent leaping.
He took advantage of their fright, and while they were fixing a superstitious glance on the club which had fallen fromheaven, and while they were putting out the eyes of the stone saints on the front with a discharge of arrows and buckshot, Quasimodo was silently piling up plaster, stones, and rough blocks of stone, even the sacks of tools belonging to the masons, on the edge of the balustrade from which the beam had already been hurled.
Thus, as soon as they began to batter the grand door, the shower of rough blocks of stone began to fall, and it seemed to them that the church itself was being demolished over their heads.
His huge gnome's head bent over the balustrade, then an enormous stone fell, then another, then another.
An idea occurred to him; he ran in search of a fagot in his bellringer's den, placed on this fagot a great many bundles of laths, and many rolls of lead, munitions which he had not employed so far, and having arranged this pile in front of the hole to the two gutters, he set it on fire with his lantern.
Around these two principal streams there were drops of that horrible rain, which scattered over the assailants and entered their skulls like gimlets of fire.
"By the Pope's whiskers!" went on a sham soldier, who had once been in service, "here are church gutters spitting melted lead at you better than the machicolations of Lectoure."
"Is there, then, no way of forcing this door," exclaimed the King of Thunes, stamping his foot.
"Let us make another trial," resumed the vagabond.
"Praised be Pluto!" said Clopin. "But what the devil is he dragging after him?"
Jehan gazed at him with a malicious, knowing look, and cracked his fingers like castanets.
At that moment he was sublime.
"What is that to me?" said Clopin.
The throng of vagabonds, uttering loud acclamations, crowded to its foot to ascend.
Jehan mounted slowly, a good deal incommoded by his heavy armor, holding his crossbow in one hand, and clinging to a rung with the other.
Thus master of the citadel, he uttered a shout of joy, and suddenly halted, petrified.
Before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering a word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands, raised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant ladder, loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment, in the midst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman force, hurled this cluster of men backward into the Place.
The ladder, launched backwards, remained erect and standing for an instant, and seemed to hesitate, then wavered, then suddenly, describing a frightful arc of a circle eighty feet in radius, crashed upon the pavement with its load of ruffians, more rapidly than a drawbridge when its chains break.
There arose an immense imprecation, then all was still, and a few mutilated wretches were seen, crawling over the heap of dead.
Quasimodo, impassive, with both elbows propped on the balustrade, looked on.
He found himself in the gallery with the formidable bellringer, alone, separated from his companions by a vertical wall eighty feet high.
For the first few moments, the deaf man paid no heed to him; but at last he turned his head, and suddenly straightened up.
He laid his hand on the arrow, tore it from his arm, and tranquilly broke it across his big knee; then he let the two pieces drop on the floor, rather than threw them down.
The arrow broken, Quasimodo breathing heavily, bounded like a grasshopper, and he fell upon the scholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow.
Quasimodo flung the scholar's iron shell at his feet, piece by piece.
This good bourgeois king preferred the Bastille with a tiny chamber and couch.
This little chamber, which the king reserved for himself in the famous state prison, was also tolerably spacious and occupied the topmost story of a turret rising from the donjon keep.
The wages of our servants are putting France to the pillage!
He paused breathless, then resumed energetically,−−
"Do you see, Gossip Guillaume? the grand warden of the keys, the grand butler, the grand chamberlain, the grand seneschal are not worth the smallest valet.
They serve no purpose, as they stand thus useless round the king; they produce upon me the effect of the four Evangelists who surround the face of the big clock of the palace, and which Philippe Brille has just set in order afresh.
They are gilt, but they do not indicate the hour; and the hands can get on without them."
He remained in thought for a moment, then added, shaking his aged head,−−
He had just dipped his lips into the goblet, and he spat out the beverage, saying: "Foh! what a disagreeable potion!" The man who was reading continued:−−
At length, after having passed a final wicket, so loaded with locks that a quarter of an hour was required to open it, they entered a vast and lofty vaulted hall, in the centre of which they could distinguish by the light of the torches, a huge cubic mass of masonry, iron, and wood.
"~Pasque−Dieu~!" exclaimed the king.
At his order, Master Olivier resumed his reading, and his majesty coldly continued his inspection of the cage.
This was lugubrious in the darkness, and their faces turned pale as they looked at each other.
He turned his back on the cage, and set out to leave the room.
The king reascended in silence to his retreat, and his suite followed him, terrified by the last groans of the condemned man.
All at once his majesty turned to the Governor of the Bastille,−−
At the moment when he finished it, the door opened and gave passage to a new personage, who precipitated himself into the chamber, crying in affright,−−
"Sire! sire! there is a sedition of the populace in Paris!" Louis XI.'s grave face contracted; but all that was visible of his emotion passed away like a flash of lightning.
"So," resumed the king,−−"speak sir,−−there is a commotion among the louts in our good city of Paris?"
"In all their petitions to the Parliament, they claim to have but two masters. Your majesty and their God, who is the devil, I believe."
"Bless me!" said the king, scratching his left ear with his right hand, "that makes a goodly bit of my city!
He lifted his cap again, and continued, still dreamily, with the air and accent of a hunter who is cheering on his pack of hounds: "Good, my people! bravely done! break these false lords! do your duty! at them! have at them! pillage them! take them! sack them!....Ah! you want to be kings, messeigneurs? On, my people on!"
Go, seek them!" Master Olivier quitted the room and returned a moment later with the two prisoners, surrounded by archers of the guard.
He was clothed in rags, and walked with one knee bent and dragging his leg.
"And do you recognize this man as your companion?" added Louis XI., pointing to the other prisoner.
I was passing there.
The advocate's trade taketh all the grain, and leaveth only straw to the other scientific professions.
Clemency beareth the torch before all the other virtues.
What matters it to your majesty, who dazzles all faces, if there is one poor man more on earth, a poor innocent philosopher spluttering amid the shadows of calamity, with an empty pocket which resounds against his hollow belly?
When Gringoire paused at last, quite out of breath, he raised his head tremblingly towards the king, who was engaged in scratching a spot on the knee of his breeches with his finger− nail; then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of ptisan.
At last the king looked at him. "Here is a terrible bawler!" said, he.
Then, turning to Tristan l'Hermite, "Bali! let him go!"
And for fear of a counter order, he rushed towards the door, which Tristan opened for him with a very bad grace.
Tristan l'Hermite in his corner wore the surly look of a dog who has had a bone snatched away from him.
As he felt the king's pulse, Coictier assumed an air of greater and greater alarm.
He speculated on it to the best of his ability.
"~Pulsus creber, anhelans, crepitans, irregularis~," continued the leech.
"Since your majesty is so clement," replied the leech, "you will not refuse to aid me a little in building my house, Rue Saint−André−des−Arcs."
"I am at the end of my finances," pursued the doctor; and it would really be a pity that the house should not have a roof; not on account of the house, which is simple and thoroughly bourgeois, but because of the paintings of Jehan Fourbault, which adorn its wainscoating.
"Ah, assassin!" cried the king, "He never draws out one of my teeth which is not a diamond."
A burning candle does not attract one gnat alone.
"Good!" he muttered, almost aloud, "'tis easy to see that the king is ill to−day; he giveth all to the leech."
Yes, gentlemen," added the king turning to the Flemings, "this man hath been an ambassador.
Accordingly, Olivier le Mauvais remained motionless, sulking at the king, and glancing askance at Jacques Coictier.
'Tis very simple; he has taken hold upon us by the whole body, and you hold us only by the chin.
The king rose, approached the window, and suddenly opening it with extraordinary agitation,−− "Oh! yes!" he exclaimed, clapping his hands, "yonder is a redness in the sky over the City.
And Louis XI.'s glance was almost as joyous as that of the hosier. "Will it not be difficult to resist?"
I! 'tis different," returned the king. "If I willed."
"I say, sire, that you may possibly be in the right, that the hour of the people may not yet have come with you." Louis XI. gazed at him with his penetrating eye,−−
I leave my work as it stands, I come out of my hosier's stall, and I shout: 'To the sack?' There is always some smashed cask at hand.
I mount it, and I say aloud, in the first words that occur to me, what I have on my heart; and when one is of the people, sire, one always has something on the heart: Then people troop up, they shout, they ring the alarm bell, they arm the louts with what they take from the soldiers, the market people join in, and they set out.
Louis XI. returned and seated himself, saying, with a smile,−− "Ah! here they have only got as far as the bailiffs." At that instant Olivier le Daim returned.
And guard your head well, gossip; for I swear to you by the cross of Saint−Lô that, if you lie to us at this hour, the sword which severed the head of Monsieur de Luxembourg is not so notched that it cannot yet sever yours!"
This eruption having passed, he returned to his seat, and said with cold and concentrated wrath,−−
He added, after a silence, "And what shall I do with the sorceress?"
Here, as though seized with a sudden idea, he flung himself on his knees before his chair, took off his hat, placed it on the seat, and gazing devoutly at one of the leaden amulets which loaded it down,
He made the sign of the cross, rose, donned his hat once more, and said to Tristan,−−
On arriving at the Baudoyer gate, he walked straight to the stone cross which rose in the middle of that place, as though he were able to distinguish in the darkness the figure of a man clad and cloaked in black, who was seated on the steps of the cross.
I come from him.
"Oh! distaff of words! what is your adventure to me!
Both descended towards the city with long strides.
He ran distractedly along the gallery.
France! cut down the louts!
Provostship!"
The frightened vagabonds wheeled round.
Men, women, children, hurled themselves on the cruppers and the breasts of the horses, and hung there like cats, with teeth, finger nails and toe nails.
Others thrust iron hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and dragged them down. They slashed in pieces those who fell.
He was singing a ditty, with a nasal intonation, he swung and drew back his scythe incessantly.
He advanced thus into the very thickest of the cavalry, with the tranquil slowness, the lolling of the head and the regular breathing of a harvester attacking a field of wheat.
The neighbors hearing the war cries of the king's troops, had mingled in the affray, and bullets rained upon the outcasts from every story.
When Quasimodo, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld this rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then, intoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a bird to that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended.
She raised her eyes once more, and recognized the poet in very fact.
"Oh!" continued Gringoire in a tone of reproach, "Djali recognized me before you!"
Then the philosopher setting his lantern on the ground, crouched upon the stones, and exclaimed enthusiastically, as he pressed Djali in his arms,−− "Oh! 'tis a graceful beast, more considerable no doubt, for it's neatness than for its size, but ingenious, subtle, and lettered as a grammarian!
"Is it true?" she exclaimed in dismay.
They rapidly descended the staircase of the towers, crossed the church, full of shadows and solitude, and all reverberating with uproar, which formed a frightful contrast, and emerged into the courtyard of the cloister by the red door.
The man with the lantern walked straight to the point of the Terrain.
The man was the last to step in. Then he cut the boat's moorings, pushed it from the shore with a long boat− hook, and, seizing two oars, seated himself in the bow, rowing with all his might towards midstream.
He took a position in the stern; and the young girl, whom the stranger inspired with an indefinable uneasiness, seated herself close to the poet.
He added with the air of a profound thinker, "One is indebted sometimes to fortune, sometimes to ruse, for the happy issue of great enterprises."
The boat made its way slowly towards the right shore.
But he suddenly ceased rowing, his arms fell as though broken, his head sank on his breast, and la Esmeralda heard him sigh convulsively.
But the man in black finally recovered himself, seized the oars once more and began to row against the current.
He doubled the point of the Isle of Notre Dame, and made for the landing−place of the Port an Foin.
He clasped the goat in his arms, and gently drew away from the gypsy, who pressed closer and closer to him, as though to the only asylum which remained to her.
The unknown rose, approached the gypsy, and endeavored to take her arm to assist her to alight.
She gazed about her on all sides.
She had no recollection of any of the places where she was walking.
The bourgeois who was standing at the window opened it, appeared there in his shirt with his lamp, stared at the quay with a stupid air, uttered some words which she did not understand, and closed his shutter again.
The man halted, turned towards her and raised his cowl.
It was the priest.
Then listen to me.
(As he spoke thus he paced to and fro, like a man who cannot remain in one place, and dragged her after him.)
Oh!−−There is a decree of Parliament which gives you back to the scaffold.
He extended his arm toward the City.
As he went with hurried step and made her hurry also, for he did not release her, he walked straight to the gallows, and pointed to it with his finger,−−
She tore herself from his hands and fell at the foot of the gibbet, embracing that funereal support, then she half turned her beautiful head, and looked at the priest over her shoulder.
At length the gypsy said to him,−− "It causes me less horror than you do."
It is that which renders me evil, do you see? and horrible to myself.−−You will not even look at me!
He was silent for a moment, and resumed, as though speaking to himself, and in a strong voice,−−"Cain, what hast thou done with thy brother?"
All at once he sank together, like something crumbling, and lay motionless on the earth, with his head on his knees.
And turning suddenly to the gypsy with unspeakable anguish,−−
He flung himself on his knees to receive with adoration the word, possibly a tender one, which was on the point of issuing from her lips.
He reddened, turned pale, then released her and gazed at her with a gloomy air.
He caught her once more, he shook her, he flung her on the ground, and walked with rapid strides towards the corner of the Tour− Roland, dragging her after him along the pavement by her beautiful hands.
She writhed, she made many starts of agony and despair, but the other held her with incredible strength.
The lean and bony fingers which bruised her, clenched on her flesh and met around it.
She fell back against the wall exhausted, and then the fear of death took possession of her.
She turned a dying look towards the window, and she beheld the fierce face of the sacked nun through the bars.
"Give me back my child!" said the recluse.
"Give me back my child!"
"Give me back my child!"
When your mother, the gypsy, comes to reclaim you, I shall say to her: 'Mother, look at that gibbet!−−Or, give me back my child.
As she spoke thus, with her other arm extended through the window, she showed the gypsy the little embroidered shoe.
The young girl passed her arm through the opening; the recluse threw herself on that hand, pressed her lips to it and there remained, buried in that kiss, giving no other sign of life than a sob which heaved her breast from time to time.
When her daughter was inside the cell, she laid her gently on the ground, then raised her up again, and bearing her in her arms as though she were still only her little Agnes, she walked to and fro in her little room,intoxicated, frantic, joyous, crying out, singing, kissing her daughter, talking to her, bursting into laughter, melting into tears, all at once and with vehemence.
"Do you see, my little girl," resumed the recluse, interspersing her words with kisses, "I shall love you dearly?
"To die!" said Gudule, staggering as though struck by lightning; "to die!" she repeated slowly, gazing at her daughter with staring eyes.
The recluse remained for several moments motionless and petrified, then she moved her head in sign of doubt, and suddenly giving vent to a burst of laughter, but with that terrible laugh which had come back to her,−−
The good God does not permit such things as that."
The priest says that we shall find her at the Rat−Hole." The noise of the horses began again.
All comes back to me.
She thrust her head through the window, and withdrew it again hastily.
She remained silent for a moment; but she paced the cell hurriedly, and halted now and then to pluck out handfuls of her gray hairs, which she afterwards tore with her teeth.
She set her daughter (down for she was still carrying her), in one corner of the cell which was not visible from without.
She made her crouch down, arranged her carefully so that neither foot nor hand projected from the shadow, untied her black hair which she spread over her white robe to conceal it, placed in front of her her jug and her paving stone, the only articles of furniture which she possessed, imagining that this jug and stone would hide her.
And when this was finished she became more tranquil, and knelt down to pray.
The day, which was only dawning, still left many shadows in the Rat−Hole.
The mother rose quickly and went to post herself before her window, in order to stop it up.
The commander dismounted, and came toward her.
The poor mother assumed as indifferent an air as she could, and replied,−− "I know not what you mean."
"Come, now, old madwoman," began the commander again, "do not lie.
"Through the Rue du Mouton, I believe." Tristan turned his head and made a sign to his troop to prepare to set out on the march again.
"I think the old dame is getting confused!" The unfortunate woman felt that all depended on her self− possession, and, although with death in her soul, she began to grin.
"Hum!" growled Tristan.
Tristan, whose face became more sinister with every moment, addressed the recluse,−− "What have you to say to that?"
"And then," added the first soldier, "there is no boat either on this side of the stream or on the other."
She seized on these words with avidity.
I understand not this madwoman at all." An old, gray−haired sergeant of the guard stepped out of the ranks, and addressing the provost,−−
Tristan l'Hermite, in despair at extracting anything from the recluse, turned his back on her, and with unspeakable anxiety she beheld him direct his course slowly towards his horse.
She dragged her violently back, digging her nails into her neck.
A man who had neither the garments nor the air of a soldier, stepped from the ranks.
Rennet returned once more to the provost in great embarrassment.
The mother still looked on steadfastly from the depths of her cavern.
He drew from it also the double ladder, which he immediately set up against the gallows.
Five or six of the provost's men armed themselves with picks and crowbars, and Tristan betook himself, in company with them, towards the window.
She cried, redoubling her terrible laugh,−− "What is your king to me?
All at once she seized her paving stone, laughed, and hurled it with both fists upon the workmen.
In proportion as the work of the demolishers seemed to advance, the mother mechanically retreated, and pressed the young girl closer and closer to the wall.
She threw herself upon it, she tried to hold it back; she scratched the stone with her nails, but the massive block, set in movement by six men, escaped her and glided gently to the ground along the iron levers.
The mother, perceiving an entrance effected, fell down in front of the opening, barricading the breach with her body, beating the pavement with her head, and shrieking with a voice rendered so hoarse by fatigue that it was hardly audible,−−
The mother gazed at the soldiers in such formidable fashion that they were more inclined to retreat than to advance.
"Come, now," repeated the provost. "Here you, Rennet Cousin!"
Placed between the provost and the mother, both threatening, the soldiers hesitated for a moment, then took their resolution, and advanced towards the Rat−Hole.
When the recluse saw this, she rose abruptly on her knees, flung aside her hair from her face, then let her thin flayed hands fall by her side.
Then great tears fell, one by one, from her eyes; they flowed down her cheeks through a furrow, like a torrent through a bed which it has hollowed for itself.
The executioner and the sergeants entered the cell.
The mother offered no resistance, only she dragged herself towards her daughter and threw herself bodily upon her.
When she felt that hand, she cried, "Heuh!" and fainted.
Then Rennet Cousin dragged the young girl outside the cell, and the mother after her.
Rennet Cousin paused at the foot of the fatal ladder, with that which he was dragging, and, barely breathing, with so much pity did the thing inspire him, he passed the rope around the lovely neck of the young girl. The unfortunate child felt the horrible touch of the hemp.
Then she shook herself and shrieked in a loud and heartrending voice: "No! no!
Without uttering a cry, she raised herself erect with a terrible expression; then she flung herself upon the hand of the executioner, like a beast on its prey, and bit it.
The headsman howled with pain.
Those near by rushed up. With difficulty they withdrew his bleeding hand from the mother's teeth.
They thrust her back with much brutality, and noticed that her head fell heavily on the pavement. They raised her, she fell back again.
When Quasimodo saw that the cell was empty, that the gypsy was no longer there, that while he had been defending her she had been abducted, he grasped his hair with both hands and stamped with surprise and pain; then he set out to run through the entire church seeking his Bohemian, howling strange cries to all the corners of the walls, strewing his red hair on the pavement.
Quasimodo, left alone in that vast Notre−Dame, so besieged and tumultuous but a short time before, once more betook himself to the cell where the gypsy had slept for so many weeks under his guardianship.
As he approached it, he fancied that he might, perhaps, find her there.
At length he summoned up courage, advanced on tiptoe, looked, entered.
All at once, he crushed his torch under his foot, and, without uttering a word, without giving vent to a sigh, he flung himself at full speed, head foremost against the wall, and fell fainting on the floor.
At length he fell a second time, exhausted; he dragged himself on his knees outside the cell, and crouched down facing the door, in an attitude of astonishment.
He uttered not a word; only at long intervals, a sob heaved his body violently, but it was a tearless sob, like summer lightning which makes no noise.
He recalled a thousand details, and soon he no longer doubted that the archdeacon had taken the gypsy.
This figure was coming towards him.
It flies towards one point and looks towards another.
In this manner the priest passed above Quasimodo without seeing him.
The archdeacon and the gypsy had come into conflict in his heart.
The priest's back was turned to him.
A man was dragging a white thing, from which hung something black, along the pavement.
This man halted at the foot of the gallows.
Moreover, at that moment the sun appeared, and such a flood of light overflowed the horizon that one would have said that all the points in Paris, spires, chimneys, gables, had simultaneously taken fire.
Meanwhile, the man began to mount the ladder.
The man reached the top of the ladder.
Here the priest, in order to see the better, knelt upon the balustrade.
All at once the man kicked away the ladder abruptly, and Quasimodo, who had not breathed for several moments, beheld the unhappy child dangling at the end of the rope two fathoms above the pavement, with the man squatting on her shoulders.
The spout, above which he had stood, arrested him in his fall.
In this terrible situation, the archdeacon said not a word, uttered not a groan.
Quasimodo had but to stretch out his hand in order to draw him from the gulf; but he did not even look at him. He was looking at the Grève.
Once, he glanced below him into the Place, into the abyss; the head which he raised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.
The curve of the lead which sustained him inclined more and more each instant towards the abyss.
He stiffened himself upon the spout, pushed against the wall with both his knees, clung to a crevice in the stones with his hands, and succeeded in climbing back with one foot, perhaps; but this effort made the leaden beak on which he rested bend abruptly.
His cassock burst open at the same time.
Then, feeling everything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and failing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and let go of the spout.
He slid rapidly along the roof like a loosened tile, and dashed upon the pavement.
To that deep charnel−house, where so many human remains and so many crimes have rotted in company, many great ones of this world, many innocent people, have contributed their bones, from Enguerrand de Marigni, the first victim, and a just man, to Admiral de Coligni, who was its last, and who was also a just man.
Instead he went over to the door, opened it slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately behind it, "He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast."
"It would be the first time that's happened," said K., as he jumped out of bed and quickly pulled on his trousers. "I want to see who that is in the next room, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this way."
It immediately occurred to him that he needn't have said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have acknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the time.
That, at least, is how the stranger took it, as he said, "Don't you think you'd better stay where you are?"
"You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this is," said Franz and both men then walked up to K. They were significantly bigger than him, especially the second man, who frequently slapped him on the shoulder.
"It's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom," they said. "Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come to an end or not.
K. paid hardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them. It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of his position, but he could not think clearly while these people were here, the second policeman's belly - and they could only be policemen - looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up and saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body.
Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was looking for straight away.
But now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again. He stayed like that until he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast.
"Now you're starting again," said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot. "We don't answer questions like that."
"That's true, you know, you'd better believe it," said Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood.
K. found himself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand down on his papers and said, "Here are my identity documents."
He walked up and down the free space in the room a couple of times, across the street he could see the old woman who, now, had pulled an old man, much older than herself, up to the window and had her arms around him.
So he decided on the more certain solution, the way things would go in the natural course of events, and went back in his room without another word either from him or from the policemen.
The two policemen were standing there and chased him back into his bedroom as if that were a matter of course.
"Well that's alright by me if it makes things go any faster," said K. He opened the wardrobe himself, spent a long time searching through all the clothes, and chose his best black suit which had a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew him, then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and began, carefully, to get dressed.
He watched them to see if they might remember after all, but of course it never occurred to them, although Willem did not forget to send Franz up to the supervisor with the message saying that K. was getting dressed.
In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the photographs belonging to Miss Bürstner that had been put into a piece of fabric on the wall.
"You're making a big mistake," he said. "These gentlemen and I have got nothing to do with your business, in fact we know almost nothing about you.
K. stared at the supervisor.
No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to the three men, said, "It makes no sense," at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk.
"What the point is?" shouted K., more disconcerted that cross. "Who do you think you are?
You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be?
"We've got some kind of audience over there," called K. to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger.
The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that was what he saw from the corner of his eye.
If you are of the same opinion, then please... " and he walked up to the supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him.
But instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss Bürstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new hat.
You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that.
K. stood where he was and watched them through the open double doorway, the last to go, of course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot.
At that moment Mrs. Grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the people were. She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all, and K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for no reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body.
Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could.
But he turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone.
Once order had been restored, every trace of those events would have been erased and everything would take its previous course once more.
"It's alright," he said then, and went on, but before going up the stairs he turned round once more.
He could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speak with Mrs. Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked.
K. looked round the room, it looked exactly as it usually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on the table by the window that morning, had already been cleared away.
He looked at Mrs. Grubach with some gratitude.
"Oh, I see," she said, and went peacefully back to what she was doing, "that was no trouble, not especially."
"No, it can't happen again," she agreed, and smiled at K. in a way that was almost pained.
It seems to me that it's something very complicated - forgive me if I'm saying something stupid - something very complicated that I don't understand, but something that you don't really need to understand anyway."
The supervisor didn't shake hands, he thought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining her.
"It really doesn't matter," said K. his head hanging as he turned to the door to leave, "I just wanted to give her my apology for taking over her room today."
"Miss Bürstner often comes home late," said K., looking at Mrs. Grubach as if that were her responsibility.
"Mr. K.," said Mrs. Grubach as if asking him for something and hurrying to his door which he had already opened, "I don't want to speak to Miss Bürstner at all, not yet, of course I'll continue to keep an eye on her but you're the only one I've told what I know.
"Decent!" called out K. through the crack in the door, "if you want to keep the house decent you'll first have to give me notice." Then he slammed the door shut, there was a gentle knocking to which he paid no more attention.
He wasn't able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the hallway as if in that way he could make Miss Bürstner arrive sooner.
Shivering, she pulled a silk shawl over her slender shoulders as she locked the door.
"Is there someone there?" asked Miss Bürstner, looking round with her eyes wide open.
We certainly can't talk out here, we'd wake everyone up and I think that would be more unpleasant for us than for them.
Wait here till I've put the light on in my room, and then turn the light down out here."
"My room?" asked Miss Bürstner, and instead of looking round the room scrutinised K.
"So you have been making fun of me, then," said Miss Bürstner exceedingly disappointed, "you really ought not to try something like that on at this time of night." And she stepped away from the photographs where they had stood so long together.
"Alright then, if you need it to show what you mean, just take the bedside table then," said Miss Bürstner, and after a short pause added in a weak voice, "I'm so tired I'm allowing more than I ought to."
And now it really does begin. the supervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up, in fact he shouts at me, I'm afraid, if I'm to make it clear to you, I'll have to shout as well, and it's nothing more than my name that he shouts out."
"Go away, go away," she said, hurriedly sitting back up, "get out of here, go, what is it you want, he's listening at the door he can hear everything.
Thank you for your suggestions, but I won't accept them.
She pulled her hand away and answered, "No, no, I'm never cross with anyone."
He very soon went to sleep, but before he did he thought a little while about his behaviour, he was satisfied with it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied; he was seriously worried about Miss Bürstner because of the captain.
Once he had received this notice, K. hung up the receiver without giving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, it was certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up to it, and this first examination would probably also be the last.
"No, no, " said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely.
"Pity," said the deputy director, and turned to the telephone conversation that had just been connected.
He dressed hurriedly, without the time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out during the week. With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been told about.
All of them seemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running; it was a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly. And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual.
People called out to each other across the street, one of the calls provoked a loud laugh about K. himself.
In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket who, as the water flowed into her can, looked at K. There was a piece of rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some washing hanging on it to dry.
K. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing was to take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he could see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a small passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard.
In the end he decided to climb up the stairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the policeman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by the guilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway that K. selected by chance.
It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and out.
Half grown girls, who seemed to be dressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro.
It was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the enquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed.
It was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention to the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it was he quietly said.
Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked over at K.
But, for the moment, I do acknowledge it, out of pity for yourselves to a large extent.
He took out the notebook again, probably so that he could give the impression of being calmer.
"What has happened to me," continued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier, he continually scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his address a somewhat nervous and distracted character, "what has happened to me is not just an isolated case. If it were it would not be of much importance as it's not of much importance to me, but it is a symptom of proceedings which are carried out against many.
It's on behalf of them that I stand here now, not for myself alone."
Again I say, Bravo!" Some of the men in the first row groped around in their beards, none of them looked round to see who was shouting.
Not even K. thought him of any importance but it did raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority of them began to think about the matter and if only one of them, now and then, was persuaded.
"I'm not trying to be a successful orator," said K. after this thought, "that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway.
Whether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rocked backwards and forwards on his seat.
"I have nearly finished what I have to say," said K., and as there was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each other.
That is impossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for himself.
That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of those they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of people they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial.
On the contrary, they stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of his collar.
Now he stood face to face with the crowd.
Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must follow, were they tired of pretending?
Well, I hope you haven't come here for nothing, I hope you've either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else - let go of me or I'll hit you," shouted K. to a quivery old man who had pressed himself especially close to him - "or else that you've actually learned something.
K. laughed towards the door.
So on Sunday, he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door.
It was indeed empty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous Sunday.
"It's not so much the room that surprises me," said K., looking at her crossly, "it's your being married that shocks me."
"Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in session, when I disturbed what you were saying?" asked the woman.
"Yes, certainly," the woman cried, and pulled K. along behind her as she rushed to them.
The books were old and well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its middle, and it was held together with a few threads.
K. took hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent picture appeared.
K. didn't thumb through that book any more, but just threw open the next one at its title page, it was a novel with the title, «What Grete Suffered from her Husband, Hans. «
It was the first thing I noticed when you first came here.
So that's what all this is about, thought K., she's offering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else around here, she's had enough of the court officials, which is understandable I suppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about his eyes.
Carry on with these people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem to me to be something you cannot do without.
You belong to the people I have to combat, and you're very comfortable among them, you're even in love with the student, or if you don't love him you do at least prefer him to your husband.
"You misunderstand me," said K., sitting back down, "if it's really important to you for me to stay here then I'll be glad to do so, I have plenty of time, I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place.
Everyone had gone, but the examining judge, he stayed in the hall, I had to bring him a lamp in, all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he was very satisfied with it and started to write straight away.
Meantime my husband arrived, he always has the day off on Sundays, we got the furniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the neighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit by a candle, in short, we forgot all about the examining judge and went to bed.
All of a sudden in the night, it must have been quite late in the night, I wakes up, next to the bed, there's the examining judge shading the lamp with his hand so that there's no light from it falls on my husband, he didn't need to be as careful as that, the way my husband sleeps the light wouldn't have woken him up anyway.
K. looked at him with some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely attain high office one day.
The student, in contrast, seemed to take no notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window, the woman leant over to K. and whispered, "Don't be cross with me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've got to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs.
It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off.
The student briefly looked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around her.
She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying.
K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the room.
K. ran the few steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said,
"No!" shouted the woman, pushing K. away with both hands, "no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing!?
He's only carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him."
K. followed them slowly. He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered from these people.
And he imagined the most laughable scene possible as an example of this, if this contemptible student, this inflated child, this knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's bed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness.
K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily get over his disappointment.
"Listen to this," said the usher, "they're always carrying her away from me.
It's Sunday today, and it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send me off with some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away from here.
All he did, he just chases after any woman.
Then he looked at K. trustingly which, despite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added, "they're always rebelling." But the conversation seemed to have become a little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, "now I have to report to the office.
"Alright then," said K. finally, "I'll come with you." And, quicker than the usher himself, he ran up the steps.
Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, "The gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for.
And before leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench and walked on.
This greatly surprised K., and he reached out for it with his hand.
He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the usher nodded, and that is the way that K. went.
The usher remained always one or two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him.
K. looked at the usher.
But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn't want to miss seeing.
And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as he watched.
The girl noticed it straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a window pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatch directly above K.'s head that led to the outside.
So he said, "I am able to walk now," and stood up, shaking after becoming used to sitting so comfortably.
"I can't manage it," he said shaking his head, and sat down again with a sigh.
"I think," said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long, sharply tailored points, "the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would most prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices altogether."
K. said nothing, did not even look up, he tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was even what suited him best.
"There's no need to be so apologetic," said the information-giver, "it's very commendable for you to be so attentive. You are taking up space here when you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as you like.
K. nodded, but started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, "Would you not like to sit down here a while?"
He was at their mercy, if they let go of him he would fall like a board.
Their little eyes glanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually being carried.
At last, a draught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in the wall in front of him, and next to him he heard someone say, "First he says he wants to go, and then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the way out and he doesn't move."
K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of a pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair - the information-giver must have thrown it down there - and then he ran down the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly frightened him.
He did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did - and this was something on which he could advise himself - he wanted to spend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one.
If the maid went by and closed the door of the apparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again.
Then he wrote her a letter, both to the office and the flat, attempting once more to justify his behaviour, offered to make whatever amends he could, promised never to cross whatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance to speak to her some time, especially as he was unable to do anything with Mrs. Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss Bürstner, he finally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his room all day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his request being fulfilled, or at least that she would explain to him why she could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever stipulations she might make.
Even sharp questions like this from Mr. K. she perceived as forgiveness, or as the beginning of forgiveness.
Then he looked up at her and said, "What about the suspicions you had earlier about Miss Bürstner, have you given them up?"
"Mr. K.," called Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for this very question, as she put her hands together and held them out towards him.
"I kept asking myself why it was that Mr. K. took such an interest in Miss Bürstner.
"No," said Mrs. Grubach, "in itself it's very good to have her there, it makes another room free for me and I can let my nephew, the captain, occupy it.
Mrs. Grubach appeared quite powerless.
He began to walk up and down the room between the window and the door, thus depriving Mrs. Grubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise probably would have done.
K. heard the maid out thoughtfully, and then looked back at the shocked Mrs. Grubach in a way that was almost contemptuous.
K. looked at her with a frown.
In silence, the two of them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down facing each other.
But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had left her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled down the whole length of the room.
In that way she took control of what he wanted to say before he said it.
"That's how it is," said Miss Montag, " or rather, that's not at all how it is, the way you put it is remarkably severe.
I offered my services in taking on the task, and after some hesitation my friend conceded.
"I thank you," said K. as soon as Miss Montag had finished. He stood slowly up, looked at her, then across the table, then out the window - the house opposite stood there in the sun - and went to the door.
The courtesy he showed towards Miss Montag made a striking contrast with the way she had been treated by K. Nonetheless, Miss Montag did not seem to be cross with K. as it even seemed to him that she wanted to introduce the captain.
For a while there was silence, but then came some more sighs. His first thought was to fetch one of the servitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, but then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open.
Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good police officers over a long period - you've got to admit yourself that as far as official work was concerned we did the job well - things looked good for us, we had prospects, it's quite certain that we would've been made whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not to have anyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many complaints like that.
"Oh, I see," said K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown like a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigorous.
"If you had a senior judge here beneath your stick," said K., pressing down the cane as he spoke to stop it being raised once more, "I really would do nothing to stop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give you all the more strength."
"I'm not going to wait any longer," said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in both hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner and looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head.
"Don't shout like that!", called out K., unable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction from which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but hard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with his hands by reflex; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still found him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down while he rolled to and fro under its blows.
The yard he looked down into was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection of the moon.
K. reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it suddenly back.
The forms and bottles of ink just inside the doorway, the whip-man with his cane, the two policemen, still undressed, the candle on the shelf, and the two policemen began to wail and call out "Mr. K.!" K. slammed the door immediately shut, and even thumped on it with his fists as if that would shut it all the firmer.
"Go and get that junk room cleared out!" he shouted, and, in amazement, they stopped what they were doing. "It should have been done long ago, we're sinking in dirt!"
His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for about a month.
K. said nothing, he knew what was coming, but, suddenly relieved from the effort of the work he had been doing, he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and looked out the window at the other side of the street. From where he sat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it, part of the empty walls of houses between two shop windows.
"Uncle Karl," said K., wrenching himself back from his daydreaming, "I really don't know what it is you want of me."
Of course, I did not place too much importance on this conversation, and even did my best to put the bank clerk's mind at rest, he was quite a simple man.
But if it is not necessary, and that is what seems most likely, then at least your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look forward to it.' - She's a good child," said K.'s uncle when he had finished reading, and wiped a few tears from his eyes.
I don't like the way you're behaving," he said, looking at K. with his head at an angle, "that's not how an innocent man behaves when he's accused of something, not if he's still got any strength in him.
Then he began to walk up and down the room, stopped now and then at the window, or stood in front of a picture always making various exclamations such as, "That is totally incomprehensible to me!" or "Now just tell me, what are you supposed to make of that?!"
The young man pretended to notice nothing of this and listened to K.'s instructions through to the end, he made a few notes, bowed to both K. and his uncle and then left the room. K.'s uncle had turned his back to him and was looking out the window, bunching up the curtains with his outstretched hands.
"How's that?" asked K., looking at him.
"Things like this don't come all of a sudden, they start developing a long time beforehand, there must have been warning signs of it, why didn't you write to me?
And that's bound to weaken the effect, it won't release you from them but it'll give you room to breathe."
"Well, naturally I'll have to think about it," said his uncle, "you must bear in mind that I've been living in the country for twenty years now, almost without a break, you lose your ability to deal with matters like this.
K.'s uncle, who had already been made very angry by the long wait, turned abruptly round and retorted, "Ill?
"They've opened the door for you, now," said the gentleman, pointing at the door of the lawyer.
K. continued to look at the girl in amazement as she turned round to block the way into the living room, she had a round face like a puppy's, not only the pale cheeks and the chin were round but the temples and the hairline were too.
The maid was still standing by the door with the candle; as far as could be made out, she was watching K. more than she was watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about her.
K.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man who lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and down behind the carer, and K. would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed.
K. himself looked on calmly, he was not even disappointed at finding the lawyer unwell, he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm his uncle had developed for the matter, he was glad that this enthusiasm had now been distracted without his having to do anything about it.
It was probably just for the sake of convenience that she had repeated the words spoken by K.'s uncle, but an onlooker might even have perceived it as mocking him and he, of course, jumped up as if he had just been stabbed.
"You damned ... ," in the first gurglings of his excitement his words could hardly be understood, K. was startled even though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the intention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his hands.
"Whose business is it then?" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again.
"Oh!" said the invalid, now with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K. "Do forgive me, I didn't notice you there at all."
The lawyer now looked so much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was ill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself of one elbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a lock of hair in the middle of his beard.
"You already look much better," said K.'s uncle, "now that that witch has gone outside."
If my heart does totally give out then at least it will have found a worthy affair to fail in."
K. believed he understood not a word of this entire speech, he looked at his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on the bedside table with the candle in his hand, a medicine bottle had rolled off the table onto the floor, he nodded to everything the lawyer said, agreed to everything, and now and then looked at K. urging him to show the same compliance.
"What circles should I move in, then, if not with members of my own discipline?" the lawyer added.
"You have to realise," the lawyer continued, in a tone as if he were explaining something obvious, unnecessary and incidental, "you have to realise that I also derive great advantage for my clients from mixing with those people, and do so in many different ways, it's not something you can keep talking about all the time.
Now he stood up with a great deal of fuss, clearly unhappy that attention had been drawn to him.
"You took us by surprise, you see," said the lawyer in explanation, cheerfully indicating to the gentleman that he should come closer, which, slowly, hesitatingly, looking all around him, but with a certain dignity, he did. "The office director - oh, yes, forgive me, I haven't introduced you - this is my friend Albert K., this is his nephew, the chief clerk Josef K., and this is the office director - so, the office director was kind enough to pay me a visit.
K. was able to quietly watch everything as nobody paid any attention to him, the office director took over as leader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been called forward, the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his ear, his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of driving away his new visitors, K.'s uncle served as candle-bearer - balancing the candle on his thigh while the office director frequently glanced nervously at it - and was soon free of his embarrassment and was quickly enchanted not only by the office director's speaking manner but also by the gentle, waving hand-movements with which he accompanied it.
When he had sat down, K. continued to look round the room, it was a large room with a high ceiling, the clients of this lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it.
First you stare at me as soon as you come in, and then you keep me waiting.
And you ought to call me Leni, too," she added quickly and suddenly, as if no moment of this conversation should be lost.
Firstly, I had to listen to what the old men were saying and couldn't leave without a good reason, but secondly I'm not a bold person, if anything I'm quite shy, and you, Leni, you didn't really look like you could be won over in one stroke, either."
He was especially impressed by a large picture hanging to the right of the door, he leant forward in order to see it better.
It depicted a man wearing a judge's robes; he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone forth from the picture.
"I know him," said Leni looking up at the picture, "he comes here quite often.
But do you have to be always thinking about your trial?" she added slowly.
"Who said that?" asked K., he felt her body against his chest and looked down on her rich, dark, tightly-bound hair.
"I'd be saying too much if I told you that," answered Leni. "Please don't ask for names, but do stop making these mistakes of yours, stop being so unyielding, there's nothing you can do to defend yourself from this court, you have to confess.
"That's alright, then," she said, and made herself comfortable on his lap by smoothing out her skirt and adjusting her blouse.
Then she hung both her arms around his neck, leant back and took a long look at him.
The photograph was not one that had been taken while Elsa was posing for it, it showed her just after she had been in a wild dance such as she liked to do in wine bars, her skirt was still flung out as she span round, she had placed her hands on her firm hips and, with her neck held taut, looked to one side with a laugh; you could not see from the picture whom her laugh was intended for.
"Yes she is," said K., "I'm not going to take my word back on that."
She spread the middle and ring fingers of her right hand apart from each other. Between those fingers the flap of skin connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the little finger.
In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she wanted to show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel.
"What a freak of nature," said K., and when he had taken a look at the whole hand he added, "What a pretty claw!"
He was almost aghast as he looked up at her, now that she was so close to him there was a bitter, irritating smell from her, like pepper, she grasped his head, leant out over him, and bit and kissed his neck, even biting into his hair.
Just then, her knee slipped out and, with a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K. tried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her.
In the end the office director stood up, as he had stayed far longer than he had originally intended, made his farewell, looked at me in sympathy without being able to help, he waited at the door for a long time although it's more than I can understand why he was being so good, and then he went.
The lawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all the talking himself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly over the desk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand of hair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhaps at the very spot where K. had lain with Leni.
Once the lawyer thought he had humiliated K. sufficiently, he usually started something that would raise his spirits again.
They simply put them with the other documents and point out that, for the time being, questioning and observing the accused are much more important than anything written.
But K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that says it has to be.
The effect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole procedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like to have a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it.
This is when the defence begins.
This is where most lawyers will push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information extracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents where documents have been stolen.
There's no denying that some surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in this way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to and fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing good.
No, K. has seen for himself that the court officials, including some who are quite high up, come forward without being asked, are glad to give information which is fully open or at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the proceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite willing to adopt the other person's point of view.
And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself from this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot then be used in public, it's not something that makes it easy for the defence to keep those gentlemen's favour.
In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public, and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal trials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge here and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially difficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very simple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with their laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human relationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this.
That went on for about an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very tired and went back to his office.
It doesn't meant that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing so, it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't be told anything of what's happening.
The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact that the first documents still had not been submitted even though the trial had already lasted several months, and that, according to the lawyer, everything was still in its initial stages, which was very effective, of course, in making the defendant passive and keeping him helpless. Then he could be suddenly surprised with the verdict, or at least with a notification that the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would be passed on to a higher office.
Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to it, his finger felt for the button of the electric bell in the ante-room.
As he pressed it he glanced up to the clock. It was eleven o'clock, two hours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just dreaming and his wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had been before.
Instead, he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets, spread them out in front of K., explained several items, corrected a little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced over it all, and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he'd concluded with him about a year before, mentioning in passing that this time there was another bank spending great effort to get his business, and finally stopped speaking in order to learn K.'s opinion on the matter.
So he bent his head as if he'd been given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the papers, now and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures.
The only thing that could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturer had covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm of the chair.
Even when the door of the manager's office opened and revealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, he did no more than look up weakly.
K. thought no more about the matter, he merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director's appearance and, for him, the effect was very pleasing; the manufacturer immediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy director, although K. would have liked to make him ten times livelier as he feared the deputy director might disappear again.
He need not have worried, the two gentlemen met each other, shook each other's hand and went together over to K.'s desk.
Carefully and slowly turning his eyes upwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one of the papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it on the flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level of the two men himself.
The deputy director had been paying all his attention to the conversation and did no more than glance at the paper, he did not read what was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerk was not important for him, he took it from K.'s hand saying, "Thank you, I'm already familiar with everything", and lay it calmly back on the desk.
K. gave him a bitter, sideways look.
But the deputy director did not notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he clearly embarrassed the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its conclusion.
"It's a very important matter," said the manufacturer. "I understand that completely.
K. still had enough control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his friendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no other retaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on his desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking, took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office.
In the doorway, the manufacturer turned and said he wouldn't make his farewell with K. just yet, he would of course let the chief clerk know about the success of his discussions but he also had a little something to tell him about.
He went over to the window, sat down on the ledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the square outside.
No-one came, and that made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his face with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his place by the window.
The decision to take his defence into his own hands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed.
You're looking so worried today."
If I delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether.
He's been coming to me in my office for years from time to time, and brings little pictures with him which I buy more or less just for the sake of charity as he's hardly more than a beggar.
And even if this advice doesn't turn out to make all the difference I still think it'll be very important once you've got it.
No, if that's the case then of course you shouldn't go there under any circumstances!
But was K. not giving up more than he absolutely had to?
As K., somewhat agitated, approached the door the deputy director called out, "Oh, you've still not left!" He turned his face toward him - its many deep folds seemed to show strength rather than age - and immediately began once more to search.
Just as K. paused for a while some young girls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs, laughing.
K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who had stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they went up side by side, "Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?"
The girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed him with her elbow and looked at him sideways.
She did not smile once, but looked at K. earnestly, with sharp, acquisitive eyes.
All their faces, even in this guard of honour, showed a mixture of childishness and depravity.
The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by the skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with the other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post.
One behind the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but which K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the hunchback whirled round in his hand.
"I painted one of them once - she's not here today - and ever since then they've been following me about.
Or else, like happened yesterday, I might come back home late in the evening - please forgive my appearance and the room being in a mess, it is to do with them - so, I might come home late in the evening and want to go to bed, then I feel something pinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of them out from under it.
K. looked at the painter in astonishment.
"Yes," said the painter, and he took the shirt hanging over the easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter.
At first K. was about to say, "He certainly is a judge," but he held himself back for the time being and went closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail.
But around the figure of Justice, apart from some coloration that was barely noticeable, it remained light, and in this brightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked like neither the God of Justice nor the God of Victory, it seemed now, rather, to be a perfect depiction of the God of the Hunt.
K. found the painter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he reproached himself for staying so long without having done anything relevant to his own affair.
The painter immediately put his crayons down, stood upright, rubbed his hands together and looked at K. with a smile.
The painter even seemed to misunderstand why K. remained at the edge of the bed and urged K. to make himself comfortable, and as he hesitated he went over to the bed himself and pressed K. deep down into the bedclothes and pillows.
Then he went back to his seat and at last he asked his first objective question, which made K. forget everything else.
To make the most of his pleasure he added, "I am totally innocent."
"My being innocent does not make things simple," said K. Despite everything, he couldn't help smiling and slowly shook his head. "There are many fine details in which the court gets lost, but in the end it reaches into some place where originally there was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it."
"Quiet!" shouted the painter at the door, "Can't you see I'm talking with the gentleman?"
Nonetheless, K. looked for a while at the door, behind which the girls were now sitting quietly on the steps.
Except, that one of them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks and was moving it slowly up and down.
The painter observed the effect his explanation had had on K. and then, with a certain unease, said, "Does it not occur to you that the way I'm speaking is almost like a lawyer?
The painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in a subdued voice: "I forgot to ask you; what sort of acquittal is it you want?
"How's that?" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with a smile.
Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, "You remarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned proofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go so far as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court.
When I was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us about court cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked about the court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when I could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages in their development, I've followed them closely as far as they could be followed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single acquittal."
All the time the painter was speaking, K. was considering whether he should take off his coat, but he finally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would be quite unable to stay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversation was over.
If that's what you want I'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper.
I'll lay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and give him my personal guarantee of it.
Apart from that, proceedings go on as before, the court offices continue their business and the case gets passed to higher courts, gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on, backwards and forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, to and fro. It's impossible to know exactly what's happening while this is going on.
One day - no-one expects it - some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more closely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active, and orders the defendant's immediate arrest.
So when it happens it has hardly any effect.
"Deferment," said the painter, looking vaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectly appropriate explanation, "deferment consists of keeping proceedings permanently in their earliest stages.
The trial doesn't stop, but the defendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been acquitted.
"Will you open this door for me," said K. pulling at the handle which, as he noticed from the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls on the other side.
K. agreed to this and jumped back to the bed.
From under the bed, the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust swirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some time.
"Moorland landscape," said the painter passing the picture to K. It showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark grass.
The painter was fully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures.
A lot of people don't like that sort of picture because they're too gloomy, but there are others, and you're one of them, who love gloomy themes."
"Wrap them all up!" he called out, interrupting the painter as he was speaking, "my servant will come to fetch them in the morning."
And, at last, he leant over the bed and unlocked the door.
Even without this invitation, K. had shown no compunction in already placing his foot in the middle of the bed covers, then he looked out through the open door and drew his foot back again.
K. did not even look round at him.
But sitting in front of him and taken by surprise by his dismissal, K. would be able easily to infer everything he wanted from the lawyer's face and behaviour, even if he could not be induced to say very much.
As K. pressed on the button for the second time he looked back at the other door, but this time it, too, remained closed.
Someone unlocked the door, but kept himself pressed against it as he called back inside, "It's him!", and only then did he open the door properly.
He looked at her for a moment and then looked round at the person who had opened the door.
"Block. I'm a businessman," said the small man, twisting himself round as he thus introduced himself, although K. did not allow him to stop moving.
In front of the picture of the judge K. took hold of the businessman's braces to stop him moving on.
"You were in your nightshirt," said K., putting his hand on her head and turning it back towards the stove.
K., though, pushed her away and said, "I don't want you to kiss me now."
"Nor do I, actually," said K., looking at the businessman with a smile.
He's very unwell today, but if you want I'll tell him you're here.
She helped him off with his coat, took the hat off his head, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up, then she ran back and saw to the soup.
"Tell him I'm here first," said K.
Now he considered his affair too important to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some of his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already on her way to the lawyer.
"Be a bit more friendly," she said and, still holding the dish, turned completely round once more in the doorway.
"I don't know how you mean," said the businessman, "he's been my business lawyer - I buy and sell cereals - he's been my business lawyer since I took the business over, and that's about twenty years now, but perhaps you mean my own trial and he's been representing me in that since it started, and that's been more than five years.
Yes, well over five years," he then added, pulling out an old briefcase, "I've got everything written down; I can tell you the exact dates if you like.
"Oh yes," said the businessman, and then he whispered, "They even say he's more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters." But then he seemed to regret saying this, and he laid a hand on K.'s shoulder and said, "Please don't betray me to him, will you."
"On my lips?" asked K., pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself. "I can see nothing special about my lips.
"Do you then have that much contact with each other, exchanging each other's opinions?" said K. "I've kept myself completely apart so far."
The superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves."
"I saw those gentlemen in the waiting room," said K., "it seemed so pointless for them to be waiting in that way."
"My case," the businessman continued, "didn't move on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to every one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to the court - which I later found was entirely unnecessary - I ran back and forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court too ..."
He explained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked for, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted - like I was asking - was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me.
So I looked round for other lawyers.
Anyway, it's best not to think about them, as if you do it makes the discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless, I had that experience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing more about it.
"Not quite yet!" called out K., to turn Leni away, his hand, still resting on the businessman's hand, twitching with impatience.
"You were about to tell me about the petty lawyers," said K., shoving Leni's hand away with no further comment.
"What's wrong with you today?" asked Leni, tapped him gently and carried on with what she had been doing.
"Yes, that's right," said the businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying.
"Yeah, yeah," said Leni, looking at the businessman and laughing.
Just think, there are times when I tell him Block's here and he doesn't receive him until three days later.
K. looked questioningly at the businessman.
"You sleep in the maid's room?" asked K., as he went back to the businessman.
K. looked long at him; his first impression of the businessman had perhaps not been right; he had experience as his trial had already lasted a long time, but he had paid a heavy price for this experience.
"Bring him to bed, then!" he called out to Leni, who seemed to understand him.
"Excuse me, sir," he said, and K. looked round crossly. "You've forgotten your promise," said the businessman, stretching his hand out to K. imploringly from where he sat.
"He's sacking him!" yelled the businessman, and he jumped up from his chair and ran around the kitchen with his arms in the air.
"I've been waiting for you a very long time," said the lawyer from his bed. He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now he laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K. sharply through them.
"I find that quite acceptable," said K. The lawyer looked at him quizzically.
Being indicted does not cause any clear, precisely definable change in a person's appearance, of course.
"Yes," said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his eyes from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer better, "I wanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation from you, with immediate effect."
"Then allow me to say a few words," said the lawyer, throwing the bed cover to one side and sitting on the edge of the bed.
K. passed him the blanket and said, "You are running the risk of catching cold for no reason."
I admit that quite openly.
"After a certain point in the proceedings," said the lawyer quietly and calmly, "nothing new of any importance ever happens.
And despite all that he held on tightly to K. Why?
Was it something personal for his uncle's sake, or did he really see K.'s case as one that was exceptional and hoped to be able to distinguish himself with it, either for K.'s sake or - and this possibility could never be excluded - for his friends at the court?
It could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have.
This is partly to do with changes in the way I do business, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more on matters such as your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper understanding that I acquire from these legal matters.
What I will do is I will call Block in, unlock the door and sit down here beside the bedside table."
He lay back down in the bed, pulled the quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall.
She smiled and nodded to K., K. looked blankly back at her.
From then on, she bothered him by leaning forward over the back of the chair or, albeit very tenderly and carefully, she would run her hands through his hair and over his cheeks.
Block noticed that at least no-one was chasing him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was tense, his hands were clenched behind his back.
K. did not even glance at him, he looked instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not be seen as he had squeezed up very close to the wall.
"Wasn't I summoned?" asked Block, more to himself than the lawyer. He held his hands in front of himself as protection and would have been ready to run away any moment.
When the lawyer started speaking Block had stopped looking at the bed but stared rather into one of the corners, just listening, as if the light from the speaker were brighter than Block could bear to look at.
It was as if the lawyer had not done as Block had wanted but instead threatened him with a stick, as now Block really began to shake.
But then K. spoke to him: "What do you think you're doing?" he shouted.
"And let there be no-one besides me," said the lawyer. Block fully understood what that meant, he glowered at K., shaking his head violently.
"I won't disturb you any more," said K., leaning back in his chair. "You can kneel down or creep on all fours, whatever you like.
But Block still had some sense of pride, at least where K. was concerned, and he went towards him waving his fists, shouting as loudly as he dared while the lawyer was there.
K. said nothing. He merely looked in amazement at this distracted being, his eyes completely still.
"I will," said Block, as if speaking to himself to give himself courage, and with a quick glance to the side he kneeled down close beside the bed.
Block immediately performed the hand-kiss and, at further urging from Leni, repeated it twice more.
Then Leni leant over the lawyer, as she stretched out, the attractive shape of her body could be seen, and, bent over close to his face, she stroked his long white hair.
This was an elderly businessman, a man whose beard was long, and he was begging a young girl to speak on his behalf.
K. listened to all of this, testing it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of closely observing everything spoken here, inform a higher office about it and write a report.
He now seemed more optimistic, he moved more freely and rocked back and forth on his knees.
Block looked at her with such tension he seemed to think that although the judge's words had been spoken so long before she would be able to change them in his favour.
This judge, for instance, sees proceedings as starting at a different point from where I do.
A difference of opinion, nothing more.
Every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause of concern for him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in the office anything like as well as he had previously, he spent many hours merely pretending to do important work, but that only increased his anxiety about not being in the office.
So now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on business or even needed to make a short business trip, however much an honour it seemed - and tasks of this sort happened to have increased substantially recently - there was always the suspicion that they wanted to get him out of his office for a while and check his work, or at least the idea that they thought he was dispensable.
For this reason, he never demurred from accepting them, and even when he was asked to go on a tiring business trip lasting two days he said nothing about having to go out in the rainy autumn weather when he had a severe chill, just in order to avoid the risk of not being asked to go.
Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in and reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was already there.
K. began to anticipate many difficulties, he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said - with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it would have been pointless effort - and for the time being did no more than scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to try and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight. K. had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his alarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly getting up, turning round and leaving.
The director had, no doubt, seen the anxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of Italian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor comments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into what the Italian said so that K. could understand.
He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him - they were standing intimately close together - he had thought at first he would accompany the Italian himself, but then - he gave no more precise reason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K. with him.
It was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the mail, bank staff came with various queries and, when they saw that K. was busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to them, the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and came in frequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the ante-room opened even clients would appear from the half darkness and bow timidly to him - they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had seen them - all this activity was circling around K. with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would need, then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart.
The cathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of going there on a day like this.
K. went back to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while, and then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was waiting at another entrance.
To pass the time he opened the album and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything in the side nave next to him.
He put his torch away and went back to his place.
K. walked up to the pulpit and examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted with great care, it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness between and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K. lay his hand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then he had been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence.
"This old man is like a child," thought K., "he doesn't have the sense for anything more than serving in a church.
With a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up the side nave and almost as far as the main altar, all this time the old man continued to point at something but K. deliberately avoided looking round, he was only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to follow him.
K. looked down at the steps which, pressed close against the column, led up to the pulpit. They were so narrow they seemed to be there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to use.
But under the pulpit - K. grinned in astonishment - there really was a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and looking at K. Then he nodded very slightly, so that K. crossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier.
With a little swing, the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps.
But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check that the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly turned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular rail with both hands.
So K. began slowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew, arrived at the broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed, except for the sound of his steps, however light, which rang out on the stone floor and resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at a repeating, regular pace.
As everything could now be done openly he ran - because of curiosity and the wish to get it over with - with long flying leaps towards the pulpit.
At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit.
K. threw it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across the floor, tearing its pages.
They even influence those who aren't involved.
While he was still on one of the higher steps as he came down them the priest reached out his hand for K. to shake.
"You are very friendly towards me," said K., as they walked up and down beside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves.
The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he's from and many other things, but these are disinterested questions such as great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can't let him in.
He accepts everything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do'.
Over the first few years he curses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he becomes old, he just grumbles to himself.
'Everyone wants access to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years, no-one but me has asked to be let in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's come to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard, he shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as this entrance was meant only for you.
He stays at his post for many years and doesn't close the gate until the very end, he's very conscious of the importance of his service, as he says, 'I'm powerful,' he has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm only the lowliest of the doormen', he's not talkative, as through all these years the only questions he asks are 'disinterested', he's not corruptible, as when he's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do,' as far as fulfilling his duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as it says about the man that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests', even his external appearance suggests a pedantic character, the big hooked nose and the long, thin, black tartar-beard. How could any doorkeeper be more faithful to his duty?
The commentators say about this that, 'correct understanding of a matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually exclusive'.
He makes a joke right at the beginning, in that he invites the man to enter at the same time as maintaining the ban on his entering, and then he doesn't send him away but gives him, as it says in the text, a stool to sit on and lets him stay by the side of the door.
And finally, he lets the man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can put his last question.
There's no more than some slight impatience - the doorkeeper knows everything's come to its end - shown in the words, 'You're insatiable'. There are many commentators who go even further in explaining it in this way and think the words, 'you're insatiable' are an expression of friendly admiration, albeit with some condescension.
However you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out differently from how you might think."
"Their argument," answered the priest, "is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper.
There are various opinions about this, some say the doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to duty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeper wanted to cause him regret and sorrow.
The simple story had lost its shape, he wanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionate allowed this and accepted K.'s remarks without comment, even though his view was certainly very different from K.'s.
Once, just in front of him, he thought he could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it, although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness.
"Go to your left as far as the wall," said the priest, "then continue alongside the wall without leaving it and you'll find a way out."
"You're the prison chaplain," said K., and went closer to the priest, it was not so important for him to go straight back to the bank as he had made out, he could very well stay where he was.
He immediately stood up and looked at the gentlemen inquisitively.
"Some ancient, unimportant actors - that's what they've sent for me," said K. to himself, and looked round once again to confirm this to himself. "They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can."
As soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take K.'s arms, but K. said "Wait till we're in the street, I'm not ill." But they waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a way that K. had never experienced before.
They kept their shoulders close behind his, did not turn their arms in but twisted them around the entire length of K.'s arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp that was formal, experienced and could not be resisted.
He thought of the flies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper. "These gentleman will have some hard work to do".
He started walking, which pleased the gentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him.
All three of them now, in complete agreement, went over a bridge in the light of the moon, the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little movement made by K. as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed the group in that direction as a single unit.
Several times he looked back cautiously to see if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner between themselves and the policeman K. began to run, and the two gentlemen, despite being seriously short of breath, had to run with him.
In this way they quickly left the built up area and found themselves in the fields which, in this part of town, began almost without any transition zone.
Here they released their hold on K., who just waited in silence, and took their top hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off their brows with their handkerchiefs.
Then he carefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed, even if not in the near future.
He did not want to expose K. to the chilly night air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and walked up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked round the quarry for a suitable place.
The gentlemen sat K. down on the ground, leant him against the stone and settled his head down on the top of it.
The repulsive courtesies began once again, one of them passed the knife over K. to the other, who then passed it back over K. to the first.
He saw how a light flickered on and the two halves of a window opened out, somebody, made weak and thin by the height and the distance, leant suddenly far out from it and stretched his arms out even further.
It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.
He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.
He slid back into his former position.
He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung.
Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not.
His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: "Gregor, open the door, I beg of you."
The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.
So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side.
When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him.
"Gregor", said his father now from the room to his left, "the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the early train.
So please open up this door.
Then the chief clerk called "Good morning, Mr. Samsa".
In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.
This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation.
"But Sir", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, "I'll open up immediately, just a moment.
The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it.
And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly?
Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs.
Gregor's mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast.
His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.
But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left.
The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it!
And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not - be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.
His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: "Help, for pity's sake, Help!" The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.
"Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.
Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time.
A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.
In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through.
He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there.
But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.
That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room.
It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.
Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in.
But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.
However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up - using a rag, not her bare hands - and carried it out.
There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt.
Then, out of consideration for Gregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked.
He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch.
Half suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.
She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.
Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.
Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier.
They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.
There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent.
Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.
He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.
One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible.
In itself, his sister's not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her.
One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.
His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully.
Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.
Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.
First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.
Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance.
Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him.
He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch.
She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.
They were emptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school - he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women's intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.
He sat unyielding on his picture.
But Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed: "Oh God, oh God!" Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.
She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut with her foot.
Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father.
He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp.
He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor.
Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him.
And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly.
Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him.
An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off without doing any harm.
Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.
All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.
Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on.
Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother "you're doing so much sewing again today!", as if he did not know that he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.
Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: "What a life!
This is what peace I get in my old age!" And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.
They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more.
And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor's room and say "Close that door, Grete", and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.
Gregor's mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.
Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back. "Aren't you coming any closer, then?", she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.
Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.
At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there.
Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen.
The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.
She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of the way in a corner.
"Mr. Samsa!", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward.
The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.
Under his sister's experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.
He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something.
And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: "And we also give immediate notice."
"Father, Mother", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, "we can't carry on like this.
His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.
He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile. "We have to try and get rid of it", said Gregor's sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, "it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming.
And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements. "My child", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, "what are we to do?"
In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.
But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister.
All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor.
Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.
As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead.
She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents "At last!".
"What now, then?", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness.
This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural.
He thought back of his family with emotion and love.
Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.
When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special.
She thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him.
She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: "Come and 'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"
"Dead?", asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking.
"That's what I said", replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.
The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about.
"Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's room.
"I mean just what I said", answered Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man.
"Alright, we'll go then", he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision.
Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times.
At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said.
Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.
The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation.
Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to.
So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out "Cheerio then, everyone", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.
Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while.
All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.
He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.
But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt.
And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power.
The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.
Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not send colonies.
The Spartans held Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy, nevertheless they lost them.
Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion.
This man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.
Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them—two most inconstant and unstable things.
States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.
For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke.
After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house.
This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia.
Afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their advocates.
And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister.
One morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion.
Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo.
When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him.
No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest.
After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince.
Nabis, Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece, and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile.
It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others.
It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.
Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke.
Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person.
I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.
Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other.
From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy.
They had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom.
This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men.
And the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.
Therefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to few.
I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it.
And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength.
And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.
Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal.
This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.
And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.
Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women.
For this he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery.
The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature.
Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.
You must know there are two ways of contesting, the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second.
But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.
That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty.
Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni, who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi.
Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king.
Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started.
But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him.
Afterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life.
From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends.
Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state.
In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions.
Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them.
Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate.
He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the Romans urged them to take up arms.
And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are generally ruined.
But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.
The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince.
Philip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the kingdom.
This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.
One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.
The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him.
For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat.
To all of us this barbarous dominion stinks.
Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.
The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.
It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy—a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off.
He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin—to the severe and long-continued illness—indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution—of a tenderly beloved sister, his sole companion for long years, his last and only relative on earth.
Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.
We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.
And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend.
Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened—I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.
In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.
It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read.
“And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.”
At the termination of this sentence I started and, for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)—it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described.
I continued the story:
The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea—for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.
Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:
“And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.”
Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.
Madman!”—here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul—“Madman!
As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell, the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws.
He turned his plump, well-kept body over on the springy sofa as if he wished to have another long sleep, and tightly embracing one of the pillows leant his cheek against it; but then suddenly opened his eyes and sat up.
There were many other delightful things which I can't just get hold of – can't catch now I'm awake.' Then, noticing a streak of light that had made its way in at the side of the blind, he gaily let down his legs and felt about with his feet for his slippers finished with bronze kid (last year's birthday present, embroidered by his wife); and from nine years' habit he stretched out his arm, without rising, towards where his dressing-gown usually hung in their bedroom.
That's the tragedy of it!' he thought. 'Oh dear, oh dear!' he muttered despairingly, as he recalled the most painful details of the quarrel.
Oblonsky kept repeating to himself, and could arrive at no conclusion. 'And how well everything was going on till now – how happily we lived!
He could no longer find forgetfulness in sleep, at any rate not before night, could not go back to the music and the songs of the little decanter-women, consequently he must seek forgetfulness in the dream of life.
'We'll see when the time comes,' thought Oblonsky, and got up, put on his grey dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the cords and drawing a full breath of air into his broad chest went with his usual firm tread toward the window, turning out his feet that carried his stout body so lightly, drew up the blind and rang loudly.
Oblonsky did not answer, but glanced at Matthew's face in the looking-glass. From their looks, as they met in the glass, it was evident that they understood one another.
Matthew put his hands into the pocket of his jacket, put out his foot, and looked at his master with a slight, good-humoured smile.
He tore open the telegram and read it, guessing at the words, which (as so often happens in telegrams) were misspelt, and his face brightened.
'Darya Alexandrovna told me to say that she is going away. "He may do as he pleases" – that is, as you please, sir,' he said, laughing with his eyes only; and, putting his hands in his pockets, with his head on one side, he gazed at his master.
'Ah, Matthew!' he said, shaking his head.
'All right – now go,' said Oblonsky, suddenly blushing. 'I must get dressed,' said he, turning to Matthew, and he resolutely threw off his dressing-gown.
Matthew blew some invisible speck off the shirt which he held ready gathered up like a horse's collar, and with evident pleasure invested with it his master's carefully tended body.
WHEN HE WAS QUITE DRESSED Oblonsky sprinkled some scent on himself, pulled down his cuffs, and as usual distributing in different pockets his cigarette-case, matches, pocket-book, and the watch with its double chain and bunch of charms, he shook out his handkerchief, and feeling clean, sweet, healthy, and physically bright in spite of his misfortune, went with a slight spring in each step into the dining-room where his coffee stood ready. Beside the coffee lay letters and papers from the Office.
And although neither science, art, nor politics specially interested him, he firmly held to the opinions of the majority and of his paper on those subjects, changing his views when the majority changed theirs, – or rather, not changing them – they changed imperceptibly of their own accord.
He read the leading article, which explained that in our time it is needless to raise the cry that Radicalism is threatening to swallow up all Conservative elements and to maintain that the Government should take measures to crush the hydra of revolution; for, on the contrary, 'in our opinion the danger lies not in an imaginary hydra of revolution but in an obstinate clinging to tradition which hampers progress,' etc. He also read the finance article in which Bentham and Mill were mentioned and hits were made at the Ministry.
Taking a box of sweets from the mantelpiece where he had put it the day before, he chose two sweets which he knew she liked best, a chocolate and a coloured cream.
'Yes, yes,' and stroking her shoulder he kissed her hair at the roots and her neck, and let her go.
The woman, widow of a petty official named Kalinin was petitioning for something impossible and absurd, but nevertheless Oblonsky, with his usual politeness, asked her to sit down and heard her attentively to the end, gave her full instructions how and to whom to apply and even wrote briskly and fluently in his large, graceful and legible hand a little note to a personage who might be of use to her.
Having dismissed her, he took his hat and paused to consider whether he had forgotten anything.
'Oh yes!' His head dropped, and his handsome face became worried.
He expanded his chest, took out a cigarette, lit it, took two whiffs, then threw it into a pearl-shell ash-tray, and crossing the drawing-room with rapid steps, he opened the door which led into his wife's bedroom.
She felt that it was impossible for her to leave; but still deceiving herself, she went an sorting the things and pretending that she really would go.
On seeing her husband she thrust her arms into a drawer of the wardrobe as if looking for something, and only when he had come close to her did she turn her face toward him.
'What's that to do with me?
I can't receive her!' she exclaimed.
Her eyes drooped and she waited to hear what he would say, as if entreating him to persuade her somehow that she had made a mistake.
'Dolly!' he said, now actually sobbing, 'for heaven's sake think of the children – they have done nothing!
She tried again and again to speak and could not.
But she had spoken of 'our children,' and looking gratefully at her he moved to take her hand; but she stepped aside with a look of repugnance.
'It is awful, awful!' he muttered.
Then she rose quickly and moved toward the door.
She went out, slamming the door.
It is dreadfully banal, dreadfully!' For a few seconds Oblonsky stood alone; then he wiped his eyes, sighed, and expanding his chest went out of the room.
It was a Friday, the day on which a German clockmaker always came to wind up the clocks.
'Well, perhaps things will shape themselves – "shape themselves"!
That's a good phrase,' he thought. 'I must use that.'
Oblonsky put on his fur coat, and went out into the porch.
Oh, and here's some money,' said he, taking a ten-rouble note out of his pocket-book. 'Will it be enough?'
'Enough or not, we shall have to manage, that's clear,' said Matthew, closing the carriage door and stepping back into the porch.
Meanwhile Darya Alexandrovna after soothing the child, knowing from the sound of the carriage wheels that her husband had gone, returned to her bedroom.
It was her only place of refuge from household cares.
'Oh, do leave me alone!' she cried; and returning to her bedroom she sat down where she had sat when talking with her husband. Locking together her thin fingers, on which her rings hung loosely, she went over in her mind the whole of their conversation.
Even if we go on living in the same house, we are strangers – strangers for ever!' she repeated, specially emphasizing the word that was so dreadful to her. 'And how I loved him!
Having arrived at his destination, Oblonsky; respectfully followed by the door-keeper bearing his portfolio, entered his little private room, put on his uniform, and came out into the Office.
All the Members from beneath the Emperor's portrait and from behind the Mirror of Justice, glad of some distraction, looked toward the door; but the door-keeper at once turned out the intruder and closed the glass doors behind him.
When the Report had been read, Oblonsky rose, stretching himself, and, paying tribute to the Liberalism of the times, took out a cigarette before leaving the Office to go to his private room.
'Some man came in without permission, your Excellency, when I wasn't looking.
A lanky official, going down with a portfolio, stopped, with a disapproving look at the feet of the man running upstairs, and then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky, who was standing at the top of the stairs.
His kindly face, beaming over the gold-embroidered collar of his uniform, grew still more radiant when he recognized the man who was coming up.
Levin, at last!' he said, scrutinizing the approaching Levin with a friendly mocking smile. 'How is it you deign to look me up in this den?' he asked; and not contented with pressing his friend's hand, he kissed him.
Levin and Oblonsky were almost of the same age; and with Levin, Oblonsky was on familiar terms not through champagne only.
Similarly, Levin in his heart despised the town life his friend was leading, and his official duties which he considered futile and ridiculed.
'We have long been expecting you,' said Oblonsky entering his private room and releasing Levin's arm, as if to show that here all danger was past. 'I'm very, very glad to see you!' continued he.
'I have the honour of knowing your brother, Sergius Ivanich,' said Grinevich, holding out his narrow hand with the long fingernails.
Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and immediately turned to Oblonsky.
'The two words are... however, it's nothing particular,' said Levin, and his face became almost vicious in his efforts to overcome his shyness.
The Secretary came in, familiarly respectful, though with a certain modest consciousness (common to all secretaries) of his superiority to his chief in knowledge of business affairs, approached Oblonsky with some papers and on the plea of asking a question began to explain some difficulty.
Oblonsky, without hearing him to the end, put his hand in a kindly way on the Secretary's sleeve and, softening his remark with a smile, said:
'No; please do it as I said,' and, having in a few words explained his view of the matter, he pushed the paper away and said finally: 'Yes, please do it that way, Zachary Nikitich!'
'That'll be all right!' said Levin and left the room, only recollecting when already at the door that he had not taken leave of Oblonsky's colleagues.
'Yes, my dear fellow,' said Oblonsky, shaking his head, 'and he's a lucky man!
All the members of that family, especially the women, appeared to him as though wrapped in some mystic poetic veil, and he not only saw no defects in them, but imagined behind that poetic veil the loftiest feelings and every possible perfection.
Then he began falling in love with the second daughter. He seemed to feel that he must fall in love with one of the sisters, but he was not sure with which.
But when he had come to Moscow early in the winter of this year and met them, he knew at last which of the three sisters he was really fated to love.
Having spent two months in Moscow, living as in a fog, meeting Kitty almost every day in Society which he began to frequent in order to meet her, he suddenly made up his mind that it was impossible, and returned to the country.
HAVING REACHED MOSCOW BY A MORNING TRAIN, Levin went to stay at the house of his half-brother Koznyshev, who was older than he, and after changing his clothes entered his brother's study, intending to tell him why he had come and to ask his advice. But his brother was not alone.
When Levin entered, Sergius Ivanich greeted him with the coldly affable smile he bestowed on everybody and, having introduced him to the professor, went on with the discussion.
The small spectacled man with the narrow forehead interrupted the conversation a moment to say, 'how do you do' to Levin and, paying no further attention to him, went on talking.
The professor, vexed and apparently mentally hurt by the interruption, turned to look at this strange questioner who resembled a barge-hauler rather than a philosopher, and then looked at Koznyshev, as if asking, 'What can one say to this?'
'We have not the data...' added the professor and went back to his arguments. 'No,' said he; 'I point out that if, as Pripasov definitely states, sensation is based on impressions, we must still carefully distinguish between these two perceptions.'
Levin listened no longer but sat waiting for the professor to go.
WHEN THE PROFESSOR HAD GONE, Koznyshev turned to his step-brother.
'We Russians are always like that. It may be a good trait in us – this capacity to see our own faults – but we overdo it, and comfort ourselves with sarcasm, which is always ready on our tongues.
Do you know?' Levin rose from his chair as if meaning to go at once.
Koznyshev took a note from under a paper-weight and handed it to his brother.
'He evidently wants to offend me,' continued Koznyshev,' but he cannot do that. I wish with all my heart I could help him, but I know it can't be done.'
What are you doing? What's the matter?
A few more steps brought him to the skating lake, and among all the skaters he at once recognized her.
Nicholas Shcherbatsky, Kitty's cousin, in a short jacket, tight trousers, with skates on his feet, was sitting on a bench, and seeing Levin, called out to him.
The ice is splendid – put on your skates!'
She was not very firm on her feet. Having drawn her hands from the muff that hung by a cord from her neck, she held them out and looking at Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him and at her fears.
Having turned the corner, she pushed off with an elastic little foot, glided straight up to Shcherbatsky, and catching hold of him with her hand, nodded smilingly to Levin.
She looked attentively at him as if wishing to understand his confusion.
There is a tradition here that you are the best skater,' she said, flicking off with a small black-gloved hand some hoar-frost crystals that had fallen on her muff.
He stood up, took off his overcoat, and having given himself a start on the rough ice near the shelter, glided down to the smooth surface of the lake, increasing and diminishing his speed and shaping his course as if by volition only.
She gave him her hand and they went on together, increasing their speed, and the faster they went the closer she pressed his hands.
Help me, O Lord!' thought Levin, hastening toward the old Frenchwoman with the grey curls; who sat on one of the benches.
'Yes, you see we grow up,' she said, indicating Kitty with a glance, 'and grow old. "Tiny Bear" is grown up!' continued the Frenchwoman, laughing and reminding him of his old joke when he called the three young ladies the Three Bears of the English fairy tale.
Whether she had not heard his words or did not wish to hear them, anyhow, after slightly stumbling and striking her foot twice against the ice, she skated hurriedly away from him toward Mlle Linon, said something to her, and went toward the little house where the ladies took off their skates.
O Lord, help me and teach me!' prayed Levin, and feeling at the same time a need of violent exercise, he got up speed and described inner and outer circles.
Just then a young man, the best of the new skaters, with a cigarette in his mouth and skates on, came out of the coffee-room, and taking a run, descended the steps leading to the lake, clattering with his skates as he jumped from step to step.
Nicholas Shcherbatsky called out.
He caught his foot on the last step, but, scarcely touching the ice with his hand, made a violent effort, regained his balance, and skated away laughing.
He then took off his skates and overtook mother and daughter at the gates of the Gardens.
She turned her head and said smilingly:
Levin was considering what the change in Kitty's face meant now; persuading himself that there was hope, now in despair, seeing clearly that such hope was madness; but yet feeling an altogether different being from what he had been before her smile and the words 'Au revoir!'
Oblonsky during the drive was composing the menu of their dinner.
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE RESTAURANT Levin could not help noticing something peculiar in his friend's expression, a kind of suppressed radiance in his face and whole figure. Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat on one side walked into the dining-room, giving his orders to the Tartar waiters, in their swallow-tail coats, with napkins under their arms, who attached themselves to him. Bowing right and left to his acquaintances who, here as elsewhere, greeted him joyfully, he passed on to the buffet, drank a glass of vodka and ate a bit of fish as hors-d'oeuvre, and said something to the painted Frenchwoman, bedecked with ribbons and lace, who sat at a little counter – something that made even this Frenchwoman burst into frank laughter.
'If you please, your Excellency,' he said, turning to Levin and as a mark of respect to Oblonsky paying attention to his guest. In a moment he had spread a fresh cloth on a round table already covered with a cloth beneath a bronze chandelier, moved two velvet chairs to the table, and stood with a napkin and menu awaiting the order.
'They may be Flensburg, but are they fresh?'
'Printanier,' chimed in the waiter.
'What, to begin with?
'Cachet blanc,' chimed in the waiter.
'You don't care much for oysters?' said Oblonsky, emptying his champagne glass – 'or perhaps you're thinking of something else. Eh?'
We try to get our hands into a state convenient to work with, and for that purpose we cut our nails and sometimes roll up our sleeves.
'Possibly; but still it seems to me strange that while we country people try to get over our meals as quickly as we can, so as to be able to get on with our work, here you and I try to make our meal last as long as possible, and therefore eat oysters.'
However, I don't want to talk about myself, and besides it's impossible to explain everything,' said Oblonsky. 'Well, and why have you come to Moscow?...
'I do, but I can't begin to speak about it, – by which you can judge whether my guess is right or wrong,' said Oblonsky, looking at him with a subtle smile.
Oblonsky slowly drank his glass of Chablis, his eyes fixed on Levin.
Do you know what we are talking about?' said Levin, peering into his interlocutor's face. 'You think it possible?'
'Wait a bit: you must take some sauce,' said Oblonsky, stopping Levin's hand that was pushing away the sauce-boat.
'I am telling you what I think,' said Oblonsky smiling. 'And I'll tell you something more.
My wife is a most wonderful woman...' He sighed, remembering his relations with his wife; then after a minute's pause he continued: 'She has the gift of clairvoyance.
But enough – enough about it!' and he got up.
'Ah, but all the same,' said Levin, 'looking back at my life, I tremble and curse and bitterly regret...
LEVIN EMPTIED HIS GLASS and they were silent for a while.
And at once he thought of his brother Nicholas and how mean he was to forget him.
Levin leant back in his chair. His face was pale.
I can't drink any more,' said Levin pushing his glass aside, 'or I shall be tipsy... Well, and how are you getting on?' he continued, evidently wishing to change the subject.
Things are in a bad way with me too, very bad, and all on account of women.
Here Levin recollecting his own sins and the inner struggle he had lived through added unexpectedly,
You have a consistent character yourself and you wish all the facts of life to be consistent, but they never are.
All the variety, charm and beauty of life are made up of light and shade.'
The Princess with a woman's way of talking round the question said that Kitty was too young, that Levin had not shown that his intentions were serious, that Kitty was not in love with him, and so on; but she did not say the most important things, namely that she expected a better match for her daughter, that she did not like Levin and did not understand him.
Her fiancé about whom everything was known beforehand came, saw his intended bride, and was seen by her people, then the matchmaking aunt learnt what was thought on each side, and passed on the information. All was satisfactory.
But to her mother they appeared in a different light.
Hard as it was to see the misfortune of Dolly, her eldest daughter (who thought of leaving her husband), the Princess's anxiety as to her youngest daughter's fate, now about to be decided, entirely absorbed her.
She felt that this evening, when those two men were to meet for the first time, would decide her fate; and she kept picturing them to herself, now individually and now together.
I came on purpose... that... to be my wife!' he uttered hardly knowing what he said; but feeling that the worst was out he stopped and looked at her.
She remembered Vronsky, lifted her clear, truthful eyes to Levin's face, and noticing his despair she replied quickly:
BUT JUST AT THAT moment the Princess came in.
Kitty sat with downcast eyes. 'Thank Heaven she has refused him,' thought the mother, and her face brightened into the usual smile with which she greeted her visitors on Thursday evenings.
Five minutes later Kitty's friend the Countess Nordston, who had married the year before, came in.
The Countess at once attacked Levin.
So you have returned to our depraved Babylon!' she said, holding out her tiny yellow hand and repeating the words he had used early in the winter when he had called Moscow 'Babylon,' – 'Has Babylon improved or have you deteriorated?' she added, and turned toward Kitty with a sarcastic smile.
'Why, of course, I always write them down.
'Mr. Levin,' she began, 'explain to me, please, you who know everything, how it is that at our Kaluga estate the peasant men and women have drunk everything they had, and never pay anything they owe us.
'Excuse me, Countess, but really I know nothing about it, and can't tell you anything,' he said, and as he turned he saw an officer who had come into the room behind the lady.
She had already glanced at Vronsky and then turned toward Levin.
When he moved toward her his fine eyes brightened with a special tenderness, and carefully and respectfully bending over her with a scarcely perceptible, happy, and (as it seemed to Levin) modestly-triumphant smile, he held out to her his small broad hand.
Having greeted and spoken a few words to every one else, he sat down without having once looked at Levin, who had not taken his eyes off him.
Vronsky glanced at him and at the Countess, and smiled.
Noticing that the Countess Nordston wished to say something, he stopped without finishing what he was saying, and listened attentively to her.
'Ah, Countess, you must really take me there. For goodness' sake take me to them!
Vronsky listened attentively to Levin as he always listened, evidently interested in what he was saying.
'For this reason,' Levin again interrupted him, 'that with electricity, you need only rub a piece of resin against wool, and you will always produce a certain phenomenon, but this other does not always act, so it is not a natural force.'
Just as the others began settling round the table and Levin was about to go, the old Prince came in, and having greeted the ladies he turned to Levin.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but in my opinion playing at hunt the ring is more amusing,' said the old Prince, looking at Vronsky and guessing that he had started the thing. 'After all there is some sense in "Hunting the ring."-'
Vronsky's unflinching eye glanced in astonishment at the old Prince, and slightly smiling he at once began talking to the Countess Nordston about the ball that was to take place the next week.
She vividly pictured to herself that strong manly face, that well-bred calm and the kindness toward everybody he always showed: she remembered the love the man she loved bore her, and again became joyful and with a happy smile put her head on her pillow.
Whether she repented of having drawn Levin on or of having rejected him she did not know, but her happiness was troubled by doubts.
'Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy,' she repeated to herself till she fell asleep. Meanwhile below in the Prince's little study her parents were having one of their frequent scenes about their favourite daughter.
I'll tell you what!' shouted the Prince flourishing his arms and immediately again wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown around him. 'You have no pride, no dignity, you disgrace and ruin your daughter by this vile idiotic match-making.'
Invite all the young puppies,' so the Prince called the Moscow young men, 'have a pianist and let them dance; but don't have the sort of thing we had to-night – these suitors and this pairing off.
On leaving that Corps as a very young and brilliant officer he at once joined the swim of the wealthy military Petersburg set.
Though he occasionally went into the highest Petersburg Society, all his love interests lay outside it.
'The Club: a game of bezique, a bottle of champagne with Ignatev?
He went straight to his rooms at the Hotel Dusseau, had supper, and after undressing had hardly laid his head on his pillow before he was fast asleep.
'My mother,' replied Vronsky, shaking hands and smiling (as everybody did when meeting Oblonsky) as they went up the steps together. 'She is coming from Petersburg to-day.'
Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed not to deny the implication but he immediately changed the subject.
But perhaps not... I really can't remember,' answered Vronsky absent-mindedly, the name Karenina suggesting to him some one stiff and dull.
The approach of the train was made more and more evident by the increasing bustle and preparation on the platform and the arrival of people who had come to meet the train.
But yesterday there were special reasons,' continued Oblonsky with a significant smile, quite forgetting the sincere sympathy he had felt for his friend the day before, and now only feeling the same sympathy for Vronsky. 'Yes, there was a reason why he had to be either specially happy or specially unhappy.'
'Yes, it is a painful position! That is why so many prefer women of the demi-monde.
The sprightly guard blew his whistle and jumped off while the train was still moving, and impatient passengers began to descend one after another: an officer of the guards, erect and looking sternly round, a fidgety little tradesman with a bag, a peasant with a sack over his shoulder.
His words roused Vronsky from his reverie and reminded him of his mother and of the coming meeting.
In the depths of his heart he did not respect his mother and (though this he never acknowledged to himself) did not love her, but in accordance with the views of the set he lived in, and as a result of his education, he could not imagine himself treating her in any way but one altogether submissive and respectful; the more submissive and respectful he was externally, the less he honoured and loved her in his heart.
He apologized for being in her way and was about to enter the carriage, but felt compelled to have another look at her, not because she was very beautiful nor because of the elegance and modest grace of her whole figure, but because he saw in her sweet face as she passed him something specially tender and kind.
When he looked round she too turned her head.
It was as if an excess of vitality so filled her whole being that it betrayed itself against her will, now in her smile, now in the light of her eyes.
She deliberately tried to extinguish that light in her eyes, but it shone despite of her in her faint smile.
She rose from the seat, and giving her hand-bag to her maid held out her small dry hand to her son, then lifting his head which had been bent to kiss her hand kissed him on his face.
'Au revoir, Ivan Petrovich, and please if you see my brother send him to me,' said the lady, closing the door and again entering the compartment.
'Excuse my not recognizing you before. Our acquaintance was so slight,' he said with a bow, 'that I am sure you do not remember me.'
Vronsky did not take his eyes off her, and kept smiling, he knew not why.
Mrs. Karenina again entered the carriage to take leave of the Countess.
But she evidently did not wish to continue the conversation in that tone, and turned to the old Countess.
She blushed, stooped a little, and held out her face for the Countess to kiss, then she stood up again, and with the same smile hovering between her lips and eyes held out her hand to Vronsky.
He followed her with his eyes as long as he could see her graceful form, and his face retained its smile.
Vronsky gave his arm to his mother, but, just as they were coming out of the carriage, several people ran past them with frightened faces. The station-master with his peculiar coloured cap also ran past them.
Oblonsky, with his sister on his arm, also turned back, and, avoiding the crowd, stood with frightened faces beside the carriage.
The ladies re-entered the carriage, while Vronsky and Oblonsky followed the crowd, to find out about the accident.
'Oh, if you had seen it, Countess,' said Oblonsky. And his wife was there...
It was dreadful to see her.
At the exit the stationmaster overtook them, and said to Vronsky:
'You have given it!' exclaimed Oblonsky behind Vronsky, and pressing his sister's arm he added, 'Very kind, very kind!
WHEN ANNA ARRIVED Dolly was sitting in her little drawing-room giving a fair-haired, plump little boy (who already resembled his father) a French reading-lesson.
The boy, as he read, kept twisting and trying to pull off a loose button that hung from his jacket.
At last she pulled the button off and put it into her pocket.
She took off her shawl and her hat and, having caught it in her black and very curly hair, shook her head to disengage it.
'Why, dear me, here is Tanya! You're just the same age as my little Serezha,' she added, turning to the little girl who had run into the room, and, taking her in her arms, Anna kissed her.
Anna took hold of the tray, but then pushed it aside.
Dolly looked coldly at Anna.
Her bright eyes under their thick lashes suddenly filled with tears.
Dolly looked at her inquiringly.
She hurriedly drew out her handkerchief and hid her face in it. 'I could perhaps understand a momentary slip,' she went on after a pause, 'but deliberately, cunningly to deceive me... and with whom?
He is ashamed of the children, and that, loving you... yes, yes, loving you more than anything else in the world,' she hurriedly went on, not listening to Dolly who was about to reply, 'he has hurt you, hit you so hard. He kept saying, ' "No, no, she will not forgive me!"-'
Dolly, gazing beyond her sister-in-law, listened thoughtfully.
Yes, I can,' said Anna, after a minute's consideration. Her mind had taken in and weighed the situation, and she added, 'Yes, I can, I can.
She spent the earlier part of the day with Dolly and the children, and sent a note to her brother to be sure and come home to dinner. 'Come,' she wrote.
There was still the same estrangement in their manner to each other, but no longer any question of separating, and Oblonsky saw that explanation and reconciliation were possible.
After dinner, when Dolly had gone to her own room, Anna got up quickly and went to her brother who was just lighting a cigar.
When Oblonsky had gone, she returned to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children.
It's always jolly at the Bobrishchevs' and also at the Nikitins', while it's always dull at the Mezhkovs'.
'I imagine you at that ball in lilac!'
'All together!' said Anna laughing and running to meet them, and putting her arms round them she tumbled the whole heap of children – struggling and shrieking joyfully – on to the floor.
'Oh, please don't trouble about me,' said Anna, scrutinizing Dolly's face and trying to discover whether a reconciliation had taken place.
While they were talking about their mutual Petersburg acquaintances Anna rose suddenly.
For toward ten o'clock – the time when she generally said good-night to her son and often put him to bed herself before going to a ball – she felt sad at being so far from him, and, whatever they talked about, her thoughts kept returning to her curly-headed Serezha.
'Papers from the office for me, I expect,' said Oblonsky.
A footman ran up to announce the new arrival, who stood at the foot of the stairs under a lamp.
When Anna returned with her album he had already gone, and Oblonsky was saying that Vronsky had called to inquire about a dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who was visiting Moscow, but that he could not be induced to come in. 'He seemed so queer,' added Oblonsky.
There was nothing extraordinary or strange in the fact that a man had called at half-past nine at a friend's house to ask about a dinner they were planning and that he would not come in; but it seemed strange to all of them.
From the ballroom as from a bee-hive came the regular sound of movement, and while they were arranging their hair and dresses before a mirror on the landing between the plants they heard the accurate measured sounds of the orchestra violins just beginning the first waltz.
A little old man, who had smoothed the grey hair on his temples before the mirror and who smelt strongly of scent, happened to jostle them on the stairs, and stepped aside in evident admiration of Kitty, whom he did not know.
A beardless youth, one of those whom the old Prince Shcherbatsky called puppies, with a very low-cut waistcoat, straightening his white tie as he went along, bowed to them and ran past but returned to ask Kitty for a quadrille.
When, just before entering the ball-room, her mother wished to put straight a twisted end of her sash, Kitty drew slightly back: she felt that everything on her must be naturally right and graceful and that there was no need to adjust anything.
He had just left the Countess Bonin, with whom he had danced the first round of the waltz, and looking round his domain – that is to say, a few couples who had begun to dance – he noticed Kitty just coming in. He approached her at that peculiar free and easy amble natural only to Masters of Ceremonies, bowed, and, without even asking her consent, put his arm round her slim waist.
She looked about for some one to hold her fan and the mistress of the house took it from her with a smile.
She was not a girl just come out, for whom all faces at a ball blend into one fairy-like vision; nor was she a girl who had been dragged from ball to ball till all the faces were familiar to dullness. She was between those two extremes, and though elated was able to control herself sufficiently to be observant.
There was the beauty Lida, Korsunsky's wife, in an impossibly low dress, and the hostess, and there shone the bald head of Krivin who was always where the elite were; youths who had not the courage to approach gazed in that direction, and there Kitty's eyes found Stephen, and then the lovely head and beautiful figure of Anna, in a black velvet dress.
And Korsunsky waltzed toward the left of the room, gradually diminishing his step and repeating 'Pardon, mesdames, pardon, pardon, mesdames,' as he steered through that sea of lace, tulle and ribbons without touching as much as a feather, and then turned his partner so suddenly that her delicate ankles in the open-work stockings appeared as her train spread out like a fan and covered Krivin's knees.
Korsunsky bowed, straightened his broad shirt front, and offered Kitty his arm to conduct her to Anna.
'No, I am not going to throw the first stone,' she was saying in reply to some question, adding, with a shrug of her shoulders, 'although I cannot understand it'; and at once she turned to Kitty with a tender protecting smile.
'You even come into the room dancing,' she said. 'She is one of my most faithful helpers,' said Korsunsky, turning to Anna whom he had not yet seen.
He came up to Kitty, reminding her of the first quadrille and regretting that he had not seen her for such a long time.
Kitty, while gazing with admiration at Anna waltzing, listened to him, expecting him to ask her to waltz, but he did not do so and she glanced at him with surprise.
Nothing special was said during the quadrille: they talked in snatches about the Korsunskys, husband and wife, whom Vronsky very amusingly described as dear forty-year-old children, and about a proposed Stage Society, and only once did the conversation touch her to the quick – when he asked her about Levin, whether he was still in Moscow, and added that he had liked him very much.
That he did not ask her for the mazurka while they were dancing the quadrille did not disturb her.
She was sure that she would dance the mazurka with him as at previous balls, and she refused five other partners for that dance, saying that she was already engaged.
'All or only one?' And without trying to help her youthful partner who was painfully struggling to carry on the conversation the thread of which he had lost, as she mechanically obeyed the merry, loud, and authoritative orders of Korsunsky, who commanded every one to form now a grand rond, now a chaine, she watched, and her heart sank more and more.
'No, it is not the admiration of the crowd that intoxicates her, but the rapture of one, and that one is... can it be he?' Every time he spoke to Anna the joyful light kindled in her eyes and a smile of pleasure curved her rosy lips.
She went to the far end of a little drawing-room and sank into an easy chair.
Her light skirt stood out like a cloud round her slight body; one thin bare girlish arm dropped listlessly and sank into the pink folds of her tunic, the other hand held a fan with which she rapidly fanned her flushed face.
But although she seemed like a butterfly just settled on a blade of grass and ready at any moment to flutter and spread its rainbow wings, her heart was crushed with terrible despair.
'But perhaps I am mistaken, perhaps it was nothing of the kind?' And she again recalled all that she had witnessed.
'Kitty, are you not dancing the mazurka?'
Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite to her.
On Vronsky's face, usually so firm and self-possessed she noticed that expression of bewilderment and submission which had so surprised her – an expression like that of an intelligent dog when it feels guilty.
Some supernatural power attracted Kitty's eyes to Anna's face.
Kitty, as she moved toward Anna, gazed at her with fear.
Anna half-closed her eyes to look at Kitty, smiled and pressed her hand, but noticing that Kitty only responded to her smile by a look of surprise and despair, she turned away from her and talked cheerfully with the other lady.
'Come, Anna Arkadyevna,' began Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm under his, 'I have such a good idea for a cotillion – Un bijou.'
And yet I, instead of looking him up, dined out and came here.' Levin went up to a lamp-post and read his brother's address which he had in his pocket-book, and then hired a sledge.
'I will tell him everything, I will get him to tell me everything. I will show him that I love and therefore understand him,' Levin decided in his mind, as toward eleven o'clock he drove up to the hotel of which he had the address.
No one noticed him, and, as he took off his goloshes, he overheard what the man in the workman's coat was saying.
His hair was thinner but the same straight moustache covered his lips; and the same eyes with their peculiar, naive gaze looked out at the new-comer.
But at the same moment he turned to look at the young man and convulsively jerked his head and neck as if his necktie were strangling him, a movement Levin knew well, and quite another expression – a wild, suffering, and cruel look – settled on his haggard face.
And he glanced round at everybody present as was his way.
'And this woman,' said Nicholas Levin, interrupting him, and pointing to her, 'is my life's companion, Mary Nikolavna; I took her out of a house...' and as he said this he again jerked his neck. 'But I love and respect her and beg all those who wish to know me,' he added, raising his voice and scowling, 'to love and respect her.
'SO YOU SEE...' NICHOLAS LEVIN CONTINUED with an effort, wrinkling his brow and twitching.
Constantine hardly listened.
And this system must be changed,' he concluded, with an inquiring look at his brother.
This is why!' suddenly shouted Nicholas at the mention of the name. 'This is why.
Go, go in God's name!' he exclaimed, rising from his chair. 'Go, go!'
Meanwhile Mary Nikolavna had come back.
Nicholas gave her an angry look.
She hurried up to him and said something in a whisper.
'Why not?' irritably answered Nicholas, still addressing Kritsky.
Come to-morrow and bring the locksmith.'
But at that moment Kritsky called him from outside the door.
Left alone with Mary Nikolavna, Levin spoke to her.
She's a street girl, and you are a gentleman,' he muttered jerking his neck. 'You, I see, have examined and weighed everything here, and regard my errors with compassion,' he continued, again raising his voice.
Nicholas jerked his head and grew thoughtful.
How well I remember the garden-house and the sofa!... Mind, don't change anything in the house, but get married soon and set things going again as they used to be.
'Enough, Nicholas Dmitrich!' said Mary Nikolavna, stretching out her plump arm with its bare wrist to take the bottle.
Mary Nikolavna gave a mild, kindly smile, which evoked one from Nicholas, and she took away the bottle.
No one but the magistrate, when she was tried for an attempt to escape from the house of ill fame, ever spoke to her so politely... Oh heavens, how senseless everything is in this world!' he suddenly exclaimed.
His speech began to grow confused and he jumped from one subject to another.
With Masha's help Constantine succeeded in persuading him not to go out anywhere, and got him into bed quite tipsy.
NEXT MORNING CONSTANTINE LEVIN LEFT MOSCOW and toward evening he reached home.
First of all he decided that he would no longer hope for the exceptional happiness which marriage was to have given him, and consequently he would not underrate the present as he had done.
And it all seemed to him so easy to carry out that he was in a pleasant reverie the whole way home, and it was with cheerful hopes for a new and better life that he reached his house toward nine o'clock in the evening.
He heard a creaking of steps at the door and hurriedly put down the dumb-bells.
'Kuzma, bring me my sheep-skin.
Crossing the yard past the heap of snow by the lilac bush, he reached the shed.
'Show a light here, Theodore, here,' said Levin, examining the calf. 'Like its mother,' he said, 'although the colour is its father's; very fine, big-boned and deep-flanked.
He went straight from the cow-shed to the office, and after talking things over with the steward and with Simon the contractor, he returned to the house and went directly upstairs to the drawing-room.
Levin could scarcely remember his mother. His conception of her was to him a sacred memory, and in his imagination his future wife was to be a repetition of the enchanting and holy ideal of womanhood that his mother had been.
He could not imagine the love of woman without marriage, and even pictured to himself a family first and then the woman who would give him the family.
When he had settled in the arm-chair in the little drawing room where he always had his tea, and Agatha Mikhaylovna had brought it in for him and had sat down at the window with her usual remark, 'I will sit down sir!' he felt that, strange to say, he had not really forgotten his dreams and that he could not live without them.
He read his book, and followed what he read, stopping now and then to listen to Agatha Mikhaylovna, who chattered indefatigably; and at the same time various pictures of farming and future family life arose disconnectedly in his mind.
He returned to his book. 'Well, let us grant that electricity and heat are one and the same, but can we substitute the one quantity for the other in solving an equation?
He lifted his head and pondered. Old Laska, who had not yet quite digested her joy at her master's return and had run out to bark in the yard, now came back, bringing a smell of fresh air with her into the room and, wagging her tail, she approached him and putting her head under his hand whined plaintively, asking to be patted.
Levin looked at her intently, surprised that she knew so well what was in his mind.
Laska kept on pushing her head under his hand.
He patted her a little, and she curled herself up at his feet with her head on her outstretched hind paw.
And to show that all was now well and satisfactory, she slightly opened her mouth, smacked her sticky lips, and drawing them more closely over her old teeth lay still in blissful peace.
It sometimes happens to me. I feel ready to cry.
Anna looked at her with her eyes wet with tears.
This is a confession of something that oppresses me, and I want to make it to you,' said Anna, determinedly throwing herself back in an arm-chair and looking straight into Dolly's eyes.
But at the moment when she uttered these words she knew they were untrue: she not only distrusted herself but was agitated by the thought of Vronsky, and was leaving sooner than she had intended only that she might not meet him again.
'Oh, my goodness! How stupid it would be,' said Anna, and again a deep flush of pleasure suffused her face at hearing the thought that occupied her mind expressed in words.
Anna's emotion had spread to Dolly, who as she embraced her sister-in-law for the last time whispered:
With her deft little hands she unlocked her red bag, took out a small pillow which she placed on her knees, and locked the bag again; then she carefully wrapped up her feet and sat down comfortably.
Anna said a few words in answer, but not foreseeing anything interesting from the conversation asked her maid to get out her reading-lamp, fixed it to the arm of her seat, and took a paper-knife and an English novel from her handbag.
She put down her book, leaned back, and clasped the paper-knife tightly in both hands.
She recalled the ball and Vronsky and his humble, enamoured gaze, and their relations with one another; there was nothing to be ashamed of.
To get over it she rose, threw off her wrap, and took off the cape of her coat.
The peasant in the long coat started gnawing at something on the wall; the old woman began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage, which she filled with a black cloud; then something squeaked and clattered in a dreadful manner, as if some one was being torn to pieces; then a blinding red light appeared, and at last everything was hidden by a wall.
She asked Annushka to give her the cape she had removed and a shawl, and putting them on she moved to the door.
And this too struck her as amusing.
The wind seemed only to have waited for her: it whistled merrily and tried to seize and carry her off, but she held on to the cold door-post and held down her shawl, then stepping on to the platform she moved away from the carriage.
Yet people, merrily exchanging remarks, ran over the creaking boards of the platform, and the big station doors were constantly being opened and shut.
The shadow of a man stooping slipped past her feet and she heard a hammer striking the carriage wheels. 'Let me have the telegram!' came an angry voice from the other side out of the stormy darkness.
She took another deep breath to get her fill of fresh air and had already drawn her hand out of her muff to take hold of the handrail and get into the train when another man wearing a military overcoat came close between her and the wavering light of the lamp.
For some time she looked into his face without answering, and, though he stood in the shade she noticed, or thought she noticed, the expression of his face and eyes.
Toward morning Anna, while still sitting up, fell into a doze; when she woke it was already light and the train was approaching Petersburg.
What has happened to his ears?' she thought, gazing at his cold and commanding figure, and especially at the gristly ears which now so struck her, pressing as they did against the rim of his hat.
She was particularly struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced when she met him. It was that ordinary well-known feeling, as if she were dissembling, which she experienced in regard to her husband, but formerly she had not noticed it, while now she was clearly and painfully conscious of it.
He sat in his place, his eyes staring straight before him, not observing the people who went in or out, and if previously his appearance of imperturbable calm had struck and annoyed those who did not know him, he now seemed to them even prouder and more self-confident.
The young man repeatedly lit his cigarette at Vronsky's, talked to him, and even jostled him to prove that he was not a thing but a man; yet Vronsky still looked at him as at a street lamp, and the young man made grimaces, feeling that he was losing self-control under the stress of this refusal to regard him as human.
He felt himself a king, not because he believed that he had made an impression on Anna – he did not yet believe that – but because the impression she had made on him filled him with happiness and pride.
When he returned to the train, he kept recalling all the positions in which he had seen her, and all her words; and in his imagination, causing his heart to stand still, floated pictures of a possible future.
Karenin's gait, the swinging of his thighs, and his wide short feet, particularly offended Vronsky, who acknowledged only his own unquestionable right to love Anna.
But she was still the same, and the sight of her still affected him physically, exhilarating and stimulating him and filling him with joy.
He ordered his German valet, who had run up from a second-class carriage, to get his luggage and take it home, and he himself went up to her.
Her face seemed tired and had none of that play which showed now in a smile and now in the animation of her eyes; but just for an instant as she looked at him he saw a gleam in her eyes and, though the spark was at once extinguished, that one instant made him happy.
She glanced at her husband to see whether he knew Vronsky.
Karenin looked at him with displeasure, absently trying to recall who he might be.
Vronsky's calm self-confidence struck like a scythe on a stone against the cold self-confidence of Karenin.
'You travelled there with the mother and came back with the son,' he said, uttering every word distinctly as though it were something valuable he was giving away. 'I suppose you are returning from furlough?' he remarked; and without waiting for an answer said to his wife in his playful manner: 'Well, were many tears shed in Moscow over the parting?'
Karenin glanced at him with his weary eyes.
Now I shan't have to dine alone,' he went on, no longer in a bantering manner. 'You can't think how I used...'
He ran down the stairs to her regardless of his governess's cries, and with desperate delight called out: 'Mama! Mama!'
'I told you it was Mama!' he shouted to the governess.
'I knew!' Her son, like his father, produced on Anna a feeling akin to disappointment.
Anna experienced an almost physical pleasure in feeling his proximity and his caresses, and a moral solace when she met his simple, trustful, and loving gaze and heard his naive questions.
She unpacked the presents which Dolly's children had sent him, and told him that there was a girl in Moscow whose name was Tanya, who could read and even teach other children.
She then went on to tell her of other unpleasantnesses, and of the underhand opposition to the plan for uniting the Churches, and she went away in a hurry, as she had that afternoon to be at a meeting of another society as well as to attend a Slavonic Committee meeting.
In her accustomed conditions of life she again felt firm and blameless.
KARENIN RETURNED FROM THE MINISTRY at four o'clock, but, as often happened, he had no time to go up and see his wife.
Exactly at five – the bronze clock (style of Peter I) had not finished striking – Karenin entered in evening dress with a white tie and two stars on his coat, as he had to attend an official meeting directly after dinner.
Completely to regain her composure, she went to the nursery and spent the evening with her son. She put him to bed herself, made the sign of the cross over him, and tucked him up.
Exactly at half-past nine there was a ring at the front door, and he entered the room.
But have a wash and smarten yourself up,' said the Baroness, again sitting down and carefully turning a small screw of the coffee-pot. 'Pierre, pass me the coffee,' she said to Petritsky whom, not concealing their relations, she called Pierre (the French for Peter), because of his surname.
'I want to begin an action.
You see how absurd it is, that because I am supposed to be unfaithful,' she said contemptuously, 'he wishes to have the use of my property.'
Vronsky listened with pleasure to the merry prattle of the pretty young woman, agreed with what she said, and half in fun gave her advice; in a word he immediately took up his habitual manner with women of her kind.
The coffee never got made, but boiled over and splashed everybody, effecting just what was required: that is, it gave an excuse for much noise and laughter, staining the valuable carpet and the Baroness's dress.
But, in general, everything was first-rate and extremely jolly; and without letting his friend go into the details of his position Petritsky began telling him all the interesting news.
'Impossible!' he cried, releasing the pedal of his washstand, which controlled a jet of water under which he was bathing his healthy, ruddy neck. 'Impossible!' he cried, at the news that Laura was under the protection of Mileyev and had thrown up Fertinhof.
"Here, this is one of the new ones," says the Grand Duchess, turning it over, and – just fancy! – out tumbles a pear and sweets – two pounds of them!... The dear fellow had collected them in his helmet!'
Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the help of his valet, put on his uniform and went to report himself.
As usual in Petersburg, he left the house not to return till late at night.
TOWARD THE END OF THE WINTER a consultation was held at the Shcherbatskys' which was intended to ascertain the state of Kitty's health and to decide what should be done to restore her failing strength. She was ill, and with the approach of spring grew worse.
He considered this natural because he did it every day, and did not, it seemed to him, either feel or think anything wrong when he did it. He therefore considered the feeling of shame in a girl to be not only a relic of barbarism but an insult to him.
The doctor meanwhile found it hard not to show his contempt for the old fellow, and with difficulty descended to the level of his comprehension.
And the celebrity explained his plan of a treatment with Soden Water, the chief reason for prescribing this evidently being that it could do no harm.
The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully to the end.
Her treatment seemed to her as absurd as piecing together the bits of a smashed vase.
He sat down opposite to her, smiling, felt her pulse and again began asking tiresome questions.
She answered him, but suddenly grew angry and rose.
Added to this the care of a large family worried her continually: either something went wrong with the feeding of the baby or the nurse left, or, as now, one of the children fell ill.
The old Prince came out of his study after the doctor had gone, and after giving his cheek to Dolly and greeting her he turned to his wife:
She lifted her face and, forcing a smile, looked up at him.
She bent toward him, blushing, and expecting a kiss, but he only patted her on the head and remarked:
One can't get at one's real daughter, but only caresses the hair of expired females.
'No, he is always preparing to go.'
I'm all obedience,' he said to his wife, as he sat down again. 'And look here, Kate,' he went on, turning to his youngest daughter: 'You must wake up one fine morning and say to yourself "Why, I am quite well and happy, and will go out to walk in the frost again with Papa."
She could not gather spirit enough to reply. She made an attempt, but suddenly burst into tears and ran away.
The Prince listened for some time to her rebukes in silence, but his face frowned more and more.
'Oh, it makes me sick to hear it!' muttered the Prince gloomily, rising as if he meant to go away, but stopping at the door. 'The laws are there, my dear, and since you have invited it I will tell you who is at fault for it all: you, and you, and no one but you!
Yes, now go and dose her, and call in these quacks!'
The Prince appeared to have much more to say, but as soon as the Princess heard his tone she, as always happened in serious cases, gave in and became repentant.
'Alexander, Alexander,' she whispered, moving nearer and bursting into tears.
As soon as she began to cry the Prince quieted down, and came up to her.
She took off her bonnet and, having mentally rolled up her sleeves, prepared for action.
When the Prince flared up she kept silent, feeling shame for her mother and tenderness toward her father because of his immediate return to kindliness; but when her father left the room she was ready for the chief thing needful, which was to go to Kitty and comfort her.
Kitty glanced at her sister, but the cold and rather severe expression of her face did not change.
She turned on her chair, blushed, and began rapidly moving her fingers, pressing now with one hand and now with the other the buckle of a belt she was holding.
The mention of Levin seemed to deprive Kitty of the last fragments of self-control: she jumped up from her chair, threw the buckle on the floor, and rapidly gesticulating with her hands she began:
Having said these words she looked at her sister and, seeing that Dolly remained silent with her head bowed sadly, Kitty, instead of leaving the room as she had intended to do, sat down by the door, and hiding her face in her handkerchief let her head sink down.
Mama takes me to a ball: and it seems to me she only takes me there to marry me off as quickly as possible and get rid of me.
And Kitty insisted on having her own way, went to her sister's, and nursed the children all through the scarlet fever that really attacked them.
But now, on her return from Moscow, that circle became unbearable to her.
She avoided her moral friends and went into grand Society.
There she saw Vronsky, and experienced a tremulous joy when meeting him.
She gave him no encouragement, but every time they met there sprang up that feeling of animation which had seized her in the train on the morning when she first saw him.
A famous prima donna was giving her second performance and all high Society was at the Opera House.
'Why did you not come to dinner?' she said, adding with a smile and so that only he could hear her: 'I am amazed at the clairvoyance of lovers! She was not there!
'And how well I remember your ridicule!' continued the Princess Betsy, who took particular pleasure in following the progress of this passion. 'What has become of it all?
'You must tell me all about it,' she said, rising. 'Come back in the next interval.'
'-"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be saved!"-' said Betsy, remembering that she had heard some one say something like that. 'Well, then, sit down and tell me about it.'
And she sat down again.
'IT'S RATHER IMPROPER but so charming that I long to tell it,' said Vronsky, gazing at her with laughing eyes. 'I shan't mention names.'
They see that a pretty woman in a hired sledge is passing them, looking at them, and laughing and nodding to them – at any rate they think so.
She runs up to the top flat.
No one knows; but their host's footman, in answer to their question whether "girls" lived there, replies that there are a lot of them thereabouts. After dinner the young men go into the host's study to compose a letter to the fair stranger, and, having written one full of passion and containing a declaration, they carry it upstairs themselves, in order to explain anything that might not be quite clear in the letter.'
The maid, quite bewildered, carries on the negotiations.
The Titular Councillor lodges a complaint, and I turn into a peacemaker – and what a peacemaker!...
The Titular Councillor again softens. "I am willing to forgive them, Count, but you must understand that my wife, a respectable woman, has been subjected to the rudeness and insults of these hobbledehoys, these scound...'
And you must remember that one of the hobbledehoys is standing there, and I have to reconcile them! Again I set my diplomacy going, and again, just as the whole business should be concluded, my Titular Councillor flies into a rage, gets red, his sausages stick out, and again I dissolve into diplomatic subtlety.'
'Well, bonne chance!' she added, giving Vronsky a finger that was not engaged in holding her fan, and with a movement of her shoulders making the bodice of her dress, that had risen a little, slip down again that she might be befittingly nude on returning to the front of the box into the glare of gas-light and the gaze of all eyes.
PRINCESS BETSY WENT HOME without waiting for the end of the last act.
The visitors passed beneath the broad portico, and the massive hall porter, who in the morning read a newspaper behind the glass panes of the front door for the edification of passers-by, now noiselessly opened this enormous door to admit them.
The hostess sat down beside the samovar and took off her gloves.
The Princess Myagkaya was seated midway between the two circles, listening and taking part in the conversation of both. 'This very same sentence about Kaulbach has been repeated to me by three different people to-day, as if by arrangement.
The theme is everything.
Stepping silently on the thick carpet, he approached the Princess Myagkaya.
In the Society in which she lived words of that kind produced the effect of a most witty joke.
'No, we are very comfortable here,' replied the ambassador's wife smiling, and she continued the interrupted conversation.
'That's it, that's just it,' rejoined the Princess Myagkaya, turning quickly toward him. 'But the point is, that I won't abandon Anna to you.
Having snubbed Anna's friend handsomely, the Princess Myagkaya rose with the ambassador's wife and joined those at the table, where there was a general conversation about the King of Prussia.
'Ah! Here you are at last!' she added, smilingly addressing Vronsky as he entered the room.
Vronsky not only knew everybody in the room, but saw them all every day, so he entered in the calm manner of one who rejoins those from whom he has parted only a short time before.
'And everybody would go there if it were considered the thing, as the opera is,' put in the Princess Myagkaya.
He gazed joyfully, intently, and yet timidly at the lady who was entering, and slowly rose from his seat.
Anna entered the room holding herself, as usual, very erect, and without changing the direction of her eyes approached her hostess, walking with that quick, firm yet light step which distinguished her from other Society women. She shook hands; smilingly, and with the same smile looked round at Vronsky.
But immediately, nodding rapidly to her acquaintances and pressing the hands extended to her, she turned again to her hostess:
Anna glanced sternly at him.
Anna rose and went up to Betsy.
'I often think men don't understand honour, though they are always talking about it,' said Anna, without answering his question. 'I have long wanted to tell you,' she added, and, moving a few steps to a side table on which lay some albums, she sat down.
'Why say that to me?' she asked, looking severely at him.
I see the possibility of despair, misfortune... or of happiness – what happiness!... Is it impossible?' he added with his lips only, but she heard.
She exerted all the powers of her mind to say what she ought; but instead she fixed on him her eyes filled with love and did not answer at all.
'Friends we shall not be, you know that yourself; but whether we shall be the happiest or the most miserable of human beings... rests with you.'
He glanced at his wife and Vronsky, went up to the hostess, and having sat down with a cup of tea began talking in his deliberate and always clear tones, in his usual ironical way ridiculing somebody.
Not these two ladies alone, but nearly all those present in the drawing-room, even the Princess Myagkaya and Betsy herself, several times glanced across at the pair who had gone away from the general circle, as if their having done so disturbed the others.
Noticing the unpleasant impression produced on every one, the Princess Betsy manoeuvred for some one else to take her place and to listen to Karenin, and she herself went up to Anna.
'Oh yes!' said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a single word of what Betsy was saying; and going across to the big table she joined in the general conversation.
The Karenins' fat old Tartar coachman, in his shiny leather coat, was finding it hard to control the near grey horse that had grown restive with cold, waiting before the portico.
'Love,' she slowly repeated to herself, and suddenly while releasing the lace, she added aloud: 'The reason I dislike that word is that it means too much for me, far more than you can understand,' and she looked him in the face. 'Au revoir!'
When he reached home he went to his study as usual, seated himself in his easy-chair, and opened a book on the Papacy at the place where his paper-knife was inserted. He read till one o'clock as was his wont, only now and then rubbing his high forehead and jerking his head as if driving something away.
He felt that he could not lie down, till he had thought over these newly-arisen circumstances. When Karenin had decided to talk the matter over with his wife, it had seemed to him quite easy and simple to do so; but now, when he began considering how to approach her, the matter appeared very difficult and complicated.
Karenin was being confronted with life – with the possibility of his wife's loving somebody else, and this seemed stupid and incomprehensible to him, because it was life itself.
He now experienced a sensation such as a man might feel who, while quietly crossing a bridge over an abyss, suddenly sees that the bridge is being taken to pieces and that he is facing the abyss.
He did not undress, but paced up and down with his even step on the resounding parquet floor of the dining-room, which was lit by one lamp, over the carpet of the dark drawing-room, where a light was reflected only from a recently painted portrait of himself which hung above the sofa, and on through her sitting-room, where two candles were burning, lighting up the portraits of her relatives and friends and the elegant knick-knacks, long familiar to him, on her writing-table.
Through her room he reached the door of their bedroom and then turned back again.
At the bedroom door he turned back, and as soon as he re-entered the dark drawing-room a voice seemed to whisper that it was not so, and that if others noticed, that showed that there must have been something for them to notice.
'I must think it over, come to a decision, and throw it off,' he said aloud.
Thinking it over, he regretted having to spend his time and powers of mind on inconspicuous domestic affairs; but nevertheless, clearly and definitely, as though it were an official report, the form and sequence of the speech he had to make shaped itself in his mind. 'I must make the following quite clear: First, the importance of public opinion and propriety; secondly, the religious meaning of marriage; thirdly, if necessary, I must refer to the harm that may result to our son; fourthly, allude to her own unhappiness.'
That movement – a bad habit of cracking his fingers – always tranquillized him and brought him back to that precision of mind which he now so needed.
A woman's steps were heard ascending the stairs.
On seeing her husband she lifted her head and, as if awaking from sleep, smiled.
What a wonder!' she said, throwing off her hood, and without pausing she went on to her dressing-room. 'Alexis Alexandrovich, it's high time!' she added from beyond the door.
'With me?' she said with surprise, coming back from the other room and looking at him. 'What is it?
Your too animated conversation to-night with Count Vronsky' (he pronounced the name firmly and with quiet deliberation) 'attracted attention.'
'I have not the right to inquire into all the details of your feelings, and in general I consider it useless and even harmful to do so,' began Karenin. 'By digging into our souls, we often dig up what might better have remained there unnoticed.
Your feelings concern your own conscience, but it is my duty to you, to myself, and to God, to point out to you your duties.
Besides...' she added, rapidly, and hardly repressing a smile, 'it really is bedtime.'
His lips were sternly compressed and his eyes did not look at her.
For a long time she lay still with wide-open eyes, the brightness of which it seemed to her she could herself see in the darkness.
Anna went into Society as before, frequently visiting the Princess Betsy, and she met Vronsky everywhere.
She met all his efforts to bring about an explanation by presenting an impenetrable wall of merry perplexity.
Each time he began to think about it, he felt that he must try again, that by kindness, tenderness, and persuasion there was still a hope of saving her and obliging her to bethink herself. Every day he prepared himself to have a talk with her.
But the louder he spoke the lower she drooped her once proud, bright, but now dishonoured head, and she writhed, slipping down from the sofa on which she sat to the floor at his feet. She would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her.
The shame she felt at her spiritual nakedness communicated itself to him.
Then, as the murderer desperately throws himself on the body, as though with passion, and drags it and hacks it, so Vronsky covered her face and shoulders with kisses. She held his hand and did not move.
He knelt down and tried to see her face, but she hid it and did not speak.
At last, as though mastering herself, she sat up and pushed him away.
'What bliss?' she said with disgust and horror, and the horror was involuntarily communicated to him. 'For heaven's sake, not another word!'
But that calm, necessary for reflection, never came. Every time the thought of what she had done, and of what was to become of her and of what she should do, came to her mind, she was seized with horror and drove these thoughts away.
One dream she had almost every night.
This lovely spring roused Levin still more and confirmed him in the determination completely to renounce the past in order to fashion his solitary life firmly and independently.
So that in spite of his solitary life, or rather because of it, his time was completely filled up; only occasionally he felt an unsatisfied desire to share with some one besides Agatha Mikhaylovna the thoughts that wandered through his brain – for even with her he often discussed physics, agricultural theories, and especially philosophy, which last was her favourite subject.
On the Thursday the wind fell and a thick grey mist rose as if to hide the secret of the changes nature was carrying on.
Beneath the mist the snow-waters rushed down, the ice on the river cracked and moved, and the turbid, foaming torrents flowed quicker, till on the first Sunday after Easter toward evening the mists dissolved, the clouds broke into fleecy cloudlets and dispersed, the sky cleared, and real spring was there.
The cattle, who had lost all but a few patches of their winter coats, began to low in the meadows; the crooked-legged lambs began to play round their bleating mothers, who were losing their wool; swift-footed children began to run along the quickly-drying paths marked with imprints of bare feet, the merry voices of women who were bleaching their linen began to chatter by the ponds, and the axes of peasants, getting ready their wooden ploughs and harrows, clicked in the yards.
The dairymaids, with twigs in their hands, holding their skirts up over their bare white legs, not yet sun-burnt, splashed through the puddles into the yard, driving the calves, who were mad with the joy of spring.
'Tell me what I keep you for!' he shouted; but remembering that this would not help matters, he stopped in the middle of what he was saying and only sighed.
Levin waved his hand angrily and went to the barn to look at the oats, then he came back to the stable.
The oats were not yet spoilt, but the men were turning them over with shovels whereas they should have let them run down from the loft. Levin ordered them to do this, told off two of the men to help sow the clover, and got over his vexation with the foreman.
The foreman listened attentively and evidently tried to approve of his master's plans: but his face still wore that hopeless and despondent expression so familiar to Levin.
That force was opposing him again.
But don't I know,' he added laughing, 'that you always want less of everything and worse? However, this year I will not let you have your way.
'You won't be able to cross the brook, Constantine Dmitrich,' the coachman called out.
On seeing the master the labourer Vasily moved toward the cart and Mishka began to sow.
You drag half a hundredweight on your boots.'
He looked at the strides Mishka took dragging the enormous lumps of earth that stuck to his feet, dismounted, took the seed-basket from Vasily, and prepared to sow.
Vasily pointed to a mark with his foot and Levin began scattering the seeds and earth as best he could.
It was hard walking, and having done a row Levin, wet with perspiration, stopped and gave back the basket.
'Oh, you'll see when the summer comes.
You just look where I sowed last spring, how regularly I scattered it over.
'Well, mind and rub the lumps,' said Levin, going up to his horse, 'and keep an eye on Mishka, and if the clover comes up well you shall have fifty kopeks for each desyatina.'
The horse sank into the ground up to its pasterns and drew each foot out of the half-thawed earth with a smacking noise.
Levin rode back by the way that led across the brook, hoping that the water would have gone down, and he did manage to ford the stream, scaring two ducks in so doing. 'There must be some snipe too,' he thought, and just at the turning to his house he met the keeper, who confirmed his supposition.
He touched up his horse and, having passed the acacia trees, saw a hired three-horse sledge coming from the station and in it a gentleman in a fur coat.
Agatha Mikhaylovna, always much concerned about the honour of the house, met him in the hall with questions about dinner.
As usual during his solitude a mass of thoughts and feelings he could not express to those around had collected in his mind, and now he poured out to Oblonsky the poetic joy of spring, his failures, his plans concerning the estate, his thoughts and remarks about the books he had read, and especially the idea of his own book, the basis of which, though he did not notice it himself, was a criticism of all previous works on agriculture.
Oblonsky, always pleasant and quick at understanding everything from a hint, was specially pleasant on this visit; there was a new trait in him which Levin noticed and was flattered by – a kind of respect and a sort of tenderness toward him.
At that moment Agatha Mikhaylovna came in with some jam.
Oblonsky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the varnished case, opened it, and set to work to put together his valuable gun, which was of the newest type.
Kuzma, already scenting a substantial tip, did not leave Oblonsky for a moment. He put on his stockings and his boots for him, and Oblonsky willingly allowed him to do so.
He sat down, wrapped a rug round his legs, and lit a cigar. 'How is it you don't smoke.?
Oblonsky understood and looked at him but said nothing.
Well, there are such women in reality, and these women are terrible.
When they had reached the wood Levin got down and led Oblonsky to the corner of a mossy and marshy glade, already free from snow.
He himself went to a forked birch on the other side and, leaning his gun against the fork of the lower branch, took off his coat, tightened his girdle, and tried whether he could move his arms freely.
The sun was setting behind the forest, and the little birches interspersed among the aspen trees stood out clearly against the evening glow with their drooping branches and their swollen buds ready to burst into leaf.
From the thicket, where the snow had not all melted, the water still flowed in branching streamlets with a gentle rippling sound.
Small birds chirped and now and then flew from tree to tree.
A hawk flew leisurely past, high above the distant forest; another followed in the same direction and vanished.
A tawny owl hooted near by, and Laska started, took a few careful steps, and with her head on one side again listened intently.
Listen, they're coming!' Levin almost shouted, cocking his gun.
Levin looked to the right and to the left, and there before him against the dull light-blue sky, over the lower branches of the aspen tops, appeared the flying birds.
They were flying straight toward him; the near sound of their cry – something like the sound made when tightly stretched cloth is steadily torn – seemed close to his ears; the long beak and neck of a bird were quite visible, and just as Levin took aim a red flash came from behind the bush where Oblonsky was standing and the bird descended like an arrow and then fluttered up again.
While they were talking Laska, pricking her ears, kept looking up at the sky and then reproachfully at them.
But at that moment both men heard a shrill whistle that seemed to smite on their ears; they both seized their guns, and there were two flashes and two reports at the same moment.
The woodcock that was flying high up instantly folded its wings and fell into the thicket, bending down the thin young shoots.
Oblonsky gave a scarcely perceptible smile on noticing the quick change, so familiar to him, in Levin's face, which became as gloomy as it had been bright a moment before.
He would not consider a deal which would bring him in ten or fifteen per cent; he waits till he can buy at a fifth of the value.'
'Oh, come!
'Not at all,' said Levin gloomily, just as they drove up to the house.
Ryabinin himself was already in the house and met the two friends in the hall.
He wiped his face all round with his handkerchief, and smoothing his coat, which was already quite in order, smilingly greeted the new arrivals. He held out his hand to Oblonsky as if he were trying to catch something.
He glanced at the book cupboards and book-shelves with the same look of doubt as he had bestowed on the snipe, smiled contemptuously, and again shook his head disapprovingly, decidedly refusing to admit that this game could be worth the candle.
Ryabinin rose and smiled silently, surveying Levin from his feet to his head.
Absolutely everything nowadays goes before a jury, everything is judged honourably, there's no possibility of stealing.
With his bony fingers he rapidly unfastened his coat, exposing his braided shirt, the brass buttons of his waistcoat, and a watch-chain, and quickly took out a thick old pocket-book.
'If you please, the forest is mine,' he said, rapidly crossing himself and holding out his hand. 'Take your money, the forest is mine.
That's the way Ryabinin does business, no fussing about kopeks,' he said, frowning and flourishing his pocket-book.
Levin went out and slammed the door.
Ryabinin looked at it and smiled, shaking his head.
"That's so," responded the clerk, handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron. "But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail Ignatitch?"
'And Constantine Levin is in a very bad temper,' said Oblonsky, smiling.
And do you know why?
At present the peasants around here are buying land – that does not pain me. The squire does nothing, the peasant works and squeezes out the idler.
Anyway the thing is done and there's an end to it. And here come the fried eggs, just the way I like them best.
'Yes, electric light,' said Levin. 'Yes, by the by, where is Vronsky now?' he asked, suddenly putting down the soap.
The interests of the regiment occupied an important place in his life, because he was fond of his regiment and still more because the regiment was fond of him.
He did not distinguish what kind of love it was, great or small, passionate or passionless, guilty or pure (he himself, the father of a family, kept a ballet girl, and was therefore lenient in these matters): but he knew that it was a love affair which displeased those whom it is necessary to please, and he therefore disapproved of his brother's conduct.
It was not necessary for him to train very strictly as his weight was just the regulation eleven-and-a-half stone, but he had to be careful not to get fatter and therefore avoided sweets and starchy foods.
Two officers appeared at the entrance door: one with a weak thin face, a young officer who had just joined the regiment from the Cadet Corps; the other a plump old officer with a bracelet on his arm and small eyes sunk in a bloated face.
Vronsky glanced at them, frowned, and, as if he had not noticed them, turned his eyes on his book and began to eat and read at the same time.
'Waiter, sherry!' said Vronsky without replying, and moving his book to the other side of his plate he continued to read.
The plump officer took the wine-list and turned to the young one. 'You choose what we shall drink,' said he, handing him the list and looking at him.
'Suppose we have some Rhine wine,' said the young one, turning his eyes timidly to Vronsky while his fingers tried to catch hold of his just-budding moustache.
The plump officer got up obediently and they made their way toward the door.
At that moment Captain Yashvin, a tall man with a fine figure, entered the room, and having given a contemptuous backward nod to the two officers he came up to Vronsky.
Vronsky looked up angrily, but his face brightened at once into its characteristic look of quiet, firm kindliness.
The conversation turned to the forecast of the day's race, the only subject Vronsky could now think about.
Here in camp also, Petritsky lived with him.
And drawing up his blanket he threw himself back on his pillow. 'Leave me alone, Yashvin!' he said angrily to Yashvin, who was pulling the blanket off him.
'Vodka, you think, eh?' asked Petritsky, making a face and rubbing his eyes.
Let us have a drink together! Vronsky, will you have a drink?' said Petritsky, getting up and wrapping himself to the arms in a rug of tiger-skin pattern.
He went to the partition door, held up his hands, and began singing in French, ' "There was a king in Thule!" Vronsky, will you have a drink?'
Petritsky, still singing, winked his eyes and pouted as if to say, 'We know what sort of Bryansky it is.'
Here it is!' and Petritsky drew the letter from under the mattress where he had put it.
Vronsky knew that it all referred to the same subject. 'What business is it of theirs?' thought he, and crumpling up the letters he pushed them in between the buttons of his coat, to be read more attentively on the way.
'To the stables!' he said, and was taking out the letter to read, but then changed his mind, not wishing to be upset before examining his horse. 'Later will do!...'
A lean Englishman in top boots and a short jacket, with only a tuft of beard left under his chin, came to meet him with the awkward gait of a jockey, swaying from side to side with his elbows sticking out.
'Come along,' said the Englishman frowning and speaking as before without opening his mouth. Swaying his elbows and walking with his loose gait he led the way.
A smart, well-dressed lad in a short and clean jacket, with a broom in his hand, met them and followed them.
Mak... I never can pronounce his name,' said the Englishman over his shoulder, pointing with his black-nailed thumb to Gladiator's box.
In the box stood a muzzled dark-bay mare stepping from foot to foot among the fresh litter.
The muscles, clearly marked beneath the network of sinews, stretched in the fine, mobile skin, which was smooth as satin, seemed hard as bone.
As soon as Vronsky entered, she drew a deep breath and, turning her prominent eyes so that their whites became bloodshot, looked from the other side of the box at the new-comers, shook her muzzle, and stepped lightly from foot to foot.
But the nearer he came the more nervous she grew.
Vronsky stroked her firm neck, adjusted a lock of her mane that had got on to the wrong side of her sharply-defined withers and brought his face close to her dilated nostrils, delicate as a bat's wing.
Her extended nostrils loudly inhaled and exhaled her breath, and she set back one of her finely-pointed ears with a start, and stretched out her black firm lips toward Vronsky, as if wishing to catch hold of his sleeve.
But remembering her muzzle she gave it a jerk, and again began stepping from one of her finely chiselled feet to the other.
The Englishman looked at him attentively and, as if he knew where he was going, added:
'It was muddy before, but now it will be a swamp.' Sitting alone in the closed chalice he drew out his mother's letter and his brother's note and read them through.
This interference roused him to anger, a feeling he rarely experienced. 'What business is it of theirs?
And why do they bother me?
And now too, having given himself a shake, he continued the current of his thoughts:
THE DOWNPOUR DID NOT LAST LONG, and as Vronsky approached his destination – with his shaft-horse at full trot pulling alone, and the trace-horses galloping over the mud with the traces loose – the sun appeared again, the roofs of the houses and the old lime trees in the gardens on both sides glittered with the moisture, and the water dripped merrily from the branches and ran down from the roofs.
Hoping to find her alone, Vronsky, as usual, to attract less attention, alighted before crossing the little bridge that led to the house and walked on.
The presence of that child always aroused in Vronsky that strange feeling of unreasoning revulsion which had of late come to him.
But just as he was going to step toward her, she felt his nearness, pushed away the can, and turned her hot face toward him.
She did not answer, but, slightly bowing her head, looked at him from under her brows questioningly, her eyes shining from under their long lashes.
The leaf in her hand shook still more violently, but she did not move her eyes from his face, watching to see how he would take it.
He grew pale, tried to say something, but stopped, dropped her hand, and bowed his head. 'Yes, he understands its full significance,' she thought, and gratefully pressed his hand.
He gave her a look full of emotion, humbly kissed her hand, rose, and began silently pacing up and down the verandah.
I will tell it you all in advance,' and an evil light came into her eyes which a minute before had been so tender. '-"Ah, you love another and have entered into a guilty union with him?"-' (mimicking her husband, she laid just such a stress on the word guilty as Karenin himself would have done). '-"I warned you of the consequences from the religious, civil, and family points of view.
But she heard the voice of her son approaching, and glancing quickly round the verandah she rose hurriedly.
Her eyes kindled with the light Vronsky knew so well, and with a rapid motion she raised her lovely hands covered with rings, seized his head, gave him a long look, lifted her face with parted smiling lips, quickly kissed his mouth and both eyes, and then pushed him away.
'When?' he whispered, gazing rapturously at her.
'To-night at one,' she whispered, and with her quick light step went to meet her son.
He could be in time for his own race, but, if he called on Bryansky first he could only just manage it, and the whole Court would already be at the racecourse.
He saw Bryansky, stayed with him five minutes, and drove back at a gallop.
He now thought with enjoyment and agitation of the race, and that after all he would be there in time, and occasionally the expectation of that night's meeting flashed brightly in his imagination.
Vronsky once again glanced at the beautiful fascinating shape of the mare, whose whole body was trembling, and tearing himself with difficulty from this sight he left the shed.
From within and without the ring every one was crowding toward the winning-post, and a group of horse-guards, – officers and men, – with loud shouts were expressing their joy at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade.
He ascertained that Anna, Betsy, and his brother's wife were there, but in order not to agitate himself, intentionally avoided going near them.
Bonne chance!' he added smiling and went away.
He wished to go up to his own horse, but was again stopped by an acquaintance.
Her fiery eyes turned on the approaching Vronsky.
The mare turned her eyes still further back, showed her teeth, and set back an ear.
Vronsky glanced round at his rivals for the last time.
Galtsin, one of the formidable competitors and a friend of Vronsky's, was struggling with a sorrel gelding that would not let him mount.
Their eyes met and Vronsky winked at him kindly and approvingly.
'Lead if you can, but do not despair till the last moment if you are behind.'
Having got his right foot also in its stirrup he straightened out the double reins between his practised fingers, and Cord removed his hand.
Some of the riders were in front, some behind, when Vronsky suddenly heard a horse galloping through the mud behind him, and Makhotin on his white-legged, large-eared Gladiator went past him.
Makhotin smiled, showing his long teeth, but Vronsky looked at him angrily.
She broke into a canter, gave two leaps, and, angry at the tightened rein, changed back into a jerky trot, jolting her rider.
Cord also frowned, following Vronsky almost at a run.
Three times the riders drew up in line, but each time someone's horse made a false start and they had to line up again.
Gladiator and Diana approached the stream together, and almost at the same moment rose above it and flew across to the other side; lightly as if on wings Frou-Frou rose up behind them; but at the moment when Vronsky felt himself raised in the air he suddenly saw, almost under his horse's feet, Kusovlev, who was floundering on the other side of the stream with his Diana (Kusovlev had let go of the reins at the jump and the horse fell throwing him over her head).
But Frou-Frou, like a falling cat, made an effort with her legs and back while in the air, and clearing the other horse rushed on.
Just then the boards of the barrier flashed close before Vronsky's eyes.
He caught sight of his mud-bespattered face, and even thought he saw him smile.
He urged on his mare and felt with joy that she easily increased her speed, and he heard the sound of Gladiator's hoofs again at the former distance behind.
He was galloping up to the Irish bank.
He and Frou-Frou both saw the bank while still some way off, and to both of them came a momentary doubt.
He noticed the mare's hesitation by her ears and raised his whip, but immediately felt that his doubt was groundless: the mare knew what was wanted, and, as he expected, she increased her speed, took off exactly at the right moment, and gave a leap the force of which carried her far across the ditch. Then without effort and without changing her legs Frou-Frou continued her gallop.
He could not fail to recognize Yashvin's voice, though he did not see him.
Vronsky was touching the ground with one foot.
His face distorted with passion, pale and with quivering jaw, Vronsky kicked her with his heel in the belly and again pulled at the reins: But she did not move and, nuzzling the ground, only looked at her master with eloquent eyes.
'Ah, ah, ah!' groaned Vronsky, seizing his head.
He turned away and, without picking up the cap that had fallen from his head, left the racecourse without knowing where he was going.
Yashvin overtook him with his cap and led him home, and in half an hour Vronsky came to himself.
He who had been a considerate father, since the end of that winter had become particularly cold toward his son, and treated him in the same bantering manner as he did his wife. 'Ah, young man!' was the way in which he addressed him.
Karenin thought and said that in no previous year had he had so much official business as this year; but he was not conscious of the fact that this year he invented work for himself, and that this was one of the means of keeping that compartment closed where lay his feelings for and thoughts of his family, which became more terrible the longer they lay there.
That was why Karenin's face bore a stern, proud expression when anyone asked about his wife's health.
He did not wish to think about his wife's conduct and feelings at all, and he really did not think about them.
He prescribed as much physical exercise and as little mental strain as possible, and above all no worries of any kind – that is, he advised what was for Karenin as impossible as not to breathe, and he went away leaving Karenin with a disagreeable consciousness that something was wrong with him which could not be remedied.
In the porch, after leaving Karenin, the doctor met Slyudin, Karenin's private secretary, whom he knew very well.
They had been at the University together, and though they very seldom met, they respected one another and were good friends, and to no one but Slyudin would the doctor have expressed his opinion about his patient.
'It is this,' said the doctor, beckoning over Slyudin's head to his coachman to drive up. 'It's this,' and with his white hands he took a finger of his kid glove and stretched it; 'if you try to break a cord that is slack it is not easy to break it, but strain that cord to its utmost and the weight of a finger will snap it.
She said all this lightly, rapidly, and with peculiarly sparkling eyes; but Karenin did not now attach any importance to this tone of hers.
He only heard her words, and gave them only their direct meaning.
He looked round at his mother, as if asking for protection.
Karenin meanwhile talked to the governess with his hand on his son's shoulder, and Serezha felt so extremely uncomfortable that Anna saw he was about to cry.
Anna, who had blushed when the boy came in, saw how distressed he was, and, rising, lifted Karenin's hand off her son's shoulder, kissed the boy, led him out on to the verandah, and returned at once.
The Princess Tverskaya did not get out, only her footman in his black hat, cape, and gaiters jumped down at the front door.
'I am going, good-bye!' said Anna, and giving her son a kiss she went up to Karenin and held out her hand to him. 'You were very kind to come.'
But as soon as she ceased to see him she became conscious of the place on her hand his lips had touched and shuddered with disgust.
She knew by the way he looked at the Ladies' Stand that he was trying to find her (he looked straight at her, without recognizing her amid the sea of muslin, ribbons feathers, sunshades, and flowers), but she purposely disregarded him.
'Alexis Alexandrovich!' the Princess Betsy called to him, 'I am sure you don't see your wife; here she is!'
He smiled at Anna as a husband should smile when meeting his wife whom he has seen shortly before, and greeted the Princess and other acquaintances, giving to each what was due – that is to say, joking with the ladies and exchanging greetings with the men.
At the foot of the stand stood a General Aide-de-Camp respected by Karenin, and noted for his intelligence and education. With him Karenin entered into conversation.
Anna heard his high measured voice and did not miss a single word. Each word seemed to her false and grated painfully on her ear.
When the four-verst steeplechase was beginning she leaned forward, and did not take her eyes off Vronsky while he went up to his horse and mounted it, and at the same time she heard her husband's repulsive, unceasing voice.
And as it is natural for the child to skip about, so it was natural for him to speak cleverly and well.
Anna said nothing, but without putting down her glasses looked steadily at one point.
Interrupting his speech, Karenin rose hurriedly, but with dignity, and bowed low to this general.
'You are not racing,' said the latter to him jokingly.
Karenin was not interested in races and therefore did not watch the riders, but began absent-mindedly looking at the spectators with his weary eyes.
He looked at her and hurriedly turned away, scrutinizing other faces.
She glanced for an instant at him with a look of inquiry, and, slightly frowning, turned away again.
'Oh, I don't care,' she seemed to say to him, and then did not once look at him again.
EVERYONE WAS LOUDLY EXPRESSING DISAPPROVAL and repeating the words some one had uttered: 'They will have gladiators and lions next,' and every one was feeling the horror of it, so that when Vronsky fell and Anna gave a loud exclamation, there was nothing remarkable about it.
But afterwards a change came over Anna's face which was positively improper.
But Betsy did not hear her.
Karenin approached Anna and politely offered her his arm. 'Come, if you like,' he said in French; but Anna listened to what the General was saying and did not notice her husband.
Anna, without replying to her husband, raised her glasses and looked toward the spot where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and so many people had crowded there, that it was impossible to distinguish anything.
She put down her glasses and was about to go; but at that moment an officer galloped up and reported something to the Emperor.
'Steve! Steve!' she called to her brother.
'I again offer you my arm if you wish to go,' said her husband, touching her arm.
With a look of repulsion she drew back, and without looking at him replied:
On hearing this Anna quickly sat down and hid her face behind her fan.
He stepped forward so as to screen her, giving her time to recover.
'For the third time I offer you my arm,' he said after a while, turning toward her.
'No, Alexis Alexandrovich,' she put in, 'I brought Anna here and I have promised to take her back again.'
'I will send to him and find out, and will let you know,' Betsy whispered to her.
'Don't forget,' said he to her, pointing at the open window behind the coachman's box; and, slightly rising, he lifted the window.
He expected a rejoinder from her; but she remained silent, looking straight before her.
Karenin had begun to speak boldly but when he realized clearly what he was talking about the fear she was experiencing communicated itself to him.
And throwing herself back into the corner of the carriage she burst into sobs, hiding her face in her hands.
Karenin did not move, and did not change the direction in which he was looking, but his face suddenly assumed the solemn immobility of the dead, and that expression did not alter till they reached the house.
As they were driving up to it, he turned his face to her still with the same expression and said:
As definitely and inevitably as a particle of water exposed to the cold assumes the well-known form of a snow crystal, did each new-comer on his arrival at the watering-place immediately settle into his natural position.
And now, when guessing who and what kind of people the strangers were, and in what relation they stood to one another, Kitty attributed to them extraordinary and splendid characters, and found confirmation in her observations.
But not so much from illness as from pride, as the Princess Shcherbatskaya explained – Madame Stahl was not acquainted with any of the Russians there.
The Russian girl looked after Madame Stahl, and also, as Kitty noticed, became intimate with all those who were seriously ill (of whom there were many in the place) and waited on them in the most natural way.
But besides the fact that it interested Kitty to observe the relations of this girl with Madame Stahl and with others, she experienced (as often happens) an inexplicable attraction toward this Mlle Varenka, and felt, when the girl's eyes met hers, that the feeling was mutual.
This Mlle Varenka was not exactly past her early youth, but seemed to be a person destitute of youthfulness: she might be nineteen years old or she might be thirty.
By this contrast to herself Kitty was specially attracted.
But for heaven's sake' – her look added – 'do not think that I shall force myself on you. I simply admire and love you.'
And Kitty saw that the girl really was always occupied: now taking the children of some Russian family home from the Wells, now carrying an invalid's plaid or wrapping it round her, now trying to soothe an irritable patient, now choosing and buying biscuits for some one's coffee.
But the Princess, having found out from the visitors' list that they were Nicholas Levin and Mary Ivanovna, explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her dreams about those two people vanished.
Kitty was walking with her mother and the Moscow Colonel, who swaggered gaily in his short, German coat, bought ready-made in Frankfort.
Varenka, in her dark dress and a black hat with turned-down rim, was pacing the whole length of the gallery with a blind Frenchwoman, and each time she met Kitty they exchanged a friendly look.
I knew her sister-in-law,' added the Princess, raising her head proudly.
In a few minutes he overtook Kitty and her mother.
'What was the matter?' asked the Princess.
Kitty begged her mother more than ever to allow her to make Varenka's acquaintance, and, much as the Princess disliked appearing to take the first step toward getting acquainted with Madame Stahl, who allowed herself to be proud of something or other, she made inquiries about Varenka, and, having learnt particulars which allowed her to conclude that though there might be little good there would be no harm in this acquaintance, she herself approached Varenka.
Just then Kitty, beaming with joy that her mother had made acquaintance with her unknown friend, returned from the Well.
'Varenka,' prompted Varenka with a smile, 'everybody calls me so.'
Madame Stahl learnt afterwards that Varenka was not her daughter, but continued to bring her up, the more readily because it happened that very soon Varenka had no relations left.
Kitty played the prelude and looked round at Varenka.
'Well then, another one,' she said, hurriedly turning over the pages, immediately realizing that there was something particular connected with that song.
'Am I not right, you have some memory attached to that song?' asked Kitty. 'Don't tell me about it,' she added hurriedly, 'only say if I am right!'
You did not think that I too have had a romance?' she said, and on her handsome face there flickered for an instant a spark of the fire which, Kitty felt, had once lighted up her whole being.
Wait a bit, let us sit down again,' said Kitty, making Varenka sit down on a garden seat beside her. 'Tell me, is it possible that you are not offended at the thought that a man despised your love?
Varenka shook her head and put her hand on Kitty's.
The question is, do you love him now or not?' said Varenka, calling everything by its plain name.
'Yes, how can you go alone at this time of night?' agreed the Princess. 'I will at any rate send Parasha with you.'
KITTY ALSO BECAME ACQUAINTED with Madame Stahl, and this acquaintanceship, together with Varenka's friendship not only had a great influence on Kitty, but comforted her in her sorrow.
Madame Stahl spoke with her as with a dear child who gives one pleasure by reminding one of one's own past, and only once mentioned that love and faith alone can bring relief in all human sorrows and that no sorrows are too trivial for Christ's compassion. Then she immediately changed the subject.
Having now clearly understood what was most important, Kitty was not content merely to delight in it, but immediately with her whole soul devoted herself to this newly revealed life.
She formed a plan for her future life, based on what Varenka told her about the work of Madame Stahl and of others whom she named.
It would have been quite right had it not been overdone. But the Princess saw that her daughter was getting out of bounds and spoke to her about it.
'Kitty, have you not had some unpleasantness with the Petrovs?' the Princess asked when they were again alone together. 'Why has she stopped sending the children here and coming herself?'
Again and again she went over in memory all the relations she had had with that family.
'Yes,' she remembered, 'there was something unnatural in Anna Pavlovna, quite unlike her usual kindness, when the day before yesterday she said crossly: '-"There, he has been waiting for you and would not drink his coffee without you, though he was growing dreadfully weak."
It was such a simple thing, but he took it so awkwardly, and thanked me so much that I myself felt awkward. And then that portrait of me, which he did so well!
QUITE TOWARD THE END OF THE SEASON Prince Shcherbatsky, who from Carlsbad had gone on to Baden and Kissingen to see some Russian friends and to 'inhale some Russian spirit,' as he expressed it, returned to his family.
And it seems funny, for they did not get on well together...
'Well, come back then,' said Kitty, turning resolutely. 'How are you to-day?' she asked Petrov.
Petrov rose with the aid of a stick and looked timidly at the Prince.
'Annetta, Annetta!' he said loudly, and the veins in his white neck protruded like thick cords.
'How so? When...' he was interrupted by a fit of coughing, and made a hopeless gesture with his hand.
Several patients lingered near by, gazing at this lady as at something out of the common.
The Prince approached her, and Kitty immediately noticed in his eyes that ironical spark which so disturbed her.
He went up to Madame Stahl, and spoke to her extremely politely and nicely in that excellent French which so very few people speak nowadays.
'No, but I am accustomed to it,' said Madame Stahl and introduced the Swedish Count to the Prince.
'Yes, God sends a cross and gives the strength to bear it.
'Ah!' exclaimed the Prince, seeing the Moscow Colonel standing near by, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he moved away with his daughter and with the Moscow Colonel, who had joined them.
'I hear she has not been up for ten years.'
THE PRINCE IMPARTED HIS GOOD SPIRITS to his household, his friends, and even to his German landlord.
[Eminence, Excellence, Serene Highness.] Well, by the time they get to "Durchlaucht" I can't resist, and ten thalers are gone.'
'But "time is money," don't forget that,' said the Colonel.
Why are you so glum?'
'Why not, why not, why not?' asked Kitty with wide-open eyes, and holding Varenka's sunshade to prevent her going. 'No, wait a bit, and tell me why not.'
'Well, go on,' Kitty hurried her, looking at her with a frown.
'It serves me right, it serves me right!' Kitty began hurriedly, snatching Varenka's sunshade out of her hands, and looking past her friend's eyes.
What business had I with a stranger?
It was all pretence!' Kitty said, opening and shutting the sunshade.
No, I shall not give in to that again!
What is Anna Pavlovna to me?
'Kitty!' came her mother's voice, 'come here and show Papa your corals.'
Kitty took from the table a little box which held the corals, and with a proud look, without having made it up with her friend, went to where her mother was.
She did not renounce all she had learnt, but realized that she had deceived herself when thinking that she could be what she wished to be.
Moreover, though he had long lived in very close relations with the peasants, as their master, mediator, and above all as their adviser (the peasants trusted him, and would often come thirty miles to consult him), he had no definite opinion concerning them. Had he been asked whether he knew the people, he would have been just as much at a loss for a reply as he was for a reply to the question whether he liked them.
He continually observed and learnt to know all sorts of human beings, among them human beings of the peasant class, whom he considered interesting, constantly discovering in them new traits and altering his opinions accordingly.
Koznyshev, on the other hand, just as he praised country life as a contrast to the life he disliked, liked the peasants as a contrast to the class he disliked and regarded them as a contrast to humanity in general.
A talkative young medical man who had only just qualified and been appointed doctor for the Zemstvo district arrived, examined the hand, said it was not sprained, and enjoyed a talk with the celebrated Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev. He told him all the gossip of the district to show off his enlightened views and complained of the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing there.
Koznyshev listened attentively, asked questions, and, enlivened by the presence of a new listener, became quite chatty, made some pointed and weighty remarks respectfully appreciated by the young doctor, and reached that state of animation his brother so well knew, which generally followed a brilliant and lively conversation.
Words seemed to detract from the beauty of what he was looking at.
When they reached the meadow Levin stopped.
Though Constantine was loth to crush his grass, he drove across the meadow.
The tall grass twined softly about the wheels and the horse's legs, leaving seeds on the wet spokes and hubs.
Koznyshev sat down by the willows, while Levin led away his horse, and, having tethered it, stepped into the immense grey-green sea of grass, so dense that the wind could not ruffle it.
'Have you found it, Fomich?' he asked.
Though he had caught nothing, Koznyshev did not feel bored and seemed in the best of spirits.
Constantine felt himself morally cornered, and in consequence became excited and involuntarily betrayed the chief cause of his indifference to social questions.
He remained silent awhile, lifted his rod and threw the line again, and then turned to his brother with a smile.
'But I am not yet prepared to say that such work is desirable,' returned Levin.
'I mean I consider it neither desirable nor possible.'
'Well, let's grant it is so,' said Levin, though he did not grant it at all. 'Still, I don't see why I should he bothered with it.'
'No, since we have started on the topic, perhaps you had better explain it to me from a philosophical point of view,' said Levin.
To me the Zemstvo means nothing but a tax of two kopecks per desyatina, my having to go to the town, sharing a bed with bugs, and listing to all sorts of nonsense and nastiness; and my personal interests do not prompt me to do it!'
'The emancipation of the serfs was quite a different matter.
I am not going to cut anybody's throat so I shall never be in need of that sort of thing.
All those Zemstvo institutions of ours,' he said, again jumping off to a subject that had no bearing on the case in point, 'are like those little birches that are cut down for decorations at Whitsuntide, and we Russians stick them up to imitate the woods that have grown up naturally in Western Europe. I cannot water these birches or believe in them from my soul.'
And to prove the inaccuracy of Levin's views, Koznyshev carried the conversation into the realm of philosophy and history, which was beyond Constantine's reach.
Koznyshev wound up his last line, untied the horse, and they started on their homeward way.
'I need physical exercise; without it my character gets quite spoilt,' thought he, and determined to go and mow, however uncomfortable his brother and the peasants might make him feel.
That evening, at tea, Levin said to his brother:
Koznyshev looked up at his brother in surprise. 'How do you mean?
Next morning Constantine got up earlier than usual, but giving instructions about the farming delayed him and when he came to the meadow each man was already mowing his second swath.
They moved slowly along the uneven bottom of the meadow, where a weir had once been.
Levin dismounted and, tethering his horse by the roadside, went up to Titus, who fetched another scythe from behind a bush and gave it to Levin.
They all looked at him, but no one made any remark until a tall old man with a shrivelled, beardless face, wearing a sheepskin jacket, stepped out on to the road and addressed him:
'I will try not to lag behind,' he said, taking his place behind Titus and waiting his turn to fall in.
'It's not properly adjusted, the grip is not right. See how he has to stoop!' said one.
It's all right: he'll get into it,' said the old man. 'There he goes...'
They came to softer grass, and Levin, who was listening without replying, followed Titus and tried to mow as well as possible.
But just at that moment Titus stopped of his own accord, stooped, took up some grass and wiped his scythe with it.
Levin straightened himself, sighed, and looked back.
Levin followed, trying not to lag behind, but it became harder and harder until at last the moment came when he felt he had no strength left, and then Titus again stopped and began whetting his scythe.
A dark cloud was hanging low overhead, and large drops of rain were falling.
Some of the peasants went to put on their coats; others as well as Levin felt pleasure in the refreshing rain and merely moved their shoulders up and down.
They came to the end of another swath.
The old man went along holding himself erect, moving with regular, long steps, turning out his toes, and with a precise and even motion that seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging his arms when walking, he laid the grass in a level high ridge, as if in play or as if the sharp scythe of its own accord whizzed through the juicy grass.
His pleasant young face, with a wisp of grass tied round the forehead over his hair, worked all over with the effort; but whenever anyone glanced at him he smiled.
The perspiration in which he was bathed was cooling and the sun which burnt his back, his head and his arm – bare to the elbow – added to his strength and perseverance in his task, and those unconscious intervals when it became possible not to think of what he was doing recurred more and more often.
When he came to a molehill he would change his action, and with a short jerk of the point and then of the heel of his scythe he would mow all round the molehill.
And while doing this he noted everything he came to: now he plucked a sorrel stalk and ate it, or offered it to Levin; now he threw aside a branch with the point of his scythe, or examined a quail's nest from which the hen bird had flown up, almost under the scythe; or he caught a beetle, lifting it with the scythe-point as with a fork, and after showing it to Levin, threw it away.
The old man broke some rye bread into a bowl, mashed it with a spoon handle, poured over it some water from his tin, broke more bread into it and salted it, and then, turning to the East, said grace.
'Come, master, have some of my dinner,' said he, kneeling in front of his bowl.
He shared the old man's meal and got into conversation with him about his domestic affairs, taking a lively interest in them and telling him about his own, giving him all the particulars which would interest the old peasant.
When the old man got up and, having said grace, lay down beneath the willows with an armful of grass under his head, Levin did the same, regardless of the flies, importunate and persistent in the sunshine, and of the crawling insects that tickled his perspiring face and body. He at once fell asleep, waking only when the sun touched the opposite side of the willows and reached him.
Let's begin!' shouted different voices, and the mowers took their places, finishing their bread as they went.
'Now then, lads! Keep going!' said Titus, starting off ahead almost at a trot.
He went in front, mowed a swath, turned round and restarted; following him all the others took their places, going downhill along the creek and back up to the very skirts of the wood.
The scented grass, cut down with a sound that showed how juicy it was, fell in high ridges.
On the short swaths the mowers crowded together, their tin boxes clattering, their scythes ringing whenever they touched, the whetstones whistling upon the blades, and their merry voices resounding as they urged each other on.
This, however, did not trouble the old man.
MASHKIN HEIGHTS WERE MOWN, and the peasants, having completed their last swaths, put on their coats and went home in high spirits.
He looked back from the top of the hill. He could not see the men, for the mist rising from the hollow hid them; but he heard their merry rough voices, laughter, and the clanking of the scythes.
Koznyshev had long had his dinner, and was in his room drinking iced water with lemon, while looking over the papers and magazines just arrived by post, when Levin rushed in, his tangled hair clinging to his moist brow, his shirt saturated back and front and dark with perspiration, and cried out joyfully:
'Dear me, what a sight you are!' said Koznyshev, turning to his brother with a momentary look of vexation: 'The door – the door!
Koznyshev shook his head as he looked at his brother. 'Go, go and be quick!' he added with a smile, as, gathering together his books, he prepared to go too.
Five minutes later the brothers met again in the dining-room.
Though Levin had imagined that he was not hungry, and sat down to table only not to offend Kuzma, yet when he began eating he thought everything delicious.
Koznyshev smiled as he looked at him
She is in Ergushevo, and everything is out of gear there.
'I see that on the whole you are well satisfied with your day.'
'What about yesterday's conversation?' asked Levin, who had finished dinner and sat blissfully blinking and puffing, quite unable to remember what yesterday's conversation had been about.
Levin listened to his brother but understood absolutely nothing and did not wish to understand.
She consoled her mistress, assuring her that everything would 'shape itself (this phrase was her own, and Matthew had learnt it from her), and she went to work deliberately and without excitement.
Very, very rare were the short intervals of quiet.
Instead of the restive Raven, the steward's Brownie had been harnessed to the carriage on Matrena Filimonovna's authority, and Dolly, who had been detained by the cares of her own toilet, came out in a white muslin dress and took her seat in the carriage.
It's true Alesha did not stand very well: he kept turning round to see the back of his jacket; but nevertheless he was wonderfully sweet.
At home also all went well, only at lunch Grisha began whistling and – what was still worse – would not obey the governess and had to go without his pudding.
Still crying over the injustice done him, he ate the pudding, muttering between sobs: 'Eat some yourself... let us both eat... together!'
The sound of rapturous squealing filled the nursery, and did not cease till they started on their drive.
Terenty the coachman tied to a tree the horses, that were swishing their tails to drive away the flies, stretched himself full length in the shade, pressing down the high grass, and smoked his pipe, while from the bathing-house came the sound of the incessant merry squealing of the children.
Although it was troublesome to look after all the children and keep them out of mischief, and difficult to remember whose were all those little stockings and drawers, not to mix up the shoes of all those different feet, to untie, unbutton, and then fasten up again all the tapes and buttons, yet Dolly, who had always been fond of bathing and considered it good for the children, knew no greater pleasure than bathing them.
Matrena Filimonovna called to one of these to ask her to dry a bath-sheet and a chemise that had fallen into the water, and Dolly entered into conversation with them.
'Just look at the little beauty, as white as sugar!' said one, gazing admiringly at Tanya and stroking her head. 'But she's thin.'
Dolly did not want to part from the peasant women; their conversation pleased her so much because their interests were exactly similar to hers.
One of the young women was watching the governess, who was dressing after all the others, and seeing her put on a third petticoat could not refrain from remarking: 'Look at her! She's wrapping herself up and wrapping herself up, and hasn't got enough round her yet!' and the women burst out laughing.
'Oh, I'm so glad!' said she, holding out her hand.
'Yes, he wrote that you had moved here, and he thought I might be of some use to you,' replied Levin, and having said this grew confused. Without finishing what he was going to say he continued walking beside the trap, breaking off twigs from the lime trees and biting them.
'Of course I understood that this only meant you wanted to see me, and was very pleased.
Children, who will race the horses with me?'
Pretence about anything sometimes deceives the wisest and shrewdest man, but, however cunningly it is hidden, a child of the meanest capacity feels it and is repelled by it.
And as she looked at his easy, strong, considerate, careful and ultra-cautious movements, the mother lost her fears and looked at them with a smile of approval.
To change the conversation Levin went on to explain to Dolly a theory of dairy farming which maintained that a cow was only a machine for the transformation of fodder into milk, and so on.
'You know I proposed and was rejected,' muttered Levin, and the tenderness he had a moment ago felt for Kitty was changed into a feeling of anger at the insult.
'Please, please don't let us talk about it!' said he, sitting down again, conscious as he did so that a hope which he had thought dead and buried was waking and stirring within him.
The feeling that seemed dead was coming to life again, rising and taking possession of Levin's heart.
'Yes, a choice between me and Vronsky,' thought Levin, and the dead hope that had begun to revive in his soul died again and only weighed painfully on his heart.
'Darya Alexandrovna,' said he, 'in that way one may choose a dress, or... purchases... anything... but not love.
Dolly, hearing their screams, ran up to the nursery and found them in a dreadful state. Tanya was holding Grisha by the hair, and he, his face distorted with anger, was hitting her at random with his fists.
IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY the Elder from the village belonging to Levin's sister (which lay fifteen miles from Pokrovsk) came to see Levin and report on business matters and on the hay-harvest.
When Levin took over the management of the estate he looked into the matter, and, concluding that the grass was worth more, fixed the price at eight roubles.
The peasants would not pay so much, and Levin suspected them of keeping other buyers off.
Then he went there himself and arranged to have the harvest gathered in partly by hired labourers and partly by peasants paid in kind.
Levin arrived at his sister's village at noon and left his horse with a friendly old peasant, the husband of his brother's nurse. Wishing to hear particulars of the hay harvest from this old man, Levin went to speak to him in his apiary.
He went to inspect the hay, examined the stacks, and saw that there could not be fifty cartloads in each. To put the peasant to the proof Levin ordered the carts on which the hay was being moved to be fetched, and one of the stacks to be carried to the barn.
There were only thirty-two loads in the stack.
In spite of the Elder's explanations that the hay had been loose, but had settled down in the stacks, and his swearing that all had been done in a 'godly way,' Levin insisted that the hay had been apportioned without his order and that he would not accept the stacks as containing fifty loads each.
To the left, carts rattled along the bare meadow, and one after another the haycocks vanished, picked up in enormous forkfuls, and their places were taken by heavy carts with their huge loads of scented hay overhanging the horses' backs.
See them picking it up, like ducklings picking up the food you've thrown to them!' he added, pointing to where the hay was being loaded on the carts. 'They've carted a good half since dinner time...
Is that the last?' he shouted to a lad who was driving past, standing on the front of a cart and flicking the ends of his hempen reins.
'The last one, father,' shouted the lad, reining in the horse and smilingly turning to a rosy young woman who, also smiling, sat inside the cart; then he drove on again.
Vanka, with evident desire to save her every moment of unnecessary exertion, hurriedly caught the hay in his outspread arms and smoothed it evenly in the cart.
When she had lifted the remaining hay to him with a rake, she shook the chaff from her neck, straightened the kerchief that had slipped from her forehead, which showed white where the sun had not reached it, and crawled under the cart to help rope up.
His wife threw her rake on top of the load, and swinging her arms went with vigorous steps to join the other women who had gathered in a circle.
Having come out upon the road, Vanka took his place in the line of carts.
The women, carrying their rakes over their shoulders, followed the carts, their coloured dresses gleaming brightly and their chatter ringing merrily.
One of the women with a strange gruff voice started a song and sang it to the end, when fifty powerful voices, some gruff and others shrill, all at once took it up with a will.
Leaving the meadow, he went down the high road toward the village.
'What's that? Who can it be coming?' thought he, hearing the tinkling of bells and raising his head.
The horses were pressing close together away from the ruts, but the skilful driver, sitting sideways on the box, guided them so that the coach wheels ran smoothly in the ruts.
That was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who might be inside he glanced in at the window absent-mindedly.
At the very moment when this vision was about to disappear, her candid eyes fell on him.
She recognized him and joyful surprise lit up her face.
He looked up at the sky, hoping to find there the shell he had been admiring, which had typified for him the reflections and feelings of the night.
There in the unfathomable height a mystic change was going on and he could see no sign of anything like a shell; but a large cover of gradually diminishing fleecy cloudlets was spreading over half the sky, which had turned blue and grown brighter.
The chief of his staff and his secretary knew this and warned women who came with petitions that they should on no account give way to tears if they did not want to spoil their case.
Being aware of this and of the fact that any expression he could at that moment find for his feelings would be incompatible with the situation, he tried to conceal all signs of life within himself and neither moved nor looked at her.
After terrible pain and a sensation as if something enormous, bigger than his whole head, were being pulled out of his jaw, he feels, scarcely believing in his happiness, that the thing which has so long been poisoning his life and engrossing his attention no longer exists, and that it is possible again to live, think, and be interested in other things.
What Karenin experienced was a feeling of this kind: it had been a strange and terrible pain, but it was past, and he felt he could again live, and think of other things beside his wife.
'I ought not to be unhappy because a despicable woman has committed a crime, but I must find the best way out of this painful situation in which she has placed me. And find it I will,' said he to himself, frowning more and more.
'I'm not the first and shall not be the last'; and without taking into account the historical instances of wives' unfaithfulness, beginning with Menelaus and La Belle Hélène [a comic opera, by Offenbach, just then in vogue in Moscow and Petersburg.] whose memory had just recently been fresh in everybody's mind, quite a number of cases of infidelity, the infidelity of modern wives, occurred to Karenin. 'Daryalov, Poltavsky, Prince Karibanov, Count Paskudin, Dram...
Semenov, Chagin, Sigonin :..' he passed them in review. 'It's true a kind of unreasonable ridicule falls on these men, but I never could see it in any other light than as a misfortune, and felt nothing but sympathy,' Karenin reflected, though it was not true: he had never felt any sympathy of the kind, and the more cases he had come across of husbands being betrayed by their wives the better the opinion he had had of himself.
Supposing I challenged him...' continued Karenin; and vividly picturing to himself the night he would spend after the challenge, and the sensation of having a pistol pointed at him, he shuddered and realized that he would never do it. 'Supposing,' he went on, 'they showed me how to do it, placed me, and I pulled the trigger...'
He closed his eyes... 'and it turned out that I had killed him...' and he shook his head to drive away the stupid thought. 'What sense is there in killing a man in order to define one's relations with a guilty wife and a son?
Karenin saw that in his own case it would be impossible to obtain a legal divorce – that is, a divorce in which the guilty wife would be simply cast off.
'Besides a formal divorce, it would be possible to act as Karibanov, Paskudin, and that good-natured Dram did, and just separate,' he resumed when he had grown calm again; but this measure would have all the inconvenience of a divorce-scandal, and would throw his wife into Vronsky's arms just in the same way. 'No, it is impossible, impossible!' he said aloud, again wrapping the rug round his legs, 'I cannot be unhappy, but she and he must not be happy.'
'I must inform her of my decision, that after considering the painful situation in which she has placed her family, I think that an external status quo would be better for both parties than any other expedient, and that I am prepared to keep to that on the strict understanding on her part that she will obey my will and break off relations with her lover.' In confirmation of this decision, after it had already been reached, another powerful argument occurred to Karenin.
He paced twice up and down his study and then halted at the gigantic writing-table, on which his valet had already lit six candles. Cracking his fingers, he sat down and arranged his writing materials.
With his elbow on the table and his head bent to one side he sat and thought for a minute, and then wrote without an instant's pause.
Having folded the letter, smoothed it out with a massive ivory paper-knife, and put it and the money in an envelope – with the pleasure that the use of his well-arranged writing appliances always caused him – he rang.
To Karenin the splendidly painted black lace on the head, the black hair, and the beautiful white hand with many rings on the third finger, suggested something intolerably bold and provocative.
He tried to read but could not awaken in himself the lively interest he had felt for the Eugubine Tables.
The complication was this: Karenin's official peculiarity, his characteristic trait (every successful official has his special trait), which together with his determined ambition, self-restraint, honesty, and self-confidence, had made him successful, consisted in a contempt for red-tape, a curtailment of correspondence, economy, and (as far as possible) a direct relation with real facts.
Like all such matters it went on of itself, by inertia.
Now Karenin meant to demand, first, that a new Commission should be formed to investigate locally the conditions of the subject races; secondly, should those conditions prove to be such as they appeared to be from the official reports already received, that another scientific Commission should be appointed to study the causes of this deplorable condition of the subject races, in the following aspects: (a) Political, (b) Administrative (c) Economic, (d) Ethnographic, (e) Material, and (f) Religious; thirdly, that information should be demanded from the hostile Department concerning the measures it had taken during the last ten years to avert the unfavourable conditions to which the subject races were now exposed; and fourthly, that the Department in question should be required to explain why it had acted in direct contradiction to the meaning of the fundamental and organic law (Vol.-, Article 18, and footnote to Article 36), as appeared from the statements submitted to the Committee and numbered 17015 and 183o8, of 5th December 1863 and th June 1864.
After walking up and down the room he again looked at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously.
Just as he was going away I wished to call him back and tell him, but changed my mind, because my not having done so at first would have appeared strange.
When she thought about Vronsky, she imagined that he did not love her, that he was beginning to find her a burden, and that she could not offer herself to him; and in consequence she felt hostile toward him.
She remained in the same position with head and arms drooping. Every now and then her whole body shuddered as she tried to make some movement or to say something and then became rigid again.
She jumped up and began pacing up and down the room.
She dressed quickly and with determined steps entered the drawing-room, where Serezha and his governess were waiting breakfast for her as usual.
Serezha, dressed all in white, was standing by a table under a looking-glass, and arranging some flowers he had brought, with bent head and back, showing that strained attention familiar to her in which he resembled his father.
The governess began to give a long and detailed account of his misconduct, but Anna did not listen to her. She was wondering whether to take her also or not.
The tears were already streaming down her cheeks, and in order to hide them she jumped up abruptly and went out on to the verandah.
She thought of his calmness, and a feeling of vexation with him made her tear the paper to pieces, with the one sentence written on it. 'There is no need to write anything,' she thought, closed her blotting-book, went upstairs to tell the governess and the servants that she was going to Moscow that evening, and then began packing.
'Go and see what it is,' she said, and, calmly prepared for anything, sat down in an easy-chair and folded her hands on her knees.
'All right,' she replied, and as soon as he had gone she tore open the envelope with trembling fingers.
A packet of new still unfolded notes in a paper band fell out.
'-"Our life must go on as heretofore"-' – she recalled another sentence of the letter. 'That life was painful before, lately it has been dreadful.
No, I shall break it off, break it off!' she exclaimed, jumping up and forcing back her tears.
She arrived at the Princess Tverskaya's house before the other visitors.
He stopped at the door, took off his cap, and let her pass.
It's just as if you thought my company might compromise you! Please bring us tea in the little drawing-room,' she said to the footman, screwing up her eyes as she always did when speaking to a footman.
She took the note from him and read it. 'Alexis has failed us,' she said in French.
'He writes that he cannot come.' She spoke in a natural and matter-of-fact tone, as if it never entered her head that Vronsky had any other interest for Anna than as a croquet player.
Anna was aware that Betsy knew everything, but when she heard her talk about Vronsky she always felt a momentary conviction that Betsy knew nothing about it.
'Ah!' said Anna, in an indifferent tone as if she cared very little about it, and went on with a smile: 'How could your company compromise anyone?' This play with words, this concealment of a secret, had a great charm for Anna, as it has for all women.
Let him and Alexis Alexandrovich break lances at their Committee Meetings; that has nothing to do with us.
I must leave you for a minute; please close the envelope and send it,' she said from the doorway; 'I have some orders to give.'
Without thinking for an instant Anna sat down at the table with Betsy's note, and without reading it added at the bottom: 'I must see you.
I shall be there at six.' She closed it, and Betsy returning sent it off in her presence.
They passed in review all who were expected to come, and their conversation dwelt at some length on Lisa Merkalova.
'Yes, but do tell me! I never can understand,' said Anna after a pause, in a tone that clearly proved she was not putting an idle question and that what she was asking about was more important to her than it ought to be; 'do tell me what are her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky, whom they call Mishka?
Betsy looked at her with smiling eyes.
Betsy burst into an unexpected, merry and uncontrollable peal of laughter, a thing she rarely did.
Lisa Merkalova's husband carries her rugs after her and is always at her service.
She moved one of the cups toward Anna, got out a pachitos, [A straw-covered cigarette.] placed it in a silver holder, and lit it.
SOUNDS OF FOOTSTEPS and a man's voice, then that of a woman followed by laughter, reached them, and the expected visitors entered the room, Sappho Stolz and a young man, shining with a superabundance of health, known as Vaska.
He came into the drawing-room behind Sappho and followed her across the room as if he were tied to her, with his glittering eye fixed on her as if he were ready to eat her.
At each strenuous step as she advanced, the shape of her knees and thighs was distinctly visible under her dress, and one involuntarily wondered just where, behind, under her heaped and swaying bustle, the real, graceful little body ended which was so exposed at the top and so hidden at the back and below.
'Just fancy! We nearly ran over two soldiers,' she began at once, winking and smiling as she threw back her train which she had jerked too much to one side.
'I was with Vaska... Oh, but you are not acquainted!' and she introduced the young man by his surname and burst into ringing laughter at her mistake in speaking of him as Vaska to a stranger.
He was Sappho's new admirer, and followed at her heels just like Vaska.
It is true she had adopted the same tone as Sappho, and, as in Sappho's case, two admirers followed her as if tied to her and devoured her with their eyes; one a young and the other an old man; but in her there was something superior to her surroundings, – she had the radiance of a real diamond among false stones.
The weary yet passionate look of those eyes, with the dark circles beneath them, was striking in its perfect sincerity.
Looking into those eyes every one felt as if they knew her perfectly, and knowing her could not help loving her. At the sight of Anna her whole face lit up with a joyful smile.
'Tell me, how do you manage not to feel bored?
What was there jolly about it? Do tell me how you manage not to get bored?' said she again to Anna.
As he rarely met Anna he could not say anything to her except trivialities, but he said these trivialities, about her return from the country to Petersburg and of how fond the Countess Lydia Ivanovna was of her, in a way that expressed his whole-hearted desire to be agreeable to her, and to show her his respect and even more.
'No, please don't go!' begged Lisa Merkalova when she heard that Anna was leaving.
The flattering words of this clever man, the naive, childish sympathy which Lisa Merkalova expressed to her, all these familiar Society surroundings made her feel so tranquil, while what was lying in wait for her was so hard, that for a moment she doubted whether to remain and put off the dread moment of explanation.
To keep things straight he was in the habit, some five or six times a year according to circumstances, of secluding himself and clearing up all his affairs.
The morning after the races he woke late, and without having a bath or shaving he put on a linen tunic and, spreading out before him his money, his accounts, and his bills and letters, he set to work.
When Petritsky – who knew that on such occasions Vronsky was often cross – on waking saw his friend at his writing-table, he dressed quietly and went out without disturbing him.
He began by first attacking his money problems, as the easiest to deal with.
After reading over the list of his debts, he divided them into three classes, each of which he noted down separately.
Then taking from his pocket-book three notes from Anna he re-read them, burnt them, and recalling a conversation he had had with her the evening before, fell into a reverie.
Having then perforce to assume the role of an independent character, he played it very adroitly and cleverly, as though he had no grudge against anyone, did not feel himself at all offended, and only wished to be left in peace to enjoy himself.
And slowly twisting his moustache he rose from the table and walked across the room.
Vronsky looked at his comrade without answering, thinking about something else.
His smiling eyes shone still more brightly.
A group of soldiers, a sergeant-major and some other non-commissioned officers, came up to the verandah at the same time as Vronsky.
After returning to the table, the Commander again came forward with a glass of champagne in his hand and announced a toast: 'To the health of our late comrade, the gallant General, Prince Serpukhovskoy!
Following the Commander, champagne glass in hand, Serpukhovskoy came down smiling.
Vronsky knew that kind of radiance, and noticed it at once on Serpukhovskoy's face.
He jerked his head backwards and raised his glass, welcoming Vronsky and showing by this gesture that he must first go to the sergeant-major, who was already stretching himself and puckering his lips for a kiss.
Serpukhovskoy kissed the smart-looking sergeant-major on his moist fresh lips and, wiping his mouth on his handkerchief, stepped up to Vronsky.
'You look after him,' shouted the Commander to Yashvin, and went out to the soldiers.
He hurriedly took three one-hundred-rouble notes out of his pocket-book and blushed.
The carousing at the house of the C.O. continued long.
Serpukhovskoy was lifted and tossed by the officers.
'Yes, and I used to hear about you, but not only from your wife,' said Vronsky, checking the hint by a serious look. 'I am very glad of your success but not at all surprised.
Yes,' he said with a smile tender as a woman's, 'Give me carte blanche, leave the regiment, and I will draw you on imperceptibly.'
Serpukhovskoy rose and said, as he stood before Vronsky,
'We will come in a minute,' Vronsky shouted to an officer who looked in, having been sent by the C.O. to call them.
Look at Mazankov, at Krupov!
'You have never loved,' said Vronsky softly, with his eyes looking straight before him and with Anna in his thoughts.
'Coming, coming!' he said, turning to a footman who had entered.
A vague sense of the accomplished cleaning up of his affairs, a vague memory of Serpukhovskoy's friendship for him, and the flattering thought that the latter considered him a necessary man, and above all the anticipation of the coming meeting, merged into one general feeling of joyful vitality.
He put down his legs, threw one of them over the other, and placing his arm across it felt its firm calf, where he had hurt it in the fall the day before, and then, throwing himself back, sighed deeply several times.
'Get on, get on!' he shouted to the coachman, thrusting himself out of the window, and taking a three-rouble note from his pocket he put it into the man's hand as the latter turned round.
Why? Why has she given me an appointment here, in a letter from Betsy?' he thought; but there was no longer any time for thinking.
But as soon as she had spoken he straightened himself and his face assumed a proud and stern expression.
She could not guess that it expressed the first idea that had entered Vronsky's mind: the thought of an inevitable duel; therefore she explained that momentary look of severity in another way.
'It was not at all hard for me – it all came about of itself,' she said, irritably. 'And here...' she pulled her husband's note from under her glove.
'I understand, I understand,' he interrupted, taking the note but not reading it, and trying to soothe her. 'I only want one thing, I only ask for one thing: to destroy this situation in order to devote my life to your happiness.'
'Who's that coming?' said Vronsky, pointing to two ladies who were coming toward them. 'They may know us!' and he moved quickly in the direction of a sidewalk, drawing her along with him.
Again, as at the first moment when he heard the news of her having spoken to her husband, Vronsky yielded to the natural feeling produced by the thoughts of his relation to the injured husband.
Now that he held his letter he could not help imagining to himself the challenge that he would no doubt find waiting for him that evening or next day, and the duel, when he would be standing with the same cold proud look as his face bore that moment, and having fired into the air would be awaiting the shot from the injured husband.
And at that instant the thought of what Serpukhovskoy had just been saying to him and of what had occurred to him that morning (that it was better not to bind himself) flashed through his mind, and he knew that he could not pass on the thought to her.
I am proud of my position because... proud of... proud...' she could not say what she was proud of.
She stopped and burst into sobs.
'Yes, but all that depends on him.
ON MONDAY THE USUAL MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE of the Second of July took place.
When the Reports had been heard, Karenin in his quiet thin voice informed the meeting that he wished to bring to their notice some considerations of his own on the question of the settlement of the native races, and the attention of the meeting turned to him.
Karenin cleared his throat, and, as was his wont when making a speech, without looking at his opponent he fixed his eyes on the first man opposite him – a quiet little old man who never had any views in connection with the Special Committee – and began to explain his considerations.
Stremov (who was also on the Special Committee), stung to the quick, began justifying himself, and the meeting became quite a stormy one. But Karenin triumphed and his motion was carried; three new Special Committees were formed, and the next day nothing was talked about in a certain Petersburg set but that meeting.
She passed through the ballroom to his study and resolutely went in.
When she entered he was sitting in his official uniform evidently ready to start, with his elbows on a little table, looking wearily in front of him.
When he saw her he was about to rise, but changed his mind as his face flushed – a thing Anna had never seen it do before. However, he quickly rose and came toward her, looking not at her eyes but at her forehead and hair.
Several times he tried to speak, but stopped.
'Is Serezha well?' he asked; and without waiting for a reply he added, 'I am not dining at home to-day and must be going at once.'
Seeing that he had not the strength to begin, she began for him.
'I am not questioning you about it,' he replied suddenly in a firm tone and looking with hatred straight into her eyes. 'I had expected it.'
He laughed in a cruel, cold manner.
And I shan't be back to dinner.' He rose and went toward the door.
What was the essential cause of that hostility?
He wrote ten notes and tore them all up, sending the saddle at last without any reply.
After showing the coachman to a place in a lean-to, in a large, clean, tidy, newly-constructed yard where stood some charred wooden ploughs, the old man invited Levin to enter the house.
The dog that followed Levin frightened her, but when she was told that it would not hurt her she at once began to laugh at her own alarm.
'Look alive!' the old man called merrily after her, and approached Levin. 'Is it to Nicholas Ivanich Sviyazhsky you are going, sir?
In the midst of his conversation about his acquaintanceship with Sviyazhsky the gates creaked again, and the labourers returning from the fields came into the yard with their ploughs and harrows.
The labourers evidently belonged to the household. Two young fellows wore print shirts and peaked caps, two others were hired men and wore homespun shirts; one of these was old and the other young.
Don't let the gelding out, Fedot, lead him to the trough. We'll harness another.'
We have had tea once to-day,' said he, evidently pleased to accept the invitation. 'Well, just for company!'
He had planted many potatoes which had already flowered and were forming fruit, as Levin had noticed when passing the fields on the way, while Levin's own potatoes were just beginning to flower.
'There now! We landlords don't get on well because of the labourers,' said Levin, handing him a tumbler of tea.
Take Sviyazhsky now.
Each time that Levin tried to penetrate deeper than the reception rooms of the other's mind, which were always open to anybody, he noticed Sviyazhsky seemed a little confused. A just perceptible look of fear appeared on his face, as if he were afraid that he would be understood by Levin, whom he met with good-natured, jocose resistance.
'You say,' the hostess continued, 'that my husband cannot feel an interest in anything Russian?
No more tea,' said Levin, and unable to continue the conversation, though he knew he was behaving rudely, he got up blushing. 'I hear a very interesting conversation there,' he added, and went to the other end of the table where his host and the two landlords were sitting.
Sviyazhsky sat sideways, leaning his elbow on the table and turning his cup round with one hand, while with the other he gathered his beard together, lifted it to his nose as if smelling it, and let it go again.
'But we see you don't give it up,' said Nicholas Ivanich Sviyazhsky, 'so it seems it has its advantages.'
They are starving, yet if you hire one of them as a labourer, he'll spoil and break things, and will even lodge complaints with the magistrate.'
The peasants come along, and say, "Be a father to us! Help us!"
Well, of course they are all our own people, our neighbours: one pities them, and lends them what they want, enough to pay the one-third then due, but one says, "Remember, lads! I help you, and you must help me when necessary – at the oat-sowing or haymaking, at harvest time; and one agrees for so much work from each family."
Sviyazhsky looked at Levin with smiling eyes, and even made a just perceptible sarcastic sign to him ridiculing the old man, but Levin did not consider the landowner's words ridiculous, he understood him better than he did Sviyazhsky.
The landowner was evidently expressing his own thoughts – which people rarely do – thoughts to which he had been led not by a desire to find some occupation for an idle mind, but by the conditions of his life: thoughts which he had hatched in his rural solitude and considered from every side.
But it did not interest Levin, and, as soon as the landlord had finished, Levin returned to the first proposition, and, trying to get Sviyazhsky to express his views seriously, said to him:
Mary, send us some curds and whey or some raspberries here,' said Sviyazhsky to his wife. 'This year the raspberries are lasting an extraordinarily long time,' and Sviyazhsky got up cheerfully and moved away, evidently regarding the conversation as finished at the very point where to Levin it seemed to be just beginning.
Having lost his interlocutor Levin continued the conversation with the landowner, trying to prove to him that all our difficulties arise from the fact that we do not wish to understand the characteristics and habits of our labourers; but the landowner, like everybody who thinks individually and in solitude, was obtuse to other thoughts and tenacious of his own.
'But if they don't suit us? If they are stupid?' said Levin.
He was more than ever excited by the thought that the dissatisfaction with work on the land which he now experienced was not an exceptional state of mind but the result of the condition of agriculture in Russia generally, and that some arrangement that would make the labourers work as they did for the peasant at the halfway-house was not an idle dream but a problem it was necessary to solve.
Sviyazhsky got down the books and settled himself in a rocking-chair.
'What is it you are looking at?' he asked Levin, who, having stopped at the round table, was looking at one of the journals.
'Oh, there is a very interesting article there,' he added, referring to the journal Levin held in his hand. 'It turns out that the chief agent in the Partition of Poland was not Frederick at all,' he added, with gleeful animation.
Though at present Levin was more interested in agriculture than in anything else, he asked himself while listening to his host, 'What is there inside him?
Levin involuntarily remembered all that the man had said, and corrected in imagination the answers he himself had given.
Let us consider the labourer not as an abstract labour force but as a Russian peasant with his own instincts, and let us arrange our farming accordingly. "Imagine!"
When, on the evening of his return, he informed the steward of his intentions, the steward with evident pleasure agreed with that part of the plan which showed that all that had been done up to then was foolish and unprofitable.
But to Levin's proposal that he, like the peasants, should participate as a shareholder would in the farming, the steward only put on a look of great depression and expressed no definite opinion, but at once began to speak of the necessity of carting the last sheaves of rye next day and of starting the second ploughing, so that Levin felt that it was not the time for his plans to be considered.
The naive peasant, the cowman Ivan, quite understood Levin's offer of letting him and his family have a share in the profits of the dairy farm, and quite sympathized with this undertaking: but when Levin impressed upon him the benefit that would accrue to him in the future, a look of anxiety and regret that he could not stop to listen to it all appeared on Ivan's face, and he hurriedly remembered some task that could not be put off, seized a hay-fork to remove the hay from the enclosure, fetched water, or cleared away the manure.
They agreed that an English plough ploughed better, that a scarifier worked quicker, but they found a thousand reasons why they could not use either the one or the other; and, though he was convinced that it would be necessary to lower his standards of farming, he disliked having to give up improvements the benefit of which was so clear.
It was true that the peasants of that group, though they had agreed to farm the land on the new conditions, did not speak of it as co-operatively held land, but as land held for payment in kind; and that the members of that group and Rezunov himself said to Levin: 'If you would only accept money for the land it would be less trouble for you, and we should feel freer.' Moreover, these peasants, on all sorts of pretexts, kept putting off the building of the cattle-sheds and granary they had agreed to put up on this land, and dragged the matter on till winter.
Having taken up this question he conscientiously read everything relating to it; and he purposed going abroad in the autumn to study the question further there, so that what had often happened to him with other questions should not be repeated.
But rain set in, making it impossible to get in what remained of the corn and potatoes, stopped all the work, and even prevented the delivery of the wheat.
He gave orders that the grain was to be got ready for carting and sent the steward to the merchant to collect the money for the wheat, while he himself went round to give final instructions before leaving.
Having got through all his business, soaked by the streams of water that had run in at the neck of his leather coat and at the top of his high boots, but in the most buoyant and animated spirits, he returned home in the evening.
With such thoughts Levin reached home when it was already dark.
Having dined, Levin as usual sat down in his easy-chair with a book, and while reading continued to think about his impending journey in connection with the book he was writing. To-day the importance of his work presented itself to him with especial clearness, and whole paragraphs of their own accord shaped themselves in his mind, expressing the gist of his thoughts.
'That must form a short preface, such as I formerly considered unnecessary.' He rose to go to his writing-table, and Laska, who was lying at his feet, stretched herself, also got up, and looked round at him as if asking where she was to go to.
After arranging about the next day's work by seeing the peasants who had come on business, Levin went to his study and sat down to his work.
He rose and began to pace up and down the room.
'There now! Visitors have come to you,' said Agatha Mikhaylovna, rising and going toward the door.
Angry with himself for this bad feeling Levin ran into the hall; and as soon as he had a near view of his brother this feeling of disappointment vanished and was replaced by pity.
He stood in the hall jerking his long, thin neck, drawing a scarf from it, and smiling in a strangely piteous manner. When he saw this meek, submissive smile, Levin felt his throat contract convulsively.
Nicholas dressed carefully, a thing he never used to do, brushed his thin, straight hair and went smiling upstairs.
When he met Agatha Mikhaylovna he joked with her and questioned her about the other old servants: The news of Parfen Denisich's death affected him strangely. A look of fear appeared on his face but he immediately recovered himself.
These two men were so near akin and so intimate with one another, that between them the least movement or intonation expressed more than could be said in words.
Nicholas went to bed but, whether he slept or not, kept tossing and coughing like a sick man and, when unable to clear his throat, muttering some complaint.
He sat on his bed in the dark, doubled his arms round his knees and thought, scarcely breathing from the mental strain.
He lit a candle, got up carefully, went to the looking-glass, and began examining his face and hair.
He opened his mouth: his double teeth were beginning to decay.
Why don't you sleep?' his brother's voice called to him.
Levin felt it, returned behind the partition, and put out the candle, but was long unable to sleep.
On the third day of his stay Nicholas challenged his brother to explain his plans to him once more, and not only found fault with them but purposely confused them with communism.
'That idea,' said Nicholas Levin with a sarcastic smile and angrily glistening eyes, 'that idea at any rate, if one may say so, has a geometric charm of definiteness and certainty.
It may be utopian; but granting the possibility of making a tabula rasa of the past – and abolishing private property and families – then labour comes by its own.
There used to be slaves everywhere, then villeins; and we have labour paid in kind, and leaseholders, and hired labour: so what are you looking for?'
Only just before he left Nicholas kissed Constantine, and suddenly said with a strange and serious look at his brother,
He surprised young Shcherbatsky, Kitty's cousin, whom he happened to meet at a railway station, by his moroseness.
THE KARENINS, HUSBAND AND WIFE, continued to live in the same house and to meet daily, but they were wholly estranged.
Vronsky never came to the Karenins' house, but Anna met him elsewhere and her husband knew it.
He took leave of him at the railway station on the seventh day, on returning from a bear-hunt, after which there had been demonstrations of Russian 'prowess' all night.
ON RETURNING HOME Vronsky found a note from Anna awaiting him.
He woke up in the dark trembling with fear, and hurriedly lit a candle.
Yes, yes, the peasant, the beater – I think he was small and dirty with a tangled beard – was stooping down and doing something or other, and suddenly began to say strange words in French. That is all there was in that dream,' he thought.
He rang for his valet, dressed hurriedly, and went out into the porch, having quite forgotten his dream and feeling worried only by the fact that he was late.
Vronsky, though not in the habit of noticing details, noticed the look of surprise on the man's face.
In the doorway he nearly knocked up against Karenin.
She put both her hands on his shoulders and gazed at him long, with a deep look of ecstasy and yet searchingly.
'He had been and had come back, and afterwards went somewhere else.
'I have long since abandoned that kind of life,' he said, wondering at the change in her face and trying to penetrate its meaning. 'And I must own,' he went on smiling and showing his compact row of teeth, 'that I seem to have been looking in a mirror the whole of this week while watching that kind of life, and it was very unpleasant.'
She held her work in her hands, without crocheting, gazing at him with a strange, glittering, unfriendly look.
She turned away from him and, managing at last to disentangle her hook, with the aid of her forefinger began to draw the stitches of white wool, shining in the lamplight, through each other, the delicate wrist moving rapidly and nervously within her embroidered cuff.
She drew up her face, half closed her eyes and quickly changed the expression of her face, folding her hands; and Vronsky saw at once upon her beautiful face the very look with which Karenin had bowed to him.
She looked at him with quizzical joy.
I thought I had run into my bedroom, that I had to fetch or find out something there: you know how it happens in dreams,' and her eyes dilated with horror. 'And in the bedroom there was something standing in the corner.'
He sat through the first two acts and saw everybody that it was necessary for him to see.
On his return home he carefully looked at the coat-stand, and noticing that no military coat hung there he went to his study as usual; contrary to his habit, however, he did not go to bed but walked up and down the room till three in the morning.
He dressed in haste, and as if he were carrying a cup brimful of wrath and were afraid of spilling any and of losing with his anger the energy he needed for an explanation with his wife, he went to her room as soon as he knew that she was up.
His brow was knit, and his eyes, gloomily fixed before him, avoided looking at her; his lips were firmly and contemptuously closed.
He entered her boudoir and without saying 'Good morning!' went straight to her writing-table, took up her keys, and opened the drawer.
'They are not there,' she said, closing the drawer; but this action proved to him that he had guessed rightly, and rudely pushing away her hand he quickly drew out a letter-case in which he knew that she kept her most important papers.
Astonished and abashed, she silently looked at him.
She did not say what she had said to her lover the day before, that Vronsky was her real husband and that he (Karenin) was superfluous, she did not even think it.
Karenin was speaking so rapidly that he blundered and could not pronounce the word, and at last said suffled.
My son will stay with my sister,' said Karenin, making an effort to remember what he had wanted to say about his son.
And he was about to go, but now she stopped him.
The assistant took the card and, though he evidently did not approve of what he read on it, went out of the room.
'Come in, please!' said the lawyer to Karenin, and gloomily ushering his client in before him, he closed the door.
The lawyer, with a rapidity one could not have expected of him, separated his hands, caught the moth, and resumed his former position.
'You know my name?' continued Karenin.
Karenin sighed, collecting his courage, but having once made up his mind he went on in his squeaky voice without timidity or hesitation, emphasizing a word here and there.
'Although the general outline of our laws relating to this matter is known to me,' continued Karenin, 'I should like to know the forms in which such cases are conducted in practice.'
'In the following cases: physical defect in husband or wife, five years' absence without news' – and he bent one of his short hairy fingers – 'and in cases of adultery,' he uttered the word with evident pleasure. 'These are subdivided as follows,' and he went on bending down his thick fingers, though the cases and the subdivisions evidently could not be classed together, 'physical defects in husband or in wife, and adultery of husband or of wife.'
But Karenin remained silent, and so he began again: 'The most usual, simple, and reasonable way I consider to be adultery by mutual consent.
'If it is so...' Karenin began, growing suddenly pale; but at that moment the other suddenly rose and went to the door to speak to his assistant, who had again come to interrupt him.
'Tell her we have not got a cheap sale on here!' he said and came back again.
Three months later the committee sent in its report.
All the questions had received splendidly-drafted answers: answers not open to doubts since they were not the result of human thoughts (always liable to error), but were the outcome of official labours.
But Stremov, who had been touched to the quick at the last meeting, made use of tactics for which Karenin was not prepared.
Stremov suddenly changed over to Karenin's side, bringing several other members in his train, and not only warmly supported the measures advocated by Karenin, but proposed other more extreme measures of the same nature.
There was a split in the Committee.
He was holding with one hand the window of a carriage (from which the head of a lady in a velvet bonnet and two little children's heads were leaning out) and was smilingly beckoning with his other hand to his brother-in-law.
The lady too with a kind smile waved her hand to Karenin.
He raised his hat and was going on, but Oblonsky told the coachman to stop and ran across the snow.
Karenin unfolded the rug he had wrapped round his legs, which were so sensitive to the cold, got out of the carriage, and making his way through the snow approached Dolly.
'She is well,' replied Karenin, frowning. 'I shall be very pleased,' and he went back to his carriage.
'Then you will come?' cried Dolly.
'I shall call to-morrow!' shouted Oblonsky to him.
Dolly called, and blushed.
From the theatre Oblonsky went to the market, and himself selected the fish and asparagus for dinner; and at noon he was already at Dusseaux's Hotel, where he had to call on three people who, fortunately for him, had all put up at the same place. These were: Levin, who had only just returned from abroad; a newly-appointed superior official who was making a tour of inspection in Moscow; and Karenin, his brother-in-law, whom he wanted to secure for dinner.
This was one of the unpleasant things, while the other was the fact that his new superior, like all new superiors, had the reputation of being a dreadful man who got up at six in the morning, worked like a horse, and expected his subordinates to do the same.
This superior also had the reputation of having the manners of a bear, and he was reported to hold views diametrically opposed to those of his predecessor and, till now, of Oblonsky also.
Later on he took it off and stayed for an hour, talking to Levin about bear-hunting and also about personal matters.
Oblonsky listened to Levin with attention.
Just think! This whole world of ours is only a speck of mildew sprung up on a tiny planet; yet we think we can have something great – thoughts, actions!
If you once realize that to-morrow, if not to-day, you will die and nothing will be left of you, everything becomes insignificant!
I consider my ideas very important, yet they too turn out to be insignificant – and would be, even if it were as possible to carry them out as it was to surround this bear.
However, I must be going,' returned Oblonsky, rising for the tenth time.
They were naively convinced that their business consisted in explaining their needs and the existing state of affairs, and of asking for help from the Government. They could decidedly not understand that some of their statements and demands would play into the hands of the hostile party, and thereby ruin their case.
When he had finished with the deputation Karenin wrote to the lawyer, without the least hesitation giving him permission to act at his own discretion, and enclosing three notes from Vronsky to Anna which he had found in the writing-case he had taken possession of.
There must be some misunderstanding!' said Oblonsky.
Karenin considered, and for a while Oblonsky gazed at him, full of sympathy, without breaking the silence.
I don't see it.
'Even if your worst suspicions proved correct, I never took upon myself, and never will, to judge either side; and I see no reason why our relations should change.
We had lunch, and I showed him how to make that stuff – you know – wine with oranges.
Karenin parted from his brother-in-law in a very different manner to that in which he had met him.
He entered together with Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev and Pestsov, who had met on the doorstep.
And as there is nothing less amenable to agreement than disagreement on semi-abstract themes, they not only disagreed in their opinions but had long been accustomed without anger to ridicule each other's incorrigible delusions.
They all sat like 'a parish priest's wife visiting' (as the old Prince Shcherbatsky expressed it), evidently puzzled as to why they were all assembled there, and forcing out words in order not to remain silent.
Kitty kept looking toward the door, gathering courage not to blush when Constantine Levin should enter.
On entering the drawing-room Oblonsky made his excuses, explaining that he had been kept by the particular Prince who was his usual scapegoat whenever he was late or absent, and in a moment he had reintroduced everybody, and having brought Karenin and Koznyshev together, he started them off on the subject of the Russification of Poland, and they immediately caught on, Pestsov joining them.
Having patted Turovtsyn on the shoulder, he whispered something funny in his ear and got him to sit down next to Dolly and the old Prince.
Then he told Kitty that she was looking very nice, and introduced young Shcherbatsky to Karenin.
But he met Levin at the door.
Whom have you got?' asked Levin with a blush, knocking the snow off his cap with his glove.
'Oh, do introduce me to Karenin!' he brought out with difficulty, and with despairing determination he entered the drawing-room and saw her.
He came up, bowed, and silently held out his hand.
They stood round the scented vodka and the delicacies, and the conversation about the Russification of Poland between Koznyshev, Karenin, and Pestsov gradually slackened in the expectation of dinner.
How many have you got?' he asked, turning to the host with a kindly smile and holding out a tiny wine-glass to be filled.
'You have killed a bear, I hear?' said Kitty, vainly trying to catch a wayward, slippery pickled mushroom with her fork, and so shaking the lace of her sleeve through which her arm gleamed white. 'Have you any bears near your estate?' she added, turning her lovely little head toward him and smiling.
On my return journey I met your brother-in-law, or rather your brother-in-law's brother-in-law, on the train,' he said smiling. 'It was a funny meeting.'
'The guard (regardless of the proverb) [The proverb is: 'At meeting you're judged by your clothes, At parting you're judged by your wits.'] judged me by my clothes and wished to turn me out, but I began to use long words and... you too,' he went on turning to Karenin (whose Christian name and patronymic he had forgotten), 'judging me by my peasant coat were going to turn me out, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am very grateful.'
'The rights of passengers to a choice of seats are very ill-defined,' said Karenin, wiping the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief.
'I noticed that you were not quite sure what to make of me,' said Levin with a good-natured smile, 'so I hastened to start an intellectual conversation, to expiate my sheep-skin.' Koznyshev, while continuing his conversation with the hostess, listened with one ear to his brother, turning his eyes toward him, and thought, 'What has happened to him to-day?
We see that the Rhine has become Frenchified, yet the Germans do not stand on a lower level!' he shouted. 'There is some other law!'
'Are they fully known?' intervened Koznyshev with a subtle smile. 'At present a purely classical education is regarded as the only real education, but we hear lively discussions from both sides and cannot deny that the opposite view has many arguments in its favour.'
'I am not expressing my opinion of either kind of education,' replied Koznyshev, smiling at him condescendingly as at a child and holding out his glass. 'All I say is that both sides have weighty arguments in their favour,' he continued addressing himself to Karenin.
'Natural science has just as great an educational and mind-developing influence,' Pestsov joined in. 'Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of general laws!'
For instance, it ought to consider the education of women injurious, yet it established courses of lectures and universities for women.'
And the conversation at once veered to a new subject – the education of women.
Karenin expressed the view that the higher education of women is generally confounded with the question of women's emancipation, and that was the only reason for considering it injurious.
'I, on the contrary, think that these two questions are firmly bound together,' said Pestsov. 'It is a vicious circle.
'You are quite right,' said Karenin. 'I think the only question is whether they are capable of fulfilling these duties.'
Turovtsyn burst into loud laughter, and Koznyshev felt sorry he had not made that remark himself.
'Yes, but what is a girl to do if she has no home?' said Oblonsky, agreeing with Pestsov and supporting him, and thinking of the dancer Chibisova, whom he had in his mind all the time.
'But we are defending a principle, an ideal!' said Pestsov in his sonorous bass. 'Women wish to have the right to be independent and educated.
At first when the influence of one nation on another was being talked about, thoughts of what he had to say on the subject involuntarily came into Levin's mind; but these thoughts, formerly so important to him, now only flickered through his mind as in a dream and were not of the slightest interest.
It even struck him as strange that they should care to talk about things that could make no difference to anyone.
I was going along and wondering who that could be in a four-horsed coach, a splendid team with bells, and for an instant you appeared and I saw you at the window sitting like this, holding the strings of your cap with both hands and thinking very deeply about something,' he said and smiled. 'How I wish I knew what you were thinking about!
And fancy!' she went on in a whisper, 'he was so sorry for her that he stopped and helped her to nurse the children.
'Yes? it was wonderful! he is splendid!' said Dolly, looking toward Turovtsyn who felt that he was being talked about, and giving him a gentle smile.
Levin looked at Turovtsyn again and wondered how it was he had failed to realize what a charming man he was.
IN THE CONVERSATION WHICH had been begun on the rights of women there were raised some questions not freely to be discussed in the presence of ladies concerning the inequalities of marriage relations.
Pestsov more than once during dinner-time flew at these questions, but Koznyshev and Oblonsky carefully diverted him from them.
The inequality between husband and wife, in his opinion, lay in the fact that the infidelity of a wife and that of a husband were unequally punished both by law and by public opinion.
Oblonsky hurriedly offered Karenin a cigar.
And with a kindly smile on his moist and rosy lips, he went on addressing himself chiefly to Karenin, the principal guest. 'Vasya Pryachnikov, as I was told to-day, has fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him.'
'I am so glad you came,' said Dolly with a frightened smile, as she met him in the sitting-room through which he had to pass: 'I must speak with you.
'Alexis Alexandrovich, forgive me, I have no right to... but I love Anna like a sister, and respect her and I beg, I implore you to tell me what has happened between you, what do you accuse her of?'
'I expect your husband has told you the reasons which make me consider it necessary to change my former relations with Anna Arkadyevna,' he said without looking in her eyes, discontentedly eyeing Shcherbatsky who was passing through the sitting-room.
'I don't, I don't believe it, I cannot believe it!' Dolly said, clasping her bony hands with an energetic movement.
'I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, and have thought deeply,' said Karenin. His face flushed in blotches and his dim eyes looked straight at her.
And here I am living; my children growing, my husband returns to the family and feels his error, grows purer and better, and I live...
But he talked to them only with the idea of getting them to agree and softening their controversy.
She stood in the doorway with Shcherbatsky and was looking at him.
Levin had often noticed in arguments among the most intelligent people that after expending enormous efforts and an immense number of logical subtleties and words, the disputants at last became conscious of the fact that the thing they had been at such pains to prove to one another had long ago, from the very beginning of the controversy, been known to them, but that they liked different things and were disinclined to mention what they liked lest it should be attacked.
Sometimes the reverse happens; one at last mentions the thing one likes, for the sake of which one has been devising arguments, and if this is said well and sincerely, one's opponent suddenly agrees and ceases to dispute.
They went back to the conversation at dinner about women's rights and occupations.
Levin agreed with Dolly, that a girl who does not get married can find woman's work in the family.
'No,' said Kitty, blushing, but looking all the more boldly at him with her truthful eyes: 'A girl may be so placed that she cannot enter into a family without humiliation, while she herself...'
And he understood all that Pestsov at dinner had been trying to prove about the freedom of women, simply because he saw in Kitty's heart fear of the humiliation of being an old maid, and, loving her, he too felt that fear and humiliation, and at once gave up his contention.
There was a pause. She still continued drawing on the table with the chalk.
'Oh, I have scribbled over the whole table!' she said, and putting down the chalk moved as if to get up.
'There,' he said, and wrote the following letters, – W, y, a: i, c, n, b; d, y, m, t, o, n?
These letters stood for: When you answered: it can not be; did you mean then or never? It was quite unlikely that she would be able to make out this complicated sentence; but he looked at her with an expression as if his life depended on her understanding what those letters meant.
She glanced seriously at him and then, leaning her frowning forehead on her hand, began reading.
Occasionally she looked up at him, her look asking him: 'Is it what I think?'
He quickly rubbed out what he had written, handed her the chalk, and rose.
He looked at her questioningly, and timidly.
He seized the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, broke it, and wrote the initial letters of the following: 'I have nothing to forget or forgive, I never ceased to love you.'
She looked at him with a smile that remained fixed on her lips.
'I am very glad, she seems a fine gi...' he began.
Koznyshev laughed merrily, a thing he rarely did. 'Anyhow I may say I am very glad.'
Nothing, nothing, silence...' said Levin, and again wrapping the collar round his brother's face he added: 'I am very fond of you!
'What are you speaking on to-night?' asked Levin not ceasing to smile.
They arrived at the Council, and Levin listened to the secretary haltingly reading an official report which he evidently did not understand himself, but from his face Levin saw what a nice, kind, and splendid fellow he was.
They were debating the grant of some money and the laying of some pipes, and Koznyshev spoke about something for a long time in a triumphant tone and stung two of the members; another member, having noted something on a bit of paper, started timidly, but went on to answer him very venomously and neatly.
Levin returned to the hotel and the thought of how with his impatience he would spend the remaining ten hours frightened him.
The attendant on duty lighted his candle and was going away, but Levin stopped him.
It turned out that Egor had a family, three boys and a girl who was a seamstress and whom he wanted to marry to an assistant in a harness business.
Levin took this opportunity to express to Egor his opinion that in marriage the chief thing is – love, and that when there is love there will always be happiness because happiness lies always within oneself.
Egor listened very attentively and evidently quite understood Levin, but in confirmation of it remarked, quite unexpectedly to Levin, that when he was in the service of nice people he was always satisfied with his masters and that he was satisfied with his present master although he was a Frenchman.
He looked now at the cross, now at the star, and inhaled the fresh frosty air which flowed with a regular current into the room, following, as in a dream, the images and memories that arose in his fancy.
He went back to his room in the hotel and ordered coffee.
He took the piece out of his mouth, put on his overcoat and went out to walk about again.
It all happened at the same time; one of the boys ran after a pigeon and looked smilingly up at Levin; the pigeon flapped its wings and fluttered up, glittering in the sunshine amid the snow-dust that trembled in the air; from the window came the scent of fresh-baked bread and the loaves were put out.
After a long round, through the Gazetny Street and the Kislovka, he returned to the hotel, put his watch in front of him, and sat down waiting till it should be twelve.
With joyful faces they surrounded Levin, disputing among themselves, and offering him their services.
Trying not to offend the others, and promising to let them too drive him later on he hired one and told him to drive to the Shcherbatskys'.
As soon as she had gone out he heard the sound of very, very rapid light steps on the parquet floor, and his joy, his life, his own self, the best in himself, that which he had sought and yearned for so long, advanced very, very rapidly towards him.
Her arms rose and her hands dropped on his shoulders.
She smiled at the word 'dear,' and at the timid look he gave her. 'Yes!' she said significantly and slowly.
The Princess, on seeing them, breathed quickly and immediately burst into tears, then she at once laughed and ran up to them with energy such as Levin never expected from her, and putting her arms round his head kissed him and wetted his cheeks with her tears.
When they had gone Levin came up to his betrothed and took her hand.
'And I,' she said. 'Even when...' she stopped, and again went on, her truthful eyes looking into his face resolutely, 'even when I drove my happiness from me I always loved you only, but I was carried away.
He had thought that his courtship would be quite unlike any other, that the ordinary conditions of courtship would spoil his peculiar happiness; but he ended by doing what others do, and his happiness was thereby only increased, becoming more and more peculiar to him, unlike anyone else's was or is.
'Now we shall eat some sweets,' said Mlle Linon, and off went Levin to buy sweets.
She was religious and had never doubted the truth of her religion, but the lack of external religion in him did not affect her at all.
'Take, take those dreadful books back!' she cried, pushing away the note-books that lay on the table before her. 'Why did you give me them?...
But no – it was best after all,' she added, pitying the despair on his face. 'But it is dreadful, dreadful!'
Karenin ordered tea, sat down at a table, took up a time-table, and began planning his journey.
Rising, he began to pace the room. 'Quos vult perdere dementat,' he thought, quos being those who had had a hand in making the appointment.
I shall die easier for your forgiveness,' he read.
But what can they be aiming at?
If the news of her illness were false, he would go away again saying nothing; but if she were really ill and dying, and wished to see him before her death, he would, should he find her still living, forgive her; and should he arrive too late he would perform his last duty to her.
With the sense of fatigue and want of cleanliness resulting from a night spent in a railway carriage, Karenin drove through the fog of a Petersburg morning, along the deserted Nevsky, looking straight before him and not thinking of what awaited him.
Bakers, the closed shops, night izvoshchiks and men sweeping the pavements passed before his eyes, and watching all this he tried to stifle the thought of what lay before him and of what he dared not desire and yet could not help desiring.
A carriage, with a coachman asleep on the box, and an izvoshchik were standing at the entrance.
The door was opened by the hall-porter before Karenin had time to ring. The porter, Petrov, otherwise Kapitonich, looked strange in an old coat without a tie, and in slippers.
There was no one in the drawing-room, but the midwife, with lilac ribbons in her cap, came out of Anna's boudoir.
She approached Karenin, and with a familiarity bred by death's approach took him by the hand and led him toward the bedroom.
But at sight of her husband he was filled with such confusion that he again sat down, drawing his head down between his shoulders as if trying to become invisible. Then, making an effort, he rose and said:
The sight of Vronsky's tears made Karenin aware of the approach of that mental perturbation which other people's visible sufferings always aroused in him, and turning away his head he went toward the door without heeding what Vronsky was saying.
'Oh, what nonsense!' Anna went on, taking no notice of her husband.
His lower jaw trembled; he struggled with his agitation, every now and then glancing at her.
And I shall go to Rome, there is a wilderness there and then I shall be in nobody's way. I shall only take Serezha and the little girl...
You are too good!' With one hot hand she held his, while with the other she pushed him away.
They have come again, why don't they go away?...
Oh, take these furs off me!'
The doctor moved her arms and carefully drew the bedclothes over her shoulders.
She meekly lay down on her back and gazed with radiant eyes straight before her.
Why does he not come in?' she cried, calling to Vronsky on the other side of the door. 'Come, come!
Karenin took Vronsky's hands and moved them away from his face, terrible with its look of suffering and shame.
How badly those flowers are drawn, not a bit like violets,' and she pointed to the wallpaper.
And she began to toss in her bed.
All day she was feverish, delirious, and unconscious.
That day Karenin went out into the boudoir where Vronsky sat, and having locked the door took a seat opposite him.
'That is my position. You may trample me in the mud, make me the laughing-stock of the world, – I will not forsake her and will never utter a word of reproach to you,' continued Karenin.
If she wishes to see you I will let you know; but now I think it will be best for you to leave.'
But the consciousness of his degradation toward the man whom he had unjustly despised accounted for but a small portion of his grief.
And just now, when he knew her and loved her in the right way, he had been humiliated before her and had lost her for ever, leaving her nothing but a shameful memory of himself.
Returning home after the three sleepless nights, Vronsky did not undress but lay down prone on a sofa, with his head on his folded arms.
Fancies, memories, and most strange thoughts followed one another with extreme rapidity and clearness: now he saw himself pouring out medicine for the patient and overfilling the spoon, then he saw the midwife's white hands, or Karenin's curious pose as he knelt on the floor by her bedside.
The waves of the sea of unconscious life were beginning to close over his head when all at once he felt as if he had received a violent electric shock.
Karenin pulls away his hands and he is conscious of the shame-suffused and stupid expression of his own face.
He rose from the sofa, took off his coat, loosened the strap, and, baring his shaggy chest to breathe more freely, walked across the room. 'That's how one goes mad,' he said again, 'and how one shoots oneself so as not to be ashamed,' he concluded slowly.
Going up to a door he closed it, then with fixed gaze and tightly clenched teeth, approached the table, took up his revolver, examined it, turned it to a loaded chamber, and pondered.
Missed,' he muttered, feeling with his hand for the revolver.
It was close to him but he sought it further away.
Continuing his search he leaned over to the other side, and unable to keep his balance, fell down bleeding.
Toward four o'clock, having finished his work, he returned home.
The old nurse with a gesture of vexation came up and took her from the wet-nurse, and began pacing up and down, rocking the baby in her arms.
When the child was pacified and laid in her deep cot, and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow went away, Karenin rose, and stepping with difficulty on tiptoe approached the infant.
He was vexed with his wife for not troubling about the charming baby, felt disinclined to go in and see her while in that frame of mind, and also disinclined to meet the Princess Betsy; but his wife might think it strange if he did not come in as usual, and so he mastered himself and went to her bedroom.
'It is not for my husband's sake but for my own that I don't wish it.
A usual when she saw her husband all her animation vanished from her face; she bowed her head and glanced uneasily at Betsy.
'But your face looks feverish,' said he, emphasizing the word feverish.
'Betsy says Count Vronsky wanted to come and say good-bye before leaving for Tashkend.' She was not looking at her husband, and evidently was in a hurry to get through what she meant to say at any cost.
I can't receive him, and it would lead...' She stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband, who was not looking at her.
He stopped and looked at the Princess.
KARENIN TOOK LEAVE OF BETSY when they reached the dining-room and returned to his wife.
She was lying down, but on hearing his step she quickly sat up in her former place and glanced at him with apprehension.
No need whatever!' And she pressed her lips together and lowered her glistening eyes, looking at his hands with their swollen veins, which he was slowly rubbing together.
'Let us say no more about it,' she added more calmly.
She was agitatedly toying with the tassels of her dressing-gown, glancing at him with that tormenting feeling of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself, but which she could not overcome.
'Forgive me, I am upset! I am unjust,' she went on, controlling herself.
'We meet only for a moment, as I am just going,' said Betsy, smiling and putting on her glove.
'Wait a little, Princess, before putting on your glove! Let me kiss your hand!
'He will kill her,' said Betsy in a significant whisper. 'This is impossible, impossible...'
'I am very glad you think so,' returned Oblonsky, shaking his head with an expression of grave, woebegone commiseration. 'That is why I have come to Petersburg.'
Though he was overflowing with high spirits Oblonsky immediately fell into a sympathetic and romantic mood suited to hers, inquired after her health and asked how she had spent the morning.
No one else in his place, having to deal with such despair, would have permitted himself to smile, for a smile would have appeared callous. But in his smile there was so much kindness and almost feminine tenderness that it was not offensive, but soothing and pacifying.
'No, Steve,' said she. 'I am lost, quite lost!
Your husband has accepted that and forgiven you.' He paused between each sentence, expecting her to make objections; but she made no answer.
'Never mind, we'll spread out something to catch you.
While a divorce would solve the whole problem,' said Oblonsky not without difficulty expressing his main idea, and looking at her significantly.
Anna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes but said nothing.
OBLONSKY, WITH THE SAME RATHER SOLEMN EXPRESSION with which he was wont to take the chair at Council meetings, entered Karenin's study.
Karenin, with his arms crossed behind him, was pacing up and down meditating on the very subject that his wife and Oblonsky had been discussing.
To hide that embarrassment he took out a cigarette-case with a new kind of fastening which he had only just bought, smelt the leather of which it was made, and took out a cigarette.
Karenin stopped. He made no reply, but the expression of submissive self-sacrifice on his face struck Oblonsky.
'I intended to talk to you about my sister and your mutual position,' said Oblonsky, still struggling with his unwonted timidity.
Karenin smiled sadly, looked at his brother-in-law, and without replying went to the table and took from it an unfinished letter which he handed to him.
Oblonsky returned the letter and went on looking at his brother-in-law with the same amazement, not knowing what to say.
'Yes, yes, I understand you,' he brought out at last.
'But how?' he added, moving his hands before his eyes in a manner unusual with him. 'I don't see any possible way out.'
'There is a way out of every situation,' said Oblonsky, rising and growing excited. 'There was a time when you wished to break with her...
'If you wish to know my opinion,' said Oblonsky with the same soothing, almondy-tender smile with which he had addressed Anna – a kindly smile so convincing that Karenin, conscious of his own weakness and yielding to it, was involuntarily ready to believe anything Oblonsky should say, – 'she would never say so, but there is one way out, one thing she might wish! It would be, to terminate your relations and everything that reminds her of them.
Karenin sighed heavily and closed his eyes. 'There is only one thing to consider: does either party wish to remarry?
Karenin, his face drawn with distress, muttered something to himself and made no reply.
'Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also... and if any man will take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also,' thought Karenin.
However, do as you like!' and turning away so that his brother-in-law should not see his face, he sat down on a chair by the window.
I regard this disaster as an accomplished fact and am trying to help both you and her,' Oblonsky went on.
Or else it would be too stupid.'
He looked at her silently, his broad jaws set, while she bandaged him.
Now he could think quietly about Karenin, fully realizing his generosity without being humiliated thereby.
His wound was quite healed and he went about making preparations for his journey to Tashkend. 'Only to see her once more, and then to bury myself, to die!' he thought, as he was making a round of farewell calls, and he expressed this thought to Betsy.
Without seeing anyone or anything he ran up the stairs and entered her room with hurried steps – almost at a run.
His passion communicated itself to her.
'Yes, you have taken possession of me and I am yours,' she brought out at last, pressing his hands to her bosom.
'Don't talk and don't think about it' he said, playing with her hand and trying to draw her attention to himself; but she continued to gaze past him.
But now without a moment's hesitation he did refuse it and, observing that his superiors frowned upon his action, at once resigned his commission.
Consequently, having decided to divide her daughter's trousseau into two parts, a lesser and a larger, the Princess eventually consented to have the wedding before Advent.
His brother borrowed money for him, the Princess advised him to return to the country after the wedding, and Oblonsky suggested going abroad.
But Oblonsky arranged that too. Levin began to prepare himself.
In his present state of mind, softened and sensitive to everything, to be obliged to pretend was not only trying but appeared impossible.
During the service he would sometimes listen to the prayers, trying to see in them a meaning which would not clash with his opinions, or, finding that he could not understand and had to disapprove of them, he would try not to listen but to occupy his mind with observation of what was going on or with recollections which passed with extraordinary clearness through his brain as he stood idly in the church.
He stood through the mass and vespers and evensong, and the next day, having got up earlier than usual, he went to church before breakfast to hear morning prayers and to confess.
As was nearly always the case just then, they had nothing to say to each other, and she had put her hand on the table and kept opening and closing it until she herself began to laugh at its motions. He remembered how he had kissed the hand and afterwards examined the converging lines on the rosy palm.
'Well, it will soon be over now,' he thought. 'No – I believe it is all going to begin again,' and he listened to the prayer.
A minute later he put his head out and beckoned to Levin.
The sealed-up thoughts began stirring in Levin's head, but he hastened to drive them away. 'It will get settled somehow,' he thought, and went to the ambo.
On going up the steps and turning to the right he saw the priest.
What are your particular sins?' he continued without the slightest pause, as if anxious not to waste time.
Sometimes I even doubt the existence of God,' said Levin involuntarily, and was horrified at the impropriety of his words.
'What doubt can you have of the Creator when you see His creation?' continued the priest in his rapid, stereotyped voice. 'Who has adorned the vault of Heaven with luminaries?
How could it all be, without a Creator?' he asked, with an inquiring glance at Levin.
Pray to God,' he repeated hurriedly.
'You are entering upon a time of life,' the priest went on, 'when you must choose your path and keep to it, so pray that God in His goodness may help you and have mercy on you!' he concluded. 'May the Lord our God Jesus Christ, in the goodness and bounty of His love for mankind, pardon thee...'; and having pronounced the absolution, the priest blessed him and let him go.
He spent that evening with his betrothed at the Oblonskys' and was in particularly high spirits. Explaining to Oblonsky the state of elation he was in, he said he felt as pleased as a dog that was being taught to jump through a hoop, and which, having accomplished what was demanded of it, barks and wags its tail and jumps for joy upon the tables and window-sills.
'How delighted I shall be when I hear of your falling in love!' said Levin. 'Pray invite me to your wedding!'
'Oh, don't confuse matters!
Now you like farming sport... Well, you just wait and see!'
'Now confess that you feel like the bridegroom in Gogol's play who jumped out of the window?' teased Chirikov.
And leave them to do as they please here,' said Chirikov, smiling.
Soon after dinner the visitors left to get ready for the wedding.
When he was alone, Levin, thinking over the remarks of the three bachelors, once more asked himself whether there was in his soul any of that regret for his freedom that they had been speaking about.
'But do I know her thoughts, wishes, or feelings?' a voice suddenly whispered.
I will call you,' said Kitty. 'What is the matter with you?' she asked as soon as the maid was gone.
I... you'd better tell me...' he went on without looking at her. 'I shall be unhappy, of course.
'Are you mad?' she exclaimed, flushing with vexation; but his face was so piteous that she suppressed her vexation, and throwing the dresses on a chair sat down closer to him.
Guilty and ashamed, but comforted, Levin returned to his hotel.
Oblonsky, standing in a comically-solemn attitude beside his wife, took the icon and told Levin to bow to the ground; then he blessed him, smiling a kindly amused smile, and kissed him three times.
Dolly did the same, then she hurried away and again became confused about the arrangements for the carriages.
More carriages kept driving up, and now ladies with flowers in their hair got out, holding up their trains; or men appeared who doffed their military caps or black hats as they entered the church.
Levin meanwhile, in trousers but without coat or waistcoat, was pacing up and down his room, perpetually putting his head out at the door and glancing up the corridor.
'Yes, it is stupid,' Oblonsky concurred with a soothing smile. 'But don't worry, it will be here in a minute.'
Meantime in the church every one was waiting for the bridegroom; while he was pacing up and down like a caged beast, looking despairingly along the corridor, remembering all he had said to Kitty and wondering what she must be thinking now.
'That won't help matters,' remarked Oblonsky, smiling and following without haste. 'It will all "shape itself," all "shape itself'...
Oblonsky told his wife the reason of the delay, and the guests smiled and whispered to one another.
Levin saw no one and nothing; he did not take his eyes off his bride.
Wait a moment, put your head down,' said Kitty's sister, Princess Lvova, and raising her plump, beautiful arms she adjusted the flowers on Kitty's head.
Dolly advanced and was about to say something, but could not speak and began crying and laughing in an unnatural manner.
Kitty gazed at everybody with a look as absent-minded as Levin's.
When at last he had taken her hand properly, the priest went a few steps in front of them and halted at the lectern.
The crowd of friends and relatives, their voices buzzing and the ladies' trains rustling, moved after them.
The old priest, with his sacerdotal headgear and his locks of grey hair, glistening like silver, combed back behind his ears, drew his small old hands out from beneath his vestments of heavy silver cloth with a large gold cross on the back, and began turning over some pages on the lectern.
Oblonsky stepped up cautiously, whispered something to him, made a sign to Levin, and stepped back again.
The priest lit two wax candles decorated with flowers, and holding them askew in his left hand so that the wax kept slowly dripping, turned to the young couple.
He looked wearily and sadly at the bride and bridegroom, sighed, and disengaging his right hand from the vestments, held it up in blessing over the bridegroom, and then over the bride; only in his manner when he placed his fingers on Kitty's bowed head there was a shade of tenderness.
Then he gave them the candles, took the censer, and slowly stepped away from them.
'Is it really true?' thought Levin, and glanced round at his bride.
He could see her profile slightly from above, and by the just perceptible movements of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his look.
The handsome, tall senior deacon in a silver cloth alb, his curled hair parted down the middle, came briskly forward lifting his stole with a practised movement of two fingers, and stopped opposite the priest.
Then, harmoniously filling the whole church from windows to vaulted roof, a full chord sung by the invisible choir rose, swelled, hung for a moment, and softly died away.
Koznyshev was talking to Dolly, jokingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was spreading because newly-married couples always felt rather uncomfortable.
'I am past all that, Darya Alexandrovna,' he answered, and his face became unexpectedly sad and serious.
Oblonsky was telling his sister-in-law the pun he had made about 'dissolving marriages.'
She rejoiced at the sight of Kitty and Levin, but going back to the past she thought of her own wedding, kept glancing at the beaming Oblonsky, and, forgetting the present, recollected nothing but her own young and innocent love.
'And now? How strange!' she murmured.
All the details of the ceremony were followed not only by the two sisters, the friends and relatives, but also by women onlookers who were quite strangers, and who – breathless with excitement and afraid of missing anything, even a single movement or expression of the bride's or bridegroom's face, and annoyed by the indifference of the men – did not answer and indeed often did not hear the latter when they jested or made irrelevant remarks.
WHEN THE FIRST PART of the ceremony was over, a verger spread out a piece of pink silk cloth in front of the lectern. The choir began singing a psalm to some elaborate and complicated melody in which the bass and tenor continually repeated each other; and the priest, turning round, motioned the couple to the piece of pink silk.
Kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to comprehend their meaning but unable to do so.
They prayed: 'That they may live in chastity for the good of the fruits of the womb, and find joy in their sons and daughters.' It was declared that God had created woman from Adam's rib, and that 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh'; and that 'This is a great mystery.'
Levin glanced round at her, was struck by the joyous radiance of her face, and was involuntarily infected by her feeling.
Young Shcherbatsky and Chirikov, who were supporting the crowns and getting entangled in the bride's train, smiled too and were pleased without knowing why, when they chanced to lag behind or jostle the young couple if the priest happened to stop.
Having lifted the crowns from their heads, the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the married couple.
The priest helped him out of the difficulty, saying softly, with a smile on his kindly mouth, 'Kiss your wife; and you, kiss your husband!' He took the candles from their hands.
A handsome head-waiter, his thick hair greased with pomatum and parted from the nape upward, dressed in a swallow-tail coat, with a wide lawn shirt-front and a bundle of charms dangling on his rotund stomach, with his hands in his pockets, his eyes screwed up contemptuously, was answering a bystander's questions in a severe tone.
Hearing steps ascending the stairs at the other side of the entrance, the waiter turned and recognized the Russian Count who occupied the best rooms in the hotel. He respectfully took his hands out of his pockets, bowed, and said that the courier had been, and that the business of renting the palazzo was settled.
With a mixture of vexation at the impossibility of evading his acquaintances anywhere and of desire to find something to distract the monotony of his life, Vronsky looked round again at the man, who had first moved away and then halted; and at the same moment the eyes of both brightened.
Yet now they brightened up and exclaimed with pleasure at recognizing one another.
He forgot the unpleasant impression left by their last encounter, and with an open and joyful countenance held out his hand to his old schoolfellow.
Well, and what are you doing?'
Three days,' answered Vronsky, still attentively scrutinizing his friend's face.
'Yes, he is a decent fellow and looks at the matter in the right way,' said Vronsky to himself, understanding the meaning of the other's look and the change of subject. 'I can introduce him to Anna, as he sees the matter rightly.'
They pretended to understand completely the significance and meaning of the situation, to countenance and even approve of it, but to consider it out of place and unnecessary to explain all this.
But what pleased him most was that at once and apparently intentionally to prevent any possibility of misapprehension in the stranger's mind, she called Vronsky simply Alexis, and said that they were about to move into a house of their own, called a palazzo, which they had just taken.
He answered with a long and tender look.
When Anna returned with her hat and mantle on, and stood beside him toying with her sunshade with quick motions of her beautiful hand, Vronsky with a feeling of relief turned from Golenishchev's eyes which were fixed on him plaintively. With renewed love he glanced at his charming companion, so full of vitality and joy.
After trying several topics of conversation she led him on to the subject of art, about which he talked very well, and listened to him with attention.
'Alexis will have a nice studio. You must certainly have that room, Alexis,' she added, having understood that Golenishchev was to be on an intimate footing with them and that there was no need to pretend in his presence.
'He is very talented,' said Anna with a pleased smile. 'Of course I am no judge, but people who do know say so.'
But she could not help being grateful to him for his treatment of her, and showing him how much she valued it.
But among us at the present day he tumbled straight into the literature of negation and rapidly assimilated the essence of the negative teaching, and there he was! And that is not all.
Twenty years ago he would have found in that kind of literature signs of the struggle with authority and of an outlook centuries old, and from that struggle would have deduced that something else had existed; but as it is, he stumbles on a kind of literature that does not even deign to dispute the old point of view, saying straight off, "There is nothing but evolution, selection, the struggle for existence, and nothing more"!
An hour later Anna, seated beside Golenishchev with Vronsky facing them, drove to a new ugly house in a distant quarter of the town.
'Have I not told you scores of times not to enter upon discussions?
'Shut up, for heaven's sake!' cried Mikhaylov with tears in his voice, stopping his ears with his hands as he went into his workroom behind a partition and locked the door behind him. 'What a duffer!' he muttered to himself as he seated himself at the table, and having opened a portfolio he at once set to work with particular ardour at an unfinished drawing.
The paper with the drawing that he had thrown away was found, but it was dirty now and spotted with candle grease.
Nevertheless, he took it, put it on his table, and, stepping backward and screwing up his eyes, began examining it.
'That's it! That's it!' he said, and taking up his pencil he began drawing rapidly.
He copied that new pose, and, suddenly remembering the energetic pose and prominent chin of a shopman from whom he had bought cigars, he gave the figure that man's face and chin.
Having made it up with his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar, and a hat, and went to the studio.
He always attributed to those judges a better understanding than his own, and always expected to hear from them something he had himself not noticed in his work, often fancying that in their criticisms he had really found that something.
Of medium height, thick-set and with a loose gait, Mikhaylov in his brown hat, olive-green overcoat and narrow trousers (at a time when wide ones had long since come into fashion), and especially his commonplace broad face, expressing a combination of timidity and a desire to be dignified, created an unpleasant impression.
'Come in, please!' he said, trying to put on an air of indifference, as he entered the hall and took a key from his pocket to unlock the door.
Vronsky and Anna, according to Mikhaylov's conception, were in all probability distinguished wealthy Russians, who like all these wealthy Russians comprehended nothing of art but pretended to be amateurs and critics. 'Probably they've seen all the antiquities, and are now going the round of the modern painters, the German quack and the stupid English pre-Raphaelite, and to complete the series have come to see me too,' he thought.
During the few moments that they were silently gazing at it, Mikhaylov also regarded it with the indifferent eye of a stranger.
To break it and to appear calm, he made an effort and addressed Golenishchev.
'I think I have had the pleasure of meeting you?' he said, glancing uneasily now at Anna and now at Vronsky, in order not to lose any detail of their expressions.
We first met at Rossi's. Don't you remember that evening when the Italian lady recited – the new Rachel?' began Golenishchev glibly, turning away from the picture to the artist without the slightest regret.
He took a liking for Golenishchev because of that remark, and his depression changed suddenly into delight.
He wished to say that it was just so that he understood Pilate, but his trembling lips would not obey him and he was unable to speak.
That is technique,' said Vronsky, addressing Golenishchev and alluding to a conversation they had had about Vronsky's despair of attaining technical mastery.
'Yes, yes, wonderful!' chimed in Golenishchev and Anna. In spite of his elation, this remark about technique grated painfully on Mikhaylov's heart, and, glancing angrily at Vronsky, he suddenly frowned.
'Why so? To me it seems that for educated people such questions can no longer exist,' said Mikhaylov.
ANNA AND VRONSKY HAD LONG BEEN exchanging glances regretting their friend's clever loquacity, and at last Vronsky without waiting for his host crossed the room to look at another and smaller picture.
The elder had just thrown the line and, quite absorbed in his occupation, was carefully drawing the float from behind a bush; the younger one lay in the grass, leaning on his elbows with his fair tousled head in his hands, and with dreamy blue eyes gazing at the water.
When the visitors had left, Mikhaylov sat down before his picture of Pilate and Christ and mentally reviewed all that had been said, and even what was not said but only hinted by the visitors.
At length, tearing himself away from it regretfully, he let the sheet fall over the picture and went home, tired but happy.
The word talent, which they understood to mean an innate and almost physical capacity, independent of mind and heart, and which was their term for everything an artist lives through, occurred very often in their conversation, since they required it as a name for something which they did not at all understand, but about which they wanted to talk.
But the picture of the boys had gripped their memories and they kept coming back to it. 'How charming!
He addressed Vronsky as 'Your Excellency,' and never stayed to dinner, though Anna and Vronsky both invited him, and he never came except for a sitting.
With characteristic firmness he left off painting, without any explanations or excuses.
But without that occupation his life and Anna's – who was surprised at his disenchantment – appeared very dull in the Italian town. All of a sudden the palazzo became so obviously old and dirty, so disagreeably familiar were the stains on the curtains, the cracks in the floor, the cracked stuccoes of the cornices, and so wearisome became Golenishchev, the Italian professor, and the German traveller, who were also always the same, that a change was necessary.
And now, behold! his life with his wife had not shaped itself differently, but was all made up of those petty trifles which he had formerly so despised, but which now, against his will, assumed an unusual and incontestable importance.
When one of them was in good spirits and the other was not, peace was not broken; but if both chanced to be out of sorts, collisions resulted from causes so trifling as to be incomprehensible. Often afterwards they could not remember what they had quarrelled about.
He went on with his work with a feeling that the centre of gravity of his attention had shifted, and that he consequently saw the matter differently and with greater clearness.
'Yes, they divert all the sap, they produce a false glamour,' he muttered, pausing, and feeling that she was looking at him he turned round smiling.
'Nothing, I only wanted to make you turn round,' said she, gazing at him and trying to discover whether he was vexed at the interruption.
I shan't go anywhere, especially not to Moscow.'
But their serious matters did not get on, and they jumped apart guiltily when Kuzma came to say that tea was served.
'And have they returned from town?' Levin inquired of Kuzma.
'They've just come and are unpacking.'
There was something contemptible, effeminate, Capuan, as he called it, in his present life. 'It is not right to live so,' he thought.
'You see, your lady has made me sit with her,' said Agatha Mikhaylovna, glancing with a friendly smile at Kitty.
I've read your letter,' said Kitty, handing him a badly-written letter. 'It is from that woman, I think – your brother's...
She begged Levin to keep watch over his brother.
'Read it... Dolly writes about you,' Kitty began with a smile, but paused suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her husband's face.
Agatha Mikhaylovna, seeing that a quarrel was imminent, softly put down her cup and went out.
'And I say that if you go I shall go with you. I will certainly go!' she said hastily and angrily.
'Go, go!' she said with a timid, guilty look at him.
She was just the same as he had seen her in Moscow – the same stuff dress without collar or cuffs, and the same kindly, dull, pock-marked face, only somewhat stouter.
For a moment he did not understand the cause of her confusion, but she immediately explained it.
'He will be pleased. He heard; and he knows and remembers her abroad.'
She shrank together, flushed till tears filled her eyes, and seizing the ends of her shawl began twisting them in her red fingers, not knowing what to say or do.
'Dear me, we can't talk in the corridor!' said Levin, looking crossly at a man who was just passing along with jerky steps, ostensibly on business of his own.
'Well, then, come in,' said Kitty to Mary Nikolavna, who had regained her self-control; 'or better still, you go on and send for me,' she continued, noticing her husband's frightened look, and then returned to their room. Levin went to his brother.
He had expected to feel the same sorrow at the loss of a loved brother and the same horror of death he had then experienced, but to a greater degree, and had prepared himself for all this; but what he found was quite different.
The glittering eyes glanced severely and reproachfully at the brother who was entering, and this glance immediately established living relations between living people.
The smile was very faint, hardly perceptible, and in spite of it the stern expression of the eyes did not change.
'You did not expect to find me like this?' he said, speaking with difficulty.
Nicholas seemed pleased at this, but said he was afraid the condition he was in might frighten her.
A silence followed.
Tidy up,' said the invalid with an effort. 'And when you have finished, go away,' he added, with a questioning look at his brother.
Kitty was silent a moment, looking timidly and pitifully at her husband, then she approached and took hold of his elbow with both hands.
Please let me!' she entreated as if her happiness depended on it.
The sick man's animation did not last long.
He went out continually on all sorts of pretexts, coming back and going out again, incapable of remaining alone.
'I'm not looking,' she said, helping the arm in. 'Mary Nikolavna, you go round to the other side and put it right,' she added.
'There is a little bottle in my handbag,' she went on, turning to her husband. 'You know, in the side pocket!
The invalid himself, washed and with his hair brushed, lay between clean sheets in a clean shirt, its white collar round his abnormally thin neck, gazing with a new look of hope at Kitty and not taking his eyes off her.
The new doctor took out a stethoscope and sounded him, shook his head, prescribed some medicine and gave extremely precise instructions about giving the medicine and about diet.
How pleasant!' He took her hand and drew it toward his lips, but as if fearful that this might be disagreeable to her he changed his mind, let her hand drop, and merely stroked it.
Dreadful as it seemed to Levin to put his arms round that terrible body, to grasp those parts under the blanket which he did not wish to remember, yet submitting to his wife, with that determined expression which she knew, he thrust his arms under the blanket, and despite his great strength was struck by the strange heaviness of those emaciated limbs.
While he was turning him, with the enormous lean arm about his neck, Kitty quickly and unostentatiously turned and beat the pillow, and arranged the invalid's head and the hair that again clung to the temples.
The patient retained his brother's hand in his.
Levin, trembling, choking with sobs and unable to utter a word, left the room.
Both knew with certainty what Life was and what Death was, and though they would have been quite unable not only to answer but even to understand the questions which confronted Levin, neither doubted the importance of those phenomena, and they both had exactly the same outlook upon them – an outlook shared not only by them but by millions of others.
She ordered supper to be brought, unpacked their things herself, helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprinkle insect powder on them.
She, however, sorted combs and brushes, and did it all in such a way that there was nothing offensive about it.
Still, I am very glad I persuaded him,' she said, turning her eyes toward her husband from behind her hair. 'Everything is possible,' she added with the peculiar and rather cunning expression which always appeared on her face when she spoke of religious matters.
'It would have been so painful for you alone,' she said, and raising her arms high so that they hid her cheeks, now flushed with pleasure, she twisted her braided hair and pinned it up at the back of her head. 'No,' she continued, 'she did not know how to...
I feel that we should have been friends, he and I...' she said, and, frightened at her own words, she glanced at her husband, and tears filled her eyes.
He even sat up when they brought him some soup, and asked for a cutlet too.
'Better – Yes, much better. – Wonderful! – It is not at all wonderful. Still, he's better!' they said in whispers, smiling at one another.
He did not lift his head but only turned up his eyes, failing to reach his brother's face. 'Kate, go away,' he added.
'I'll soon be lying,' he said softly. 'Dead!' he added cynically and angrily.
'That's so!' he drawled in a tone of relief, as if he had found a solution. 'Oh God!' he muttered with a heavy sigh.
'Don't go,' said Nicholas and stretched out his hand.
Levin gave him his hand, signing angrily with the other to his wife.
He again sat up, coughed, ate and talked, no longer of death, expressed hopes of recovery, and was even more irritable and depressed than before.
Levin, who had long wished to reconcile his brothers, even if only at the moment of death, had written to Sergius Ivanich, and having received his answer read it to Nicholas.
Only the invalid himself did not show that desire, but on the contrary was angry because the doctor had not been fetched, and he continued taking medicine and talking of life.
Only at rare moments, when opium made him forget his incessant sufferings for a moment, did he sometimes when half asleep express what was stronger in his soul than in any of the others': 'Oh, if only it were over!' or 'When will this end!'
His sufferings, regularly increasing, did their work of preparing him for death.
He had no words to express his desire for this liberation, and therefore did not speak of it; but went on from habit demanding satisfaction of those wishes that could be fulfilled. 'Turn me on the other side,' he said, and immediately afterwards asked to be put back as he had been.
After dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as usual to the sick man, taking her embroidery.
Nicholas looked at her sternly when she entered, and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been ill.
'Worse,' he answered with an effort. 'It hurts!'
Levin said 'Hush!' and turned to look at his brother.
Toward night the patient could no longer raise his hands, and only gazed straight before him without changing the attentive concentrated expression of his eyes.
Even when his brother or Kitty bent over him so that he could see them, he did not look at them.
Having finished the prayer, the priest touched the cold forehead with his cross which he then wrapped in his stole, and after standing in silence another two minutes, touched the enormous bloodless hand, which was growing cold.
A moment later his face brightened, a smile appeared under the moustache, and the women who had gathered round him began zealously to lay out the body.
The doctor confirmed their supposition about Kitty. Her illness was pregnancy.
FROM THE MOMENT THAT KARENIN UNDERSTOOD from his conversations with Betsy and Oblonsky that all that was asked of him was that he should leave his wife in peace and not trouble her with his presence and that his wife herself wished this, he felt so lost that he could decide nothing for himself, did not know what he now wanted, and having placed himself in the hands of those who with so much pleasure busied themselves with his affairs, he consented to everything.
Without rendering account to himself why he did it, during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent.
Karenin appeared to be considering, when suddenly he turned round and sat down at the table.
Dropping his head on his hands he sat thus for a long time, tried several times to speak, but stopped short.
Neither at school nor at the university, nor afterwards, in the Service, did he enter into friendly relations with anyone.
At the time when he was Governor of a Province, Anna's aunt, a rich provincial lady, introduced him, who though not a young man was a young Governor, to her niece, and contrived to put him in such a position that he was obliged either to propose or leave the town.
At that time there were as many reasons for the step as against it, but there was no such decisive reason as to make him neglect his rule of refraining when in doubt. But Anna's aunt intimated to him, through an acquaintance, that he had already compromised the girl, and that he was in honour bound to propose to her.
His attachment to Anna excluded from his soul any need he had felt for affectionate relations with other persons; and now, among all his acquaintances, he had no intimate friend.
Once Karenin, having finished signing documents, remained silent a long time, glancing now and then at Michael Vasilich, and tried several times but was unable to begin speaking.
Karenin rose frowning, and disengaging his hand moved a chair toward her.
I am no longer a man!' said Karenin, releasing her hand but continuing to gaze into her tearful eyes. 'My position is terrible because I cannot find support anywhere, cannot find it even in myself.'
Though it was evident that she was touched by her own lofty sentiments, and though her words proceeded from that new, ecstatic, mystic influence which had lately spread through Petersburg and which Karenin had considered superfluous, it was pleasant to him to hear them now.
'It is not the loss of what no longer exists, it is not that,' continued Karenin.
Karenin frowned, and bending his hands backward began cracking his fingers.
About two months after their marriage her husband left her, and only answered her ecstatic assurances of tenderness with ridicule and even with animosity – which those who knew the Count's good-nature, and who saw no fault in the ecstatic Lydia, were quite unable to explain.
Lydia Ivanovna found out through acquaintances what 'those disgusting people,' as she called Anna and Vronsky, intended to do, and tried so to direct her friend's steps during those days that he should not meet them.
A young adjutant, a comrade of Vronsky's, through whom she had her information, who hoped through her influence to obtain a concession, told her that they had finished their affairs and were leaving Petersburg next day.
'MADANIE LA COMTESSE! – The Christian feelings which fill your heart encourage me to what I feel to be the unpardonable boldness of writing to you.
I entreat you to permit me to see him once before my departure.
Everything in that letter irritated the Countess Lydia Ivanovna: its matter, the hint contained in the word 'magnanimity,' and especially what seemed to her its free and easy tone.
In this way they chattered unceasingly about Karenin, blaming him and laughing at him, while he, barring the way to the member of the State Council whom he had buttonholed, and not pausing for a moment for fear he might slip away, expounded point by point some financial project of his.
Whatever he might say, whatever he might propose, he was listened to as if all he was proposing had long been known and was what no one wanted.
The evident impatience of the Member of the Council did not trouble Karenin, who left off expounding his project only when the Councillor, profiting by a royal personage's passing, slipped away.
Left alone, Karenin bowed his head, collecting his thoughts; and then turned absent-mindedly toward the door where he hoped to meet the Countess Lydia Ivanovna. 'How strong and healthy they all are physically,' he thought, glancing at the powerfully-built chamberlain with his well-brushed and perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck of a Prince in a tightly-fitting uniform, whom he had to pass on his way.
Having caught sight, just as she entered, of the Countess Lydia Ivanovna's yellow shoulders emerging from her corset, and of her beautiful dreamy eyes summoning him, Karenin smiled, revealing his white impeccable teeth, and went up to her.
Karenin started at the reference to his wife, but immediately his face assumed a death-like immobility which showed utter helplessness in the matter.
The Countess Lydia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and her eyes filled with tears of rapturous admiration at the loftiness of his soul.
Karenin glanced absent-mindedly at the numberless familiar portraits decorating the boudoir, and sitting down by the table opened a New Testament that was on it.
'But wherein am I to blame?' he asked himself, and as usual that question suggested another: Did those others – those Vronskys and Oblonskys and those fat-calved chamberlains – feel differently, love differently, marry differently?
He drove these thoughts from him, and tried to convince himself that he was not living for the present temporal life but for eternal life, and that his soul was full of peace and love.
'Serezha!' said his tutor, a Slav, stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms, 'take it off yourself.'
He stood holding on by the porter's shoulder-strap and looking into his face.
Go, go! Vasily Lukich is calling you,' said the hall-porter, hearing the approaching step of the tutor, and gently disengaging the little hand in the half-drawn-off glove which held him by his shoulder-strap, as he nodded and winked toward the tutor.
On entering the schoolroom, instead of sitting down to his lessons, Serezha told his tutor of his guess that the parcel that had been brought must be a railway train. 'What do you think?' he asked.
Serezha looked attentively at his teacher, at his thin little beard and his spectacles which had slipped down the bridge of his nose, and became so engrossed in thought that he no longer heard what his teacher was explaining.
Why does he repulse me? Why does he not love me?' he asked himself sadly, and could find no answer.
Before his father came Serezha sat at the table playing with a pocket-knife and thinking.
At the sight of any such woman a feeling of such tenderness awoke in his heart that he grew breathless and tears came to his eyes.
To-day Serezha was more than ever conscious of a flow of love for his mother in his heart, and now as he sat lost in thought, waiting for his father, he notched the whole edge of the table with his knife, looking before him with shining eyes and thinking about her.
Serezha jumped up, approached his father, kissed his hand, and looked at him attentively, trying to find some sign of his joy at receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky.
Serezha looked at his father with scared eyes, and could only think of whether his father would make him repeat what he had just said, as he sometimes did.
However, his father did not make him repeat it, but went on to the lesson from the Old Testament.
You'd better tell me,' said Vasily Lukich, smiling, which he rarely did. 'Well, lie down, and I'll put out the candle.'
His brother, however, having come to see him next morning, asked about her, and Alexis Vronsky told him frankly that he regarded his union with her as a marriage, that he hoped to arrange a divorce for her, and would then marry her, and that meanwhile he considered her his wife, just like any other wife, and he asked his brother to say so to their mother and to his own wife.
The elder brother, who had always respected his younger brother's opinions, was not sure whether he was right or wrong, until the world had decided the point; but for his own part he had nothing against it and went up with Alexis to see Anna.
In his brother's presence Vronsky spoke to Anna merely as to a close acquaintance, as he always did in the presence of a third party; but it was assumed that his brother knew of their relations, and they spoke of Anna's going to Vronsky's estate.
This was what Vronsky experienced with regard to Society.
As in the game of cat and mouse, the arms that were raised to allow him to get inside the circle were at once lowered to prevent Anna from entering.
The day after his arrival Vronsky called on her, and having found her alone, expressed his wish.
'But I don't consider that she has fallen lower than hundreds of people whom you do receive!' said Vronsky still more gloomily, and rose in silence, having understood that his sister-in-law's determination was final.
'I am not angry with you,' he said just as gloomily, 'but I am doubly pained.
So at least it seemed to Vronsky, as a man with a sore finger feels that he is continually knocking that finger against everything as if on purpose.
The commissionaire who delivered her letter brought back the most cruel and unexpected reply: that there would be no answer!
Having spent all that day at the hotel considering how she might see her son, she resolved to write to her husband.
She drove to a toy shop, purchased a lot of toys, and devised a plan of action. She would go early in the morning, at about eight, when Karenin would certainly not be up.
Next morning Anna went alone, and at eight o'clock got out of the hired carriage and rang the bell at the front door of the house which used to be her home.
After examining the note the porter's assistant stopped her at the inner glass door.
Noticing the stranger's confusion, Kapitonich himself came out, admitted her, and inquired what she wanted.
'He is not up yet,' said the hall-porter, carefully scrutinizing her face.
She wished to speak, but her voice refused to utter a sound; with a look of guilty entreaty at the old man she went with light steps up the stairs.
Bending forward and catching the steps with his goloshes, Kapitonich ran after her, trying to overtake her.
I'll just look in,' he said, having overtaken her. He opened a big door and vanished behind it.
At the moment when his lips were closing they extended into a blissful sleepy smile, and with that smile he again fell slowly and sweetly backwards.
He raised himself again on his elbow, moved his tousled head from side to side as if seeking for something, and opened his eyes.
Silently and questioningly he gazed for a few moments at his mother, who stood motionless before him, then suddenly smiling blissfully, he closed his heavy eyelids and fell once more, not backward, but forwards into her arms.
While saying this he was again falling asleep.
I won't,' she said, swallowing her tears and turning away. 'But it's time for you to get dressed,' she said after a pause when she had recovered; and without releasing his hands she sat down by his bed on a chair on which his clothes were lying ready.
She tried to speak simply and cheerfully, but could not, and turned away again.
He shook his head, sighed, and closed the door again. 'I will be another ten minutes,' he said to himself, coughing and wiping away his tears.
The hall-porter remained obstinately silent; but when the valet said he 'ought to get the sack,' Kapitonich rushed at Korney and, flourishing his hands about before Korney's face, began to speak out:
Serezha, with bright eyes and beaming smile, holding his mother with one hand and his nurse with the other, jumped with his plump bare feet on to the carpet.
He pressed against her in silence, and then whispered:
His mother moved him away from her, to see whether he really believed what he was saying; and in the frightened look on his face she saw not only that he was speaking about his father, but that he was, as it were, asking her what he ought to think of him.
Anna moved the hands away, kissed him again on his wet face, and went rapidly out.
Karenin was advancing toward her.
On returning to her lonely suite in the hotel she could not for a long time understand why she was there. 'Yes, it is all ended and I am alone again,' she said to herself; and without taking off her bonnet she sat down in an easy-chair by the fireplace.
The French maid, whom she had brought from abroad, came and asked whether she would not dress. She looked at her in astonishment and replied, 'Later.'
A waiter offered her coffee. 'Later,' she said.
The Italian nurse, having smartened up the baby girl, came in and held her out to Anna.
She returned the baby to its nurse, sent them away, and opened a locket with Serezha's portrait as a baby about the same age as the little girl.
Rising, she removed her bonnet and took from the table an album in which were photographs of her son at different ages.
He was there in a white shirt, astride a chair, his brows frowning while his mouth smiled.
There was no knife on the table, and she drew out the photo next to it (one, taken in Rome, of Vronsky with long hair and wearing a round hat), and with it pushed out her son's photo. 'Yes, there he is!' she said with a glance at Vronsky's likeness, and suddenly remembered that he was the cause of her present grief.
She awaited him, thinking with a sinking heart of the words in which she would tell him everything and of the expressions of his love which would comfort her. The servant returned with the reply that he had a visitor, but would come up at once, and wished to know whether he might bring with him Prince Yashvin, who had just arrived in Petersburg.
'So he won't come alone,' she thought, 'he won't come so that I can tell him everything, but will bring Yashvin...' And suddenly a strange idea crossed her mind: what if he had ceased to love her?
She imagined that he had ceased to love her, and she was almost in despair: which roused in her a feeling of peculiar excitement.
She rang for her maid, and going into the dressing-room paid more attention to her toilet than she had done all these days, as if, having ceased to love her, his love might be recalled by her wearing the dress and having her hair done in the style most becoming to her.
But of course you don't care for life abroad,' she went on with a pleasant smile: 'I know you and know all your tastes, though we have met so seldom.'
'Not long, I think,' she replied with embarrassment glancing at Vronsky.
'Come and dine with me,' said Anna resolutely, as if vexed with herself for her embarrassment, yet blushing as she always did when she revealed her position to a fresh person. 'The dinners here are not good, but at any rate you will see one another.
I shall catch you up in a minute!' he shouted to Yashvin.
She took his hand and looked fixedly at him, trying to think of something to say to prevent his leaving her.
'Well, then go! Go!' she said in an offended tone, and quickly left him.
But Anna did not return alone, she brought with her her old maiden aunt, Princess Oblonskaya.
He looked seriously at her, but she answered him with the same provocative glance of high spirits or desperation, the meaning of which he could not make out.
'Of course there is no reason whatever,' he replied with a frown.
I love you, and it's all the same to me,' she said, changing from French into Russian, while her eyes as she looked at him glittered with a light he could not understand, 'so long as you have not changed toward me!
'Because it might cause you...' He became confused.
And what is happening to her?' he asked himself.
He went down frowning to his rooms, and taking a seat beside Yashvin, who sat with his long legs stretched out on a chair drinking brandy and seltzer, ordered the same for himself.
This conversation about horses interested him, but he never forgot Anna, and involuntarily listened to the steps in the corridor and glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece.
Yashvin emptied another glass of brandy into the sparkling water, drank it, and then rose, buttoning his coat.
'Well, let us go,' he said, smiling slightly under cover of his big moustache, and showing by that smile that he understood the cause of Vronsky's depression, but did not attach importance to it.
Left alone, Vronsky got up and began pacing the room.
In trying to save it from falling he overturned it, and in his vexation kicked it and rang the bell.
The valet, conscious that he was not to blame, was about to defend himself, but, glancing at his master saw by his face that there was nothing for it but to keep silence; so, stooping quickly, he knelt on the carpet and began sorting out the whole and broken glasses and bottles.
Send a waiter to clear it up, and get out my dress suit!'
The attendant, an old man, helped him off with his overcoat, recognized him and, addressing him as 'Your Excellency,' suggested that he need not take a ticket for his coat, but should merely call for 'Theodore' when he wanted it.
When he entered the auditorium, brilliantly illuminated by chandeliers and bronze gas brackets, the noise still continued.
The conductor from his raised seat helped to pass the bouquets, and rearranged his white tie.
Vronsky went to the middle of the floor, then stopped and looked around him.
He glanced around unobtrusively, but did not look at her: prepared for the worst, he looked for Karenin.
He was frowning and drawing the left side of his moustache further and further into his mouth, looking askance at the adjoining box.
Her face looked pale and angry and she was speaking excitedly.
Her husband began conversing with her from his box, and Kartasova flew at him!
'I have been expecting you all the time,' said his mother with a sarcastic smile. 'I never see anything of you.'
'I think you got here late and missed the finest aria,' said Anna to him, with a mocking glance as it seemed to him.
She rose and went to the back of the box.
She was sitting in the first arm-chair by the wall, fixedly gazing before her.
She glanced at him and immediately resumed her former posture.
And those assurances of love, which to him appeared so trivial that he felt ashamed to utter them, she drank in and gradually became calm.
Next day, fully reconciled, they left for the country.
He said he greatly regretted that his duties prevented his spending the summer with his family in the country, which would have given him the greatest pleasure; and he remained in Moscow, visiting the country occasionally for a day or two at a time.
'You must take me too!
I am very fond of looking for mushrooms,' he said with a glance at Varenka. 'I consider it a very good occupation.'
Kitty and Dolly exchanged significant looks.
After dinner Koznyshev sat down by the drawing-room window, continuing his conversation with his brother over a cup of coffee and glancing now and then at the door through which the children, who were preparing to set out on the mushroom hunt, would enter.
'In many ways you have changed since your marriage and for the better,' said Koznyshev, smiling at Kitty and apparently not much interested in his conversation with his brother; 'but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical views.'
'Kate, it is not good for you to be standing,' said her husband, with a meaning look, moving a chair toward her.
'Ah, well! there's no time now,' added Koznyshev as the children came running in.
In advance of them all, at a sideways gallop, came Tanya in tightly pulled-up stockings, running toward Koznyshev, flourishing a basket and his hat.
Having boldly approached him, her beautiful eyes beaming (eyes so like her father's), she gave him his hat and made a movement as if to put it on him, her shy and gentle smile softening the boldness of the action.
'Varenka is waiting,' she said, carefully placing his hat on his head when she saw from his smile that she had permission to do so.
'I'm coming, Mlle Varenka,' said Koznyshev, drinking up his coffee and pocketing his handkerchief and cigarcase.
We will drive there.'
Varenka, hearing Kitty's voice and her mother reprimanding her, came up with her light step.
'Varenka, I shall be very happy if a certain thing comes to pass,' she whispered, kissing her.
'And are you coming with us?' Varenka, quite confused, asked Levin, pretending not to have heard what had been said to her.
'Oh, why should you?' said Kitty.
'I always buy dress materials for the maids myself, at the sales,' the Princess said, continuing the conversation. 'Is it not time to take the scum off, my dear?' she added, turning to Agatha Mikhaylovna.
'Steve says it's better to give them money,' Dolly remarked, returning to the interesting topic of what presents it was best to give to the servants, 'but...'
'Yes, I remember she wore it on your Name day.'
'Oh, how sweet he is – don't frighten him!' exclaimed Kitty unexpectedly, looking at a sparrow that had settled on the railing, turned a raspberry stalk over, and was pecking at it.
'Oh, but, Mama, try and understand why nothing better could be imagined either for him or for her.
'Secondly, his position in the world is such that neither property nor the social position of his wife matters to him at all.
And the three women meditated silently on the same subject.
Such things happen to every girl.'
'No, excuse me!' her mother continued. 'And then you yourself would not let me talk it over with Vronsky.
The exact reverse,' she added, struck by her thought. 'Then Anna was so happy and Kitty considered herself miserable.
Walking is good for me,' and Kitty rose, went to her husband and took his arm.
'It's better so, Agatha Mikhaylovna: it won't ferment, and we have no ice left in the cellar and nowhere to keep it cool,' said Kitty, immediately seeing her husband's intention and addressing the old woman in the same spirit. 'On the other hand, your pickling is such that Mama says she never tasted anything like it!' she added, smiling and putting the old woman's kerchief straight.
Agatha Mikhaylovna looked crossly at Kitty.
'Please follow my advice,' said the old Princess, 'cover the jam with paper soaked in rum, and then it will not get mouldy, even without ice.'
When they started on their walk in advance of the others and had passed out of sight of the house on to the hard, dusty road, strewn with rye-ears and grain, she leaned more heavily on his arm and pressed it.
Her disbelief in his dissatisfaction with himself was pleasant, and unconsciously he challenged her to give reasons for her disbelief.
'In what way?' asked she, still smiling. 'Don't you do anything for others?
So you think he will propose to-day?' he added after a pause.
'There, begin! He will propose, he won't...' and she handed him the flower.
'No, no!' exclaimed she, watching his fingers excitedly as she seized his hand to stop him. 'You've pulled off two at once.'
'Well then, we won't count this tiny one,' said he, picking off a short ill-formed petal. 'And here's the trap overtaking us.'
Conscious of that smile, Koznyshev shook his head disapprovingly at his own state and taking out a cigar began to light it.
At last one match did burn up, and the scented smoke of the cigar, like a broad swaying sheet definitely outlined, moved forwards and upwards over the bush under the overhanging branches of the birch-tree.
Watching the sheet of smoke, he went on slowly, meditating on his condition of mind.
The second one was: she was not only far from worldly, but evidently felt a repulsion from the world, yet she knew the world and had all the ways of a woman of good Society, without which a life-companion would be unthinkable for him.
Throwing away his cigar Koznyshev went toward her with resolute steps.
I love you, and offer you my hand.'
Kneeling and with outstretched arms defending some mushrooms from Grisha, she was calling little Masha.
On seeing Koznyshev approaching she did not move; yet everything told him that she felt his approach and was glad of it.
And as soon as those words were spoken, both he and she understood that all was over, and that what ought to have been said would not be said, and their excitement, having reached its climax, began to subside.
They began to return to the children. Varenka felt pained and ashamed, but at the same time she experienced a sense of relief.
'Gently, gently, children!' shouted Levin almost angrily, stepping in front of his wife to shield her, when the crowd of children came rushing at them with shrieks of delight.
Behind the children Koznyshev and Varenka came out of the wood.
'And I know why,' continued the Princess. 'He says young married folk should be left to themselves for a while.'
And suddenly the old Princess's voice unexpectedly quavered.
No, Dolly! I will go,' said Levin, jumping up.
'So you are expecting Stephen Arkadyevich to-night?' asked Koznyshev, evidently disinclined to join in a conversation about Varenka. 'It would be hard to find two brothers-in-law more unlike,' he went on with his subtle smile; 'the one always on the move, living always in Society like a fish in water; the other, our Constantine here, lively, quick, sensitive to everything, but as soon as he appears in Society either shutting up altogether or floundering about absurdly like a fish on dry land!'
'It's Steve!' shouted Levin from under the balcony. 'We have finished, Dolly, don't worry!' he added, running like a boy to meet the carriage.
It must be Papa!' shouted Levin, who had stopped at the bend of the avenue. 'Kitty, don't come down those steep steps, go round!'
Not at all dismayed by the disappointment he caused by appearing instead of the old Prince, Veslovsky gaily greeted Levin, reminding him that they had met before, and lifting Grisha he caught him up into the vehicle over the pointer Oblonsky had brought with him.
He looked at Dolly, and was not pleased with her either.
He looked at the Princess, who a few moments before had seemed so nice, and did not like the way she welcomed that beribboned Vasenka, as if to her own house.
Talking noisily, they all went into the house, but as soon as all were seated Levin turned and left the room.
LEVIN DID NOT RETURN until they called him to supper.
Kostya! Wait a moment – what's the matter with you?' said Kitty, hurrying after him, but, without waiting for her, he went away pitilessly with big strides to the dining-room, where he immediately joined in the general animated conversation which was kept going by Vasenka Veslovsky and Oblonsky.
'Yes, really! Don't let us go to bed!
Delightful!' chimed in Veslovsky.
Veslovsky, come here!'
'It's very nice at their place,' Vasenka was saying, talking of Vronsky and Anna. 'Of course I do not take it upon myself to judge, but in their house one feels oneself to be in a family.'
Why should I go?' said Kitty, flushing deeply and glancing round at her husband.
Meanwhile Vasenka, without the least suspicion of the sufferings his presence was causing, rose from the table after Kitty and followed her, smiling pleasantly.
Please let's go!' said Vasenka, sitting down and once more doubling his leg under him, as his habit was.
But he did not escape a fresh pang.
Taking leave of his hostess, Vasenka again wanted to kiss her hand; but Kitty, blushing, drew away her hand, and said with naive rudeness, for which she was afterwards reprimanded by her mother:
After the rest had separated for the night Oblonsky long walked in the avenue with Veslovsky, and their voices could be heard practising a new song.
Levin sat listening to them and frowning, in an easy chair in his wife's bedroom, meeting her inquiries as to what was the matter with stubborn silence. But when at length she asked with a timid smile: 'Aren't you displeased about something connected with Veslovsky?' he gave vent to his feelings and told her everything.
'Oh no Kostya! Wait – listen!' she implored with a look of pained commiseration.
'Try and understand the horror and absurdity of my position,' he continued in a despairing whisper. 'He is in my house, and strictly speaking he has done nothing improper except by his free and easy manner and doubling up his legs!
Laska jumped down to him and greeted him by leaping about. In her own way she asked him how soon the others would come out but, receiving no reply, she returned to her post of expectancy and again sat motionless with her head turned sideways and one ear pricked up.
At length the door opened noisily and out bounded, spinning round and round in the air, Krak, Oblonsky's yellow spotted pointer, followed by Oblonsky himself with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth. 'Quiet, quiet, Krak!' he said affectionately to the dog, which was throwing its paws up against his stomach and chest and getting them entangled in his game-bag.
He realized it now that he saw Oblonsky in his rags, yet shining with his elegant, well-nurtured, cheerful and gentlemanly figure, and resolved to follow his example next time.
Well, never mind!
'There, you see! You did not come to the office last night, and now you are detaining me.
It will just stretch from the bottom, you see,' he went on with a persuasive gesture, 'and go up and up till it gets there.'
'It will go up from the bottom, I mean, and reach to the top,' the carpenter repeated obstinately and persuasively.
Levin pulled out his ramrod and drew the staircase in the dust.
Hold the dogs, Philip!'
Vasenka Veslovsky alone chattered incessantly and merrily.
He seemed to picture a gallop on a Steppe horse as something wild and poetical; nothing came of it, but his naïveté, in connection with his good looks; sweet smile, and graceful movements, was very attractive.
He had three hundred and seventy roubles in the pocket-book, and therefore the matter could not be ignored.
So the coachman rode back on the side-horse and Levin drove the other two himself.
'There is, but it would delay us; and besides, it's hot!
Levin remained with the trap and looked enviously at the sportsmen.
Suddenly the horses started, Levin knocked his head against the barrel of some one's gun, and there was a report.
Oblonsky shook his head and laughed reproachfully at Veslovsky.
When they reached the second marsh, which was of considerable size and would take a good deal of time Levin tried to dissuade them from getting out.
But again Veslovsky persuaded him, and again, the marsh being a narrow one, Levin as a hospitable host remained with the vehicles.
Krak immediately went toward the hummocks.
Vasenka Veslovsky was the first to follow the dog.
Veslovsky killed the bird and went back to the vehicles.
'Why don't you stop her?' shouted Oblonsky.
A small marsh bird only diverted her attention for an instant.
She described a circle in front of the hummocks, and began another, but suddenly shuddered and stopped dead.
After making sure he had missed, he turned and saw that the trap and horses were no longer on the road but in the marsh.
Veslovsky, wishing to watch the shooting, had driven into the marsh, where the horses had stuck fast.
Ce poulet va tomber jusqu'au fond de mes bottes,' [A good appetite! a good conscience! This chicken will go down to the bottom of my boots.] remarked Vasenka, who had brightened up again, repeating a French saying while he finished a second chicken.
I am Automedona' – wait and see how I will drive you!' he said, keeping hold of the reins, in reply to Levin who wanted him to let the coachman drive. 'No, I must expiate my sin, and besides, it's delightful on the box,' and he was off.
Levin was rather afraid Veslovsky would tire out the horses, especially the roan on the left, whom he did not know how to hold in; but he could not resist Veslovsky's high spirits, the songs he sang all the way while sitting on the box, the stories he told, and his representation of the English way of driving four-in-hand; and after lunch they were all in the best of spirits when they reached the Gvozdevo marsh.
Oblonsky evidently wanted the same thing, and on his face Levin noticed the preoccupation, which every true sportsman feels before the shooting begins, and also a little good-natured cunning, characteristic of him.
It's a splendid marsh, and I see there are hawks too,' said Oblonsky, pointing at two large birds circling above the sedges. 'Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.'
We'll make the best bag,' chimed in Vasenka.
'Veslovsky, walk beside me – beside me!' he whispered with bated breath to his comrade, who was splashing in the water behind him, and the direction of whose gun, after the accidental shot by the Kolpensky marsh, involuntarily interested Levin.
Levin had barely time to turn, before he heard the cry of a snipe, then another, and a third, and about eight more rose one after the other.
Levin was not so lucky: he fired at the first snipe too near, and missed; he followed it with his gun when it had already risen, but at that instant another rose just at his feet and diverted his attention, and he missed again.
While they were reloading another bird rose, and Veslovsky, who had finished reloading, fired two charges of small shot over the water.
Oblonsky picked up his two snipe and looked with sparkling eyes at Levin.
They kept rising before the dogs and at the very feet of the sportsmen, and Levin might have recovered himself; but the oftener he fired the more he disgraced himself before Veslovsky, who was puffing away merrily, in and out of range, never killing anything, but not in the least abashed thereby.
Her search became more and more indolent, and she looked round at the sportsmen as if in perplexity and with reproach.
The cry near the ground and sound in the air came incessantly from every side. The snipe that had risen previously and had been flying about descended in front of the sportsmen.
Though there was little hope of finding as many birds in the unmown strips as on the mown part, Levin, having promised Oblonsky to meet him, went with his companion farther on over the mown and unmown strips.
'Hullo you sportsmen!' shouted one of several peasants who were sitting beside a cart from which the horses had been taken out.
Go, you'll find the way to the mill!' cried Levin, and on looking round was pleased to see Veslovsky making his way out of the marsh toward the peasants, stooping and stumbling with his weary feet and holding his gun at arm's length.
'You come too!' shouted a peasant to Levin.
The dog continued pointing.
'Fetch it!' Another bird rose before the dog.
Levin fired, but that day he had no luck: he missed, and when he went to look for the bird he had killed, he could not find it.
The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes were wet through with perspiration and stuck to his body; his left boot, full of water, was heavy and made a smacking sound; down his face, grimy with powder, ran drops of sweat; a bitter taste was in his mouth, the smell of powder and rust was in his nose, and the perpetual cry of the snipe was in his ears; he could not touch the barrels of his gun, they were so hot; his heart thumped with short, quick beats; his hands trembled with excitement and his tired feet stumbled as he dragged them over the hummocks and through the bog; but still he went on and shot.
'No! I must pull myself together,' he thought, picked up his gun and hat, called Laska to heel, and got out of the marsh.
When he reached a dry place he sat down on a hummock, took off his boot and emptied it, then went back to the marsh, drank a little of the rusty water, wetted the heated barrels and bathed his face and hands.
He came toward Levin red and perspiring, with his shirt unbuttoned, still limping as before.
He sat in the middle of the room, holding with both hands to a bench, from which a soldier – a brother of the mistress of the house – was tugging him by his slime-covered boots, and he was laughing with his infectiously merry laugh.
After fluctuating between recollections and stories of the shooting, of dogs, and of other shooting parties, the talk reached a theme that interested all three.
'Perfectly true!' chimed in Vasenka Veslovsky. 'Perfectly true!
Down, Krak!' exclaimed Oblonsky to the dog that was scratching itself and turning round in the hay.
'I don't give it away because nobody demands that of me, and if I wanted to I could not do it,' replied Levin; 'besides, there is no one to give it to.'
'Well, then I'll go alone,' said Veslovsky, rising quickly and putting on his boots.
That's all very well for an idyll, but it can't last a lifetime.
Levin pretended to be asleep, but Oblonsky, having put on his slippers and lit a cigar, left the barn, and their voices soon died away.
'To-morrow I will start early in the morning, and make up my mind not to get excited.
And when I come back, there will be a note from Kitty.
I am not manly with her, I have grown effeminate...
Oblonsky was saying something about the freshness of a girl, comparing her to a fresh kernel just taken from its shell; and Veslovsky was laughing his merry infectious laugh, and repeating something that had probably been told him by a peasant: 'You'd better strive for a wife of your own!'
Even Laska, sleeping curled into a ring on a corner of the hay heap, got up reluctantly, and lazily stretched and adjusted first one hind leg and then the other.
The outside world was still grey.
A bee flew past his ear, whistling like a bullet.
The path led him straight to the marsh, which was recognizable by the mist rising from it, thicker at one spot and thinner at another, so that the sedge and willow bushes looked like islets swaying in the mist.
Laska walked beside her master, seeking permission to run forward and looking around.
When he had passed the sleeping peasants and reached the first wet place, Levin examined his percussion caps and allowed Laska to go.
The other horses, also alarmed, splashed through the water with their hobbled feet, making a sound of slapping as they drew their hoofs out of the thick clayey mud, and began floundering their way out of the marsh.
Joyful and preoccupied, Laska started running across the bog, which swayed beneath her feet.
Here!' he said, pointing to the other side.
She obeyed, pretending to search in order to please him, went over the whole place and then returned to the first spot and immediately scented them once more.
One of her ears had turned back while she ran, she breathed heavily but cautiously, and yet more cautiously looked toward her master, turning her eyes rather than her head.
Having come close up to her he looked beyond, and from his height saw with his eyes what she had found with her nose.
It sat with turned head, listening.
Then, just spreading its wings slightly and folding them again, it vanished round a corner with an awkward backward jerk.
From here I scent them, but if I go forward I shall not know what I am doing, nor where they are nor who they are.' But now he pushed her with his knee, saying in an excited whisper, 'Seize it, Laska!
With lusty cries and a sound of the beating of concave wings so peculiar to the double-snipe, a bird rose; and, following the report of the gun, it fell heavily on its white breast ten paces from the first spot into the wet bog.
Another rose behind Levin without waiting to be disturbed by the dog.
After flying some twenty feet, the second snipe rose at an acute angle, and then, turning round and round like a ball, fell heavily on a dry spot.
A hawk had woke up and was sitting on a haycock, turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh.
'Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!' he shouted, following Levin from afar.
Tired, hungry, and happy, Levin returned to his lodging toward ten o'clock, having tramped some thirty versts and bringing nineteen red-fleshed birds, besides a duck tied to his girdle, as there was no room for it in his bag.
In the evening they again went out shooting, when Veslovsky also killed some birds, and late at night they set off home.
NEXT MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK Levin, having made the round of his farm, knocked at the door of Vasenka's room.
When they had walked round the garden, visited the stables, and even done some gymnastics together on the parallel bars, Levin returned to the house with his guest and entered the drawing-room with him.
The birth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which they promised him, but in which he still could not believe, so extraordinary did it seem, appeared to him on the one hand such an immense and therefore impossible happiness, and on the other such a mysterious event, that this pretended knowledge of what was going to happen and consequent preparations as for something ordinary, something produced by human beings, seemed to him an indignity and a degradation.
The Princess began telling him, but he did not listen to her.
'Well then, Princess, let it be just as you think best,' he said, turning away.
[A quotation from Pushkin's Boris Godunov.] said Oblonsky banteringly, evidently alluding not only to the Princess's conversation, but also to the cause of Levin's agitation, which he had observed. 'How late you are to-day, Dolly!'
Vasenka only rose for a moment, and with the absence of politeness to women which is characteristic of modern young men, barely bowed and again continued his conversation, laughing at something.
Levin did not answer him but went out with his wife.
In the garden they came upon a man weeding a path, and without any longer considering that the man saw her tear-stained eyes and his excited face, or that they looked like people running away from some calamity, they went on with rapid feet, feeling that they must speak out and convince each other, must be alone together, and thereby both escape from the torment both were experiencing.
She was walking up and down the room and speaking angrily to a little girl who stood howling in a corner:
Figurez vous que la petite...'
Dolly gazed at him with wise, comprehending eyes.
Consider!' she went on, laughing. 'You can go to Fanny now,' she said to Masha.
The little girl burst into sobs and buried her face in her mother's lap, and Dolly placed her thin tender hand on the child's head.
'Yes, it's much cleaner,' said Vasenka, placing his fat foot on a chair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling good-naturedly.
'It happens that I am expecting visitors,' replied Levin more rapidly, breaking off the splintered bits of the stick with his strong fingers. 'Or no, I am not expecting visitors and nothing has happened, yet I request you to leave.
As the splinters were now all broken off, Levin grasped the thick ends in his fingers and split the stick, carefully catching a piece as it fell.
Levin turned away from him quickly and went far down one of the avenues, where he continued walking up and down alone.
Soon he heard the rattle of the tarantas, and through the trees saw Vasenka, seated on hay (unluckily the tarantas had no seat), with the Scotch bonnet on his head, jolting over the ruts as he was driven down the other avenue.
He bowed and said something to Veslovsky, then climbed into the tarantas, and they drove away together.
Dolly, who had inherited her father's gift of putting things humorously, made Varenka collapse with laughter when she related for the third or fourth time, with ever fresh humorous additions, how she was just putting on some new ribbons in the visitor's honour, and was about to go into the drawing-room, when suddenly she heard the clatter of the old cart.
'I look again and they had popped a fat German in with him and were driving them both off...!
DOLLY CARRIED OUT HER INTENTION of going to see Anna.
Acting on Levin's advice, Dolly started before daybreak.
Dolly dozed, and only woke up when approaching the inn where the horses were to be changed.
After drinking tea at the prosperous peasant's house where Levin had stopped when on his way to Sviyazhsky's, and conversing with the women about their children and with the old man about Count Vronsky, of whom he spoke very highly, Dolly continued her journey at ten o'clock.
Her thoughts seemed strange to her.
Then came problems of a more remote future: how she should start her children in the world. 'With the girls it will be comparatively easy,' she thought, 'but how about the boys?
Dolly shuddered at the mere thought of the pain she had endured from sore nipples, from which she had suffered with almost every baby. 'Then the children's illnesses, that continued anxiety; then their education, nasty tendencies,' (she recalled little Masha's delinquency among the raspberry canes), 'lessons, Latin...
And above all, the death of these children...' And once more the cruel memory rose that always weighed on her mother-heart: the death of her last baby, a boy who died of croup; his funeral, the general indifference shown to the little pink coffin, and her own heartrending, lonely grief at the sight of that pale little forehead with the curly locks on the temples, and of the open, surprised little mouth visible in the coffin at the instant before they covered it with the pink lid ornamented with a gold lace cross.
They will have children of their own and won't be able to help us; as it is, they are put to inconvenience.
'And they are all down on Anna!
I was still attractive then, still had my good looks,' she went on, feeling that she wanted to see herself in a glass.
She had a small travelling looking-glass in her bag, and felt inclined to take it out; but glancing at the backs of the coachman and the clerk who sat swaying beside him, she knew she would feel ashamed if one of them chanced to look round, and she did not take it out.
THE COACHMAN STOPPED THE HORSES and looked round toward a field of rye on the right, where some peasants sat beside a cart.
The clerk wished to get down, but then, changing his mind, shouted authoritatively and beckoned to a peasant.
The metallic sound of a scythe being hammered beside the cart ceased, and one of the peasants rose and came toward the calèche.
'Look at him, stuck fast!' shouted the clerk angrily at the peasant, who was slowly stepping with bare feet over the ruts of the dry, hard-trodden road. 'Be quick!'
The curly-headed old man, with a piece of bast tied round his head, his rounded back dark with perspiration, increased his speed, approached the calèche and put his sunburnt arm on the mud-guard.
When you have passed that bend turn to the left, and go right down the drive and you'll knock up straight against it.
The coachman started, but hardly had they gone round the corner when the peasants called out to them.
In Dolly's mind the idea of horse-riding for women was connected with youthful coquetry, which in her opinion was unsuitable to a woman in Anna's position; but when she saw her closer she at once became reconciled to Anna's riding.
Sviyazhsky and the Princess Barbara in a new char-a-banc, to which was harnessed a tall trotter, were overtaking the riders.
Anna's face immediately brightened into a joyful smile when she recognized Dolly in the little figure pressed back in a corner of the old calèche.
She gave an exclamation, started in her saddle and touched her horse into a gallop.
Riding up to the calèche she jumped unaided from the horse and, holding up her habit, ran toward Dolly.
Vronsky, taking off his grey top hat, approached Dolly.
'Oh!' said Dolly, and her face involuntarily expressed displeasure.
Dolly walked up to the char-a-banc and coldly greeted Princess Barbara.
The clerk, to hide his embarrassment, bustled about, helping the ladies in, but Philip became morose and made up his mind not to be imposed upon by this eternal superiority.
The peasants beside the cart all got up and looked with merry curiosity at the visitor, making their own comments.
I have wakened up! I have lived through sufferings and terrors, but for a long time past – especially since we came here – I have been happy!...' she said, looking at Dolly timidly and with a questioning smile.
What are all those buildings? Quite a town!' she asked, to change the subject, pointing to the red and green roofs visible above a living green wall of acacias and lilacs.
Anna did not even glance at him; but it still seemed to Dolly out of place to begin to discuss this big subject in the calèche, so she briefly replied:
Anna, turning her eyes away from her friend and screwing them up (this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dolly), grew thoughtful, trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark.
'They are the employees' houses, the stud farm, and the stables,' answered Anna. 'And here the park begins.
It was his grandfather's, and it has not been altered at all on the outside.'
'Mais vous venez trop tard,' [But you have come too late.] she said, wiping with her handkerchief the hand which the horse had wetted as it took the sugar.
The smart lady's maid with hair stylishly done, and wearing a dress more fashionable than Dolly's, who came to offer her services, was as new and expensive as everything else in the room.
Is it for us to judge?
You wished to ask about her name? Am I not right?
That is, her name is Karenina,' said Anna, screwing up her eyes till only the meeting lashes could be seen. 'However, we will talk about all that later,' said she, suddenly brightening.
When they entered the little girl was sitting in her chemise in a little arm-chair at a table, having her dinner of broth which she was spilling all over her little chest.
A Russian nursemaid was feeding the child and evidently herself eating also.
Glancing round at the grown-up people with her large radiant black eyes, like a little animal, evidently pleased that she was being admired, she smiled, and turning out her feet, energetically supported herself on her hands, drew her lower limbs forward, and then again advanced her hands.
You know I have seen him, Serezha,' said Anna, screwing up her eyes as if peering at something far off. 'However, we will talk about that afterwards.
I must speak out about everything. Yes, I must give you a sketch of the people you will meet here,' she began.
Think of Biryuzovsky and Avenyeva... And even Nikandrov!
'Une partie de [A game of.] lawn tennis,' suggested Veslovsky with his pleasing smile. 'We will be partners again, Anna Arkadyevna!'
But, not to seem to be making up to Vronsky, he immediately added a slightly condemnatory remark. 'But I am surprised, Count, that you, who are doing so much for the people from a sanitary point of view, should be so indifferent to the schools!'
The ladies opened their sunshades and entered the sidewalk.
Having finished talking with the architect Vronsky rejoined the ladies and led them to the hospital.
Sviyazhsky appreciated everything like one who is acquainted with all the newest improvements.
'This is not a maternity home but a hospital, and is intended for all illnesses, except infectious ones,' he said. 'But have a look at this... 'and he moved a chair for convalescents, just arrived from abroad, toward Dolly.
'NO, I THINK THE PRINCESS DARYA ALEXANDROVNA IS TIRED and horses do not interest her,' said Vronsky to Anna, who was suggesting that they should go to the stud farm where Sviyazhsky wanted to look at a new stallion. 'You go, and I will see the Princess back to the house and will have a talk with her – if you do not mind?' he added, turning to Dolly.
'You have guessed that I want to talk to you,' he said, looking at her with laughter in his eyes. 'I know that you are a friend of Anna's.'
Dolly looked with timid inquiry at his energetic face, which was now wholly and now partly in the sunlight that fell between the lime trees, and then was again darkened by their shadow. She waited for what more he would say; but he walked by her side in silence, prodding the gravel with his stick as he went.
'As you have come to see us and you are the only one of Anna's former friends who has (I do not count the Princess Barbara) – I feel you have done so not because you consider our position normal, but because, realizing all the hardship of that position, you love her as before and wish to help her.
'Oh, yes!' answered Dolly, closing her sunshade, 'but...'
Whether we acted rightly or wrongly is another question; the die is cast,' he said, changing from Russian into French, 'and we are bound together for life.
She made no answer, but only looked at him. He continued:
I have tried to speak to Anna about it, but it irritates her.
I like my activities.
'Well, this brings me to the point of my talk,' he went on, calming himself with an effort. 'Anna can do it;. it depends on her...
Her husband was willing to have a divorce – your husband had almost arranged it – and I know he would not refuse now.
I do not speak of myself, though it's very hard on me, very hard,' he said with a look as if he were menacing some one for making it so hard on him. 'And so, Princess, I shamelessly cling to you as an anchor of salvation!
But how is it she herself does not think of it?' asked Dolly, suddenly remembering that strange new habit Anna had of screwing up her eyes. And she remembered that it was just when the intimate side of life was in question that Anna screwed up her eyes.
Vronsky introduced the doctor and the steward to his visitor; the architect had already been presented at the hospital.
Dolly observed all this luxury, which was new to her, and, as a housewife herself controlling a household, she could not help noting the details (though she had no hope of putting what she observed to practical use in her own home, so far was such luxury above her way of life) and asking herself how it was all done and by whom.
Vasenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviyazhsky and many others whom she knew, never thought about these things, and readily believed, what every decent host wishes his guests to feel, that all that is so well arranged at his house has cost him no trouble but has come about of itself.
It was evident that it depended no more on Anna than on Veslovsky.
Anna was the hostess only in what concerned the conversation.
'Nicholas Ivanich,' she said (referring to Sviyazhsky), 'was struck by the way the new building had grown since his last visit; even I, who go there every day, am always surprised how quickly it gets on.'
She was obviously aware that her explanation would not be understood, but as she knew that she spoke pleasantly and that her hands were beautiful, she went on explaining.
He evidently did not attach any importance to Veslovsky's chatter, and even encouraged it.
The conversation among the diners – except the doctor, the architect and the steward, who sat in gloomy silence – was incessant, now gliding smoothly, now catching on something and touching one or other of them to the quick.
'And I rather agree with your brother-in-law,' said Anna, 'though I do not go to his lengths,' she added with a smile. 'I'm afraid we have too many of these public obligations nowadays.
Although Anna spoke playfully, irritation was perceptible in her tone.
The players, having chosen their partners, took their places on the carefully levelled and rolled croquet lawn, on the two sides of a net stretched between two small gilded pillars.
Her partner Tushkevich also gave it up, but the rest played for a long time.
They intently followed the ball sent to them, neither hurrying nor hesitating, ran toward it with agility, waited for it to bounce, and then striking it with the racket sent it back across the net with good aim and precision.
He, as well as the other men, had with the ladies' permission taken off his coat, and his large handsome figure in white shirt-sleeves, his ruddy perspiring face and impetuous movements, stamped themselves on the memories of the onlookers.
But not to disturb the others and to while away the time, after resting she rejoined the players and pretended to like it.
'With Alexis?' said Anna. 'I know you have.
But imagine me living alone, without him, alone, and that will happen... everything shows that it will often happen, – that he will spend half his time from home,' she said, rising and taking a seat nearer to Dolly. 'Of course,' she went on, interrupting Dolly, who was about to reply, 'of course I won't keep him against his will!
One day there are races and his horses are running; he goes.
But think of me, imagine my position... But why talk of it!'
But I could not help remembering...
'Well, yes, of course,' said Dolly, listening to the very arguments which she had put to herself but not finding them so convincing as before.
She curved her white arms in front of her stomach.
She glanced at Dolly, but not pausing for a reply continued:
These were the very arguments Dolly had put to herself, but now she listened without understanding them. 'How can one be guilty toward beings who don't exist?' thought she.
She rose, drew herself up, sighed deeply, and with her light steps began pacing up and down the room, pausing occasionally. 'I not consider it?
Dolly, sitting upright in her chair, with a pained expression of sympathy turned her head to follow Anna's movements.
But what would it mean?' said Anna, evidently expressing a thought she had considered a thousand times and knew by heart. 'It means that I, who hate him but yet acknowledge myself to blame toward him – and I do think him magnanimous – I must humiliate myself by writing to him... !
Anna at that instant had reached the other end of the room and stopped there, doing something to the window curtain. 'I receive his consent, and my so... son?
'I love those two beings only, and the one excludes the other!
If anyone is unhappy, it is I!' she murmured, and, turning away, she wept.
When she came in Vronsky regarded her attentively.
She, misunderstanding that look, smiled at him.
Levin's coachman in his by no means new coat, and a hat something like a post-boy's, with his horses that did not match and the old calèche with mended mud-guards, drove up gloomily but resolutely to the covered, sand-strewn portico.
But it did seem so dull to me, Darya Alexandrovna! I don't know how you found it,' he added, turning his handsome, kindly face toward her.
On returning home and finding every one safe and extremely nice, Dolly gave a very animated account of her visit, of how well she had been received, of the luxury and good taste at the Vronskys', and of their amusements, and would not let anyone say a word against them.
There she not only helped, but arranged and planned many things herself.
He listened to what the steward had to say and questioned him, but only consented when the things to be ordered or built were the latest, as yet unknown in Russia, and likely to astonish people.
But, to his surprise, Anna took the news very quietly and only asked when he would return.
He looked at her attentively, not understanding this calm manner.
He asked his brother, who had a vote for the Seleznev district, to accompany him.
'Look here!' he would say, 'just try this – go to so-and-so, and to so-and-so.'
Koznyshev explained to him the meaning and importance of the changes anticipated as a result of the elections.
Levin, wishing to enter fully into everything and not to miss anything, stood there too in the crowd, and heard the Governor say: 'Please tell Mary Ivanovna that my wife is very sorry she has to go to the Orphanage.' Then the noblemen gaily scrambled for their overcoats and all drove to the cathedral.
On the second and third days matters were dealt with concerning the funds of the Nobility and the Girls' High Schools, which, Koznyshev explained, were quite unimportant; so Levin, busy going from place to place on the business he had in hand, did not trouble about them.
On the fourth day the audit of the Provincial Funds was undertaken, and now for the first time there was a conflict between the new and old parties.
Then a small, very young-looking, but very venomous man began saying that probably the Marshal of the Province would be pleased to account for the Funds, and that the excessive politeness of the members of the Commission was depriving him of that moral satisfaction.
Thereupon the members of the Commission withdrew their report and Koznyshev began very logically to prove that they must admit either that they had audited the accounts or that they had not done so, and to elaborate this dilemma.
For some of the districts the election was stormy enough; but for the Selezensk district Sviyazhsky was elected without opposition, and he gave a dinner party at his house that evening.
At the Marshal's table, beneath the portrait of the Emperor, discussions were in full swing.
But the division into young and old did not coincide with the separation into parties.
Levin stood with his own group in the Small Hall, which was used as a refreshment and smoking room, listening to what was being said and vainly straining his mental powers to understand it all.
He was now listening to Sviyazhsky and Hlyustov, the Marshal of another district, who also belonged to their party.
And after listening to the conversation he backed Sviyazhsky's opinion.
Levin would have been glad to get a taste for it but could not understand what the point was, and, stepping aside from the group, he told Oblonsky of his perplexity as to why the Marshal of the Province should be asked to stand again.
Koznyshev read the Act aloud, and began to explain its meaning, but a tall, thick-set, round-shouldered landowner with a dyed moustache, wearing a tight uniform the high collar of which squeezed up his neck at the back, interrupted him.
He was demanding the very thing Koznyshev was proposing; but he evidently hated Koznyshev and his party, and this hatred communicated itself to all those on his side, and in turn evoked a similar, though more decently expressed, feeling of conflicting anger from the opposing party.
Kindly ballot!... Abominable!' was heard shouted by spiteful furious voices from every side.
He began pacing up and down the room, watching the waiters with pleasure.
Levin entered the Hall, was given a white ball, and, following his brother, Sergius Ivanich, approached the table at which Sviyazhsky stood with an ironical and impressive look on his face, gathering his beard into his fist and smelling at it.
When he had done so he recollected that he ought to have put in his left hand also, and thrust it in, but it was too late; and feeling still more confused he hurried away to the very back of the room.
Whether those tears resulted from a consciousness of injustice done him, or from love for the Nobility, or from the strained situation in which he found himself, surrounded by enemies, at any rate his emotion communicated itself. The majority of the nobles were touched and Levin felt a tenderness for Snetkov.
In the doorway the Marshal came into collision with Levin.
The leaders of both parties were making estimates and calculating on their fingers the white and black balls they could reckon on.
Some of them ate, standing or hastily sitting down at the table, others smoked cigarettes, pacing up and down the long room, and talked to friends they had not seen for a long time.
And casting a discontented glance at Levin, he suddenly turned away.
Another group followed close on the heels of a nobleman who was shouting loudly. He was one of those who had been made drunk.
The landowner also recognized Levin and they shook hands.
Look at the uniforms! They tell the tale: this is an assembly of Justices of the Peace, permanent officials, and so on, but not of nobles!'
It can't be grown in a year,' he remarked cautiously, immediately changing the subject. 'Well, and how is your husbandry getting on?'
'Yes, but you don't reckon your own work.
It is clear he will be a scholar, so that there will be no one to continue my work, and yet I go on!
One feels a sort of duty toward the land.'
'I'll tell you something,' continued the landowner. 'My neighbour, a merchant, called on me, and we went over the farm and garden together.
'Yes, and with that money he would buy cattle, or a piece of land for a mere song, and would lease it to the peasants,' added Levin with a smile, having evidently more than once come across such calculations.
'We won't deny it.'
SVIYAZHSKY TOOK Levin's arm and led him back to his own group.
He was standing with Oblonsky and Koznyshev, and looked straight at Levin as he came up.
'Yes, I well remember our meeting,' said Levin, and blushing scarlet immediately turned and spoke to his brother.
Smiling slightly, Vronsky continued his conversation with Sviyazhsky, evidently having no desire to start a conversation with Levin; but Levin, while talking to his brother, kept looking round at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him, in order to mitigate his rudeness.
Sviyazhsky introduced him to Levin.
It's a struggle!' he said frowning, and closed his powerful jaw.
There was a pause, during which Vronsky, since he had to look at something, looked at Levin: at his feet, his uniform; and then his face, and noticing the sombre eyes fixed upon him he remarked, just to say something:
'Put it on the right,' whispered Oblonsky to Levin as the latter, with his brother, followed the Marshal to the table.
While approaching the box he had the ball in his right hand, but, thinking it was a mistake, he shifted it to his left hand just as he reached the box, and evidently placed it to the left.
The old waiter offered him something to eat and Levin accepted.
As he was passing through the corridor behind the gallery he came across a dispirited High School pupil with bloodshot eyes pacing up and down.
'Oh, Lord!' said the Marshal of the Province with a deep sigh; and with his weary legs in the white trousers dragging, and hanging his head, he went down the middle of the hall to the chief table.
This influence was promoted by his wealth, by his title, by the splendid house in the town which had been lent him by his old acquaintance Shirkov, a financier who had founded a flourishing bank in Kashin; by the excellent chef whom he had brought from his estate; by his friendship with the Governor, who had been a former comrade and one whom Vronsky had even protected; but above all by his simple behaviour in treating every one alike which had quickly induced most of the noblemen to change their opinion as to his supposed pride.
He saw clearly, and others acknowledged, that he had contributed very much to Nevedovsky's success.
Sviyazhsky comically mimicked the old Marshal's tearful speech and, turning to Nevedovsky, remarked that His Excellency would have to adopt a different and more complex method of auditing the funds than tears!
Later on, meditating in solitude on that look – which expressed his right to freedom – she, as usual, came only to a consciousness of her own humiliation. 'He has the right to go when and where he pleases.
Of course it is indefinable, intangible, but it was not so formerly, and that look means much,' she thought. 'That look shows that he is beginning to grow cold.'
Walks, talks with the Princess Barbara, visits to the hospital, and above all reading, reading one book after another, filled her time.
Toward the evening of that day, being alone, Anna felt such terror on Vronsky's account that she decided to go to town, but after careful consideration she wrote that contradictory letter which Vronsky received, and without reading it over she sent it by express messenger.
She heard his voice, and forgetting everything else ran joyfully to meet him.
He was sitting on a chair, and the footman was pulling off his warm boots.
She took his hand in both hers and drew it to her waist, not taking her eyes off him.
And the stern and stony look, which she so dreaded, settled on his face.
But not a cold look only but the angry look of a hunted and exasperated man flashed in his eyes as he spoke those tender words.
Anna wrote to her husband asking him for a divorce and at the end of November, having parted from the Princess Barbara, who had to go to Petersburg, she moved to Moscow with Vronsky.
Daily expecting Karenin's reply, to be followed by a divorce, they now established themselves like a married couple.
Sometimes this occasioned her pain, but at the same time she wanted to laugh because of this strange new joy.
All whom she loved were with her, and all were so kind to her and so attentive, and everything was presented to her in so pleasant an aspect, that had she not known it must soon come to an end she could not have desired a better or pleasanter life.
But she understood him not from without but from within and saw that in town he was not himself; she could not otherwise define his condition.
Whether it was that the conditions of town-life were different, or that they had both grown more careful and reasonable in this respect – at any rate in Moscow they never had quarrels resulting from jealousy such as they had feared when they moved to town.
But she at once turned to the Princess Mary Borisovna and did not once look round at Vronsky till he rose to go. Then she looked at him, but evidently only because it is impolite not to look at a man when he is bowing to you.
When he had heard all, down to the fact that just for the first second she could not help blushing, but that afterwards she had felt as natural and easy as with anyone she might happen to meet, he became quite happy and said he was very glad it had happened and in future he would not behave as stupidly as he had done at the election, but would try to be as friendly as possible with Vronsky next time he met him.
'But put on a morning coat, so that you can call on the Countess Bol on the way.'
'No, wait a moment.' She held him by the hand.
'Let's talk it over, it bothers me. I don't think I spend on anything superfluous, and yet the money simply flies away!
'Not at all,' he said, coughing and looking at her from under his brows.
It is quite impossible.
'I'm ready to agree with Arseny beforehand.
At the porch Kuzma, an old servant of his bachelor days, who was now managing the household in town, stopped Levin.
He parted with that hundred-rouble note not without a struggle. The next such note he changed to buy provisions for a family dinner, costing twenty-eight roubles; and though he remembered that twenty-eight roubles was the price of nine chetverts of oats mown, bound into sheaves, threshed, winnowed, sifted, and shovelled with sweat and groans, nevertheless it went more easily than the first.
The notes he now changed no longer evoked such calculations, but flew away like wee birds.
Katavasov in a few words told him the latest news, and, taking him into the study, introduced Levin to a tall, sturdy, and very agreeable-looking man.
Metrov quoted words an the subject attributed to the Emperor and one of the Ministers, which he had from a reliable source.
Levin tried to imagine a situation in which both utterances might have been made, and the subject was dropped.
Though he had to admit that in the Eastern and greater part of Russia rents were still nil, that wages – for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian population – represented only sustenance for themselves, and that capital did not yet exist except in the form of most primitive tools yet he regarded every labourer merely from that one point of view, though on many points he disagreed with the economists and had his own theory of wages, which he explained to Levin.
Levin listened reluctantly and at first made objections.
But afterwards, having convinced himself that they looked at the question so differently that they would never understand one another, he ceased making objections and merely listened.
Levin attributed this to his own worth, not knowing that Metrov, who had exhausted the matter with all his intimates, was particularly pleased to speak about it to any fresh person, and, in general, willingly spoke to everybody about the subject with which he was occupied and which was not yet clear to himself.
'Yes, there is a meeting of the Society of Amateurs in honour of Svintich's jubilee,' Katavasov went on, in answer to Levin's inquiry. 'Peter Ivanovich' (Metrov) 'and I have arranged to go.
Levin took one of the vacant chairs which were standing round the table, and in a whisper asked a student who was sitting there what was being read.
With a displeased look at Levin the student replied:
Though the biography of the scientist did not interest Levin, he listened involuntarily and learned a few interesting facts about the celebrated man's life.
When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read aloud some verses for the jubilee sent by the poet Ment, adding a few words of thanks to the poet.
Then Katavasov, in his loud strident voice, read his paper on the scientific work of the man whose jubilee it was.
After that they began talking about the university question.
Levin found Lvov at home, and entered unannounced.
His handsome, refined, and still young-looking face, to which the curly, glossy, silver hair gave a still more well-bred appearance, lit up with a smile when he saw Levin.
'There now! I envy you for having the entrance to that interesting scientific world,' he said, and having started talking he changed, as he usually did, into French, which he spoke more easily.
'Ah! Come here, you perfect children!' said Lvov to two little boys, who, after bowing to Levin, approached their father, evidently wishing to ask him something.
Levin wanted to talk to them and hear what they would say to their father, but Nataly spoke to him, and then Makhotin, a fellow official of Lvov's, came in Court uniform to fetch Lvov to meet some one; and an unending conversation began about Herzegovina, the Princess Korzinskaya, the Duma, and the Countess Apraxina's sudden death.
Levin had forgotten the commission he had been charged with and only remembered it when on his way to the ante-room.
AT THE MATINÉE CONCERT there were two very interesting items.
He carefully avoided the musical experts and great talkers, and stood with lowered eyes gazing straight before him, listening.
The musical expression of some emotion seemed perpetually on the point of beginning, when it suddenly broke into fragments of the expression of other emotions or even into unrelated sounds which, elaborate though they were, were only connected by the whim of the composer.
Every one rose, began to walk about, and to talk.
Levin maintained that the mistake of Wagner and of all his followers lay in trying to make music enter the domain of another art, and that poetry commits the same error when it depicts the features of a face, which should be done by painting, and, as an example of this kind of error, he mentioned a sculptor who tried to chisel the shadows of poetic images arising round the pedestal of his statue of a poet. 'The sculptor's shadows so little resembled shadows that they even clung to a ladder,' said Levin.
Levin could not listen to the second part of the concert, for Pestsov, who stood beside him, talked all the while and found fault with the piece because of its unnecessary and sickly affectation of simplicity, comparing it with the simplicities of the pre-Raphaelite school of painting.
On going out Levin met several other acquaintances with whom he talked about politics, music, and mutual friends; among others he met Count Bol. He had quite forgotten his intended visit to him.
'They do; please walk in,' said the hall-porter, determinedly helping him off with his overcoat.
The Countess Bol pretended to be listening.
At length, having mentioned the folle journée [Mad fête.] that was being got up at Tyurin's, he laughed, rose noisily, and went away.
Levin again expressed, and heard, various opinions about the meeting, the new fantasia, and a trial.
LEVIN ARRIVED AT THE CLUB IN GOOD TIME.
Members and visitors were driving up as he got there.
All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties behind them in the hall with their hats, and to be preparing to enjoy the material blessings of life at their leisure.
'Why are you so late?' asked the old Prince with a smile, holding out his hand over his shoulder. 'How is Kitty?' he added, smoothing the table-napkin, which he had tucked in behind a button of his waistcoat.
He sat beside a young military man, and two chairs were tilted against their table.
Levin joined them with pleasure.
They drank a glass of vodka each and returned to their table.
Levin did not refuse the proffered wine, and ordered another bottle.
Oblonsky took a glass, and exchanging a look with a bald, red-haired man with a moustache who sat at the other end of their table, smilingly nodded to him.
'Ah, here they are!' said Oblonsky, just as they were finishing, leaning back in his chair and stretching out his hand to Vronsky, who was approaching with a tall Colonel of the Guards.
Gaily leaning his arm on Oblonsky's shoulder, he whispered something to him, and with the same merry smile held out a hand to Levin.
Whether influenced by the club or by the wine he had drunk, Levin chatted with Vronsky about the best breeds of cattle, and was very pleased to find that he had not the least animosity toward the man.
You know Prince Chechensky?' asked the Prince, and Levin saw by his face that he was going to say something droll.
Well, never mind!
Three years ago he was not yet among the shlyupiks and he showed a bold front, calling others shlyupiks.
Oh yes, that fat one; he is a great wit. Well, Prince Chechensky asks him: "I say, Vasily, who is here?
They also went into the room which the Prince termed 'the wise room.'
Levin sat down for a while and listened, but remembering all the conversations he had that day heard, he suddenly felt terribly bored.
Turovtsin, with a tankard of something to drink, was sitting on the high sofa in the billiard-room, and Oblonsky was talking to Vronsky by the door in the far corner.
Only for the first few moments, while they were leaving the courtyard of the club, did Levin retain that sense of club calm, pleasure, and undoubted decorum in his surroundings; but as soon as the carriage had passed out into the street and he felt it jolting on the uneven road, heard the angry shouts of an izvoshchik they met, saw in the ill-lit street the red signboards of a vodka dealer and of a small shop, that sense was dissipated, and he began to consider his actions and to ask himself whether he was doing right in going to see Anna.
Though she is my sister,' Oblonsky continued, 'I may safely say that she is a remarkable woman.
He agrees; but there are difficulties about their son, and the affair, which should have been ended long ago, has already been dragging on for three months.
How stupid that old ceremony is, walking round and round singing, "Rejoice, Isaiah!" – a ceremony in which nobody believes and which stands in the way of people's happiness!' interpolated Oblonsky. 'Well, and then their position will be as definite as mine or yours.'
'Faugh! How hot!' he said, throwing his already unfastened overcoat still wider open in spite of 12 degrees of frost.
He took completely to drink, got delirium tremens, and has deserted his family.
She saw them, helped them, and became interested in them, and now the whole family is on her hands – and she doesn't do it patronizingly, just with money, but she herself coaches the boys in Russian for the High School, and she has taken the girl into the house.
Glancing in the mirror, Levin saw that he was red in the face, but he was sure he was not tipsy, and he followed Oblonsky up the carpeted stairs.
She spoke easily and without haste, occasionally turning her eyes from Levin to her brother.
'We came into Alexis's room to have a smoke,' she said in reply to Oblonsky's question whether he might smoke; and glancing at Levin, instead of asking him whether he smoked, she drew a tortoise-shell cigar-case nearer and took from it a straw cigarette.
'Yes; that's it exactly,' said Vorkuyev.
After being so lovely in its tranquillity, her face suddenly expressed a strange curiosity, anger, and pride.
But this lasted only a moment. She screwed up her eyes, as if she were remembering something.
Again she glanced at Levin.
After a pause she smiled and said, 'Yes, yes, I never could do it. Je n'ai pas le coeur assez large [My heart is not big enough] to love a whole orphanage-full of unpleasant little girls.
And Levin perceived yet another feature in this woman whom he already liked so much.
She asked Levin and Vorkuyev to pass on into the drawing-room, and herself remained behind to speak to her brother. 'About the divorce?
About me?' Levin wondered; and he was so excited about what she might be saying to Oblonsky that he hardly listened to what Vorkuyev was telling him about the merits of Anna's story for children.
There was not a single moment when it was necessary to seek for a subject of conversation; on the contrary one felt that there was not time enough to say what one wanted to say, but willingly refrained in order to hear what she was saying.
And he, who had formerly judged her so severely, now by some strange process of reasoning justified her and at the same time pitied her and feared that Vronsky did not fully understand her.
She let go his hand and screwed up her eyes.
All of them had been good, and only two things were not quite pleasant. One was what he had said about the pike, and the other was that there was something not quite right about his tender pity for Anna.
But, not to hinder his relating everything, she masked her observation and listened with an appreciative smile while he told her how he had spent the evening.
'Oh no!' she said, but he saw by her eyes the effort she made to control herself, and it boded him no good.
When he drew near she looked at him and burst into sobs.
WHEN HER VISITORS HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE Anna did not sit down, but began pacing up and down the room.
Though she had involuntarily done all in her power to awaken love in Levin (as at that time she always did to all the young men she met), and though she knew she had succeeded in as far as was possible with an honourable married man in one evening, and though she had liked him very much (despite the marked difference between Vronsky and Levin from a man's point of view, she, as a woman, saw in them that common trait which had caused Kitty to fall in love with them both), yet as soon as he had left the room she ceased to think about him.
She heard Vronsky's vehement ring at the front door and quickly dried her eyes. She even sat down near the lamp and opened a book, pretending to be tranquil.
But he went back and now has lost more than he had won.'
A similar cold expression of readiness for strife appeared on his face.
Why? Why?...' he asked after a short pause, bending toward her and opening his hand, hoping that she would place hers in it.
'Nothing,' said she, coming candle in hand from beyond the partition. 'I only felt a little unwell,' she added with a peculiarly sweet and significant smile.
'No, no,' she said smiling, holding him back with her hand.
She came back to her bed, put out the candle, lay down, and remained quiet.
He jumped up hastily, hardly aware of himself and without taking his eyes off her, put on his dressing-gown and stood still, gazing at her.
How vile and despicable he appeared to himself before her as she now was, when he recollected the grief he had caused her yesterday!
She looked at him smilingly, but suddenly her eyebrows twitched, she raised her head, and coming quickly to him she took hold of his hand and clinging close she enveloped him in her hot breath.
She moved away from him and rang.
And he, an unbeliever, repeated those words not with his lips only.
Without stopping the izvoshchik he ran back beside her.
The dispenser asked in German whether he might sell it and receiving permission from some one behind a screen took out a bottle and a funnel, slowly poured it from a large bottle into a small one, stuck on a label, and in spite of Levin's request that he should not do so sealed up the bottle, and was about to wrap it up.
Levin deliberately took out a ten-rouble note, and speaking slowly but without losing time, handed him the note and explained that Dr Peter Dmitrich (how great and important this Peter Dmitrich, formerly so insignificant, now appeared to Levin!) had promised to come at any time, and that he would certainly not be angry and must therefore be called at once.
'Then you will come at once?' said Levin, looking angrily at the servant who brought in the coffee.
'No, I can't stand it!' said Levin, jumping up. 'So you will come in a quarter of an hour?'
Levin got home just as the Princess arrived, and they met at the bedroom door.
'It's going all right,' she said.
Had he been told it was ten in the morning he would not have been more astonished.
He saw Dolly, he saw the doctor smoking thick cigarettes, and Mary Vlasevna with a firm, resolute, and tranquillizing look on her face, and the old Prince pacing up and down the ballroom and frowning.
During the whole of that time he was alternately in two different moods.
And every time when the screams that came from the bedroom roused him from momentary forgetfulness he succumbed to the same strange error that had possessed him in the first moments: every time, on hearing the scream, he jumped up and ran to justify himself, but recollected on the way that he was not to blame and that he longed to protect and help her.
Levin sat listening to the doctor's stories of a quack magnetizer and staring at the ash of the doctor's cigarette.
'But who was it screaming?' He jumped up and rushed into the bedroom on tiptoe, past Mary Vlasevna and the Princess, and stopped at his place at the head of the bed.
I am not afraid, I am not afraid!' she said rapidly. 'Mama!
She spoke very rapidly and tried to smile, but all at once her face became distorted and she pushed him away.
'It's all right, it's all right! All goes well!'
It was still more frowning and stern.
With her arms helplessly outstretched upon the quilt, unusually beautiful and calm she lay, gazing silently at him, trying unsuccessfully to smile.
That feminine world which since his marriage had received a new and unsuspected significance for him now rose so high in his estimation that his imagination could not grasp it.
'Send and let me know whether I may see her,' said the old Prince.
He could not answer and, conscious of his weakness, turned away.
'Let me have him,' said she, hearing the baby's cry. 'Let me have him, Mary Vlasevna, and he will see him too!'
Levin, gazing at this tiny piteous being, vainly searched his soul for some indications of paternal feeling.
Kitty turned her eyes and gazed fixedly in the same direction. 'Let me have him, let me have him!' she said, and was even going to raise herself.
And Mary Vlasevna held out to Levin on one hand (the other merely supporting the nape of the shaky head) this strange, limp, red creature, that hid its head in its swaddling clothes.
This beautiful baby only inspired him with a sense of repulsion and pity.
'Well, that's enough! That's enough!' said Mary Vlasevna; but Kitty would not part with the baby.
He fell asleep in her arms.
'Now look at him,' said Kitty, turning him so that Levin could see him.
The old-looking little face wrinkled up still more and the baby sneezed.
But the latter would not advance any more of the money, especially as Dolly, who had that winter for the first time plainly claimed a right to her own property, had refused to endorse the contract with a receipt for the last third of the payment. Oblonsky's whole salary went for household expenses and the liquidation of small pressing bills.
'Evidently I have been asleep and have been forgotten!' thought Oblonsky. And he began pricking up his ears and looking around, and by the end of the winter he had discovered a very good post and begun an attack on it, first from Moscow through aunts, uncles, and friends; and then in spring, when the matter had ripened, he himself went to Petersburg.
The post carried a salary of from seven to ten thousand roubles a year, and Oblonsky could hold it without resigning his official position.
It depended on two Ministers, one lady, and two Jews; and though they had already been prepared it was necessary for Oblonsky to see all these people in Petersburg.
So, having got fifty roubles from Dolly, he went to Petersburg.
Sitting in Karenin's study and listening to his article on 'The Causes of the Bad State of Russian Finance,' Oblonsky only waited for him to conclude to speak about his own affairs and about Anna.
'Yes, but I bring forward another principle which embraces the principle of freedom,' said Karenin, accentuating the word 'embraces,' and putting his pince-nez on again to re-read the part where this was said.
Turning over the beautifully written, very broad-margined manuscript, Karenin re-read the convincing passage:
'I do not want protection for the benefit of private individuals, but for the common good – for the lowest and for the highest classes equally,' he said, looking at Oblonsky over his pince-nez. 'But they cannot understand this, they are concerned only with their private interests and are carried away by phrases.'
Oblonsky was firmly convinced that the business he wished to serve was new, alive, and honest; but that morning when Bolgarinov, with obvious intention, made him wait two hours in his waiting-room with other petitioners, he had suddenly felt uncomfortable.
During those two hours in Bolgarinov's waiting-room he had walked about boldly, smoothing his whiskers, entering into conversation with other applicants, inventing a joke to tell, of how he had waited at the Jew's, carefully concealing his feelings from others and even from himself.
'For heaven's sake don't excite yourself,' said Oblonsky, touching his brother-in-law's knee. 'The matter is not closed.
She appreciated it to such a degree that, at the moment, feeling herself to blame toward you, she did not consider and could not consider everything.
She knows that and does not ask you for anything. She says plainly that she dare not ask anything.
Besides, I hoped that Anna Arkadyevna would have generosity enough...' uttered Karenin with difficulty, his lips trembling and his face turning pale.
But as you had promised, she wrote to you and moved to Moscow.
Well then, forgive me! forgive me if I have pained you,' said Oblonsky with an embarrassed smile, holding out his hand. 'I only delivered my message as an envoy.'
Karenin gave him his hand, reflected, and then said:
But now Oblonsky saw that it was useless even to think of that; he was, however, glad to see his nephew.
He bowed to his uncle as to a stranger, but recognizing him he blushed and turned away from him quickly as if offended and angry about something.
'I do, mon oncle,' he answered, looking at his uncle and then again lowering his eyes.
The doors are opened beforehand...
'No, I don't!' hurriedly replied Serezha, and blushing scarlet he hung down his head.
If I do remember, or if I don't... what business is it of his?
Leave me alone!' he said, now addressing not his tutor but the world in general.
Oblonsky did not tell him that it was a 'live' business. Bartnyansky would not have understood that.
Zhivakhov, whose debts amounted to three hundred thousand roubles, didn't possess a penny and yet he lived, and how he lived!
Petrovsky had run through five millions, continued living in just the same style, and even directed the Finance Department and received a salary of twenty thousand.
I returned to Russia and had to be with my wife, and in the country besides, and in a fortnight I took to a dressing-gown and gave up dressing for dinner!
The day after his interview with Karenin, Oblonsky, calling on her, felt so youthful that he went accidentally to such lengths in this bantering courtship and humbug that he did not know how to get out of it, for unfortunately she was not merely unattractive but actually repulsive to him.
But the Princess Myagkaya immediately interrupted him, as was her habit, and commenced telling her own tale.
[The famous Jules Landau, the clairvoyant.] He also is half-witted, but your sister's fate depends on him.
AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER and a large quantity of brandy at Bartnyansky's, Oblonsky, only a little after the appointed time, entered the Countess Lydia Ivanovna's house.
And she introduced them.
Landau hurriedly looked round, approached smilingly, laid upon Oblonsky's outstretched hand his own moist and motionless one, went back, and continued looking at the portraits.
'I am very pleased to see you, especially to-day,' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, pointing to a seat beside Karenin.
He heard a voice yesterday,' said the Countess, with a look at Oblonsky.
'Ah, a voice!' Oblonsky remarked, feeling that he must be as careful as possible in this company, where something peculiar occurred, or was supposed to occur, to which he as yet lacked a clue.
After a momentary pause the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, as if coming to the important point, turned with a subtle smile to Oblonsky.
You understand what I am speaking about?' she said, lifting her beautiful dreamy eyes.
'Take no notice of him,' said Lydia Ivanovna, and with an agile movement she pushed forward a chair for Karenin. 'I have noticed...' she began, when a footman entered with a note.
Lydia Ivanovna rapidly read the note and, excusing herself, with extreme rapidity wrote and despatched the answer and returned to the table. 'I have noticed,' she continued her interrupted sentence, 'that Muscovites, men especially, are most indifferent to religion.'
I did not wish to disturb you,' said Lydia, looking tenderly at him. 'Sit down beside us.'
'Only one must not shut one's eyes, so as to deprive oneself of light,' Karenin continued.
Excuse me!' she added, glancing at the footman who entered with another note.
She read it, and answered by word of mouth: 'Tell him, "To-morrow at the Grand Duchess's"... For those who believe, there is no sin,' she went on.
'There it is, from the Epistle of St James,' said Karenin, addressing Lydia Ivanovna in a somewhat reproachful tone. Evidently this was a point they had discussed more than once.
It is much simpler and easier,' she added, looking at Oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which at Court she encouraged young Maids of Honour who were confused by their new surroundings.
We are saved by faith,' Karenin chimed in, showing his approval of her remark by a look.
'I want to read Safe and Happy, or, Under the Wing,' she said with a questioning look at Karenin. And having found the book and sat down again, she opened it.
But still, it won't do to ask her help now.
But whereas Oblonsky's sleep would, he imagined, have offended them – he did not really even think this, for everything seemed so strange – Landau's sleep delighted them extremely, especially Lydia Ivanovna.
Hush!' she said to the footman, who came in again. 'I am not receiving.'
He went up to the Frenchman and placed his hand in his. Oblonsky also rose and, opening his eyes wide to wake himself up in case he was asleep, looked first at one and then at the other.
And having received an answer in the affirmative, Oblonsky – forgetting the request he had wanted to make to Lydia Ivanovna, forgetting his sister's affairs, and with the one desire to get away from there as quickly as possible – went out on tiptoe, and ran out into the street as from an infected house. After which he talked and joked for a long time with an izvoshchik, trying to regain his senses as soon as possible.
When he returned to Peter Oblonsky's house, where he was staying, he found a note from Betsy.
He was so drunk that he could not get up the stairs, but on seeing Oblonsky he ordered the men to put him on his feet and, clinging to Stephen, he went with him to his room, began relating how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep there.
It was an inner irritation, caused on her side by a diminution of his love for her, and on his by regret that for her sake he had placed himself in a distressing situation, which she, instead of trying to alleviate, made still harder.
Neither of them spoke of the cause of their irritation, but each thought the other in the wrong, and at every opportunity tried to prove that this was so.
She blamed him for everything that was hard in her situation.
There isn't anything to keep you, is there?'
Vronsky named the guests. 'The dinner was capital, the boat-races and everything quite nice, but in Moscow they can't get on without doing something ridiculous...
She flushed and moved away from him.
'Dear me! This is becoming unbearable!' exclaimed Vronsky, rising from his chair.
'Stop! St-o-op!' said Vronsky, his brow still knit, but holding her back by the hand.
'No! There are limits to one's endurance,' he exclaimed, and quickly let go her hand.
Pretending to be putting away her rings, she did not even turn round.
He came up to her, and taking her hand said softly:
Abandon me!' she murmured between her sobs. 'I will go away to-morrow.
His face now wore a tender expression, and she thought she detected in his voice the sound of tears, and their moisture on her hand.
And instantly her despairing jealousy changed into desperate, passionate tenderness. She embraced him, and covered his head, his neck, and his hands with kisses.
Vronsky called back the valet and told him to bring the telegram.
Anna took the telegram with trembling hands and saw exactly what Vronsky had said, but at the end were added the words: 'Little hope, but I'll do everything possible and impossible.'
'I said yesterday that it is all the same to me when I get the divorce, or even whether I get it at all,' she said, flushing. 'There was no need at all to conceal it from me.'
She explained his desire to have children as showing that he did not value her beauty.
Most of all for your sake,' he repeated, his face contorted as with pain, 'because I am convinced that a great deal of your irritability is due to our indefinite position.'
'You may be perfectly at rest on that matter!' she rejoined, and turning away she began to drink her coffee.
After a few sips she glanced at him, and from the expression of his face clearly realized that her hand, her movement, and the sound made by her lips were repulsive to him.
'It is perfectly indifferent to me what your mother thinks and whom she wishes to marry you to,' she went on, putting down her cup with a trembling hand.
It's all words, words, words!' she said, looking at him with hatred.
And you?' asked Yashvin, looking at Vronsky with half-closed eyes and evidently divining that there had been a quarrel.
'Is it possible you are not sorry for that unfortunate Pevtsov?' she said, continuing her conversation with Yashvin.
You see, my whole fortune is here,' and he pointed to a side pocket, 'and now I am a rich man; but I shall go to the club to-night and shall perhaps leave it a beggar.
Meeting his look, her face suddenly assumed a coldly severe expression, as if to say: 'It is not forgotten.
But, you see, some men find it possible to sit down to cards and yet to be able always to leave when the time comes for an assignation! Now I can engage in love-making, but always so as not to be late for cards in the evening.
[So much the worse for her.] But, as he was going out, he thought she said something, and suddenly his heart ached with pity for her.
And recalling all the cruel words he had uttered, Anna invented other words which he evidently had wished to say and could have said to her, and she grew more and more exasperated.
Go back!
She lay in bed with open eyes, looking at the stucco cornice under the ceiling by the light of a single burnt-down candle, and at the shadow of the screen which fell on it, and she vividly imagined what he would feel when she was no more, when she was for him nothing but a memory. 'How could I say those cruel words to her?' he would say.
Suddenly the shadow of the screen began to move and spread over the whole of the cornice, the whole ceiling. Other shadows rushed toward it from another side; for an instant they rushed together, but then again they spread with renewed swiftness, flickered, and all was darkness.
She came up, and holding the light above him looked at him long.
In the morning a terrible nightmare, which had come to her several times even before her union with Vronsky, repeated itself and woke her. An old man with a tangled beard was leaning over some iron and doing something, while muttering senseless words in French; and as always in that nightmare (this was what made it terrible) she felt this peasant was paying no attention to her but was doing something dreadful to her with the iron.
When she got up, the previous day appeared in her memory as in a fog.
And hearing that he was in the study she went to him.
As she passed through the drawing-room she heard a vehicle stop at the front door, and, looking out of the window, she saw a young girl in a lilac hat leaning out of the carriage window and giving an order to the footman who was ringing at the front door.
He was going quickly downstairs.
There he was on the steps, without a hat, going down to the carriage.
The carriage rolled away; he ran rapidly upstairs again.
She stood silent in the middle of the room, looking at him intently.
He glanced at her, frowned for an instant, and continued to read a letter.
Alarmed by the despairing look with which she had said these words, he jumped up, intending to run after her, but, recollecting himself, he sat down again, tightly clenching his teeth and frowning.
This – as it seemed to him – unbecoming and indefinite threat irritated him. 'I have tried everything,' he thought, 'the only thing left is to pay no attention,' and he began getting ready to drive to town, and to go again to his mother's to obtain her signature to a power of attorney.
But now he re-entered the hall, and some one ran upstairs.
IS IT FINISHED?' said Anna to herself as she stood by the window; and in answer to that question, the impressions left by the darkness when her candle went out and by the terrible dream, merging into one, filled her heart with icy horror.
The little girl, sitting at the table, persistently and firmly hammered on it with the stopper of a bottle, gazing blankly at her mother with her two black-currants of eyes.
'A quarter of an hour there, a quarter of an hour back; he is already on the way, he will be here in a minute.' She looked at her watch.
Just as she was going to compare her watch with the large clock some one drove up.
Such things will happen.
Sitting in the corner of the comfortable calèche, which rocked gently on its elastic springs to the rapid trot of the pair of greys, Anna – amid the incessant rattle of wheels and the rapidly changing impressions in the open air – again going over the events of the last days saw her position quite differently from what it had seemed at home.
'No! I shall go to Dolly's, and will tell her frankly: "I am unhappy, I deserve it; I am guilty, but all the same I am unhappy.
'We also had a telegram from him,' replied Anna, looking round for Kitty.
But it is not for her, who was in love with Vronsky – it is not for her to let me feel it, even if it is true!
I, on the contrary, am hopeful,' said Dolly, looking at Anna with curiosity.
She had never seen her in such a strange and irritable mood. 'When are you leaving?' she asked.
Anna, screwing up her eyes, gazed straight before her without answering.
She will come directly,' Dolly said awkwardly, not knowing how to tell an untruth. 'Oh, here she is!'
Having mustered up her courage, Kitty came in and, blushing, went up to Anna and held out her hand.
Yes, you are changed!' said Anna.
He called on me and I liked him very much,' she added, with obvious ill intent. 'Where is he?'
'Yes, but to-day there is something peculiar about her,' said Dolly. 'When I was seeing her out, there in the ante-room, I thought she was going to cry.'
Seeing his hat on the hat-rail, she shuddered with aversion.
The servants, the walls, the things in the house, all repelled and angered her, and oppressed her like a weight.
'Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if I don't find him, I must go there and expose him.' She looked at the time-table published in the daily paper.
Peter jumped up on the box, and with his arm akimbo told the coachman to drive to the station.
Glancing in the direction in which Peter was looking she saw a workman, nearly dead-drunk, with his head swaying about, who was being led off somewhere by a policeman. 'That one is more likely to,' she thought.
Before we were united we really drew together; but now we are irresistibly drifting apart; and it cannot be altered.
If, without loving me, he is kind and tender to me from a sense of duty, but what I desire is lacking – that would be a thousand times worse than anger! It would be hell!
Remembering Karenin, she pictured him to herself with extraordinary vividness, as if he stood before her, with his mild, dull, lifeless eyes, the blue veins of his white hands, his intonations, his cracking fingers, and remembering the feeling that had once existed between them and which had also been called love, she shuddered with revulsion. 'Well, I get divorced and become Vronsky's wife!
Yet I lived without him and exchanged his love for another's, and did not complain of the change as long as the other love satisfied me.' And she thought with disgust of what she called 'the other love.'
Peter, in his livery and gaiters, with his dull animal face, also crossed the room, and came to her to see her into the train.
She mounted the high step of the railway carriage and seated herself in an empty compartment on the dirty – though once white – cover of the spring seat.
A misshapen lady with a bustle (Anna mentally stripped that woman and was horrified at her deformity) and a girl, laughing affectedly, ran past outside.
In order not to see anyone, she rose quickly and sat down by the opposite window of the empty compartment.
A grimy, misshaped peasant in a cap from under which his tousled hair stuck out, passed that window, stooping over the carriage wheels. 'There is something familiar about that misshaped peasant,' she thought.
And remembering her dream she went to the opposite door, trembling with fright.
She went back to her corner and sat down.
At last the third bell rang, the engine whistled and creaked, the coupling chains gave a jerk, and the husband crossed himself. 'It would be interesting to ask him what he means by it,' thought Anna, regarding him spitefully.
And glancing at the red-cheeked husband and his thin wife, she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood, and that the husband deceived her and encouraged her in her opinion of herself.
Directing her searchlight upon them, Anna thought she saw their story and all the hidden recesses of their souls.
But there was nothing of interest there, and she continued her reflections.
When the train stopped at the station, Anna got out with the crowd of passengers, and shunning them as if they were lepers, stopped on the platform trying to remember why she had come there and what she had intended to do.
Porters rushed up, offering their services. Young men passed along the platform, clattering their heels on the planks, talking loudly and gazing at her; and people she met tried to get out of her way on the wrong side.
Recollecting that she meant to go on if there was no reply, she stopped a porter and asked him whether there was not a coachman bringing a note from Count Vronsky there.
What is the coachman like?'
She opened it, and her heart sank even before she read it.
She spoke softly, because the rapid beating of her heart impeded her breathing. 'No, I will not let you torture me,' she thought, addressing her threat not to him nor to herself but to that which forced her to suffer, and she walked along the platform, past the station buildings.
Two maid-servants, strolling about on the platform, turned their heads to look at her, and made some audible remarks about her dress. 'It's real,' they said of the lace she was wearing.
Some ladies and children, who had come to meet a spectacled gentleman and were laughing and talking noisily, became silent and gazed at her as she passed them.
Quickly and lightly descending the steps that led from the water-tank to the rails, she stopped close to the passing tram.
But she did not take her eyes off the wheels of the approaching second truck, and at the very moment when the midway point between the wheels drew level, she threw away her red bag, and drawing her head down between her shoulders threw herself forward on her hands under the truck, and with a light movement as if preparing to rise again immediately dropped on her knees.
A little peasant muttering something was working at the rails.
It was already the middle of the hot summer, but Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev was only now preparing to leave Moscow.
Not asking anyone about it, reluctantly and with feigned indifference replying to his friends' inquiries as to how it was going, and not even asking the booksellers how it was selling, Koznyshev watched keenly and with strained attention for the first impression his book would produce in Society and in literature.
Koznyshev had calculated exactly the time necessary for a review to be written; but a month passed, and another, and the silence continued.
Notwithstanding the thorough conscientiousness with which Koznyshev verified the correctness of the critic's arguments, he did not dwell for a moment on the deficiencies and mistakes which were ridiculed, but at once involuntarily began to recall his meeting and conversation with the author of the review, down to the minutest details.
After working all through the spring and part of the summer, it was not till July that he prepared to go to his brother's in the country.
The Volunteers were met by ladies who brought them nosegays and who, with the crowd that rushed after them, accompanied them into the station.
One of the ladies who had met the Volunteers spoke to Koznyshev at the exit from the waiting-room.
'More than eight hundred: counting those who did not go from Moscow direct, more than a thousand,' said Koznyshev.
I said so!' the lady said joyfully. 'And isn't it true that about a million roubles have been collected?'
Now, you should say something, so that... just a few words, you know, of encouragement; you do it so well,' he added with an affectionate, respectful and solicitous smile, gently pushing Koznyshev forward by the arm.
You know, les petites misères de la vie humaine,' [The little miseries of human life.] he said to the Princess, as if to excuse himself. 'And the Princess Myagkaya, not Lisa but Bibish, is really sending a thousand rifles and twelve nurses!
The Princess without replying glanced at Koznyshev.
Noticing a lady with a collecting-box he beckoned to her and put in a five-rouble note.
Not only is he going himself, but he is taking a whole squadron at his own expense.'
Oblonsky walked beside him, talking with animation.
Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as if not hearing what Oblonsky was saying
His face, which was aged and full of suffering, seemed petrified.
HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF THE PRINCESS, Koznyshev with Katavasov, who had joined him, entered the very crowded carriage, and the train started.
He listened smilingly to the young man and tried to stop him.
Getting into conversation with the young man, Katavasov learnt that he had been a rich Moscow merchant but had run through a large fortune before he was twenty-two.
'Well, everybody is going.
WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED at the Provincial capital, Koznyshev, instead of going to the refreshment-room, walked up and down the platform.
You know he had once before shot himself on her account?' she said, and the old woman's brows knit at the recollection. 'Yes, she ended as such a woman deserved to end.
'It is not for us to judge, Countess,' Koznyshev remarked with a sigh, 'but I understand how distressing it was for you.'
He wrote an answer and sent it off.
He had thrown up everything – his career, me; and then she did not even pity him, but deliberately dealt him a deathblow.
It was the only thing that could rouse him. His friend, Yashvin, had lost everything at cards and was going to Serbia.
Please have a talk with him. He is walking about on the other side.'
IN THE SLANTING SHADOW of a pile of sacks heaped up on the platform, Vronsky, in a long overcoat, his hat pulled down low and his hands in his pockets, was walking up and down like an animal in a cage, turning sharply every twenty paces.
Vronsky paused, looked at Koznyshev, recognized him, and advancing a few steps to meet him, pressed his hand very very hard.
God grant you outward success and inward peace,' he added, holding out his hand.
'Aren't you ashamed of yourself for not letting us know?' she said, holding out her hand to him and offering her forehead for a kiss.
'Oh, nothing in particular – the same as everybody,' Kitty answered, rather embarrassed and glancing round at Koznyshev. 'Well, I'll send for him.
'Has he been screaming long, Nurse? Long?' she asked hurriedly, sitting down and preparing to nurse the baby.
'Yes, yes! Hush!...' was all Kitty answered as she sat softly rocking herself and tenderly pressing the little plump arm, which looked as if a thread had been tied round the wrist, and was still feebly waving while Mitya kept shutting and opening his eyes.
At last the arm ceased waving and the eyes closed.
Only now and then the baby, continuing his business, lifted his long curved lashes and looked at his mother with moist eyes that seemed black in the dim light.
It must be because he thinks too much. And he thinks too much because of his solitude.
With an involuntary smile of emotion, Kitty remembered her own husband's shamefacedness after that, and his repeated awkward attempts to approach the subject he had on his mind, and how at length having discovered the only way of helping Dolly without offending her, he suggested to Kitty that she should give her sister her own part of the estate, a device that had not occurred to her.
'Yes, only be like your father, only be like him!' she whispered, giving Mitya to the nurse, and touching his cheek with her lips.
He was painfully out of harmony with himself and strained all his spiritual powers to escape from this condition.
Their thoughts seemed to him fruitful when he read, or was himself devising refutations of other teachings, the materialistic in particular; but as soon as he began reading, or himself devised, solutions to life's problems, the same thing occurred every time.
Following long definitions of vague words such as spirit, will, freedom, substance, and deliberately entering the verbal trap set for him by the philosophers, or by himself, he seemed to begin to understand something.
But he had only to forget that artificial line of thought, and to return direct from real. life to what had appeared satisfactory so long as he kept to the given line of thought – and suddenly the whole artificial edifice tumbled down like a house of cards, and it was evident that the edifice had been constructed of those same words differently arranged, and without regard for something in life more important than reason.
At one time, while reading Schopenhauer, he replaced the word will by the word love, and this new philosophy comforted him for a day or two, as long as he did not stand aside from it; but it, too, collapsed when he viewed it in relation to real life, and it turned out to be a muslin garment without warmth.
But afterwards on reading the history of the Church, first by a Roman Catholic and then by a Greek-Orthodox writer, and finding that each essentially infallible Church repudiated the other, he became disenchanted with Homyakov's teaching about the Church; and that edifice fell into dust just as the philosophical structures had done.
'In an infinity of time, and in infinity of matter, in infinite space, a bubble, a bubble organism, separates itself, and that bubble maintains itself awhile and then bursts, and that bubble is – I!'
This was a distressing falsehood, but it was the sole and last result of centuries and the age-long labour of human thought in that direction.
All this, with game-shooting, and his new hobby of beekeeping, filled up the whole of that life of his which seemed to him, when he thought about it, to have no meaning.
Whether he was acting well or ill he did not know and far from laying down the law about it, he now avoided talking or thinking about it.
And this is done every year, all over Russia.
'Why is all this being done?' he wondered. 'Why am I standing here, obliging them to work?
Why do they all make such efforts and try to show me their zeal? Why is my old friend Matrena toiling so (I doctored her after the fire, when she was struck by a girder)?' he thought, looking at a thin peasant woman who pushed the grain along with a rake, her dark sunburnt bare feet stepping with effort on the hard uneven barn floor.
'She recovered then, but to-day or tomorrow, or in ten years' time, they will bury her and nothing will be left of her, nor of that smart girl with the red skirt, who with such dexterous and delicate movements is beating the chaff from the ears. She too will be buried, and that piebald gelding too – and that one very soon,' he reflected, looking at a horse breathing quickly with falling and rising belly and inflated nostrils, as it trod on the slanting wheel that moved under it.
'They will bury her, and so they will Theodore, who is feeding the machine, his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulder.
He thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to calculate how much they could thresh in an hour.
Having worked till the peasants' dinner-hour, which soon came, he left the barn together with Theodore and began chatting, standing beside the neat yellow freshly-reaped stack of seed-rye on the threshing-floor.
'But how does Kirilov make it pay?'
That fellow will press hard, but he'll get his own!
He'll lend, and sometimes let a man off, and so run short himself.
'But why should he let anyone off?'
LEVIN WENT ALONG THE HIGH-ROAD with long strides, attending not so much to his thoughts – he could not yet disentangle them – as to a condition of his soul he had never before experienced.
He felt something new in his soul and probed this something with pleasure, not yet knowing what it was.
He was breathless with excitement and, incapable of going further, he turned from the road into the wood and sat down on the uncut grass in the shade of the aspens.
'Yes, I must clear it up and understand it,' he thought, gazing intently at the untrodden grass before him, and following the movements of a green insect that was crawling up a stalk of couch grass and was hindered in its ascent by a leaf of goutwort.
Is it not evident in the development of every philosopher's theory that he knows in advance, as indubitably as the peasant Theodore and not a whit more clearly than he, the chief meaning of life, and only wishes, by a questionable intellectual process, to return to what every one knows?
'Try to build up anything without these conceptions!
The Church?' Levin repeated to himself.
He purposely thought of those teachings of the Church which always seemed most strange to him, and that tried him.
LEVIN LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM, and saw the herd of cattle and then his trap and his horse Raven and the coachman who, having driven up to the cattle, was speaking to the herdsman; after that, close by, he heard the sound of wheels and the snorting of a well-fed horse; but he was so engrossed in his thoughts that he did not wonder why the coachman was coming for him.
Tightly holding in the good horse, who snorted impatiently and pulled at the reins, Levin kept turning to glance at Ivan, who sat beside him not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hands and continually pushing down his shirt as the wind blew it out. Levin tried to think of some pretext for beginning a conversation with him.
'I have long been meaning to!
Now we'll have some talks, and we'll see!
But he was suddenly struck by the calm and cheerful expression of Katavasov's face, and felt so sorry to lose the spiritual condition which he was evidently spoiling by his conversation, that recollecting his resolution he ceased speaking.
When by the narrow footpath they had reached the unmown glade covered on one side by a thick growth of bright John-and-Maries, with tall spreading bushes of dark green sneezewort between them, Levin asked his guests to sit down in the deep cool shade of the young aspens – upon a bench and some tree stumps specially arranged for visitors to the apiary who might be afraid of bees – while he went to the hut to fetch bread, cucumbers, and fresh honey for the grown-up people as well as for the children.
At the very entrance a bee became entangled in his beard and began buzzing, but he carefully liberated it.
He went into the shady lobby and from a peg in the wall took down his veil, put it on, and with his hands deep in his pockets entered the fenced-in apiary where – standing in regular rows and tied with bast to stakes – in the middle of a space where the grass had been mown stood the old beehives, [Hollowed-out stumps of trees placed upright.] every one familiar to him, and each with a history of its own, while along the wattle fence stood the new hives with the swarms hived that year.
On the other side of the fence an old man was making a hoop and did not notice Levin, who stopped in the middle of the apiary without calling him.
But at that instant returning into that mood, he felt with joy that something new and important had occurred within him.
'That is like him,' said Levin. 'But are Volunteers really still going?' he added with a glance at Koznyshev.
Koznyshev did not reply, but with the blunt side of a knife carefully extracted from a bowl in which lay a wedge of white honeycomb a live bee that had stuck in the running honey.
Well, say they were not even our brothers or co-religionists, but simply children, women, and old people; one's feelings are outraged, and Russians hasten to help to stop those horrors.
'Nor do I,' said the Prince. 'I was living abroad and read the papers, and must own that I could not at all understand why, even before the Bulgarian atrocities, all Russians suddenly grew so fond of their Slavonic brothers, while I don't feel any love for them.
'Personal opinions don't count in this matter;' said Koznyshev. 'It is not an affair of personal opinions, when all Russia – the people – has expressed its will.'
The people understood nothing, but they sighed as they always do during a sermon,' continued the Prince. 'They were told that there would be a collection in the church for a soul-saving object, so they each took out a kopek and gave it, but what it was for – they did not know!'
A consciousness of their destiny always exists in the people, and at moments like the present it becomes clear to them,' said Koznyshev positively, glancing at the old beekeeper.
So much the same that they are just like frogs before a storm!
I don't publish a newspaper and don't want to defend them, but I am speaking of the unanimity of the intelligent world,' said Koznyshev, turning to his brother. Levin was going to reply, but the old Prince interrupted him.
He has now got the post of Member of the Committee of a Commission of something or other – I don't remember.
'I would make only one stipulation,' continued the Prince. 'Alphonse Karr put it very well, before the war with Prussia.
One thing could be seen indubitably, namely, that this dispute was irritating his brother at the moment, and that therefore it was wrong to continue it, so Levin ceased to argue and drew his visitors' attention to the clouds that were gathering and to the fact that they had better get home before the rain began.
THE PRINCE AND KOZNYSHEV GOT INTO THE TRAP and drove off; the rest of the party, hastening their steps, went home on foot.
When they were still about two hundred paces from the house the wind had already risen, so that at any moment a downpour might be expected.
The men, holding their hats, went on with long strides.
A white curtain of pouring rain was already descending over the distant wood and half the neighbouring field, and was advancing rapidly toward the Kolok.
The flash of lightning, the sound of thunder, and the sudden cold sensation of his body that was being drenched, merged for Levin into one feeling of horror.
Thank God!' he muttered, running up to them and splashing through the puddles with one shoe half off and full of water.
Kitty's wet and rosy face was turned to him, timidly smiling beneath her bedraggled hat.
After the rain it was too wet to go out walking, besides which the thunder-clouds had not cleared from the horizon, and, now here now there, passed thundering and darkening along the borders of the sky.
Koznyshev too was in good spirits and at tea, led on by his brother, expounded his views of the future of the Eastern question, and did it so simply and well that every one listened attentively.
He at once returned to the feeling that directed him, which was related to those thoughts, and he found that feeling in his soul yet more powerful and definite than before.
Kitty was standing, with her sleeves rolled up, beside the bath in which the baby was splashing about, and hearing her husband's step she turned her face toward him, beckoning him with a smile.
With one hand supporting the head of the plump kicking baby who floated on his back, with the other she squeezed the water from a sponge over him, regularly exerting the muscles of her arm.
Kitty bent over him, and his face lit up with a smile, he pressed his hand into the sponge and bubbled with his lips, producing such a contented and peculiar sound that not only Kitty and the nurse, but Levin too went into unexpected raptures.
'I am very glad, for I was beginning to be grieved about it.
She listened attentively, replacing on her slender fingers, across the baby, the rings she had taken off to bath Mitya.
At every flash of lightning not only the Milky Way but even the bright stars vanished; but immediately afterwards they reappeared in the same places, as if thrown there by some unerring hand.
'Do I not know that it is not the stars that are moving?' he asked himself, looking at a bright planet that had already shifted its position by the top branch of a birch tree. 'But I, watching the movement of the stars, cannot picture to myself the rotation of the earth and I am right in saying that the stars move.
By the light of that flash she saw the whole of his face and, noticing that he was calm and happy, she smiled at him.
Be good and go to the corner room and see how they have arranged things for Sergius Ivanich!
"Y-o-u-u TOM!" There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
Hand me that switch."
"My! Look behind you, aunt!"
He got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.
Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning.
A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.
The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said: "But you ain't too warm now, though."
Unbutton your jacket!"
Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises.
Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude.
"'Tisn't any of your business, maybe."
"Go away yourself!"
"I won't."
The boy only struggled to free himself.
Better look out who you're fooling with next time."
To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope.
So he went away; but he said he "'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.
He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound.
In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.
But Tom's energy did not last.
So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys.
He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work.
As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water.
The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.
His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles--for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.
Come--out with your spring-line--what're you about there!
Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work.
Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: "What do you call work?"
Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed.
"No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try.
They raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone.
He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two "military" companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment.
These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp.
A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind.
She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door.
Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.
Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner.
So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
A log raft in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.
At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.
And thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came.
The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort.
THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction.
I wouldn't do that.
True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a "sure-enough" Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.
Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door.
But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck.
Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect.
He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable.
Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.
Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons.
At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade: "Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?"
He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy.
The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say "Ouch!" and got a new reprimand from his teacher.
Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil.
There--that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do.
And so forth and so on.
But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.
The librarian "showed off"--running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in.
And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible.
But there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face.
She wondered; then she was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody.
The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish.
"Now I know you'll tell me," said the lady. "The names of the first two disciples were--"
The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision.
It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.
The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it--if he even did that much.
The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving.
He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded.
The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy.
So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again.
Tom lay thinking.
So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
However, it seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.
He took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.
Sid yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.
The boy felt a little foolish, and he said: "Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all."
Tom hailed the romantic outcast: "Hello, Huckleberry!"
and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many warts.
You see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes."
"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!'
He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her.
Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it.
Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity.
Take off your jacket."
He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head.
She observed it, "made a mouth" at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute.
She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place.
Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word.
The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.
The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.
"All right, go ahead; start him up."
This change of base occurred often.
The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession.
"I won't!"
"Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the lane and come back.
I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same way."
Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear.
Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:
Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said: "Please, Becky, won't you take it?"
Presently Becky began to suspect.
He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.
But no, there was something gaudier even than this.
It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward.
He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm.
He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called--
He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up discouraged.
Now he went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying: "Brother, go find your brother!"
Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with fluttering shirt.
He presently halted under a great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way and that.
They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, "two up and two down."
Why don't you fall?"
Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.
The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
A cry of "Scat! you devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the "ell" on all fours.
And the two clung together with beating hearts.
The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed.
Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light.
The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.
They cast down their load and began to open the grave.
The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees.
They growled a response and went on digging.
They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground.
The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.
Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said: "Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with another five, or here she stays."
"That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.
He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.
Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly.
They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed.
Tom thought a while, then he said: "Who'll tell?
Tom's whole being applauded this idea.
He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a little fragment of "red keel" out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]
So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood.
They continued to whisper for some little time.
Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them.
"Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am.
He's got his _back_ to us!"
Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more."
"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"
So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other.
Then they separated, cogitating.
When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent.
He unrolled it.
Tom's heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful, unaccountable fascination drew him on.
"Hallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning!
When he stood before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.
What did you want to come here for?" somebody said.
Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night.
She was a subscriber for all the "Health" periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils.
She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges.
She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.
She ordered a lot at once.
She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it.
Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc.
Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path.
Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him.
He was sick, he said, and he looked it.
Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away.
When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and "led up" warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait.
He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting her--and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: "Mf! some people think they're mighty smart--always showing off!"
Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous.
About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place.
Now the raft was passing before the distant town.
When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with contentment.
He had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.
A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, "Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and she took wing and went off to see about it--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once.
They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again.
While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward.
They tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines.
They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk.
But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and forced a recognition.
There was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.
"'Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz thunder--"
Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.
"That's it!" said Huck; "they done that last summer, when Bill Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him come up to the top.
As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared.
The pirates returned to camp.
They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon--from their point of view.
Tom withered him with derision!
Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined in with Tom, and the waverer quickly "explained," and was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging to his garments as he could.
Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his "red keel"; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner.
Then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.
However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out.
Shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.
Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to "cast off."
At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.
Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began, warily.
No end of strange things now.
He lay and "breathed" himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt's foot.
"But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't _bad_, so to say--only misch_ee_vous.
He warn't any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was"--and she began to cry.
He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim; then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should "hear something" soon; the wise-heads had "put this and that together" and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village--and then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner.
Then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted.
He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over.
He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle.
But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.
He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a graven image.
So he stepped ashore and entered the woods.
He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch.
After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.
And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ringtaw" and "keeps" till that amusement grew stale.
They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the "dumps," and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun.
He erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.
He made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:
He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.
The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will, chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it.
Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence.
"Well, I have too," said Tom; "oh, hundreds of times.
And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating, won't they wish they'd been along?"
I'll just _bet_ they will!" So the talk ran on.
Both boys were looking very pale and miserable, now.
You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it."
So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour.
About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys.
Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness.
And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground.
They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.
As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep.
They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them up.
When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way.
And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.
Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise God from whom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it!"
"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'"
"I don't think I said anything," said Sid.
He did not go skipping and prancing, but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him.
They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material.
She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead.
Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him.
At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction.
She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function.
Tom hinted at things he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting.
Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came.
I don't care for them!" and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.
So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on, crying.
Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse.
He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.
TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market:
The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in.
She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute.
Twice she put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained.
Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said: "I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry.
The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face: "I'll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer.
He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed.
She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete.
Well, of course I ain't going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it?
Then he'll do just the way he always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the right girl he'll know it, without any telling.
Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: "All right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it out!"
Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside.
Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings.
Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he had denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from principle.
By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it.
Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!
He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head.
The stillness continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.
Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.
Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing.
At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.
They swore in the signpainter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help.
The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the signpainter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would "manage the thing" while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.
In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived.
He was looking tolerably mellow.
Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible "Give me liberty or give me death" speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it.
Let us return to the "Examination."
But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!"
Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:
He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it.
He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced.
He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased.
That broke up the meeting.
Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up--gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.
He attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so he abandoned it.
Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.
A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever. There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.
Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and forever.
By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object.
The boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches.
Good friendly faces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me touch 'em.
The next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.
Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently.
Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window.
After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever.
The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when his own counsel said: "I have no questions to ask him."
The boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared.
Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially.
So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their three-mile tramp.
They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.
We've got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it."
Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note.
Tom considered awhile; and then said: "The ha'nted house.
ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come for their tools.
"Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday."
And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse.
They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.
They're coming right toward the door."
The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear. "They've stopped....
"Those infernal boys" quaked again under the inspiration of this remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day.
The two men got out some food and made a luncheon.
His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet.
Injun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him up with his foot and said:
"Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down, raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly.
He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.
They nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and easily understood, for they simply meant--"Oh, but ain't you glad _now_ we're here!"
He reached his hand in and drew it out--
Injun Joe took the pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself, and then began to use it.
"I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should say."
What business with fresh earth on them?
Who brought them here--and where are they gone?
The steps came creaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway.
Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.
Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.
Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house.
If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.
"Number Two--yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that.
But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.
Also Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better.
Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley.
Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him: "Run!" said he; "run, for your life!"
I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, _Great Caesar's Ghost!_"
I just grabbed that towel and started!"
Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was ready for a start.
The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was: "You'll not get back till late.
Then Becky reflected a moment and said:
Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up.
The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter.
Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.
But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again.
By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead.
Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere.
Ten o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts.
So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.
They passed by the old Welshman's house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward.
But they never stopped at the quarry.
They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom.
Better give it up."
Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig snapped under his foot!
His breath stopped and he listened.
When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew.
Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in their hands.
Huck accompanied them no further.
Huck waited for no particulars.
Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.
I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile.
But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods.
They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm.
"Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so, and I don't see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it last night.
Well, just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it.
The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair.
During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood.
The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:
But what did give you that turn?
Huck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing suggested itself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a senseless reply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it--feebly:
The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile.
Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret.
When all else had been learned, the widow said: "I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise.
They've just come back."
There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early at church.
When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said: "Is my Becky going to sleep all day?
One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!
Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching.
All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles.
Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it.
Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.
"Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before, you must _not_ talk.
Curious that she should cry. These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep.
NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic.
They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as "The Drawing-Room," "The Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on.
Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification.
They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about.
Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles.
He seized Becky's hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern.
Becky said: "Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others."
We seem to get worse and worse off all the time."
Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps.
We never can get out of this awful place!
He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter.
By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.
He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there.
While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.
Becky gave loose to tears and wailings.
The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again.
Both held their breath and listened.
Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction.
Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could.
He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.
The children groped their way back to the spring.
The weary time dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken.
He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along.
Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.
Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who shouted, "Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!"
Tom got about, a little, on Thursday, was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.
Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.
The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed.
Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging.
You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else.
Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?"
"Less start right off, Tom."
When they were several miles below "Cave Hollow," Tom said: "Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike.
Tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:
You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite.
Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave.
If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books."
By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the lead.
They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on.
They went on, and presently entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the "jumping-off place."
Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in.
They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged.
The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock.
He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his cargo behind him.
Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:
Mr. Jones said: "Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry."
She took them to a bedchamber and said: "Now wash and dress yourselves.
There--no thanks, as the widow says"--and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door with several kicks. "Now go and tell auntie if you dare--and tomorrow you'll catch it!"
The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality.
The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request.
A dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.
He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up missing.
The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's so awful reg'lar a body can't stand it."
"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom."
