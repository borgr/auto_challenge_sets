`` Do n't *take* them *off* , '' I cried ; `` I will not stir . ''
Bessie answered not ; but ere long , addressing me , she said -- `` You ought to be aware , Miss , that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed : she keeps you : if she were to *turn* you *off* , you would have to go to the poorhouse . ''
`` *Take* me *out* ! Let me go into the nursery ! '' was my cry .
Ere long , I became aware that some one was handling me ; *lifting* me *up* and supporting me in a sitting posture , and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before .
Then he *laid* me *down* , and addressing Bessie , charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night .
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night , if they can help it ; and it was cruel to *shut* me *up* alone without a candle , -- so cruel that I think I shall never forget it . "
`` But John Reed *knocked* me *down* , and my aunt *shut* me *up* in the red-room . ''
On that same occasion I learned , for the first time , from Miss Abbot 's communications to Bessie , that my father had been a poor clergyman ; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends , who considered the match beneath her ; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience , he *cut* her *off* without a shilling ; that after my mother and father had been married a year , the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated , and where that disease was then prevalent : that my mother took the infection from him , and both died within a month of each other .
`` My Uncle Reed is in heaven , and can see all you do and think ; and so can papa and mama : they know how you *shut* me *up* all day long , and how you wish me dead . ''
But Bessie , as soon as she had dressed her young ladies , used to *take* herself *off* to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper 's room , generally bearing the candle along with her .
I shall remember how you thrust me back -- roughly and violently thrust me back -- into the red-room , and *locked* me *up* there , to my dying day ; though I was in agony ; though I cried out , while suffocating with distress ,
Have mercy , Aunt Reed ! ' And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me -- *knocked* me *down* for nothing .
I asked of myself . " Were I in her place , it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and *swallow* me *up* .
`` Burns '' ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys are elsewhere ) , `` Burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . '' `` Burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; *draw* it *in* . ''
And in five minutes more she *shut* it *up* .
I suspected she might be right and I wrong ; but I would not ponder the matter deeply ; like Felix , I *put* it *off* to a more convenient season .
We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall *put* them *off* in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , -- the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man -- perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph !
And I was placed there , by whom I do n't know : I was in no condition to note particulars ; I was only aware that they had *hoisted* me *up* to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst 's nose , that he was within a yard of me , and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me .
" You see she is yet young ; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood ; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us ; no signal deformity *points* her *out* as a marked character .
You must be on your guard against her ; you must shun her example ; if necessary , avoid her company , exclude her from your sports , and *shut* her *out* from your converse .
What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me ! How the new feeling *bore* me *up* !
Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm `` the untidy badge ; '' scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in *copying* it *out* .
The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school , I ran to Helen , *tore* it *off* , and thrust it into the fire : the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day , and tears , hot and large , had continually been scalding my cheek ; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart .
I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as I loved , *urged* me *on* : I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me .
Tell me everything about them , Bessie : but sit down first ; and , Bobby , come and sit on my knee , will you ? " but Bobby *preferred* sidling *over* to his mother .
She went up to London last winter with her mama , and there everybody admired her , and a young lord fell in love with her : but his relations were against the match ; and -- what do you think ? -- he and Miss Georgiana *made* it *up* to run away ; but they were found out and stopped .
It was Miss Reed that *found* them *out* : I believe she was envious ; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together ; they are always quarrelling -- "
He hoisted it on to the vehicle , which was a sort of car , and then I got in ; before he *shut* me *up* , I asked him how far it was to Thornfield .
There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character , or observing and describing salient points , either in persons or things : the good lady evidently belonged to this class ; my queries puzzled , but did not *draw* her *out* .
`` You live just below -- do you mean at that house with the battlements ? '' pointing to Thornfield Hall , on which the moon cast a hoary gleam , *bringing* it *out* distinct and pale from the woods that , by contrast with the western sky , now seemed one mass of shadow .
`` *Take* them *off* to the other table , Mrs. Fairfax , '' said he , `` and look at them with Adele ; -- you '' ( glancing at me ) " resume your seat , and answer my questions .
Adele is a degree better , but still far below the mark ; Mrs. Fairfax ditto ; you , I am persuaded , can suit me if you will : you puzzled me the first evening I *invited* you *down* here .
It would please me now to *draw* you *out* -- to learn more of you -- therefore speak . "
Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me , I *found* her *out* ; but it was a warm night , and I was tired with strolling through Paris , so I sat down in her boudoir ; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence .
I *heaved* them *up* , deluged the bed and its occupant , flew back to my own room , brought my own water-jug , baptized the couch afresh , and , by God 's aid , succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it .
He took it from my hand , *held* it *up* , and surveyed the bed , all blackened and scorched , the sheets drenched , the carpet round swimming in water .
No ; what the deuce would you *call* her *for* ?
I looked at Adele , whose head leant against my shoulder ; her eyes were waxing heavy , so I *took* her *up* in my arms and *carried* her *off* to bed .
`` Then , what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that ? '' ( pointing to Adele ) . `` Where did you *pick* her *up* ? ''
`` Then no more need be said : change the subject . '' Amy Eshton , not hearing or not heeding this dictum , joined in with her soft , infantine tone : " Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too ; but she was such a good creature , she would bear anything : nothing *put* her *out* .
`` How provoking ! '' exclaimed Miss Ingram : `` you tiresome monkey ! '' ( apostrophising Adele ) , `` who *perched* you *up* in the window to give false intelligence ? '' and she cast on me an angry glance , as if I were in fault .
`` Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not *take* herself *off* , '' replied the magistrate .
`` Why , she 's a real sorceress ! '' cried Frederick Lynn . `` Let us *have* her *in* , of course . ''
`` Then you have some secret hope to *buoy* you *up* and please you with whispers of the future ? ''
It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand , and *take* it *up* : but whether you will do so , is the problem I study .
In short , I believe you have been trying to *draw* me *out* -- or in ; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense .
`` Go back now into the room ; *step* quietly *up* to Mason , and whisper in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him : show him in here and then leave me . '' `` Yes , sir . ''
`` But do n't *pull* me *down* or strangle me , '' he replied : for the Misses Eshton were clinging about him now ; and the two dowagers , in vast white wrappers , were bearing down on him like ships in full sail .
He took the sponge , *dipped* it *in* , and moistened the corpse-like face ; he asked for my smelling-bottle , and applied it to the nostrils .
The sun will soon rise , and I must *have* him *off* . "
`` Mason got the start of you all this morning ; he was gone before sunrise : I rose at four to *see* him *off* . ''
`` Why , you see , Miss Eyre , it is not a common mishap : his life has been very wild : these last three years he *gave* himself *up* to strange ways , and his death was shocking . ''
Robert Leaven resumed -- " Missis had been out of health herself for some time : she had got very stout , but was not strong with it ; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite *breaking* her *down* .
The young ladies *put* it *off* at first ; but their mother grew so restless , and said , ' Jane , Jane , ' so many times , that at last they consented .
`` None that would own me , sir . Mr. Reed is dead , and his wife *cast* me *off* . ''
I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will , perhaps , be dead before you reach her : besides , you say she *cast* you *off* . "
Turning restlessly , she drew the bedclothes round her ; my elbow , resting on a corner of the quilt , *fixed* it *down* : she was at once irritated .
I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house ; or *let* it *off* .
She had an alarm to *call* her *up* early . I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast , but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions , and each hour had its allotted task .
One day , however , as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery , she suddenly *took* her *up* thus --
You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents , I shall suffer you to *fasten* me *down* by even the feeblest claim : I can tell you this -- if the whole human race , ourselves excepted , were swept away , and we two stood alone on the earth , I would leave you in the old world , and betake myself to the new . "
One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to *bring* you *up* as my own child ; the other -- " she stopped .
As I *laid* her *down* -- for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank -- I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine : the feeble fingers shrank from my touch -- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze .
`` Yes ; I suppose you *found* that *out* by second-sight . ''
No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like ; it was full of trees , it bloomed with flowers : a very high wall *shut* it *out* from the court , on one side ; on the other , a beech avenue screened it from the lawn .
I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and *put* it *on* : it seemed no attire had ever so well become me , because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood .
He *handed* her *over* as if she had been a lapdog . `` I 'll send her to school yet , '' he said , but now he was smiling .
`` Fire rises out of the lunar mountains : when she is cold , I 'll *carry* her *up* to a peak , and *lay* her *down* on the edge of a crater . ''
I dangers dared ; I hindrance scorned ; I omens did defy : Whatever menaced , harassed , warned , I *passed* impetuous *by* .
Though haughty Hate should *strike* me *down* , Right , bar approach to me , And grinding Might , with furious frown , Swear endless enmity .
From less to more , I *worked* him *up* to considerable irritation ; then , after he had retired , in dudgeon , quite to the other end of the room , I got up , and saying , `` I wish you good-night , sir , '' in my natural and wonted respectful manner , I slipped out by the side-door and got away .
But presently she took my veil from its place ; she *held* it *up* , gazed at it long , and then she threw it over her own head , and turned to the mirror .
Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester -- his passion died as if a blight had *shrivelled* it *up* : he only asked -- `` What have _ you _ to say ? ''
Mrs. Poole advanced . `` Keep out of the way , '' said Mr. Rochester , *thrusting* her *aside* : `` she has no knife now , I suppose , and I 'm on my guard . ''
The house cleared , I *shut* myself *in* , fastened the bolt that none might intrude , and proceeded -- not to weep , not to mourn , I was yet too calm for that , but -- mechanically to take off the wedding dress , and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday , as I thought , for the last time .
Self-abandoned , relaxed , and effortless , I seemed to have *laid* me *down* in the dried-up bed of a great river ; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains , and felt the torrent come : to rise I had no will , to flee I had no strength .
I wrestled with my own resolution : I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me ; and Conscience , turned tyrant , held Passion by the throat , told her tauntingly , she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough , and swore that with that arm of iron he would *thrust* her *down* to unsounded depths of agony .
So you shun me ? -- you *shut* yourself *up* and grieve alone !
" Concealing the mad-woman 's neighbourhood from you , however , was something like covering a child with a cloak and *laying* it *down* near a upas-tree : that demon 's vicinage is poisoned , and always was .
I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to *set* her *up* in a good line of business , and so get decently rid of her .
I wondered what you thought of me , or if you ever thought of me , and resolved to *find* this *out* . " I resumed my notice of you .
`` Jane ! '' recommenced he , with a gentleness that *broke* me *down* with grief , and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror -- for this still voice was the pant of a lion rising -- `` Jane , do you mean to go one way in the world , and to let me go another ? ''
God must have *led* me *on* .
It is a summer evening ; the coachman has *set* me *down* at a place called Whitcross ; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given , and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world . The coach is a mile off by this time ; I am alone .
She shook her head , she `` was sorry she could give me no information , '' and the white door closed , quite gently and civilly : but it *shut* me *out* .
I approached it ; it was a road or a track : it *led* straight *up* to the light , which now beamed from a sort of knoll , amidst a clump of trees -- firs , apparently , from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom .
`` It is very well we *took* her *in* . ''
But she could remember Bill Oliver 's father a journeyman needlemaker ; and th ' Rivers wor gentry i ' th ' owd days o ' th ' Henrys , as onybody might see by looking into th ' registers i ' Morton Church vestry . `` Still , she allowed , '' the owd maister was like other folk -- *naught* mich *out* o ' t ' common way : stark mad o ' shooting , and farming , and sich like . "
Often , of an evening , when he sat at the window , his desk and papers before him , he would cease reading or writing , rest his chin on his hand , and *deliver* himself *up* to I know not what course of thought ; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye .
I know I am : but how did you *find* it *out* ? "
What he suddenly saw on this blank paper , it was impossible for me to tell ; but something had caught his eye . He *took* it *up* with a snatch ; he looked at the edge ; then shot a glance at me , inexpressibly peculiar , and quite incomprehensible : a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape , face , and dress ; for it traversed all , quick , keen as lightning .
How very easily alarmed you are ! " he answered , removing his cloak and *hanging* it *up* against the door , towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged .
`` One drift *took* me *up* to the waist ; happily the snow is quite soft yet . ''
A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to *find* her *out* .
`` You *give* it *up* very gleefully , '' said he ; `` I do n't quite understand your light-heartedness , because I can not tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing . What aim , what purpose , what ambition in life have you now ? ''
" My first aim will be to _ clean down _ ( do you comprehend the full force of the expression ? ) -- to _ clean down _ Moor House from chamber to cellar ; my next to *rub* it *up* with bees-wax , oil , and an indefinite number of cloths , till it glitters again ; my third , to arrange every chair , table , bed , carpet , with mathematical precision ; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room ; and lastly , the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs , sorting of currants , grating of spices , compounding of Christmas cakes , chopping up of materials for mince-pies , and solemnising of other culinary rites , as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you .
I am disposed to be as content as a queen , and you try to *stir* me *up* to restlessness !
`` You say truly ; but when found , it is right to *stir* them *up* -- to urge and exhort them to the effort -- to show them what their gifts are , and why they were given -- to speak Heaven 's message in their ear , -- to offer them , direct from God , a place in the ranks of His chosen . ''
`` Very willingly , '' he rejoined ; and rising , he strode a little distance up the pass , *threw* himself *down* on a swell of heath , and there lay still .
`` I see you and St. John have been quarrelling , Jane , '' said Diana , `` during your walk on the moor . But go after him ; he is now lingering in the passage expecting you -- he will *make* it *up* . ''
I would much rather he had *knocked* me *down* .
It is better , therefore , for the insignificant to keep out of his way , lest , in his progress , he should *trample* them *down* .
I can not *give* you *up* to perdition as a vessel of wrath : repent -- resolve , while there is yet time .
I *took* it *up* .
He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry , and *shut* himself *up* like a hermit at the Hall . "
`` My dear master , '' I answered , `` I am Jane Eyre : I have *found* you *out* -- I am come back to you . ''
I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his wife : an expectation , not the less certain because unexpressed , had *buoyed* me *up* , that he would claim me at once as his own .
After supper , he began to ask me many questions , of where I had been , what I had been doing , how I had *found* him *out* ; but I gave him only very partial replies : it was too late to enter into particulars that night .
Very early the next morning I *heard* him *up* and astir , wandering from one room to another .
Then : " Which room did you *put* her *into* ?
`` *Shake* me *off* , then , sir , -- push me away , for I 'll not leave you of my own accord . ''
( for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to *say* it *over* ) ' -- yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ? ' ( Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say . )
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for *shutting* people *up* like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( ' which certainly was not here before , ' said Alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' DRINK ME ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .
However , this bottle was not marked ' poison , ' so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon *finished* it *off* .
After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had *tired* herself *out* with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to *quiver* all *over* with fright . ' Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings .
Some of the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began *wrapping* itself *up* very carefully , remarking , ' I really must be getting home ; the night-air does n't suit my throat ! ' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , ' Come away , my dears ! It 's high time you were all in bed ! '
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her . ' Poor little thing ! ' said Alice , in a coaxing tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would be very likely to *eat* her *up* in spite of all her coaxing .
Hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and *held* it *out* to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , with a yelp of delight , and rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ; and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut .
She *stretched* herself *up* on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar 's making such very short remarks , and she *drew* herself *up* and said , very gravely , ' I think , you ought to tell me who you are , first . '
She had just succeeded in *curving* it *down* into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings .
' Whoever lives there , ' thought Alice , ' it 'll never do to come upon them this size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! ' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had *brought* herself *down* to nine inches high .
Alice *went* timidly *up* to the door , and knocked .
' There might be some sense in your knocking , ' the Footman went on without attending to her , ' if we had the door between us . For instance , if you were inside , you might knock , and I could *let* you *out* , you know . '
' Oh , please mind what you 're doing ! ' cried Alice , jumping up and down in an agony of terror . ' Oh , there goes his precious nose ' ; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it , and very nearly *carried* it *off* .
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it , and kept *doubling* itself *up* and *straightening* itself *out* again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it , ( which was to *twist* it *up* into a sort of knot , and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself , ) she *carried* it *out* into the open air . ' If I do n't take this child away with me , ' thought Alice , ' they 're sure to kill it in a day or two : would n't it be murder to leave it behind ? '
' Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well , ' the Hatter grumbled : ' you should n't have *put* it *in* with the bread-knife . '
' No , I *give* it *up* , ' Alice replied : ' what 's the answer ? '
Two began in a low voice , ' Why the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a red rose-tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to *find* it *out* , we should all have our heads cut off , you know .
The Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , *screamed* ' *Off* with her head ! Off -- '
The Queen turned angrily away from him , and said to the Knave ' *Turn* them *over* ! '
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live hedgehogs , the mallets live flamingoes , and the soldiers had to *double* themselves *up* and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .
She was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it a minute or two , she *made* it *out* to be a grin , and she said to herself ' It 's the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to . '
The executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to *cut* it *off* from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at his time of life .
' Everything 's got a moral , if only you can find it . ' And she *squeezed* herself *up* closer to Alice 's side as she spoke .
`` You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they *take* us *up* and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! '' But the snail replied `` Too far , too far ! '' and gave a look askance -- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
' But about his toes ? ' the Mock Turtle persisted . ' How could he *turn* them *out* with his nose , you know ? '
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other . ' I beg pardon , your Majesty , ' he began , ' for *bringing* these *in* : but I had n't quite finished my tea when I was sent for . '
' Write that down , ' the King said to the jury , and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates , and then *added* them *up* , and reduced the answer to shillings and pence .
' Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began *picking* them *up* again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box , or they would die .
She soon *got* it *out* again , and put it right ; ' not that it signifies much , ' she said to herself ; ' I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other . '
They were just beginning to *write* this *down* on their slates , when the White Rabbit interrupted : ' Unimportant , your Majesty means , of course , ' he said in a very respectful tone , but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke .
At this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to *beat* them *off* , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .
He stooped to *pick* it *up* .
A neighbor *knocked* it *down* again with his elbow ; he *picked* it *up* once more .
For two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the provinces of Caux and Picardy , in a kind of place half farm , half private house ; and here , soured , eaten up with regrets , cursing his luck , jealous of everyone , he *shut* himself *up* at the age of forty-five , sick of men , he said , and determined to live at peace .
To *shut* himself *up* every evening in the dirty public room , to push about on marble tables the small sheep bones with black dots , seemed to him a fine proof of his freedom , which raised him in his own esteem .
She *drew* herself *up* , scarlet , and looked at him over her shoulder as she handed him his whip .
Old Rouault was *seeing* him *off* ; they were walking along the road full of ruts ; they were about to part .
Emma 's dress , too long , trailed a little on the ground ; from time to time she stopped to *pull* it *up* , and then delicately , with her gloved hands , she picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns , while Charles , empty handed , waited till she had finished .
When he had gone about a hundred paces he stopped , and as he saw the cart disappearing , its wheels turning in the dust , he gave a deep sigh . Then he remembered his wedding , the old times , the first pregnancy of his wife ; he , too , had been very happy the day when he had taken her from her father to his home , and had *carried* her *off* on a pillion , trotting through the snow , for it was near Christmas-time , and the country was all white .
Charles noticed it ; he took it and *carried* it *up* to the attic , while Emma seated in an arm-chair ( they were putting her things down around her ) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox , and wondered , dreaming , what would be done with them if she were to die .
He rose . She came to the window to *see* him *off* , and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of geranium , clad in her dressing gown hanging loosely about her .
Emma proved to him with a word that he was mistaken , and *sent* him *off* to his patients .
Charles *dragged* himself *up* by the balusters .
After she had well scolded her servant she gave her presents or *sent* her *out* to see neighbours , just as she sometimes threw beggars all the silver in her purse , although she was by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible to the feelings of others , like most country-bred people , who always retain in their souls something of the horny hardness of the paternal hands .
We leave the highroad at La Boissiere and *keep* straight *on* to the top of the Leux hill , whence the valley is seen .
Call Polyte and tell him to *put* it *up* .
With the tips of her fingers she caught her dress at the knee , and having thus *pulled* it *up* to her ankle , held out her foot in its black boot to the fire above the revolving leg of mutton .
She *took* it *up* in the wrapping that enveloped it and began singing softly as she rocked herself to and fro .
Then the three hundred finished , they both *stretched* themselves *out* in front of the fire , and were soon asleep .
Then he took energetic resolutions , wrote letters that he tore up , *put* it *off* to times that he again deferred .
The conversation languished ; Madame Bovary *gave* it *up* every few minutes , whilst he himself seemed quite embarrassed .
`` Then you are *giving* it *up* ? '' he went on .
When visitors called , Felicite *brought* her *in* , and Madame Bovary undressed her to show off her limbs .
Madame Bovary sprang to *lift* her *up* , broke the bell-rope , called for the servant with all her might , and she was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared .
Although he had not seemed much moved , Homais , nevertheless , had exerted himself to *buoy* him *up* , to `` keep up his spirits . ''
In the supineness of her conscience she even took her repugnance towards her husband for aspirations towards her lover , the burning of hate for the warmth of tenderness ; but as the tempest still raged , and as passion *burnt* itself *down* to the very cinders , and no help came , no sun rose , there was night on all sides , and she was lost in the terrible cold that pierced her .
But her reading fared like her piece of embroidery , all of which , only just begun , filled her cupboard ; she *took* it *up* , left it , passed on to other books .
Wherever did that fat fellow *pick* her *up* ? "
And , moreover , Madame Lefrancois , one must know botany , be able to distinguish between plants , you understand , which are the wholesome and those that are deleterious , which are unproductive and which nutritive , if it is well to *pull* them *up* here and re-sow them there , to propagate some , destroy others ; in brief , one must keep pace with science by means of pamphlets and public papers , be always on the alert to find out improvements . "
It 's Lheureux who is *selling* him *out* ; he has killed him with bills . "
More than one showed his humble medal with pride ; and no doubt when he got home to his good housewife , he *hung* it *up* weeping on the modest walls of his cot .
You ought to *follow* it *up* . "
Her figure slightly bent , her hand well up , and her right arm stretched out , she *gave* herself *up* to the cadence of the movement that rocked her in her saddle .
She threw back her white neck , swelling with a sigh , and faltering , in tears , with a long shudder and hiding her face , she *gave* herself *up* to him -
And as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and *shut* herself *up* in her room .
She was wild with impatience ; if her eyes could have done it , she would have *hurled* him *out* at the window .
He *thought* it *over* , but could hit upon nothing .
`` Take me away , '' she cried , " *carry* me *off* !
" Perhaps she 'll think I 'm *giving* it *up* from avarice .
`` I think it 's all right . Ah ! and this for fear she should come and *hunt* me *up* . ''
She *drew* herself *up* slowly , shading her eyes with her hand to look .
The tradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been ordered , and that he would not take them back ; besides , it would vex madame in her convalescence ; the doctor had better *think* it *over* ; in short , he was resolved to sue him rather than give up his rights and take back his goods .
Then she let her head fall back , fancying she heard in space the music of seraphic harps , and perceived in an azure sky , on a golden throne in the midst of saints holding green palms , God the Father , resplendent with majesty , who with a sign sent to earth angels with wings of fire to *carry* her *away* in their arms .
Then she *gave* herself *up* to excessive charity .
She *gave* herself *up* to the lullaby of the melodies , and felt all her being vibrate as if the violin bows were drawn over her nerves . She had not eyes enough to look at the costumes , the scenery , the actors , the painted trees that shook when anyone walked , and the velvet caps , cloaks , swords - all those imaginary things that floated amid the harmony as in the atmosphere of another world .
Edgar , flashing with fury , dominated all the others with his clearer voice ; Ashton hurled homicidal provocations at him in deep notes ; Lucie uttered her shrill plaint , Arthur at one side , his modulated tones in the middle register , and the bass of the minister pealed forth like an organ , while the voices of the women repeating his words *took* them *up* in chorus delightfully .
`` *Turn* them *out* ! *turn* them *out* ! ''
" Well , you must *think* it *over* . We 'll see .
As they talked they explained more and more fully the motives of their sadness , *working* themselves *up* in their progressive confidence .
" I am beginning to repent terribly of having *taken* you *up* !
In order to *put* it *down* he described painfully a quarter of a circle with his stump .
`` We *made* it *up* , all the same , and I 've come again to propose another arrangement . ''
" And he would do better to *give* it *over* to someone else - to you , for example .
She *poured* it *out* upon the square , on the walks , on the streets , and the old Norman city outspread before her eyes as an enormous capital , as a Babylon into which she was entering .
He *took* it *out* and read -
In vain the clerk tried to get rid of him . Monsieur Homais *dragged* him *off* to the large Cafe de la Normandie , which he entered majestically , not raising his hat , thinking it very provincial to uncover in any public place .
`` But still , now *talk* it *over* . ''
" I will *show* you *up* .
Emma had *sent* her *out* to watch for Bovary in order to *keep* him *off* , and they hurriedly installed the man in possession under the roof , where he swore he would remain .
The druggist 's wife *crunched* them *up* as they had done - heroically , despite her wretched teeth . And so whenever Homais journeyed to town , he never failed to bring her home some that he bought at the great baker 's in the Rue Massacre .
He flew to the writing-table , tore open the seal , and read aloud : `` Accuse no one . '' He stopped , passed his hands across his eyes , and *read* it *over* again .
The priest did not fail to *point* this *out* ; he even explained to Bovary that the Lord sometimes prolonged the life of persons when he thought it meet for their salvation ; and Charles remembered the day when , so near death , she had received the communion . Perhaps there was no need to despair , he thought .
He had to write two letters , to prepare a soothing potion for Bovary , to invent some lie that would conceal the poisoning , and *work* it *up* into an article for the `` Fanal , '' without counting the people who were waiting to get the news from him ; and when the Yonvillers had all heard his story of the arsenic that she had mistaken for sugar in making a vanilla cream . Homais once more returned to Bovary 's .
He *shut* himself *up* in his consulting-room , took a pen , and after sobbing for some time , wrote -
Emma 's head was turned towards her right shoulder , the corner of her mouth , which was open , seemed like a black hole at the lower part of her face ; her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands ; a kind of white dust besprinkled her lashes , and her eyes were beginning to disappear in that viscous pallor that looks like a thin web , as if spiders had *spun* it *over* . The sheet sunk in from her breast to her knees , and then rose at the tips of her toes , and it seemed to Charles that infinite masses , an enormous load , were weighing upon her .
Charles felt inclined to get up and *put* them *out* .
Felicite now wore Madame Bovary 's gowns ; not all , for he had kept some of them , and he went to look at them in her dressing-room , *locking* himself *up* there ; she was about her height , and often Charles , seeing her from behind , was seized with an illusion , and cried out -
Monsieur Bournisien even paid him two or three visits , then *gave* him *up* .
Then they said `` he *shut* himself *up* to drink . ''
The priest whitewashes them , the archdeacon *scrapes* them *down* ; then the populace arrives and demolishes them .
Then a great hurly − burly ensued ; a vast movement of feet , hands , and heads ; a general outbreak of coughs and handkerchiefs ; each one arranged himself , assumed his post , *raised* himself *up* , and grouped himself .
Each man vied with his neighbor in *pointing* them *out* and naming them , in seeing who should recognize at least one of them : this one , the Bishop of Marseilles ( Alaudet , if my memory serves me right ) ; − − this one , the primicier of Saint − Denis ; − − this one , Robert de Lespinasse , Abbé of Saint − Germain des Prés , that libertine brother of a mistress of Louis XI . ; all with many errors and absurdities .
Jupiter , whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing − room , supported her claim , and Venus was on the point of *carrying* it *off* , − − that is to say , without allegory , of marrying monsieur the dauphin , when a young child clad in white damask , and holding in her hand a daisy ( a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of Flanders ) came to contest it with Venus .
Gringoire bore this new disaster heroically ; he *picked* himself *up* , and reached the water 's edge .
Just see if those boobies will *put* themselves *out* ! Move aside !
`` Will you *take* yourself *off* , you Egyptian grasshopper ? '' cried a sharp voice , which proceeded from the darkest corner of the Place .
At the moment when he stood forth from the crowd , Gringoire , who had not *noticed* him *up* to that time , recognized him : `` Hold ! '' he said , with an exclamation of astonishment . " Eh ! it is my master in Hermes , Dom Claude Frollo , the archdeacon !
`` Captain Phoebus de Châteaupers , at your service , my beauty ! '' replied the officer , *drawing* himself *up* .
They *dragged* him *off* .
`` *Pick* me *up* that knave , and hang him without ceremony . ''
Gringoire stooped quickly to *pick* it *up* ; when he straightened up , the young girl and the goat had disappeared .
There was no piece of furniture adapted to sleeping purposes , except a tolerably long wooden coffer ; and its cover was carved , to boot ; which afforded Gringoire , when he *stretched* himself *out* upon it , a sensation somewhat similar to that which Micromégas would feel if he were to lie down on the Alps .
And then they have *made* it *over* ; a presumption of which neither time nor revolutions at least have been guilty .
Finally , the fourth compartment , which *stretched* itself *out* in the agglomeration of the roofs on the right bank , and which occupied the western angle of the enclosure , and the banks of the river down stream , was a fresh cluster of palaces and Hôtels pressed close about the base of the Louvre .
However , admirable as the Paris of to − day may seem to you , reconstruct the Paris of the fifteenth century , *call* it *up* before you in thought ; look at the sky athwart that surprising forest of spires , towers , and belfries ; spread out in the centre of the city , tear away at the point of the islands , fold at the arches of the bridges , the Seine , with its broad green and yellow expanses , more variable than the skin of a serpent ; project clearly against an azure horizon the Gothic profile of this ancient Paris . Make its contour float in a winter 's mist which clings to its numerous chimneys ; drown it in profound night and watch the odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre labyrinth of edifices ; cast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to emerge from the fog the great heads of the towers ; or take that black silhouette again , enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables , and make it start out more toothed than a shark 's jaw against a copper − colored western sky , − − and then compare .
He took it in his cassock and *carried* it *off* .
When he removed the child from the sack , he found it greatly *deformed* , *in* very sooth .
`` God help me , messieurs ! '' said the archdeacon , *showing* them *in* ; `` I was not expecting distinguished visitors at such an hour . '' And while speaking in this courteous fashion he cast an uneasy and scrutinizing glance from the physician to his companion .
Thought was then free only in this manner ; hence it never *wrote* itself *out* completely except on the books called edifices .
He cast the same glance about him , but it was so dull and sleepy that the women only *pointed* him *out* to each other in derision .
She kissed her , caressed her , tickled her , washed her , *decked* her *out* , devoured her !
`` I am no longer surprised , '' added Gervaise , `` that fear of the gypsies should *spur* you *on* so sharply . ''
These words were , so to speak , the point of union of two scenes , which *had* , *up* to that time , been developed in parallel lines at the same moment , each on its particular theatre ; one , that which the reader has just perused , in the Rat − Hole ; the other , which he is about to read , on the ladder of the pillory .
`` That will teach you to *wake* us *up* at night with your peal of a dammed soul . ''
Then , from that eye which had been , up to that moment , so dry and burning , a big tear was seen to fall , and *roll* slowly *down* that deformed visage so long contracted with despair .
They were *chatting* together *in* that whispering tone and with the half − stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose midst there is a young man .
The name of some festival when the bells are pealed ! So he took the liberty of *carrying* you *off* , as though you were made for beadles !
Every day , an hour before sunset , the archdeacon ascended the staircase to the tower , and *shut* himself *up* in this cell , where he sometimes passed whole nights .
He did not know , he who wore his heart on his sleeve , he who observed only the good old law of Nature in the world , he who allowed his passions to follow their inclinations , and in whom the lake of great emotions was always dry , so freely did he *let* it *off* each day by fresh drains , − − he did not know with what fury the sea of human passions ferments and boils when all egress is denied to it , how it accumulates , how it swells , how it overflows , how it hollows out the heart ; how it breaks in inward sobs , and dull convulsions , until it has rent its dikes and burst its bed .
`` Be at ease , '' said Charmolue with a smile ; " I 'll *buckle* him *down* again for you on the leather bed when I get home .
I have just been with those prudes , and when I come forth , I always find my throat full of curses , I must *spit* them *out* or strangle , ~ ventre et tonnerre ~ ! "
Several liards had rolled into the mud ; the captain in his enthusiasm stooped to *pick* them *up* . Jehan restrained him .
Meanwhile , all malice was not extinguished in the captain 's heart . `` So much the worse if the devil 's cart *picks* you *up* on its passage ! '' he said to the poor , sleeping clerk ; and he strode off .
I love my captain . " Phoebus again profited by the opportunity to impress upon her beautiful bent neck a kiss which made the young girl *straighten* herself *up* as scarlet as a poppy .
A bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile , who made a doleful shake of the head , and *passed* it *on* to the president , who gave it to the procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court , and thus it made the circuit of the hail .
`` *Take* that *off* ! '' she cried angrily ; and *drawing* herself *up* , with her hair all dishevelled : `` Mercy ! '' She darted from the bed to fling herself at the feet of the king 's procurator , but her leg was fast in the heavy block of oak and iron , and she sank down upon the boot , more crushed than a bee with a lump of lead on its wing .
Between men and himself , the condemned man felt a pile of stones and jailers weighing down upon his head ; and the entire prison , the massive bastille was nothing more than an enormous , complicated lock , which *barred* him *off* from the rest of the world .
I *drew* myself *up* ; I fled ; but alas ! something within me had fallen never to rise again , something had come upon me from which I could not flee . "
My God ! my God ! it would have been better not to give her to me than to *take* her *away* so soon .
She was in her shift ; her long black hair ( the fashion then was to *cut* it *off* only at the foot of the gallows ) fell in disorder upon her half − bared throat and shoulders .
No one had yet observed in the gallery of the statues of the kings , carved directly above the arches of the portal , a strange spectator , who *had* , *up* to that time , observed everything with such impassiveness , with a neck so strained , a visage so hideous that , in his motley accoutrement of red and violet , he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have discharged their waters for six hundred years .
Then he became alarmed , he put his hands on his ears that he might no longer hear , *turned* his *back* that he might no longer see , and fled from the frightful vision with hasty strides .
Then he *drew* himself *up* stiffly and said , − − `` Oh ! how happy you are to have some one who loves you ! ''
A moment later she felt a touch along her body which made her shudder so that she *straightened* herself *up* in a sitting posture , wide awake and furious .
`` Yes , '' resumed Gringoire , talking to himself and touching his nose with his forefinger in sign of meditation , − − " that 's it ! − − The thieves are brave fellows ! − − The tribe of Egypt love her ! − − They will rise at the first word ! − − Nothing easier ! − − A sudden stroke . − − Under cover of the disorder , they will easily *carry* her *off* ! − − Beginning to − morrow evening . They will ask nothing better .
`` What more do you want to *break* it *in* ? '' demanded Clopin .
With a strength which the sense of danger increased tenfold , he seized one of the beams − − the longest and heaviest ; he *pushed* it *out* through a loophole , then , grasping it again outside of the tower , he made it slide along the angle of the balustrade which surrounds the platform , and let it fly into the abyss .
He laid his hand on the arrow , tore it from his arm , and tranquilly broke it across his big knee ; then he let the two pieces drop on the floor , rather than *threw* them *down* .
If you will grant me mercy , sire , I will *wear* it *out* on the knees in praying to God for you night and morning !
Release him at once , the wanton ( Louis XI. was fond of this word which formed , with ~ Pasque − Dieu ~ , the foundation of his joviality ) , and *put* him *out* with a buffet . "
Here , as though seized with a sudden idea , he flung himself on his knees before his chair , took off his hat , placed it on the seat , and gazing devoutly at one of the leaden amulets which *loaded* it *down* ,
Others thrust iron hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and *dragged* them *down* . They slashed in pieces those who fell .
You will follow me , you will be obliged to follow me , or I will *deliver* you *up* ! You must die , my beauty , or be mine ! belong to the priest ! belong to the apostate ! belong to the assassin ! this very night , do you hear ?
And if they *woke* her *up* when they took her , in vain she might cry ; I was not there ! − − Ah ! gypsy mothers , you devoured my child ! come see your own . "
When her daughter was inside the cell , she laid her gently on the ground , then *raised* her *up* again , and bearing her in her arms as though she were still only her little Agnes , she walked to and fro in her little room , intoxicated , frantic , joyous , crying out , singing , kissing her daughter , talking to her , bursting into laughter , melting into tears , all at once and with vehemence .
The mother rose quickly and went to post herself before her window , in order to *stop* it *up* .
If the unfortunate girl had still been there , it would have been he himself who would have *delivered* her *up* .
`` It 's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom , '' they said . " Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom , and after a certain amount of time they *sell* things *off* , whether the case involved has come to an end or not .
He *threw* himself *down* on his bed , and from the dressing table he took the nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his breakfast .
`` Ridiculous formalities ! '' he grumbled , as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his hands for a little while , as if *holding* it *out* for the policemen 's inspection .
He secretly told himself that he had succeeded in *speeding* things *up* by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath .
The old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them *calmed* them *down* .
We certainly ca n't talk out here , we 'd *wake* everyone *up* and I think that would be more unpleasant for us than for them .
`` You arrived back so late , '' said K. " Now you 've started *telling* me *off* .
And now it really does begin. the supervisor calls out as if he had to *wake* me *up* , in fact he shouts at me , I 'm afraid , if I 'm to make it clear to you , I 'll have to shout as well , and it 's nothing more than my name that he shouts out . "
K. was too engrossed in his role and slowly called out , `` Josef K. ! . '' It was not as loud as he had threatened , but nonetheless , once he had suddenly *called* it *out* , the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all round the room .
It was a matter of course that he would have to appear without fail , there was probably no need to *point* this *out* to him .
`` Bad news ? '' asked the deputy director casually , not in order to *find* anything *out* but just to get K. away from the device .
A fruitmonger , taking his goods up to the windows , was just as inattentive as K. and nearly *knocked* him *down* with his cart .
`` Next time I come here , '' he said to himself , `` I must either bring sweets with me make them like me or a stick to hit them with . '' Just before he reached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a ball had finished its movement , two small lads with sly faces like grown-up scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had ; if he were to *shake* them *off* he would have to hurt them , and he was afraid of what noise they would make by shouting .
But then he *went* back *in* anyway .
As far as could be *distinguished* , *up* in the half-darkness , dust and haze , they seemed to be less well dressed than those below .
The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power over those below him in the hall , he tried to reduce what harm had been done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them , his eyebrows , until then hardly remarkable , *pushed* themselves *up* and became big , black and bushy over his eyes .
The judge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk - which could only have been a sign of his deep humiliation , or at least that is how it must have been perceived - tried to *tidy* it *up* a little , and held it once more in front of himself in order to read from it .
If you want to discuss what I say , please do n't bother to *write* it *down* until later on , I do n't have any time to waste and I 'll soon be leaving . "
`` So , '' called out K , throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed more room , " all of you are working for this organisation , I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I 've just been speaking about , you 've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and snoop on me , you gave the impression of having formed into factions , one of you even applauded me to *test* me *out* , and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man !
All of a sudden in the night , it must have been quite late in the night , I wakes up , next to the bed , there 's the examining judge shading the lamp with his hand so that there 's no light from it falls on my husband , he did n't need to be as careful as that , the way my husband sleeps the light would n't have *woken* him *up* anyway .
She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K. 's as if she wanted to *calm* him *down* , and whispered , `` Be quiet , Berthold is watching us . ''
`` So that 's it , '' said the student , `` oh no , you 're not going to get her , '' and with a strength you would not have expected from him , he glanced tenderly at her , *lifted* her *up* on one arm and , his back bent under the weight , ran with her to the door .
What a position it was that K. *found* himself *in* , compared with the judge sitting up in the attic ! K. , at the bank , had a big office with an ante-room , and had an enormous window through which he could look down at the activity in the square .
The student has *carried* her *off* to the examining judge . "
It 's Sunday today , and it 's not part of my job to do any work today , but they *send* me *off* with some message which is n't even necessary just to get me away from here .
What they do is they *send* me *off* not too far away so that I can still hope to get back on time if I really hurry .
`` Nothing that I know of , '' said the usher . `` And it 's going to get even worse now , up till now he 's only been *carrying* her *off* for himself , now he 's started *carrying* her *off* for the judge and all , just like I 'd always said he would . ''
Then he looked at K. trustingly which , despite all his friendliness , he had not done until then , and added , `` they 're always rebelling . '' But the conversation seemed to have become a little uncomfortable for him , as he *broke* it *off* by saying , " now I have to report to the office .
Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and , in order to *calm* him *down* and raise his spirits , said , " The gentleman here 's only asking what it is you 're waiting for .
The usher of the court said a few words to try and *calm* him *down* but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself , saluted , and hurried on , walking with very short steps , probably because of gout .
He has an answer for every question , you can *try* him *out* if you feel like it .
It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at once , and to get a foretaste of freedom he *stepped* straight *on* to one of the stairs and took his leave there of his companions , who bowed to him .
`` We 're not *clearing* anything *out* , Mr. K. , '' she said , `` it 's just that Miss Montag is moving in with Miss Bürstner and is moving her things across . ''
Then he looked up at her and said , `` What about the suspicions you had earlier about Miss Bürstner , have you *given* them *up* ? ''
`` Mr. K. , '' called Mrs. Grubach , who had been waiting for this very question , as she put her hands together and *held* them *out* towards him .
K. immediately sent the junior staff from the room and told them to *let* no-one *in* .
" Here it is . She writes ; ' I have not seen Josef for a long time , I was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not *let* me *through* ; I waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my piano lesson .
And that everyone you know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated , *disgraced* right *down* to the ground .
Fortunately , though , behind the girl , the invalid *raised* himself *up* , K. 's uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and then , somewhat calmer , said , " We have naturally not lost our senses , not yet ; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking for it .
Well , he came anyway , we were having a peaceful chat , as far as I was able when I 'm so weak , and although we had n't told Leni she must n't *let* anyone *in* as we were n't expecting anyone , we still would rather have remained alone , but then along came you , Albert , thumping your fists on the door , the office director moved over into the corner pulling his table and chair with him , but now it turns out we might have , that is , if that 's what you wish , we might have something to discuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back together again . - Office director ... , " he said with his head on one side , pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed .
`` I 'm afraid I 'll only be able to stay a few minutes more , '' smiled the office director as he *spread* himself *out* in the armchair and looked at the clock .
`` And what if I do n't confess , could you not help me then ? '' asked K. to *test* her *out* .
But now , his uncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer , he had to take account of his family ; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress of the trial , he himself had carelessly - with a certain , inexplicable complacency - mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about it in ways he did not know , his relationship with Miss Bürstner seemed to be in trouble because of it . In short , he no longer had any choice whether he would accept the trial or *turn* it *down* , he was in the middle of it and had to defend himself .
He had been capable of *working* himself *up* to his high position in the bank in a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone , now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that possible for him to the trial , and there was no doubt that it had to turn out well .
Instead , he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets , *spread* them *out* in front of K. , explained several items , corrected a little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced over it all , and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he 'd concluded with him about a year before , mentioning in passing that this time there was another bank spending great effort to get his business , and finally stopped speaking in order to learn K. 's opinion on the matter .
He need not have worried , the two gentlemen met each other , shook each other 's hand and *went* together *over* to K. 's desk .
And I 'm sure the chief clerk ... `` - even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the manufacturer - '' will be very glad to have us *take* it *off* his hands .
Did a carefully worked out defence - and any other sort would have made no sense - did a carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to *shut* himself *off* from everything else as much as he could ?
Was he supposed to *let* people *in* to see him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this ? While his trial trundled on , while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat looking at the papers for this trial , should he be worrying about the business of the bank ?
Only , one time these visits became a bit too frequent , I began to *tell* him *off* for it , we started talking and I became interested how it was that he could earn a living just by painting , and then I learned to my amazement that his main source of income was painting portraits . ' I work for the court , ' he said , ' what court ? ' said I. And that 's when he told me about the court .
On the third floor he had to slow down his pace , he was quite out of breath - the steps , just like the height of each floor , were much higher than they needed to be and he 'd been told that the painter *lived* right *up* in the attic .
The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm , but the painter chased after her , grabbed her by the skirt , span her once round and *set* her *down* again by the door with the other girls who , unlike the first , had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post .
So he drew the manufacturer 's letter out from his pocket , *held* it *out* to the painter and said , `` I learned about you from this gentleman , an acquaintance of yours , and it 's on his advice that I 've come here . ''
The painter glanced through the letter and *threw* it *down* onto the bed .
And of course , it always *wakes* me *up* when I hear the door opened beside the bed , however fast asleep I am .
What also happens , though , is that there are some judges who 'll *turn* me *down* in advance , and that 's worse .
The painter had leant back and *spread* himself *out* in his chair , his nightshirt was wide open , he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides .
K. did not want to be impolite , the painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the future , and because of K. 's forgetfulness there had been no mention of any payment for the painter 's help , so K. could not *turn* him *down* now and allowed him to show him the picture , even though he was quivering with impatience to get out of the studio .
From under the bed , the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings . They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to *blow* it *off* the one on top the dust swirled around in front of K. 's eyes , robbing him of breath for some time .
`` Josef , '' said Leni , looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes , `` you 're not going to be jealous of Mr. Block now , are you ? Rudi , '' she then said , turning to the businessman , `` *help* me *out* will you , I 'm being suspected of something , you can see that , leave the candle alone . ''
She *helped* him *off* with his coat , took the hat off his head , ran with the things into the hallway to *hang* them *up* , then she ran back and saw to the soup .
`` You 're a client of the lawyer 's too , are n't you , '' said the businessman quietly from his corner as if he were trying to *find* this *out* .
`` I ca n't tell you very much about that , '' said the businessman , " at first I tried to do that too but I soon had to *give* it *up* again .
It *wears* you *out* too much , and it 's really not much use .
I can *leave* it *up* to them less than when I had just the one .
K. could not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance would *win* him *over* .
K. listened to all of this , testing it and *thinking* it *over* as if he had been given the task of closely observing everything spoken here , inform a higher office about it and write a report .
Then at eight o 'clock I *let* him *out* and gave him something to eat . "
`` Block , '' said Leni , as if reprimanding him , and , taking hold of the collar of his coat , *pulled* him *up* slightly higher . `` Leave the carpet alone and listen to what the lawyer is saying . ''
It was an extremely irksome task , servitors brought him the mail , bank staff came with various queries and , when they saw that K. was busy , stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to them , the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and came in frequently , took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages , clearly for no purpose , when the door to the ante-room opened even clients would appear from the half darkness and bow timidly to him - they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had seen them - all this activity was circling around K. with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would need , then *looked* them *up* in the dictionary , then *wrote* them *out* , then practised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart .
As he was tired he wanted to sit down , he went back inside the cathedral , he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps , he moved it with his foot to a nearby pew , *wrapped* himself *up* tighter in his coat , put the collar up and sat down .
At the front pews he stopped , but to the priest he still seemed too far away , he reached out his hand and *pointed* sharply *down* with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit .
`` *Put* it *down* , '' said the priest .
The priest lowered his head down to the balustrade , only now did the roof over the pulpit seem to *press* him *down* .
But the doorkeeper says he ca n't *let* him *in* to the law right now .
The doorkeeper often questions him , asking about where he 's from and many other things , but these are disinterested questions such as great men ask , and he always ends up by telling him he still ca n't *let* him *in* .
The simple story had lost its shape , he wanted to *shake* it *off* , and the priest who now felt quite compassionate allowed this and accepted K. 's remarks without comment , even though his view was certainly very different from K. ' s .
`` Some ancient , unimportant actors - that 's what they 've sent for me , '' said K. to himself , and looked round once again to confirm this to himself . `` They want to *sort* me *out* as cheaply as they can . ''
The gentlemen did not need to make any answer , it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K. and tried to *move* him *on* , but K. resisted them .
Beneath them , now invisible , there were gravel paths with comfortable benches where K. had *stretched* himself *out* on many summer 's days .
The *went* on *up* through several streets where policemen were walking or standing here and there ; some in the distance and then some very close .
It was a simple matter to throw off the covers ; he only had to *blow* himself *up* a little and they fell off by themselves .
He would have used his arms and his hands to *push* himself *up* ; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions , and which he was moreover unable to control .
If he wanted to bend one of them , then that was the first one that would *stretch* itself *out* ; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg , all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully .
As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it , only holding himself upright with his mouth , and hung onto the key or *pushed* it *down* again with the whole weight of his body as needed .
Gregor 's mother , her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk 's being there , looked at his father . Then she unfolded her arms , took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that *spread* themselves *out* around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast .
The washing up from breakfast lay on the table ; there was so much of it because , for Gregor 's father , breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would *stretch* it *out* for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers .
His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper , *reading* it *out* in a loud voice to Gregor 's mother , and sometimes to his sister , but there was now not a sound to be heard .
However , his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise . She immediately *picked* it *up* - using a rag , not her bare hands - and *carried* it *out* .
Half suffocating , he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs , *mixing* them *in* with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more . She quickly dropped it all into a bin , closed it with its wooden lid , and *carried* everything *out* .
There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening , when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would *pull* it *up* again with a start , as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent .
If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was *take* it *off* again , as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to *cut* himself *off* so completely . She left the sheet where it was .
Gregor also refrained , this time , from spying out from under the sheet ; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come . `` You can come in , he ca n't be seen , '' said his sister , obviously *leading* her *in* by the hand .
She stood very still , remained there a moment , and then *went* back *out* to Grete .
Perhaps only because her mother was there , she remained calm , bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said , albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice : `` Come on , let 's go back in the living room for a while ? '' Gregor could see what Grete had in mind , she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then *chase* him *down* from the wall .
She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint ; Gregor wanted to help too - he could save his picture later , although he stuck fast to the glass and had to *pull* himself *off* by force ; then he , too , ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days ; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing ; she was looking into various bottles , he startled her when she turned round ; a bottle fell to the ground and broke ; a splinter cut Gregor 's face , some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him ; now , without delaying any longer , Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother ; she slammed the door shut with her foot .
Another one however , immediately following it , hit squarely and lodged in his back ; Gregor wanted to drag himself away , as if he could remove the surprising , the incredible pain by changing his position ; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and *spread* himself *out* , all his senses in confusion .
This is what peace I get in my old age ! " And supported by the two women he would *lift* himself *up* carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself , let the women take him to the door , *send* them *off* and carry on by himself while Gregor 's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him .
From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and *look* briefly *in* on him .
Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it , leave it there a few hours and then , more often than not , *spit* it *out* again .
The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity , or to *throw* everything *out* in one go , but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else . At first he moved it because , with no other room free where he could crawl about , he was forced to , but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that the way left him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards .
Gregor 's father staggered back to his seat , feeling his way with his hands , and fell into it ; it looked as if he was *stretching* himself *out* for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all .
For these reasons Louis the Twelfth , King of France , quickly occupied Milan , and as quickly lost it ; and to *turn* him *out* the first time it only needed Lodovico 's own forces ; because those who had opened the gates to him , finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit , would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince .
And having committed this prime error , he was obliged to *follow* it *up* , so much so that , to put an end to the ambition of Alexander , and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany , he was himself forced to come into Italy .
And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church , and deprived himself of friends , he , wishing to have the kingdom of Naples , divides it with the King of Spain , and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate , so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter ; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king , he *drove* him *out* , to put one there who was able to drive him , Louis , out in turn .
And as this point is worthy of notice , and to be imitated by others , I am not willing to *leave* it *out* .
But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others , he resolved , with the aid of some citizens of Fermo , to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty , and with the help of the Vitelleschi , to seize Fermo . So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that , having been away from home for many years , he wished to visit him and his city , and in some measure to look upon his patrimony ; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour , yet , in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain , he desired to come honourably , so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen , his friends and retainers ; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians , all of which would be not only to his honour , but also to that of Giovanni himself , who had *brought* him *up* .
They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war , but if war comes they *take* themselves *off* or run from the foe ; which I should have little trouble to prove , for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries , and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves , yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were .
These arms may be useful and good in themselves , but for him who *calls* them *in* they are always disadvantageous ; for losing , one is undone , and winning , one is their captive .
In conclusion , the arms of others either fall from your back , or they *weigh* you *down* , or they bind you fast .
But , it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it , it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it ; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen , because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live , that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done , sooner effects his ruin than his preservation ; for a man who wishes to *act* entirely *up* to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil .
Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality , yet he did not strive afterwards to *keep* it *up* , when he made war on the King of France ; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects , for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness .
This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers , who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse , who *brought* them *up* in his discipline ; which means solely that , as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man , so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures , and that one without the other is not durable .
Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France , and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king ; of these the first is the parliament and its authority , because he who founded the kingdom , knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness , considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to *hold* them *in* ; and , on the other side , knowing the hatred of the people , founded in fear , against the nobles , he wished to protect them , yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king ; therefore , to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people , and from the people for favouring the nobles , he set up an arbiter , who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king .
Afterwards he *sought* him *out* in France , and took from him his government and life .
But let us come to Commodus , to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire , for , being the son of Marcus , he had inherited it , and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers ; but , being by nature cruel and brutal , he *gave* himself *up* to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them , so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people ; on the other hand , not maintaining his dignity , often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators , and doing other vile things , little worthy of the imperial majesty , he fell into contempt with the soldiers , and being hated by one party and despised by the other , he was conspired against and was killed .
*Shaking* this *off* with a gasp and a struggle , I uplifted myself upon the pillows , and , peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber , hearkened - I know not why , except that an instinctive spirit prompted me - to certain low and indefinite sounds which came , through the pauses of the storm , at long intervals , I knew not whence .
By God 's grace you might *make* it *up* !
' I told you not to put passengers on the roof , ' the girl shouted in English . ' Now *pick* them *up* ! '
' Well , *ask* her *in* at once , ' said Oblonsky , his face wrinkling with vexation .
' Will you be home to dinner , sir ? ' said Matthew , as he *showed* him *out* .
Levin , at last ! ' he said , scrutinizing the approaching Levin with a friendly mocking smile . ' How is it you deign to *look* me *up* in this den ? ' he asked ; and not contented with pressing his friend 's hand , he kissed him .
Yet skaters appeared quite calmly to gain on her , to *catch* her *up* , and even speak to her , and quite independently of her to amuse themselves enjoying the excellent ice and the fine weather .
She was not very firm on her feet . Having drawn her hands from the muff that hung by a cord from her neck , she *held* them *out* and looking at Levin , whom she had recognized , she smiled at him and at her fears .
Having turned the corner , she pushed off with an elastic little foot , *glided* straight *up* to Shcherbatsky , and catching hold of him with her hand , nodded smilingly to Levin .
' You 've not *looked* us *up* for a long time , sir , ' said one of the attendants as , holding up Levin 's foot , he bored a hole in the heel of his boot . ' Since you left we have had no gentleman who is such a master at it as you !
The waiter , remembering Oblonsky 's way of calling the items on the French menu by their Russian names , did not repeat the words after him , but afterwards allowed himself the pleasure of repeating the whole of the order according to the menu : ' Potage printanier , turbot , sauce Beaumarchais , boeuf , poularde à l 'estragon , macédoine de fruits ... ' and immediately , as if moved by springs , he put down the bill of fare in one cardboard cover , and seizing another containing the wine-list *held* it *out* to Oblonsky .
' Why , of course , I always *write* them *down* .
But I 'll *draw* him *out* , I do love to make a fool of him when Kitty 's about , and I will . '
Do I *draw* them *on* ?
' And you 'll *find* it *out* , but too late , just as with poor Dolly . '
*Think* it *over* , Anna , help me !
' I 'm afraid you will be cold upstairs , ' remarked Dolly to Anna . ' I want to *move* you *down* , and then we shall be nearer to one another . '
' Goodness knows if they have quite *made* it *up* , ' thought Anna on hearing her tone , which was cold and calm .
And yet I , instead of *looking* him *up* , dined out and came here . ' Levin went up to a lamp-post and read his brother 's address which he had in his pocket-book , and then hired a sledge .
He recalled how despite the ridicule of his fellow-students his brother had lived like a monk while at the University and for a year after , strictly observing all the religious rites , attending service , fasting , avoiding all pleasures and especially women ; and then how he suddenly broke loose , became intimate with the vilest people and *gave* himself *up* to unbridled debauchery .
' Here , here , *put* it *down* here , ' he said crossly , and at once poured out a wineglass full of vodka and drank it greedily . ' Have a drink , will you ? ' he said to his brother , brightening up at once .
When he had settled in the arm-chair in the little drawing room where he always had his tea , and Agatha Mikhaylovna had *brought* it *in* for him and had sat down at the window with her usual remark , ' I will sit down sir ! ' he felt that , strange to say , he had not really forgotten his dreams and that he could not live without them .
He patted her a little , and she *curled* herself *up* at his feet with her head on her outstretched hind paw .
Completely to regain her composure , she went to the nursery and spent the evening with her son . She put him to bed herself , made the sign of the cross over him , and *tucked* him *up* .
When he rang the bell , while still outside , he heard men 's laughter , a woman 's lisping voice , and Petritsky shouting : ' If it is one of the villains , do n't *let* him *in* ! ' Vronsky told the servants not to announce his arrival , and softly entered the first room .
And your wife ? ' the Baroness said suddenly , interrupting Vronsky 's conversation with his comrade . ' We here have been *marrying* you *off* !
They wink at him , nod , frown , to make him *give* it *up* ...
`` Here , this is one of the new ones , '' says the Grand Duchess , *turning* it *over* , and - just fancy ! - out tumbles a pear and sweets - two pounds of them ! ... The dear fellow had collected them in his helmet ! '
' Oh ! I ca n't *make* anything *out* !
' I am going home now and shall have to *shut* myself *up* , and you wo n't be able to come to me , ' said Dolly , sitting down beside her sister . ' I want to talk to you . '
Mama takes me to a ball : and it seems to me she only takes me there to *marry* me *off* as quickly as possible and get rid of me .
Wenden himself , having returned from his office and hearing the front-door bell and voices , went out , saw the tipsy officers with the letter , and *hustled* them *out* .
She had scarcely time to go to her dressing-room , put powder on her long pale face and *rub* it *off* again , *smarten* herself *up* , and order tea to be served in the big drawing-room , before one carriage after another began to arrive at the door of her immense house on the Great Morskaya .
' I must think it over , come to a decision , and *throw* it *off* , ' he said aloud .
*Thinking* it *over* , he regretted having to spend his time and powers of mind on inconspicuous domestic affairs ; but nevertheless , clearly and definitely , as though it were an official report , the form and sequence of the speech he had to make shaped itself in his mind . ' I must make the following quite clear : First , the importance of public opinion and propriety ; secondly , the religious meaning of marriage ; thirdly , if necessary , I must refer to the harm that may result to our son ; fourthly , allude to her own unhappiness . '
While the horse was being saddled Levin again called the steward , who was hanging about within sight , in order to *make* it *up* with him , and began to talk about the spring work that lay before them and his plans for the estate .
He was not irritated either by the sight of a peasant 's horse and colt treading down the young growth ( he told a peasant he met to *drive* them *off* ) , nor by the jeering and stupid answer the peasant , Ipat , whom he happened to meet , gave him in reply to his question : ' Well , Ipat , will it soon be time to sow ? ' ' We must plough first , Constantine Dmitrich , ' said Ipat .
' Oh , but we *crumble* it *up* , ' said Vasily , taking a handful and rubbing the earth between his palms .
' Constantine , please leave word that if the dealer Ryabinin comes ( I told him to come here to-day ) they should *ask* him *in* and let him wait . '
' Because he and the other dealers are in league , and he has *bought* them *off* .
' I can do that , ' said Ryabinin , sitting down and putting his arm on the back of his chair in a most uncomfortable way . ' You must *let* me *off* something , Prince .
There was one question he wanted to put to Oblonsky , but could not bring himself to ask , nor could he find the form to *put* it *in* or the moment to ask it .
The orderly stood before him with vodka and pickled cucumbers on a tray . ' Yashvin here has ordered vodka to *freshen* me *up* . '
In her open box Frou-Frou stood ready saddled . They were just going to *lead* her *out* .
After crossing the brook Vronsky had the mare quite under control , and *held* her *in* , intending to cross the big barrier behind Makhotin and then to try and pass him on the flat 300 yards before the next obstacle .
He alighted first and *helped* her *out* .
Madame Stahl learnt afterwards that Varenka was not her daughter , but continued to *bring* her *up* , the more readily because it happened that very soon Varenka had no relations left .
Varenka did not seem at all abashed by the fact that strangers were present , and she *went* straight *up* to the piano .
With French exaggeration she at once began talking to him , admiring him for having such a delightful daughter , and in Kitty 's presence *praised* her *up* to the skies , calling her a treasure , a pearl , and a ministering angel .
' I do not know whether you will remember me , but I must recall myself to you in order to thank you for your kindness to my daughter , ' he said , raising his hat and not *putting* it *on* again .
Kitty took from the table a little box which held the corals , and with a proud look , without having *made* it *up* with her friend , went to where her mother was .
You have made an attempt , and because according to your judgment it was a failure , you *gave* it *up* .
All those Zemstvo institutions of ours , ' he said , again jumping off to a subject that had no bearing on the case in point , ' are like those little birches that are cut down for decorations at Whitsuntide , and we Russians *stick* them *up* to imitate the woods that have grown up naturally in Western Europe . I can not water these birches or believe in them from my soul . '
' Go on , go on ! ' said the old man , hurrying after him and easily *catching* him *up* . ' Take care , I 'll mow you down ! '
The old man stooped each time he came upon one , *picked* it *up* , and put it inside his jacket , saying , ' Another treat for my old woman . '
Levin followed , and often thought he would certainly fall when climbing a mound with his scythe in his hand - a mound so steep that it would have been hard to climb even unencumbered . Still , he managed to climb it and to do all that had to be done ; and he felt as if some external force were *urging* him *on* .
Previously Miss Hull used to find one and *point* it *out* to her ; but this time Lily herself found a fine big one and there was a general shout of delight : ' Lily has found a mushroom ! '
One of the young women was watching the governess , who was dressing after all the others , and seeing her put on a third petticoat could not refrain from remarking : ' Look at her ! She 's *wrapping* herself *up* and *wrapping* herself *up* , and has n't got enough round her yet ! ' and the women burst out laughing .
See them *picking* it *up* , like ducklings picking up the food you 've thrown to them ! ' he added , pointing to where the hay was being loaded on the carts . ' They 've carted a good half since dinner time ...
One of the women with a strange gruff voice started a song and sang it to the end , when fifty powerful voices , some gruff and others shrill , all at once *took* it *up* with a will .
How am I to do it ? ' he again asked himself . , and could find no reply . ' However , I have not slept all night and ca n't render a clear account of myself now , ' he thought , ' but I 'll *clear* it *up* later .
But since the gauntlet had been thrown down , he would *take* it *up* boldly and would demand the appointment of a special Committee to investigate and report upon the work of the Committee of Irrigation in the Zaraysk Province , but at the same time he would not yield an inch to those gentlemen who had raised the question .
Just as he was going away I wished to *call* him *back* and tell him , but changed my mind , because my not having done so at first would have appeared strange .
He despises that feeling of mine , but he knows that I will not give up my son , that I can not *give* him *up* , that without my son I can not live even with the man I love , - that if I forsook my son I should act like a horrid disreputable woman . He knows that and knows that I have not the power to do it . '
No , I shall *break* it *off* , *break* it *off* ! ' she exclaimed , jumping up and forcing back her tears .
And she went to the table to write him another note , though she knew in the depths of her soul that she would not have the strength to *break* anything *off* , nor to escape from her former position , however false and dishonest it might be .
And in spite of his ridiculous position as Lisa 's old admirer , you should see how he *carries* it *off* .
I shall be there at six . ' She closed it , and Betsy returning *sent* it *off* in her presence .
Every one , knowing intimately all the complexities of his own circumstances , involuntarily assumes that these complexities and the difficulty of *clearing* them *up* are peculiar to his own personal condition , and never thinks that others are surrounded by similar complexities .
He had made this proposal , but now , *thinking* it *over* , he saw clearly that it would be better to avoid that plan , and yet , while he told himself so , he feared that this might be wrong .
Having proposed it , I must be ready to *carry* it *out* - that is to say I must find the money and leave the army . '
I *found* that *out* when I married .
' We 'll talk it over another time . I will *look* you *up* in Petersburg . '
' For God 's sake *hear* me *out* ! ' he added , with an air of entreaty that she would let him explain his words . ' I am glad because I know that it is impossible , quite impossible for things to remain as they are , as he imagines . '
The English ploughs turned out useless , because it never entered the peasant 's head to lower the upturned ploughshare , and as he *forced* it *through* at the turning he spoiled the ground and strained the horses , and Levin was told not to worry ! The horses were allowed to stray into the wheat-field because not one of the peasants wanted to be watchman , and in spite of its having been forbidden the labourers took turns to watch the horses at night ; so Vanka ; who had been at work all day , fell asleep , and confessed his guilt , saying , ' I am in your hands , sir ! '
' There in the passage , ' answered the old man , winding the reins into a ring and throwing them on the ground . ' *Fix* them *on* before we finish dinner . '
' But we see you do n't *give* it *up* , ' said Nicholas Ivanich Sviyazhsky , ' so it seems it has its advantages . '
' But why ? If your farming is rational you can *carry* it *on* with hired labour , ' said Sviyazhsky .
By means of whose labour am I to *carry* it *on* ? '
She did not remember the exact figure , though the German had *calculated* it *down* to a quarter of a kopeck .
Involuntarily submitting to Anna 's weakness , who , ready in advance to accept anything , *gave* herself *up* to him entirely and expected him to decide her fate , he had long ceased to imagine that their union could end in the way he had then expected .
His ambitious plans had receded to the background , and feeling that he had come out of the range of activity in which everything was definite , he completely *gave* himself *up* to his passion , and that passion bound him closer and closer to her .
And I went into Dusseaux 's hotel yesterday and saw `` Karenin '' on the board , and it never entered my head that it could be you ! ' said Oblonsky , thrusting his head in at the carriage window , ' else I should have *looked* you *up* .
Later on he *took* it *off* and stayed for an hour , talking to Levin about bear-hunting and also about personal matters .
I consider my ideas very important , yet they too turn out to be insignificant - and would be , even if it were as possible to *carry* them *out* as it was to surround this bear .
' I 'm awfully glad I have *found* you *in* ! Well , I hope ... ' began Oblonsky , cheerfully .
Well , before doing so , see my wife and *talk* it *over* with her !
For heaven 's sake , *talk* it *over* with her !
Do come , and above all , do *talk* it *over* with her .
On entering the drawing-room Oblonsky made his excuses , explaining that he had been kept by the particular Prince who was his usual scapegoat whenever he was late or absent , and in a moment he had reintroduced everybody , and having brought Karenin and Koznyshev together , he *started* them *off* on the subject of the Russification of Poland , and they immediately caught on , Pestsov joining them .
Oblonsky took his arm and *led* him *up* to Karenin .
' The guard ( regardless of the proverb ) [ The proverb is : ' At meeting you 're judged by your clothes , At parting you 're judged by your wits . ' ] judged me by my clothes and wished to *turn* me *out* , but I began to use long words and ... you too , ' he went on turning to Karenin ( whose Christian name and patronymic he had forgotten ) , ' judging me by my peasant coat were going to *turn* me *out* , but afterwards you took my part , for which I am very grateful . '
What will become of her if you *throw* her *off* ? '
Will they really *let* me *in* to the meeting ? '
It all happened at the same time ; one of the boys ran after a pigeon and *looked* smilingly *up* at Levin ; the pigeon flapped its wings and fluttered up , glittering in the sunshine amid the snow-dust that trembled in the air ; from the window came the scent of fresh-baked bread and the loaves were put out .
' *Are* they *up* ? '
' Whom shall I *announce* you *to* ? ' asked the footman .
As he entered the hall Karenin dragged forth his resolve as it were from a remote corner of his brain , and *conned* it *over* . It said :
I feel that I am *flying* headlong *over* some precipice but must not even try to save myself .
Only I hope you will not go *letting* it *off* accidentally any more , ' said she with an inquiring smile .
That now , having atoned for his guilt toward her husband , he would be obliged to *give* her *up* and never place himself between her with her remorse and her husband , was clear to his mind ; but he could not eradicate from his heart a regret for the loss of her love - could not efface from his memory the moments of happiness he had known with her , moments he had valued so lightly , but the image of which with all their charm pursued him still .
THE PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKAYA AT FIRST *CONSIDERED* it *out* of the question to have the wedding before Advent , to which there remained but five weeks , but could not help agreeing with Levin that to *put* it *off* until after the Fast might involve waiting too long , for Prince Shcherbatsky 's old aunt was very ill and likely to die soon , and then the family would be in mourning and the wedding would have to be considerably deferred .
Katavasov , feeling that his originality was observed and appreciated , *showed* it *off* .
For a long time Levin could not be made to understand what he had to do , and they were a long while trying to set him right . Just as they were going to *give* it *up* because he would either use the wrong hand or else take her by the wrong one , he at last comprehended that he with his right hand , without changing his position , must take her by her right hand .
He looked wearily and sadly at the bride and bridegroom , sighed , and disengaging his right hand from the vestments , *held* it *up* in blessing over the bridegroom , and then over the bride ; only in his manner when he placed his fingers on Kitty 's bowed head there was a shade of tenderness .
' *Put* it *on* , ' she whispered , smiling .
Golenishchev *pulled* himself *up* and unwillingly agreed , but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage .
Having *made* it *up* with his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar , and a hat , and went to the studio .
He did not even like looking at it , and had only *brought* it *out* because he was expecting an Englishman who wished to buy it .
How well he has *hit* it *off* , and how simply !
They *made* it *up* .
But when he took her face in his hands and said ' Kitty ! ' she suddenly recovered , cried a little , and then they *made* it *up* .
' Now *turn* me *over* on the left side and go to bed , ' he murmured .
*Turn* him *over* . It is unpleasant to call the servants , and I can not do it .
' It would have been so painful for you alone , ' she said , and raising her arms high so that they hid her cheeks , now flushed with pleasure , she twisted her braided hair and *pinned* it *up* at the back of her head . ' No , ' she continued , ' she did not know how to ...
And Levin noticed that all day long the sick man really kept catching at himself as if wishing to *pull* something *off* .
Their uncle , Karenin , a high official and at one time a favourite with the late Emperor , *brought* them *up* .
As soon as the secretary left , I announced him , ' answered the hall-porter with a wink . ' Let me *take* it *off* for you . '
' Serezha ! ' said his tutor , a Slav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' *take* it *off* yourself . '
' Korney has *taken* it *in* to your Papa .
' You know how fond I am of you , Alexis , ' she replied when she had *heard* him *out* , ' and how ready I am to do anything for you ; but I have kept silent because I knew I could be of no use to you and Anna Arkadyevna . ' She pronounced the formal ' Anna Arkadyevna ' with peculiar precision .
She would have ready in her hand some money to give to the hall-porter and the footman , in order that they should *let* her *in* . Without raising her veil she would say she had been sent by Serezha 's godfather to wish him many happy returns of the day and that she was to put the toys by his bedside .
' Would you like to wait ? ' said Kapitonich , *helping* her *off* with her cloak .
' *Let* me *in* , *let* me *in* ! ' she cried , and entered at the big door .
Korney , the valet , went down into the hall-porter 's room to inquire who had *let* her *in* , and hearing that it was Kapitonich who had done so , he reprimanded the old man .
' Yes , I daresay you would not have *let* her *in* !
' He 's *let* her *in* without telling anybody ; and Alexis Alexandrovich will be ready in a minute and will go to the nursery . '
The Italian nurse , having smartened up the baby girl , came in and *held* her *out* to Anna .
If I know it , then I know what I shall do , ' she told herself , powerless to imagine the position she would *find* herself *in* when she was convinced of his indifference .
I shall *catch* you *up* in a minute ! ' he shouted to Yashvin .
Send a waiter to *clear* it *up* , and get out my dress suit ! '
' I will do it , ' said Dolly , and she got up and began carefully sliding the spoon over the surface of the bubbling syrup , and now and then , to remove what had stuck to the spoon , she tapped it against a plate already covered with the yellowish pink scum , with blood-red streaks of syrup showing beneath it . ' How they 'll *lick* it *up* at tea-time ! ' she thought of the children , remembering how she herself , when a child , used to marvel that the grown-ups did not eat the scum - the nicest part .
*Boil* it *up* a little longer , Agatha Mikhaylovna . '
' No , excuse me ! ' her mother continued . ' And then you yourself would not let me *talk* it *over* with Vronsky .
' Well , Agatha Mikhaylovna , is the jam done ? ' asked Levin , smiling at her and wishing to *cheer* her *up* . ' Has it turned out well the new way ? '
The first to appear was Vasenka Veslovsky in new boots *reaching* half-way *up* his fat thighs , his green blouse girdled with a new cartridge-belt smelling of leather , and on his head the Scotch bonnet with the ribbons . He carried a new English gun without a sling .
' *Let* them *out* with the flock , ' he said , turning to the herdsman who was waiting for orders about some young sheep . ' Sorry !
But when heated with the work , and seeing Veslovsky pulling at the splashboard so strenuously and zealously that he actually *wrenched* it *off* , Levin reproached himself with being influenced by his sentiments of the previous day and with treating Veslovsky too coldly , and he tried to efface his unfriendliness by particular courtesy .
The other unpleasantness , which for a moment upset his good-humour , but about which he afterwards laughed heartily , was that of all the provisions that Kitty had provided so lavishly that it had appeared impossible to *eat* them *up* in a week , nothing was left !
' Masha has *worn* me *out* .
I will *turn* him *out* , ' said Levin .
Vasenka *drew* himself *up* .
Well , supposing the best : that none of the other children die , and that I somehow succeed in *bringing* them *up* ; at the very best they will only escape being ne 'er-do-wells . That is all I can hope for .
She had a small travelling looking-glass in her bag , and felt inclined to *take* it *out* ; but glancing at the backs of the coachman and the clerk who sat swaying beside him , she knew she would feel ashamed if one of them chanced to look round , and she did not *take* it *out* .
The breeze , which they had felt while driving , died down when they stopped ; and horseflies settled on the sweating horses , which angrily tried to *brush* them *off* .
' We have come a long way , ' replied the coachman , *climbing* back *on* to the box . ' And you say it 's not far ?
' There , you see , when you 've turned to the left you 'll *knock* straight *up* against it , ' said the peasant , evidently unwilling to let them go , and wishing to talk .
Anna , turning her eyes away from her friend and *screwing* them *up* ( this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dolly ) , grew thoughtful , trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark .
Mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien ! [ But I shall not *let* you *off* anything ! ]
Dolly was somewhat embarrassed and troubled by the quite novel circle she *found* herself *in* .
' It is not like having to do with the Local Authorities , ' said he . ' Where they would scribble over a whole ream of paper , I merely report to the Count ; we *talk* it *over* , and three words settle the matter . '
Her partner Tushkevich also *gave* it *up* , but the rest played for a long time .
He *threw* her *over* and took another .
She rose , *drew* herself *up* , sighed deeply , and with her light steps began pacing up and down the room , pausing occasionally . ' I not consider it ?
She bent her head and , *trembling* all *over* with emotion , looked from under her brows with moist , glittering eyes at the thin , piteous-looking little Dolly in her patched dressing-jacket and night-cap .
He waited for the venomous nobleman to conclude , and then said he considered the proper course would be to consult the wording of the Act and requested the Secretary to *look* it *up* .
You know , if we had to make a garden in front of our house , we should *plan* it *out* , and if a century-old tree is growing on that spot - though it may be rugged and old , yet you wo n't *cut* it *down* for the sake of a flower-bed , but will plan your beds so as to make use of the old tree !
He dictated it aloud , saying , ' I must *cheer* them *up* ! ' But Dolly , on receiving the telegram , only sighed over the rouble it had cost , and understood that it had been sent toward the end of a dinner .
Toward the evening of that day , being alone , Anna felt such terror on Vronsky 's account that she decided to go to town , but after careful consideration she wrote that contradictory letter which Vronsky received , and without *reading* it *over* she sent it by express messenger .
' Let 's *talk* it *over* , it bothers me . I do n't think I spend on anything superfluous , and yet the money simply flies away !
' They do ; please walk in , ' said the hall-porter , determinedly *helping* him *off* with his overcoat .
' No ! I believe Anna is *bringing* her *up* splendidly , but one does not hear about her .
Glancing in the mirror , Levin saw that he was red in the face , but he was sure he was not tipsy , and he *followed* Oblonsky *up* the carpeted stairs .
The horse was not yet ready , but feeling particularly energetic , physically strong and alert to meet what lay before him , so as not to lose a moment he did not wait for it but started off on foot , telling Kuzma to *catch* him *up* .
The dispenser asked in German whether he might sell it and receiving permission from some one behind a screen took out a bottle and a funnel , slowly poured it from a large bottle into a small one , stuck on a label , and in spite of Levin 's request that he should not do so sealed up the bottle , and was about to *wrap* it *up* .
But seeing her meek smiling face and hearing her say , ' I have *worn* you *out* , ' he blamed God ; but the thought of God made him at once pray for forgiveness and mercy .
When the baby had been swaddled and made into a firm doll , Mary Vlasevna *turned* it *over* as if proud of her work , and stepped aside that Levin might see his son in all his beauty .
He did not give me an answer , but said he must *think* it *over* ; and this morning instead of an answer I have received an invitation for this evening to go to the Countess Lydia Ivanovna 's . '
All the same , I think I have not done anything to *shock* them *up* till now .
He went up to the Frenchman and placed his hand in his . Oblonsky also rose and , opening his eyes wide to *wake* himself *up* in case he was asleep , looked first at one and then at the other .
To-day he had been away from home all day , and she had felt so lonely , and it was so painful to feel herself at discord with him , that she wished to forget it all , to forgive and *make* it *up* with him . Wishing even to blame herself and to justify him , she said to herself :
I will *make* it *up* with him and we will go back to the country . There I shall be calmer . '
' Is it possible that I ca n't ... ? Is it possible that I ca n't *take* it *on* myself ? ' she wondered , and began again from the beginning .
Thoughts of where she would now go : to the aunt who had *brought* her *up* , to Dolly , or simply abroad by herself ; of what he was now doing , alone in the study ; of whether this quarrel was final or whether a reconciliation was still possible ; of what all her former Petersburg acquaintances would say of her now ; how Karenin would regard it ; and many other thoughts about what would happen now after the rupture , passed through her mind , but she did not *give* herself *up* entirely to these thoughts .
Come home . We must *talk* it *over* .
She *stuck* it *down* and gave it to the man . Then , afraid to remain alone now , she followed him out of the room and went to the nursery .
' But how could he go away leaving me in this condition ? How can he go on living , without having *made* it *up* with me ? '
We can not *tear* it *out* but we can hide the memory of it . And I will hide it ! '
' Yes , but to-day there is something peculiar about her , ' said Dolly . ' When I was *seeing* her *out* , there in the ante-room , I thought she was going to cry . '
For me everything centres in him , and I demand that he should *give* himself *up* to me more and more completely .
She wished to rise , to throw herself back , but something huge and relentless struck her on the head and *dragged* her *down* . ' God forgive me everything ! ' she said , feeling the impossibility of struggling ...
' You too have come to *see* them *off* ? ' she asked in French .
And do you always come to *see* them *off* ? ' he asked with a slight smile .
Only his mother is *seeing* him *off* .
He wrote an answer and *sent* it *off* .
But my poor son had *given* himself *up* to her entirely .
' But why should he *let* anyone *off* ? '
' Yes , I must *clear* it *up* and understand it , ' he thought , gazing intently at the untrodden grass before him , and following the movements of a green insect that was crawling up a stalk of couch grass and was hindered in its ascent by a leaf of goutwort .
Tightly holding in the good horse , who snorted impatiently and pulled at the reins , Levin kept turning to glance at Ivan , who sat beside him not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hands and continually pushing down his shirt as the wind *blew* it *out* . Levin tried to think of some pretext for beginning a conversation with him .
But she would not have been able to discern its expression had not a flash of lightning that effaced the stars *lit* it *up* .
No answer . The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room ; then she *put* them *up* and looked out under them .
He ' pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up , and he knows if he can make out to *put* me *off* for a minute or make me laugh , it 's all down again and I ca n't hit him a lick .
Every time I *let* him *off* , my conscience does hurt me so , and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks .
Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man 's are to a man , but because a new and powerful interest *bore* them *down* and drove them out of his mind for the time -- just as men 's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises .
I dare you to *knock* it *off* -- and anybody that 'll take a dare will suck eggs . "
`` You 're a fighting liar and das n't *take* it *up* . ''
At last the stranger got out a smothered `` ' Nuff ! '' and Tom *let* him *up* and said :
*Come* -- *out* with your spring-line -- what 're you about there !
He *got* it *out* , rumpled and wilted , and it mightily increased his dismal felicity .
This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and *set* it *up* in new and varied lights , till he wore it threadbare .
And thus he would *die* -- *out* in the cold world , with no shelter over his homeless head , no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow , no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came .
Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap , and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there ; then he dipped the soap in the water and *laid* it *down* ; turned up his sleeves ; poured out the water on the ground , gently , and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door .
The girl `` put him to rights '' after he had dressed himself ; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin , turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders , *brushed* him *off* and crowned him with his speckled straw hat .
He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes , but the hope was blighted ; she coated them thoroughly with tallow , as was the custom , and *brought* them *out* .
The boy stammered , gasped , and *got* it *out* :
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and *got* it *out* .
He had but one marring thought ; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug , but he did not think it was upright in him to *carry* it *off* .
This was lucky ; he was about to begin to groan , as a `` starter , '' as he called it , when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument , his aunt would *pull* it *out* , and that would hurt .
So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and *held* it *up* for inspection .
He took a rest and then *swelled* himself *up* and fetched a succession of admirable groans .
Sid yawned , stretched , then *brought* himself *up* on his elbow with a snort , and began to stare at Tom .
Tom said : " Oh , please , auntie , do n't *pull* it *out* .
So at last , with a sigh and a yawn , he *gave* it *up* .
So he put Joe 's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom . `` Now , '' said he , `` as long as he is on your side you can *stir* him *up* and I 'll let him alone ; but if you let him get away and get on my side , you 're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over . ''
`` All right , go ahead ; *start* him *up* . ''
The tick tried this , that , and the other course , and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves , but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp , so to speak , and Tom 's fingers would be twitching to begin , Joe 's pin would deftly *head* him *off* , and keep possession .
`` Tom , you let him alone . '' `` I only just want to *stir* him *up* a little , Joe . ''
He *took* it *up* and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles .
He *laid* himself *down* and put his mouth close to this depression and called --
Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent , and within another minute or two the men had *hoisted* it *out* on the ground .
Tom 's heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession , not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else , but because an awful , unaccountable fascination *drew* him *on* .
She had him out at daylight every morning , *stood* him *up* in the wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water ; then she *scrubbed* him *down* with a towel like a file , and so brought him to ; then she *rolled* him *up* in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and `` the yellow stains of it came through his pores '' -- as Tom said .
She calculated his capacity as she would a jug 's , and *filled* him *up* every day with quack cure-alls .
Aunt Polly took it , *held* it *up* .
Because if he 'd had one she 'd a *burnt* him *out* herself !
He *gathered* himself *up* and sneaked off , crushed and crestfallen .
But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom , and had come to *hunt* him *up* for that purpose .
Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and *let* himself *down* after it , tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort .
The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon , and had about *worn* himself *out* with getting it there .
When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone , and the last allowance of corn pone devoured , the boys *stretched* themselves *out* on the grass , filled with contentment .
They tried to *argue* it *away* by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times ; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities ; it seemed to them , in the end , that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only `` hooking , '' while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing -- and there was a command against that in the Bible .
They were too hungry to stop to fish , but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham , and then *threw* themselves *down* in the shade to talk .
`` Oh , it ai n't the bread , so much , '' said Tom ; `` I reckon it 's mostly what they _ say _ over it before they *start* it *out* . ''
But when the shadows of night *closed* them *in* , they gradually ceased to talk , and sat gazing into the fire , with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere .
However , he reached the shore finally , and drifted along till he found a low place and *drew* himself *out* .
He *laid* himself *down* under the thwarts and waited , panting .
`` It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment , and up to every kind of mischief , but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be -- and laws bless me , to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream , never once recollecting that I *throwed* it *out* myself because it was sour , and I never to see him again in this world , never , never , never , poor abused boy ! ''
God 'll take care of _ him _ -- never you trouble _ your _ self , sir ! Oh , Mrs. Harper , I do n't know how to *give* him *up* !
I do n't know how to *give* him *up* ! He was such a comfort to me , although he tormented my old heart out of me , ' most . "
When they were well exhausted , they would run out and sprawl on the dry , hot sand , and lie there and *cover* themselves *up* with it , and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more .
Tom found himself writing `` BECKY '' in the sand with his big toe ; he *scratched* it *out* , and was angry with himself for his weakness .
He had a secret which he was not ready to tell , yet , but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon , he would have to *bring* it *out* .
Finally he said : " Oh , boys , let 's *give* it *up* .
Now you *think* it *over* .
Now they *stretched* themselves *out* on their elbows and began to puff , charily , and with slender confidence .
The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces , *burn* it *up* , drown it to the treetops , blow it away , and deafen every creature in it , all at one and the same moment .
They had no heart in their sports , and gradually *gave* them *up* .
This thought *broke* her *down* , and she wandered away , with tears rolling down her cheeks .
`` *Go* _ *on* _ , Tom ! ''
`` And you *shut* him *up* sharp . '' " I lay I did !
I 'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I 've got you back , that 's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word , though goodness knows I 'm unworthy of it , but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places , there 's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes . Go ' long Sid , Mary , Tom -- *take* yourselves *off* -- you 've hendered me long enough . "
It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him ; and so , instead of winning him , it only `` *set* him *up* '' the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about .
You just wait till I *catch* you *out* !
Tom conned the thing a moment longer , and then added : `` All right , though ; she 'd like to see me in just such a fix -- let her *sweat* it *out* ! ''
By and by , Mr. Dobbins *straightened* himself *up* , yawned , then unlocked his desk , and reached for his book , but seemed undecided whether to *take* it *out* or leave it .
Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while , then *took* it *out* and settled himself in his chair to read !
Fourth of July was coming ; but he soon *gave* that *up* -- *gave* it *up* before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours -- and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer , justice of the peace , who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral , since he was so high an official .
" My ! we could n't *get* him *out* , Tom .
They arrived hot and panting , and *threw* themselves *down* in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke .
Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I did n't hurry up , and I tell you he 'd *clean* it *out* pretty quick .
But wo n't the widow *take* it *away* from us , Tom ?
The boys gazed awhile , half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window ; then talking in a low tone , as befitted the time and the circumstances , they *struck* far *off* to the right , to give the haunted house a wide berth , and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill .
They had a smoke and a chat in the shade , and then dug a little in their last hole , not with great hope , but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it , and then somebody else had come along and *turned* it *up* with a single thrust of a shovel .
Injun Joe sat up , stared around -- smiled grimly upon his comrade , whose head was drooping upon his knees -- *stirred* him *up* with his foot and said :
He reached his hand in and *drew* it *out* --
But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of *thinking* them *over* , and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream , after all .
`` Well , so 'd I ; but I 'd like to see him , anyway -- and *track* him *out* -- to his Number Two . ''
There was not much to take away , for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls , and his heart would soon *wear* itself *out* , the way it was beating .
And why should he *give* it *up* , he reasoned -- the signal did not come the night before , so why should it be any more likely to come tonight ?
Why not *give* it *up* and turn in ?
Better *give* it *up* . "
" *Give* it *up* , and I just leaving this country forever !
*Give* it *up* and maybe never have another chance .
But I 'll *take* it *out* of _ her _ . "
" *Let* me *in* -- quick !
`` Huckleberry Finn -- quick , *let* me *in* ! '' " Huckleberry Finn , indeed !
`` Please *let* me *in* ! It 's only Huck Finn ! ''
Rest and sleep will *fetch* you *out* all right , I hope . "
Those fellows war n't likely to come again -- they had n't any tools left to work with , and what was the use of *waking* you *up* and scaring you to death ?
That 's the Lord 's mark . He do n't *leave* it *off* .
By-and-by Tom took Becky 's candle and *blew* it *out* .
Tin pans and horns were added to the din , the population massed itself and moved toward the river , met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens , thronged around it , joined its homeward march , and *swept* magnificently *up* the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah !
He described how he labored with her and convinced her ; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight ; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then *helped* her *out* ; how they sat there and cried for gladness ; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition ; how the men did n't believe the wild tale at first , `` because , '' said they , `` you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in '' -- then took them aboard , rowed to a house , gave them supper , made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home . Before day-dawn , Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out , in the cave , by the twine clews they had strung behind them , and informed of the great news .
The prisoner had *searched* them *out* and eaten them .
Will you go in there with me and help *get* it *out* ? "
If you *drove* them *out* they 'd turn right around and come back . It 's so in all the books . "
Let 's *snake* it *out* . Lem me see if I can lift the box . "
The money was soon in the bags and the boys *took* it *up* to the cross rock .
Mr. Jones said : `` Tom was n't at home , yet , so I *gave* him *up* ; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door , and so I just brought them along in a hurry . ''
He had to eat with a knife and fork ; he had to use napkin , cup , and plate ; he had to learn his book , he had to go to church ; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth ; whithersoever he turned , the bars and shackles of civilization *shut* him *in* and bound him hand and foot .
Tom *routed* him *out* , told him the trouble he had been causing , and urged him to go home .
Huck 's joy was quenched . " Ca n't *let* me *in* , Tom ?
You would n't *shet* me *out* , would you , Tom ?
`` Do n't *take* them *off* , '' I cried ; `` I will not stir . ''
Bessie answered not ; but ere long , addressing me , she said -- `` You ought to be aware , Miss , that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed : she keeps you : if she were to *turn* you *off* , you would have to go to the poorhouse . ''
`` *Take* me *out* ! Let me go into the nursery ! '' was my cry .
Ere long , I became aware that some one was handling me ; *lifting* me *up* and supporting me in a sitting posture , and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before .
Then he *laid* me *down* , and addressing Bessie , charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night .
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night , if they can help it ; and it was cruel to *shut* me *up* alone without a candle , -- so cruel that I think I shall never forget it . "
`` But John Reed *knocked* me *down* , and my aunt *shut* me *up* in the red-room . ''
On that same occasion I learned , for the first time , from Miss Abbot 's communications to Bessie , that my father had been a poor clergyman ; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends , who considered the match beneath her ; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience , he *cut* her *off* without a shilling ; that after my mother and father had been married a year , the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated , and where that disease was then prevalent : that my mother took the infection from him , and both died within a month of each other .
`` My Uncle Reed is in heaven , and can see all you do and think ; and so can papa and mama : they know how you *shut* me *up* all day long , and how you wish me dead . ''
But Bessie , as soon as she had dressed her young ladies , used to *take* herself *off* to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper 's room , generally bearing the candle along with her .
I shall remember how you thrust me back -- roughly and violently thrust me back -- into the red-room , and *locked* me *up* there , to my dying day ; though I was in agony ; though I cried out , while suffocating with distress ,
Have mercy , Aunt Reed ! ' And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me -- *knocked* me *down* for nothing .
I asked of myself . " Were I in her place , it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and *swallow* me *up* .
`` Burns '' ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys are elsewhere ) , `` Burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately . '' `` Burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; *draw* it *in* . ''
And in five minutes more she *shut* it *up* .
I suspected she might be right and I wrong ; but I would not ponder the matter deeply ; like Felix , I *put* it *off* to a more convenient season .
We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall *put* them *off* in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , -- the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man -- perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph !
And I was placed there , by whom I do n't know : I was in no condition to note particulars ; I was only aware that they had *hoisted* me *up* to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst 's nose , that he was within a yard of me , and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me .
" You see she is yet young ; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood ; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us ; no signal deformity *points* her *out* as a marked character .
You must be on your guard against her ; you must shun her example ; if necessary , avoid her company , exclude her from your sports , and *shut* her *out* from your converse .
What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me ! How the new feeling *bore* me *up* !
Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm `` the untidy badge ; '' scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in *copying* it *out* .
The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school , I ran to Helen , *tore* it *off* , and thrust it into the fire : the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day , and tears , hot and large , had continually been scalding my cheek ; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart .
I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as I loved , *urged* me *on* : I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me .
Tell me everything about them , Bessie : but sit down first ; and , Bobby , come and sit on my knee , will you ? " but Bobby *preferred* sidling *over* to his mother .
She went up to London last winter with her mama , and there everybody admired her , and a young lord fell in love with her : but his relations were against the match ; and -- what do you think ? -- he and Miss Georgiana *made* it *up* to run away ; but they were found out and stopped .
It was Miss Reed that *found* them *out* : I believe she was envious ; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together ; they are always quarrelling -- "
He hoisted it on to the vehicle , which was a sort of car , and then I got in ; before he *shut* me *up* , I asked him how far it was to Thornfield .
There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character , or observing and describing salient points , either in persons or things : the good lady evidently belonged to this class ; my queries puzzled , but did not *draw* her *out* .
`` You live just below -- do you mean at that house with the battlements ? '' pointing to Thornfield Hall , on which the moon cast a hoary gleam , *bringing* it *out* distinct and pale from the woods that , by contrast with the western sky , now seemed one mass of shadow .
`` *Take* them *off* to the other table , Mrs. Fairfax , '' said he , `` and look at them with Adele ; -- you '' ( glancing at me ) " resume your seat , and answer my questions .
Adele is a degree better , but still far below the mark ; Mrs. Fairfax ditto ; you , I am persuaded , can suit me if you will : you puzzled me the first evening I *invited* you *down* here .
It would please me now to *draw* you *out* -- to learn more of you -- therefore speak . "
Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me , I *found* her *out* ; but it was a warm night , and I was tired with strolling through Paris , so I sat down in her boudoir ; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence .
I *heaved* them *up* , deluged the bed and its occupant , flew back to my own room , brought my own water-jug , baptized the couch afresh , and , by God 's aid , succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it .
He took it from my hand , *held* it *up* , and surveyed the bed , all blackened and scorched , the sheets drenched , the carpet round swimming in water .
No ; what the deuce would you *call* her *for* ?
I looked at Adele , whose head leant against my shoulder ; her eyes were waxing heavy , so I *took* her *up* in my arms and *carried* her *off* to bed .
`` Then , what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that ? '' ( pointing to Adele ) . `` Where did you *pick* her *up* ? ''
`` Then no more need be said : change the subject . '' Amy Eshton , not hearing or not heeding this dictum , joined in with her soft , infantine tone : " Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too ; but she was such a good creature , she would bear anything : nothing *put* her *out* .
`` How provoking ! '' exclaimed Miss Ingram : `` you tiresome monkey ! '' ( apostrophising Adele ) , `` who *perched* you *up* in the window to give false intelligence ? '' and she cast on me an angry glance , as if I were in fault .
`` Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not *take* herself *off* , '' replied the magistrate .
`` Why , she 's a real sorceress ! '' cried Frederick Lynn . `` Let us *have* her *in* , of course . ''
`` Then you have some secret hope to *buoy* you *up* and please you with whispers of the future ? ''
It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand , and *take* it *up* : but whether you will do so , is the problem I study .
In short , I believe you have been trying to *draw* me *out* -- or in ; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense .
`` Go back now into the room ; *step* quietly *up* to Mason , and whisper in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him : show him in here and then leave me . '' `` Yes , sir . ''
`` But do n't *pull* me *down* or strangle me , '' he replied : for the Misses Eshton were clinging about him now ; and the two dowagers , in vast white wrappers , were bearing down on him like ships in full sail .
He took the sponge , *dipped* it *in* , and moistened the corpse-like face ; he asked for my smelling-bottle , and applied it to the nostrils .
The sun will soon rise , and I must *have* him *off* . "
`` Mason got the start of you all this morning ; he was gone before sunrise : I rose at four to *see* him *off* . ''
`` Why , you see , Miss Eyre , it is not a common mishap : his life has been very wild : these last three years he *gave* himself *up* to strange ways , and his death was shocking . ''
Robert Leaven resumed -- " Missis had been out of health herself for some time : she had got very stout , but was not strong with it ; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite *breaking* her *down* .
The young ladies *put* it *off* at first ; but their mother grew so restless , and said , ' Jane , Jane , ' so many times , that at last they consented .
`` None that would own me , sir . Mr. Reed is dead , and his wife *cast* me *off* . ''
I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will , perhaps , be dead before you reach her : besides , you say she *cast* you *off* . "
Turning restlessly , she drew the bedclothes round her ; my elbow , resting on a corner of the quilt , *fixed* it *down* : she was at once irritated .
I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house ; or *let* it *off* .
She had an alarm to *call* her *up* early . I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast , but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions , and each hour had its allotted task .
One day , however , as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery , she suddenly *took* her *up* thus --
You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents , I shall suffer you to *fasten* me *down* by even the feeblest claim : I can tell you this -- if the whole human race , ourselves excepted , were swept away , and we two stood alone on the earth , I would leave you in the old world , and betake myself to the new . "
One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to *bring* you *up* as my own child ; the other -- " she stopped .
As I *laid* her *down* -- for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank -- I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine : the feeble fingers shrank from my touch -- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze .
`` Yes ; I suppose you *found* that *out* by second-sight . ''
No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like ; it was full of trees , it bloomed with flowers : a very high wall *shut* it *out* from the court , on one side ; on the other , a beech avenue screened it from the lawn .
I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and *put* it *on* : it seemed no attire had ever so well become me , because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood .
He *handed* her *over* as if she had been a lapdog . `` I 'll send her to school yet , '' he said , but now he was smiling .
`` Fire rises out of the lunar mountains : when she is cold , I 'll *carry* her *up* to a peak , and *lay* her *down* on the edge of a crater . ''
I dangers dared ; I hindrance scorned ; I omens did defy : Whatever menaced , harassed , warned , I *passed* impetuous *by* .
Though haughty Hate should *strike* me *down* , Right , bar approach to me , And grinding Might , with furious frown , Swear endless enmity .
From less to more , I *worked* him *up* to considerable irritation ; then , after he had retired , in dudgeon , quite to the other end of the room , I got up , and saying , `` I wish you good-night , sir , '' in my natural and wonted respectful manner , I slipped out by the side-door and got away .
But presently she took my veil from its place ; she *held* it *up* , gazed at it long , and then she threw it over her own head , and turned to the mirror .
Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester -- his passion died as if a blight had *shrivelled* it *up* : he only asked -- `` What have _ you _ to say ? ''
Mrs. Poole advanced . `` Keep out of the way , '' said Mr. Rochester , *thrusting* her *aside* : `` she has no knife now , I suppose , and I 'm on my guard . ''
The house cleared , I *shut* myself *in* , fastened the bolt that none might intrude , and proceeded -- not to weep , not to mourn , I was yet too calm for that , but -- mechanically to take off the wedding dress , and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday , as I thought , for the last time .
Self-abandoned , relaxed , and effortless , I seemed to have *laid* me *down* in the dried-up bed of a great river ; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains , and felt the torrent come : to rise I had no will , to flee I had no strength .
I wrestled with my own resolution : I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me ; and Conscience , turned tyrant , held Passion by the throat , told her tauntingly , she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough , and swore that with that arm of iron he would *thrust* her *down* to unsounded depths of agony .
So you shun me ? -- you *shut* yourself *up* and grieve alone !
" Concealing the mad-woman 's neighbourhood from you , however , was something like covering a child with a cloak and *laying* it *down* near a upas-tree : that demon 's vicinage is poisoned , and always was .
I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to *set* her *up* in a good line of business , and so get decently rid of her .
I wondered what you thought of me , or if you ever thought of me , and resolved to *find* this *out* . " I resumed my notice of you .
`` Jane ! '' recommenced he , with a gentleness that *broke* me *down* with grief , and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror -- for this still voice was the pant of a lion rising -- `` Jane , do you mean to go one way in the world , and to let me go another ? ''
God must have *led* me *on* .
It is a summer evening ; the coachman has *set* me *down* at a place called Whitcross ; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given , and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world . The coach is a mile off by this time ; I am alone .
She shook her head , she `` was sorry she could give me no information , '' and the white door closed , quite gently and civilly : but it *shut* me *out* .
I approached it ; it was a road or a track : it *led* straight *up* to the light , which now beamed from a sort of knoll , amidst a clump of trees -- firs , apparently , from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom .
`` It is very well we *took* her *in* . ''
But she could remember Bill Oliver 's father a journeyman needlemaker ; and th ' Rivers wor gentry i ' th ' owd days o ' th ' Henrys , as onybody might see by looking into th ' registers i ' Morton Church vestry . `` Still , she allowed , '' the owd maister was like other folk -- *naught* mich *out* o ' t ' common way : stark mad o ' shooting , and farming , and sich like . "
Often , of an evening , when he sat at the window , his desk and papers before him , he would cease reading or writing , rest his chin on his hand , and *deliver* himself *up* to I know not what course of thought ; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye .
I know I am : but how did you *find* it *out* ? "
What he suddenly saw on this blank paper , it was impossible for me to tell ; but something had caught his eye . He *took* it *up* with a snatch ; he looked at the edge ; then shot a glance at me , inexpressibly peculiar , and quite incomprehensible : a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape , face , and dress ; for it traversed all , quick , keen as lightning .
How very easily alarmed you are ! " he answered , removing his cloak and *hanging* it *up* against the door , towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged .
`` One drift *took* me *up* to the waist ; happily the snow is quite soft yet . ''
A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to *find* her *out* .
`` You *give* it *up* very gleefully , '' said he ; `` I do n't quite understand your light-heartedness , because I can not tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing . What aim , what purpose , what ambition in life have you now ? ''
" My first aim will be to _ clean down _ ( do you comprehend the full force of the expression ? ) -- to _ clean down _ Moor House from chamber to cellar ; my next to *rub* it *up* with bees-wax , oil , and an indefinite number of cloths , till it glitters again ; my third , to arrange every chair , table , bed , carpet , with mathematical precision ; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room ; and lastly , the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs , sorting of currants , grating of spices , compounding of Christmas cakes , chopping up of materials for mince-pies , and solemnising of other culinary rites , as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you .
I am disposed to be as content as a queen , and you try to *stir* me *up* to restlessness !
`` You say truly ; but when found , it is right to *stir* them *up* -- to urge and exhort them to the effort -- to show them what their gifts are , and why they were given -- to speak Heaven 's message in their ear , -- to offer them , direct from God , a place in the ranks of His chosen . ''
`` Very willingly , '' he rejoined ; and rising , he strode a little distance up the pass , *threw* himself *down* on a swell of heath , and there lay still .
`` I see you and St. John have been quarrelling , Jane , '' said Diana , `` during your walk on the moor . But go after him ; he is now lingering in the passage expecting you -- he will *make* it *up* . ''
I would much rather he had *knocked* me *down* .
It is better , therefore , for the insignificant to keep out of his way , lest , in his progress , he should *trample* them *down* .
I can not *give* you *up* to perdition as a vessel of wrath : repent -- resolve , while there is yet time .
I *took* it *up* .
He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry , and *shut* himself *up* like a hermit at the Hall . "
`` My dear master , '' I answered , `` I am Jane Eyre : I have *found* you *out* -- I am come back to you . ''
I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his wife : an expectation , not the less certain because unexpressed , had *buoyed* me *up* , that he would claim me at once as his own .
After supper , he began to ask me many questions , of where I had been , what I had been doing , how I had *found* him *out* ; but I gave him only very partial replies : it was too late to enter into particulars that night .
Very early the next morning I *heard* him *up* and astir , wandering from one room to another .
Then : " Which room did you *put* her *into* ?
`` *Shake* me *off* , then , sir , -- push me away , for I 'll not leave you of my own accord . ''
( for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to *say* it *over* ) ' -- yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ? ' ( Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say . )
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for *shutting* people *up* like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( ' which certainly was not here before , ' said Alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' DRINK ME ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .
However , this bottle was not marked ' poison , ' so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon *finished* it *off* .
After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had *tired* herself *out* with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to *quiver* all *over* with fright . ' Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings .
Some of the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began *wrapping* itself *up* very carefully , remarking , ' I really must be getting home ; the night-air does n't suit my throat ! ' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , ' Come away , my dears ! It 's high time you were all in bed ! '
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her . ' Poor little thing ! ' said Alice , in a coaxing tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would be very likely to *eat* her *up* in spite of all her coaxing .
Hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and *held* it *out* to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , with a yelp of delight , and rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ; and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut .
She *stretched* herself *up* on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar 's making such very short remarks , and she *drew* herself *up* and said , very gravely , ' I think , you ought to tell me who you are , first . '
She had just succeeded in *curving* it *down* into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings .
' Whoever lives there , ' thought Alice , ' it 'll never do to come upon them this size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! ' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had *brought* herself *down* to nine inches high .
Alice *went* timidly *up* to the door , and knocked .
' There might be some sense in your knocking , ' the Footman went on without attending to her , ' if we had the door between us . For instance , if you were inside , you might knock , and I could *let* you *out* , you know . '
' Oh , please mind what you 're doing ! ' cried Alice , jumping up and down in an agony of terror . ' Oh , there goes his precious nose ' ; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it , and very nearly *carried* it *off* .
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it , and kept *doubling* itself *up* and *straightening* itself *out* again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it , ( which was to *twist* it *up* into a sort of knot , and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself , ) she *carried* it *out* into the open air . ' If I do n't take this child away with me , ' thought Alice , ' they 're sure to kill it in a day or two : would n't it be murder to leave it behind ? '
' Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well , ' the Hatter grumbled : ' you should n't have *put* it *in* with the bread-knife . '
' No , I *give* it *up* , ' Alice replied : ' what 's the answer ? '
Two began in a low voice , ' Why the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a red rose-tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to *find* it *out* , we should all have our heads cut off , you know .
The Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , *screamed* ' *Off* with her head ! Off -- '
The Queen turned angrily away from him , and said to the Knave ' *Turn* them *over* ! '
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live hedgehogs , the mallets live flamingoes , and the soldiers had to *double* themselves *up* and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .
She was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it a minute or two , she *made* it *out* to be a grin , and she said to herself ' It 's the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to . '
The executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to *cut* it *off* from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at his time of life .
' Everything 's got a moral , if only you can find it . ' And she *squeezed* herself *up* closer to Alice 's side as she spoke .
`` You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they *take* us *up* and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! '' But the snail replied `` Too far , too far ! '' and gave a look askance -- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
' But about his toes ? ' the Mock Turtle persisted . ' How could he *turn* them *out* with his nose , you know ? '
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other . ' I beg pardon , your Majesty , ' he began , ' for *bringing* these *in* : but I had n't quite finished my tea when I was sent for . '
' Write that down , ' the King said to the jury , and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates , and then *added* them *up* , and reduced the answer to shillings and pence .
' Oh , I beg your pardon ! ' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began *picking* them *up* again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box , or they would die .
She soon *got* it *out* again , and put it right ; ' not that it signifies much , ' she said to herself ; ' I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other . '
They were just beginning to *write* this *down* on their slates , when the White Rabbit interrupted : ' Unimportant , your Majesty means , of course , ' he said in a very respectful tone , but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke .
At this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to *beat* them *off* , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .
He stooped to *pick* it *up* .
A neighbor *knocked* it *down* again with his elbow ; he *picked* it *up* once more .
For two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the provinces of Caux and Picardy , in a kind of place half farm , half private house ; and here , soured , eaten up with regrets , cursing his luck , jealous of everyone , he *shut* himself *up* at the age of forty-five , sick of men , he said , and determined to live at peace .
To *shut* himself *up* every evening in the dirty public room , to push about on marble tables the small sheep bones with black dots , seemed to him a fine proof of his freedom , which raised him in his own esteem .
She *drew* herself *up* , scarlet , and looked at him over her shoulder as she handed him his whip .
Old Rouault was *seeing* him *off* ; they were walking along the road full of ruts ; they were about to part .
Emma 's dress , too long , trailed a little on the ground ; from time to time she stopped to *pull* it *up* , and then delicately , with her gloved hands , she picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns , while Charles , empty handed , waited till she had finished .
When he had gone about a hundred paces he stopped , and as he saw the cart disappearing , its wheels turning in the dust , he gave a deep sigh . Then he remembered his wedding , the old times , the first pregnancy of his wife ; he , too , had been very happy the day when he had taken her from her father to his home , and had *carried* her *off* on a pillion , trotting through the snow , for it was near Christmas-time , and the country was all white .
Charles noticed it ; he took it and *carried* it *up* to the attic , while Emma seated in an arm-chair ( they were putting her things down around her ) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a bandbox , and wondered , dreaming , what would be done with them if she were to die .
He rose . She came to the window to *see* him *off* , and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of geranium , clad in her dressing gown hanging loosely about her .
Emma proved to him with a word that he was mistaken , and *sent* him *off* to his patients .
Charles *dragged* himself *up* by the balusters .
After she had well scolded her servant she gave her presents or *sent* her *out* to see neighbours , just as she sometimes threw beggars all the silver in her purse , although she was by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible to the feelings of others , like most country-bred people , who always retain in their souls something of the horny hardness of the paternal hands .
We leave the highroad at La Boissiere and *keep* straight *on* to the top of the Leux hill , whence the valley is seen .
Call Polyte and tell him to *put* it *up* .
With the tips of her fingers she caught her dress at the knee , and having thus *pulled* it *up* to her ankle , held out her foot in its black boot to the fire above the revolving leg of mutton .
She *took* it *up* in the wrapping that enveloped it and began singing softly as she rocked herself to and fro .
Then the three hundred finished , they both *stretched* themselves *out* in front of the fire , and were soon asleep .
Then he took energetic resolutions , wrote letters that he tore up , *put* it *off* to times that he again deferred .
The conversation languished ; Madame Bovary *gave* it *up* every few minutes , whilst he himself seemed quite embarrassed .
`` Then you are *giving* it *up* ? '' he went on .
When visitors called , Felicite *brought* her *in* , and Madame Bovary undressed her to show off her limbs .
Madame Bovary sprang to *lift* her *up* , broke the bell-rope , called for the servant with all her might , and she was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared .
Although he had not seemed much moved , Homais , nevertheless , had exerted himself to *buoy* him *up* , to `` keep up his spirits . ''
In the supineness of her conscience she even took her repugnance towards her husband for aspirations towards her lover , the burning of hate for the warmth of tenderness ; but as the tempest still raged , and as passion *burnt* itself *down* to the very cinders , and no help came , no sun rose , there was night on all sides , and she was lost in the terrible cold that pierced her .
But her reading fared like her piece of embroidery , all of which , only just begun , filled her cupboard ; she *took* it *up* , left it , passed on to other books .
Wherever did that fat fellow *pick* her *up* ? "
And , moreover , Madame Lefrancois , one must know botany , be able to distinguish between plants , you understand , which are the wholesome and those that are deleterious , which are unproductive and which nutritive , if it is well to *pull* them *up* here and re-sow them there , to propagate some , destroy others ; in brief , one must keep pace with science by means of pamphlets and public papers , be always on the alert to find out improvements . "
It 's Lheureux who is *selling* him *out* ; he has killed him with bills . "
More than one showed his humble medal with pride ; and no doubt when he got home to his good housewife , he *hung* it *up* weeping on the modest walls of his cot .
You ought to *follow* it *up* . "
Her figure slightly bent , her hand well up , and her right arm stretched out , she *gave* herself *up* to the cadence of the movement that rocked her in her saddle .
She threw back her white neck , swelling with a sigh , and faltering , in tears , with a long shudder and hiding her face , she *gave* herself *up* to him -
And as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and *shut* herself *up* in her room .
She was wild with impatience ; if her eyes could have done it , she would have *hurled* him *out* at the window .
He *thought* it *over* , but could hit upon nothing .
`` Take me away , '' she cried , " *carry* me *off* !
" Perhaps she 'll think I 'm *giving* it *up* from avarice .
`` I think it 's all right . Ah ! and this for fear she should come and *hunt* me *up* . ''
She *drew* herself *up* slowly , shading her eyes with her hand to look .
The tradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been ordered , and that he would not take them back ; besides , it would vex madame in her convalescence ; the doctor had better *think* it *over* ; in short , he was resolved to sue him rather than give up his rights and take back his goods .
Then she let her head fall back , fancying she heard in space the music of seraphic harps , and perceived in an azure sky , on a golden throne in the midst of saints holding green palms , God the Father , resplendent with majesty , who with a sign sent to earth angels with wings of fire to *carry* her *away* in their arms .
Then she *gave* herself *up* to excessive charity .
She *gave* herself *up* to the lullaby of the melodies , and felt all her being vibrate as if the violin bows were drawn over her nerves . She had not eyes enough to look at the costumes , the scenery , the actors , the painted trees that shook when anyone walked , and the velvet caps , cloaks , swords - all those imaginary things that floated amid the harmony as in the atmosphere of another world .
Edgar , flashing with fury , dominated all the others with his clearer voice ; Ashton hurled homicidal provocations at him in deep notes ; Lucie uttered her shrill plaint , Arthur at one side , his modulated tones in the middle register , and the bass of the minister pealed forth like an organ , while the voices of the women repeating his words *took* them *up* in chorus delightfully .
`` *Turn* them *out* ! *turn* them *out* ! ''
" Well , you must *think* it *over* . We 'll see .
As they talked they explained more and more fully the motives of their sadness , *working* themselves *up* in their progressive confidence .
" I am beginning to repent terribly of having *taken* you *up* !
In order to *put* it *down* he described painfully a quarter of a circle with his stump .
`` We *made* it *up* , all the same , and I 've come again to propose another arrangement . ''
" And he would do better to *give* it *over* to someone else - to you , for example .
She *poured* it *out* upon the square , on the walks , on the streets , and the old Norman city outspread before her eyes as an enormous capital , as a Babylon into which she was entering .
He *took* it *out* and read -
In vain the clerk tried to get rid of him . Monsieur Homais *dragged* him *off* to the large Cafe de la Normandie , which he entered majestically , not raising his hat , thinking it very provincial to uncover in any public place .
`` But still , now *talk* it *over* . ''
" I will *show* you *up* .
Emma had *sent* her *out* to watch for Bovary in order to *keep* him *off* , and they hurriedly installed the man in possession under the roof , where he swore he would remain .
The druggist 's wife *crunched* them *up* as they had done - heroically , despite her wretched teeth . And so whenever Homais journeyed to town , he never failed to bring her home some that he bought at the great baker 's in the Rue Massacre .
He flew to the writing-table , tore open the seal , and read aloud : `` Accuse no one . '' He stopped , passed his hands across his eyes , and *read* it *over* again .
The priest did not fail to *point* this *out* ; he even explained to Bovary that the Lord sometimes prolonged the life of persons when he thought it meet for their salvation ; and Charles remembered the day when , so near death , she had received the communion . Perhaps there was no need to despair , he thought .
He had to write two letters , to prepare a soothing potion for Bovary , to invent some lie that would conceal the poisoning , and *work* it *up* into an article for the `` Fanal , '' without counting the people who were waiting to get the news from him ; and when the Yonvillers had all heard his story of the arsenic that she had mistaken for sugar in making a vanilla cream . Homais once more returned to Bovary 's .
He *shut* himself *up* in his consulting-room , took a pen , and after sobbing for some time , wrote -
Emma 's head was turned towards her right shoulder , the corner of her mouth , which was open , seemed like a black hole at the lower part of her face ; her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands ; a kind of white dust besprinkled her lashes , and her eyes were beginning to disappear in that viscous pallor that looks like a thin web , as if spiders had *spun* it *over* . The sheet sunk in from her breast to her knees , and then rose at the tips of her toes , and it seemed to Charles that infinite masses , an enormous load , were weighing upon her .
Charles felt inclined to get up and *put* them *out* .
Felicite now wore Madame Bovary 's gowns ; not all , for he had kept some of them , and he went to look at them in her dressing-room , *locking* himself *up* there ; she was about her height , and often Charles , seeing her from behind , was seized with an illusion , and cried out -
Monsieur Bournisien even paid him two or three visits , then *gave* him *up* .
Then they said `` he *shut* himself *up* to drink . ''
The priest whitewashes them , the archdeacon *scrapes* them *down* ; then the populace arrives and demolishes them .
Then a great hurly − burly ensued ; a vast movement of feet , hands , and heads ; a general outbreak of coughs and handkerchiefs ; each one arranged himself , assumed his post , *raised* himself *up* , and grouped himself .
Each man vied with his neighbor in *pointing* them *out* and naming them , in seeing who should recognize at least one of them : this one , the Bishop of Marseilles ( Alaudet , if my memory serves me right ) ; − − this one , the primicier of Saint − Denis ; − − this one , Robert de Lespinasse , Abbé of Saint − Germain des Prés , that libertine brother of a mistress of Louis XI . ; all with many errors and absurdities .
Jupiter , whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing − room , supported her claim , and Venus was on the point of *carrying* it *off* , − − that is to say , without allegory , of marrying monsieur the dauphin , when a young child clad in white damask , and holding in her hand a daisy ( a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of Flanders ) came to contest it with Venus .
Gringoire bore this new disaster heroically ; he *picked* himself *up* , and reached the water 's edge .
Just see if those boobies will *put* themselves *out* ! Move aside !
`` Will you *take* yourself *off* , you Egyptian grasshopper ? '' cried a sharp voice , which proceeded from the darkest corner of the Place .
At the moment when he stood forth from the crowd , Gringoire , who had not *noticed* him *up* to that time , recognized him : `` Hold ! '' he said , with an exclamation of astonishment . " Eh ! it is my master in Hermes , Dom Claude Frollo , the archdeacon !
`` Captain Phoebus de Châteaupers , at your service , my beauty ! '' replied the officer , *drawing* himself *up* .
They *dragged* him *off* .
`` *Pick* me *up* that knave , and hang him without ceremony . ''
Gringoire stooped quickly to *pick* it *up* ; when he straightened up , the young girl and the goat had disappeared .
There was no piece of furniture adapted to sleeping purposes , except a tolerably long wooden coffer ; and its cover was carved , to boot ; which afforded Gringoire , when he *stretched* himself *out* upon it , a sensation somewhat similar to that which Micromégas would feel if he were to lie down on the Alps .
And then they have *made* it *over* ; a presumption of which neither time nor revolutions at least have been guilty .
Finally , the fourth compartment , which *stretched* itself *out* in the agglomeration of the roofs on the right bank , and which occupied the western angle of the enclosure , and the banks of the river down stream , was a fresh cluster of palaces and Hôtels pressed close about the base of the Louvre .
However , admirable as the Paris of to − day may seem to you , reconstruct the Paris of the fifteenth century , *call* it *up* before you in thought ; look at the sky athwart that surprising forest of spires , towers , and belfries ; spread out in the centre of the city , tear away at the point of the islands , fold at the arches of the bridges , the Seine , with its broad green and yellow expanses , more variable than the skin of a serpent ; project clearly against an azure horizon the Gothic profile of this ancient Paris . Make its contour float in a winter 's mist which clings to its numerous chimneys ; drown it in profound night and watch the odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre labyrinth of edifices ; cast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to emerge from the fog the great heads of the towers ; or take that black silhouette again , enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables , and make it start out more toothed than a shark 's jaw against a copper − colored western sky , − − and then compare .
He took it in his cassock and *carried* it *off* .
When he removed the child from the sack , he found it greatly *deformed* , *in* very sooth .
`` God help me , messieurs ! '' said the archdeacon , *showing* them *in* ; `` I was not expecting distinguished visitors at such an hour . '' And while speaking in this courteous fashion he cast an uneasy and scrutinizing glance from the physician to his companion .
Thought was then free only in this manner ; hence it never *wrote* itself *out* completely except on the books called edifices .
He cast the same glance about him , but it was so dull and sleepy that the women only *pointed* him *out* to each other in derision .
She kissed her , caressed her , tickled her , washed her , *decked* her *out* , devoured her !
`` I am no longer surprised , '' added Gervaise , `` that fear of the gypsies should *spur* you *on* so sharply . ''
These words were , so to speak , the point of union of two scenes , which *had* , *up* to that time , been developed in parallel lines at the same moment , each on its particular theatre ; one , that which the reader has just perused , in the Rat − Hole ; the other , which he is about to read , on the ladder of the pillory .
`` That will teach you to *wake* us *up* at night with your peal of a dammed soul . ''
Then , from that eye which had been , up to that moment , so dry and burning , a big tear was seen to fall , and *roll* slowly *down* that deformed visage so long contracted with despair .
They were *chatting* together *in* that whispering tone and with the half − stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose midst there is a young man .
The name of some festival when the bells are pealed ! So he took the liberty of *carrying* you *off* , as though you were made for beadles !
Every day , an hour before sunset , the archdeacon ascended the staircase to the tower , and *shut* himself *up* in this cell , where he sometimes passed whole nights .
He did not know , he who wore his heart on his sleeve , he who observed only the good old law of Nature in the world , he who allowed his passions to follow their inclinations , and in whom the lake of great emotions was always dry , so freely did he *let* it *off* each day by fresh drains , − − he did not know with what fury the sea of human passions ferments and boils when all egress is denied to it , how it accumulates , how it swells , how it overflows , how it hollows out the heart ; how it breaks in inward sobs , and dull convulsions , until it has rent its dikes and burst its bed .
`` Be at ease , '' said Charmolue with a smile ; " I 'll *buckle* him *down* again for you on the leather bed when I get home .
I have just been with those prudes , and when I come forth , I always find my throat full of curses , I must *spit* them *out* or strangle , ~ ventre et tonnerre ~ ! "
Several liards had rolled into the mud ; the captain in his enthusiasm stooped to *pick* them *up* . Jehan restrained him .
Meanwhile , all malice was not extinguished in the captain 's heart . `` So much the worse if the devil 's cart *picks* you *up* on its passage ! '' he said to the poor , sleeping clerk ; and he strode off .
I love my captain . " Phoebus again profited by the opportunity to impress upon her beautiful bent neck a kiss which made the young girl *straighten* herself *up* as scarlet as a poppy .
A bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile , who made a doleful shake of the head , and *passed* it *on* to the president , who gave it to the procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court , and thus it made the circuit of the hail .
`` *Take* that *off* ! '' she cried angrily ; and *drawing* herself *up* , with her hair all dishevelled : `` Mercy ! '' She darted from the bed to fling herself at the feet of the king 's procurator , but her leg was fast in the heavy block of oak and iron , and she sank down upon the boot , more crushed than a bee with a lump of lead on its wing .
Between men and himself , the condemned man felt a pile of stones and jailers weighing down upon his head ; and the entire prison , the massive bastille was nothing more than an enormous , complicated lock , which *barred* him *off* from the rest of the world .
I *drew* myself *up* ; I fled ; but alas ! something within me had fallen never to rise again , something had come upon me from which I could not flee . "
My God ! my God ! it would have been better not to give her to me than to *take* her *away* so soon .
She was in her shift ; her long black hair ( the fashion then was to *cut* it *off* only at the foot of the gallows ) fell in disorder upon her half − bared throat and shoulders .
No one had yet observed in the gallery of the statues of the kings , carved directly above the arches of the portal , a strange spectator , who *had* , *up* to that time , observed everything with such impassiveness , with a neck so strained , a visage so hideous that , in his motley accoutrement of red and violet , he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have discharged their waters for six hundred years .
Then he became alarmed , he put his hands on his ears that he might no longer hear , *turned* his *back* that he might no longer see , and fled from the frightful vision with hasty strides .
Then he *drew* himself *up* stiffly and said , − − `` Oh ! how happy you are to have some one who loves you ! ''
A moment later she felt a touch along her body which made her shudder so that she *straightened* herself *up* in a sitting posture , wide awake and furious .
`` Yes , '' resumed Gringoire , talking to himself and touching his nose with his forefinger in sign of meditation , − − " that 's it ! − − The thieves are brave fellows ! − − The tribe of Egypt love her ! − − They will rise at the first word ! − − Nothing easier ! − − A sudden stroke . − − Under cover of the disorder , they will easily *carry* her *off* ! − − Beginning to − morrow evening . They will ask nothing better .
`` What more do you want to *break* it *in* ? '' demanded Clopin .
With a strength which the sense of danger increased tenfold , he seized one of the beams − − the longest and heaviest ; he *pushed* it *out* through a loophole , then , grasping it again outside of the tower , he made it slide along the angle of the balustrade which surrounds the platform , and let it fly into the abyss .
He laid his hand on the arrow , tore it from his arm , and tranquilly broke it across his big knee ; then he let the two pieces drop on the floor , rather than *threw* them *down* .
If you will grant me mercy , sire , I will *wear* it *out* on the knees in praying to God for you night and morning !
Release him at once , the wanton ( Louis XI. was fond of this word which formed , with ~ Pasque − Dieu ~ , the foundation of his joviality ) , and *put* him *out* with a buffet . "
Here , as though seized with a sudden idea , he flung himself on his knees before his chair , took off his hat , placed it on the seat , and gazing devoutly at one of the leaden amulets which *loaded* it *down* ,
Others thrust iron hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and *dragged* them *down* . They slashed in pieces those who fell .
You will follow me , you will be obliged to follow me , or I will *deliver* you *up* ! You must die , my beauty , or be mine ! belong to the priest ! belong to the apostate ! belong to the assassin ! this very night , do you hear ?
And if they *woke* her *up* when they took her , in vain she might cry ; I was not there ! − − Ah ! gypsy mothers , you devoured my child ! come see your own . "
When her daughter was inside the cell , she laid her gently on the ground , then *raised* her *up* again , and bearing her in her arms as though she were still only her little Agnes , she walked to and fro in her little room , intoxicated , frantic , joyous , crying out , singing , kissing her daughter , talking to her , bursting into laughter , melting into tears , all at once and with vehemence .
The mother rose quickly and went to post herself before her window , in order to *stop* it *up* .
If the unfortunate girl had still been there , it would have been he himself who would have *delivered* her *up* .
`` It 's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom , '' they said . " Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom , and after a certain amount of time they *sell* things *off* , whether the case involved has come to an end or not .
He *threw* himself *down* on his bed , and from the dressing table he took the nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his breakfast .
`` Ridiculous formalities ! '' he grumbled , as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his hands for a little while , as if *holding* it *out* for the policemen 's inspection .
He secretly told himself that he had succeeded in *speeding* things *up* by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath .
The old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them *calmed* them *down* .
We certainly ca n't talk out here , we 'd *wake* everyone *up* and I think that would be more unpleasant for us than for them .
`` You arrived back so late , '' said K. " Now you 've started *telling* me *off* .
And now it really does begin. the supervisor calls out as if he had to *wake* me *up* , in fact he shouts at me , I 'm afraid , if I 'm to make it clear to you , I 'll have to shout as well , and it 's nothing more than my name that he shouts out . "
K. was too engrossed in his role and slowly called out , `` Josef K. ! . '' It was not as loud as he had threatened , but nonetheless , once he had suddenly *called* it *out* , the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all round the room .
It was a matter of course that he would have to appear without fail , there was probably no need to *point* this *out* to him .
`` Bad news ? '' asked the deputy director casually , not in order to *find* anything *out* but just to get K. away from the device .
A fruitmonger , taking his goods up to the windows , was just as inattentive as K. and nearly *knocked* him *down* with his cart .
`` Next time I come here , '' he said to himself , `` I must either bring sweets with me make them like me or a stick to hit them with . '' Just before he reached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a ball had finished its movement , two small lads with sly faces like grown-up scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had ; if he were to *shake* them *off* he would have to hurt them , and he was afraid of what noise they would make by shouting .
But then he *went* back *in* anyway .
As far as could be *distinguished* , *up* in the half-darkness , dust and haze , they seemed to be less well dressed than those below .
The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power over those below him in the hall , he tried to reduce what harm had been done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them , his eyebrows , until then hardly remarkable , *pushed* themselves *up* and became big , black and bushy over his eyes .
The judge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk - which could only have been a sign of his deep humiliation , or at least that is how it must have been perceived - tried to *tidy* it *up* a little , and held it once more in front of himself in order to read from it .
If you want to discuss what I say , please do n't bother to *write* it *down* until later on , I do n't have any time to waste and I 'll soon be leaving . "
`` So , '' called out K , throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed more room , " all of you are working for this organisation , I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I 've just been speaking about , you 've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and snoop on me , you gave the impression of having formed into factions , one of you even applauded me to *test* me *out* , and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man !
All of a sudden in the night , it must have been quite late in the night , I wakes up , next to the bed , there 's the examining judge shading the lamp with his hand so that there 's no light from it falls on my husband , he did n't need to be as careful as that , the way my husband sleeps the light would n't have *woken* him *up* anyway .
She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K. 's as if she wanted to *calm* him *down* , and whispered , `` Be quiet , Berthold is watching us . ''
`` So that 's it , '' said the student , `` oh no , you 're not going to get her , '' and with a strength you would not have expected from him , he glanced tenderly at her , *lifted* her *up* on one arm and , his back bent under the weight , ran with her to the door .
What a position it was that K. *found* himself *in* , compared with the judge sitting up in the attic ! K. , at the bank , had a big office with an ante-room , and had an enormous window through which he could look down at the activity in the square .
The student has *carried* her *off* to the examining judge . "
It 's Sunday today , and it 's not part of my job to do any work today , but they *send* me *off* with some message which is n't even necessary just to get me away from here .
What they do is they *send* me *off* not too far away so that I can still hope to get back on time if I really hurry .
`` Nothing that I know of , '' said the usher . `` And it 's going to get even worse now , up till now he 's only been *carrying* her *off* for himself , now he 's started *carrying* her *off* for the judge and all , just like I 'd always said he would . ''
Then he looked at K. trustingly which , despite all his friendliness , he had not done until then , and added , `` they 're always rebelling . '' But the conversation seemed to have become a little uncomfortable for him , as he *broke* it *off* by saying , " now I have to report to the office .
Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and , in order to *calm* him *down* and raise his spirits , said , " The gentleman here 's only asking what it is you 're waiting for .
The usher of the court said a few words to try and *calm* him *down* but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself , saluted , and hurried on , walking with very short steps , probably because of gout .
He has an answer for every question , you can *try* him *out* if you feel like it .
It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at once , and to get a foretaste of freedom he *stepped* straight *on* to one of the stairs and took his leave there of his companions , who bowed to him .
`` We 're not *clearing* anything *out* , Mr. K. , '' she said , `` it 's just that Miss Montag is moving in with Miss Bürstner and is moving her things across . ''
Then he looked up at her and said , `` What about the suspicions you had earlier about Miss Bürstner , have you *given* them *up* ? ''
`` Mr. K. , '' called Mrs. Grubach , who had been waiting for this very question , as she put her hands together and *held* them *out* towards him .
K. immediately sent the junior staff from the room and told them to *let* no-one *in* .
" Here it is . She writes ; ' I have not seen Josef for a long time , I was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not *let* me *through* ; I waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my piano lesson .
And that everyone you know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated , *disgraced* right *down* to the ground .
Fortunately , though , behind the girl , the invalid *raised* himself *up* , K. 's uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and then , somewhat calmer , said , " We have naturally not lost our senses , not yet ; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking for it .
Well , he came anyway , we were having a peaceful chat , as far as I was able when I 'm so weak , and although we had n't told Leni she must n't *let* anyone *in* as we were n't expecting anyone , we still would rather have remained alone , but then along came you , Albert , thumping your fists on the door , the office director moved over into the corner pulling his table and chair with him , but now it turns out we might have , that is , if that 's what you wish , we might have something to discuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back together again . - Office director ... , " he said with his head on one side , pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed .
`` I 'm afraid I 'll only be able to stay a few minutes more , '' smiled the office director as he *spread* himself *out* in the armchair and looked at the clock .
`` And what if I do n't confess , could you not help me then ? '' asked K. to *test* her *out* .
But now , his uncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer , he had to take account of his family ; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress of the trial , he himself had carelessly - with a certain , inexplicable complacency - mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about it in ways he did not know , his relationship with Miss Bürstner seemed to be in trouble because of it . In short , he no longer had any choice whether he would accept the trial or *turn* it *down* , he was in the middle of it and had to defend himself .
He had been capable of *working* himself *up* to his high position in the bank in a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone , now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that possible for him to the trial , and there was no doubt that it had to turn out well .
Instead , he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets , *spread* them *out* in front of K. , explained several items , corrected a little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced over it all , and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he 'd concluded with him about a year before , mentioning in passing that this time there was another bank spending great effort to get his business , and finally stopped speaking in order to learn K. 's opinion on the matter .
He need not have worried , the two gentlemen met each other , shook each other 's hand and *went* together *over* to K. 's desk .
And I 'm sure the chief clerk ... `` - even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the manufacturer - '' will be very glad to have us *take* it *off* his hands .
Did a carefully worked out defence - and any other sort would have made no sense - did a carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to *shut* himself *off* from everything else as much as he could ?
Was he supposed to *let* people *in* to see him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this ? While his trial trundled on , while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat looking at the papers for this trial , should he be worrying about the business of the bank ?
Only , one time these visits became a bit too frequent , I began to *tell* him *off* for it , we started talking and I became interested how it was that he could earn a living just by painting , and then I learned to my amazement that his main source of income was painting portraits . ' I work for the court , ' he said , ' what court ? ' said I. And that 's when he told me about the court .
On the third floor he had to slow down his pace , he was quite out of breath - the steps , just like the height of each floor , were much higher than they needed to be and he 'd been told that the painter *lived* right *up* in the attic .
The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm , but the painter chased after her , grabbed her by the skirt , span her once round and *set* her *down* again by the door with the other girls who , unlike the first , had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post .
So he drew the manufacturer 's letter out from his pocket , *held* it *out* to the painter and said , `` I learned about you from this gentleman , an acquaintance of yours , and it 's on his advice that I 've come here . ''
The painter glanced through the letter and *threw* it *down* onto the bed .
And of course , it always *wakes* me *up* when I hear the door opened beside the bed , however fast asleep I am .
What also happens , though , is that there are some judges who 'll *turn* me *down* in advance , and that 's worse .
The painter had leant back and *spread* himself *out* in his chair , his nightshirt was wide open , he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides .
K. did not want to be impolite , the painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the future , and because of K. 's forgetfulness there had been no mention of any payment for the painter 's help , so K. could not *turn* him *down* now and allowed him to show him the picture , even though he was quivering with impatience to get out of the studio .
From under the bed , the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings . They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to *blow* it *off* the one on top the dust swirled around in front of K. 's eyes , robbing him of breath for some time .
`` Josef , '' said Leni , looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes , `` you 're not going to be jealous of Mr. Block now , are you ? Rudi , '' she then said , turning to the businessman , `` *help* me *out* will you , I 'm being suspected of something , you can see that , leave the candle alone . ''
She *helped* him *off* with his coat , took the hat off his head , ran with the things into the hallway to *hang* them *up* , then she ran back and saw to the soup .
`` You 're a client of the lawyer 's too , are n't you , '' said the businessman quietly from his corner as if he were trying to *find* this *out* .
`` I ca n't tell you very much about that , '' said the businessman , " at first I tried to do that too but I soon had to *give* it *up* again .
It *wears* you *out* too much , and it 's really not much use .
I can *leave* it *up* to them less than when I had just the one .
K. could not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance would *win* him *over* .
K. listened to all of this , testing it and *thinking* it *over* as if he had been given the task of closely observing everything spoken here , inform a higher office about it and write a report .
Then at eight o 'clock I *let* him *out* and gave him something to eat . "
`` Block , '' said Leni , as if reprimanding him , and , taking hold of the collar of his coat , *pulled* him *up* slightly higher . `` Leave the carpet alone and listen to what the lawyer is saying . ''
It was an extremely irksome task , servitors brought him the mail , bank staff came with various queries and , when they saw that K. was busy , stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to them , the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and came in frequently , took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages , clearly for no purpose , when the door to the ante-room opened even clients would appear from the half darkness and bow timidly to him - they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had seen them - all this activity was circling around K. with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would need , then *looked* them *up* in the dictionary , then *wrote* them *out* , then practised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart .
As he was tired he wanted to sit down , he went back inside the cathedral , he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps , he moved it with his foot to a nearby pew , *wrapped* himself *up* tighter in his coat , put the collar up and sat down .
At the front pews he stopped , but to the priest he still seemed too far away , he reached out his hand and *pointed* sharply *down* with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit .
`` *Put* it *down* , '' said the priest .
The priest lowered his head down to the balustrade , only now did the roof over the pulpit seem to *press* him *down* .
But the doorkeeper says he ca n't *let* him *in* to the law right now .
The doorkeeper often questions him , asking about where he 's from and many other things , but these are disinterested questions such as great men ask , and he always ends up by telling him he still ca n't *let* him *in* .
The simple story had lost its shape , he wanted to *shake* it *off* , and the priest who now felt quite compassionate allowed this and accepted K. 's remarks without comment , even though his view was certainly very different from K. ' s .
`` Some ancient , unimportant actors - that 's what they 've sent for me , '' said K. to himself , and looked round once again to confirm this to himself . `` They want to *sort* me *out* as cheaply as they can . ''
The gentlemen did not need to make any answer , it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K. and tried to *move* him *on* , but K. resisted them .
Beneath them , now invisible , there were gravel paths with comfortable benches where K. had *stretched* himself *out* on many summer 's days .
The *went* on *up* through several streets where policemen were walking or standing here and there ; some in the distance and then some very close .
It was a simple matter to throw off the covers ; he only had to *blow* himself *up* a little and they fell off by themselves .
He would have used his arms and his hands to *push* himself *up* ; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions , and which he was moreover unable to control .
If he wanted to bend one of them , then that was the first one that would *stretch* itself *out* ; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg , all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully .
As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it , only holding himself upright with his mouth , and hung onto the key or *pushed* it *down* again with the whole weight of his body as needed .
Gregor 's mother , her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk 's being there , looked at his father . Then she unfolded her arms , took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that *spread* themselves *out* around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast .
The washing up from breakfast lay on the table ; there was so much of it because , for Gregor 's father , breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would *stretch* it *out* for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers .
His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper , *reading* it *out* in a loud voice to Gregor 's mother , and sometimes to his sister , but there was now not a sound to be heard .
However , his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise . She immediately *picked* it *up* - using a rag , not her bare hands - and *carried* it *out* .
Half suffocating , he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs , *mixing* them *in* with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more . She quickly dropped it all into a bin , closed it with its wooden lid , and *carried* everything *out* .
There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening , when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would *pull* it *up* again with a start , as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent .
If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was *take* it *off* again , as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to *cut* himself *off* so completely . She left the sheet where it was .
Gregor also refrained , this time , from spying out from under the sheet ; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come . `` You can come in , he ca n't be seen , '' said his sister , obviously *leading* her *in* by the hand .
She stood very still , remained there a moment , and then *went* back *out* to Grete .
Perhaps only because her mother was there , she remained calm , bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said , albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice : `` Come on , let 's go back in the living room for a while ? '' Gregor could see what Grete had in mind , she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then *chase* him *down* from the wall .
She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint ; Gregor wanted to help too - he could save his picture later , although he stuck fast to the glass and had to *pull* himself *off* by force ; then he , too , ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days ; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing ; she was looking into various bottles , he startled her when she turned round ; a bottle fell to the ground and broke ; a splinter cut Gregor 's face , some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him ; now , without delaying any longer , Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother ; she slammed the door shut with her foot .
Another one however , immediately following it , hit squarely and lodged in his back ; Gregor wanted to drag himself away , as if he could remove the surprising , the incredible pain by changing his position ; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and *spread* himself *out* , all his senses in confusion .
This is what peace I get in my old age ! " And supported by the two women he would *lift* himself *up* carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself , let the women take him to the door , *send* them *off* and carry on by himself while Gregor 's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him .
From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and *look* briefly *in* on him .
Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it , leave it there a few hours and then , more often than not , *spit* it *out* again .
The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity , or to *throw* everything *out* in one go , but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else . At first he moved it because , with no other room free where he could crawl about , he was forced to , but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that the way left him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards .
Gregor 's father staggered back to his seat , feeling his way with his hands , and fell into it ; it looked as if he was *stretching* himself *out* for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all .
For these reasons Louis the Twelfth , King of France , quickly occupied Milan , and as quickly lost it ; and to *turn* him *out* the first time it only needed Lodovico 's own forces ; because those who had opened the gates to him , finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit , would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince .
And having committed this prime error , he was obliged to *follow* it *up* , so much so that , to put an end to the ambition of Alexander , and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany , he was himself forced to come into Italy .
And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church , and deprived himself of friends , he , wishing to have the kingdom of Naples , divides it with the King of Spain , and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate , so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter ; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king , he *drove* him *out* , to put one there who was able to drive him , Louis , out in turn .
And as this point is worthy of notice , and to be imitated by others , I am not willing to *leave* it *out* .
But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others , he resolved , with the aid of some citizens of Fermo , to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty , and with the help of the Vitelleschi , to seize Fermo . So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that , having been away from home for many years , he wished to visit him and his city , and in some measure to look upon his patrimony ; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour , yet , in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain , he desired to come honourably , so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen , his friends and retainers ; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians , all of which would be not only to his honour , but also to that of Giovanni himself , who had *brought* him *up* .
They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war , but if war comes they *take* themselves *off* or run from the foe ; which I should have little trouble to prove , for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries , and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves , yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were .
These arms may be useful and good in themselves , but for him who *calls* them *in* they are always disadvantageous ; for losing , one is undone , and winning , one is their captive .
In conclusion , the arms of others either fall from your back , or they *weigh* you *down* , or they bind you fast .
But , it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it , it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it ; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen , because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live , that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done , sooner effects his ruin than his preservation ; for a man who wishes to *act* entirely *up* to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil .
Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality , yet he did not strive afterwards to *keep* it *up* , when he made war on the King of France ; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects , for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness .
This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers , who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse , who *brought* them *up* in his discipline ; which means solely that , as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man , so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures , and that one without the other is not durable .
Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France , and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king ; of these the first is the parliament and its authority , because he who founded the kingdom , knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness , considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to *hold* them *in* ; and , on the other side , knowing the hatred of the people , founded in fear , against the nobles , he wished to protect them , yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king ; therefore , to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people , and from the people for favouring the nobles , he set up an arbiter , who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king .
Afterwards he *sought* him *out* in France , and took from him his government and life .
But let us come to Commodus , to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire , for , being the son of Marcus , he had inherited it , and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers ; but , being by nature cruel and brutal , he *gave* himself *up* to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them , so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people ; on the other hand , not maintaining his dignity , often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators , and doing other vile things , little worthy of the imperial majesty , he fell into contempt with the soldiers , and being hated by one party and despised by the other , he was conspired against and was killed .
*Shaking* this *off* with a gasp and a struggle , I uplifted myself upon the pillows , and , peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber , hearkened - I know not why , except that an instinctive spirit prompted me - to certain low and indefinite sounds which came , through the pauses of the storm , at long intervals , I knew not whence .
By God 's grace you might *make* it *up* !
' I told you not to put passengers on the roof , ' the girl shouted in English . ' Now *pick* them *up* ! '
' Well , *ask* her *in* at once , ' said Oblonsky , his face wrinkling with vexation .
' Will you be home to dinner , sir ? ' said Matthew , as he *showed* him *out* .
Levin , at last ! ' he said , scrutinizing the approaching Levin with a friendly mocking smile . ' How is it you deign to *look* me *up* in this den ? ' he asked ; and not contented with pressing his friend 's hand , he kissed him .
Yet skaters appeared quite calmly to gain on her , to *catch* her *up* , and even speak to her , and quite independently of her to amuse themselves enjoying the excellent ice and the fine weather .
She was not very firm on her feet . Having drawn her hands from the muff that hung by a cord from her neck , she *held* them *out* and looking at Levin , whom she had recognized , she smiled at him and at her fears .
Having turned the corner , she pushed off with an elastic little foot , *glided* straight *up* to Shcherbatsky , and catching hold of him with her hand , nodded smilingly to Levin .
' You 've not *looked* us *up* for a long time , sir , ' said one of the attendants as , holding up Levin 's foot , he bored a hole in the heel of his boot . ' Since you left we have had no gentleman who is such a master at it as you !
The waiter , remembering Oblonsky 's way of calling the items on the French menu by their Russian names , did not repeat the words after him , but afterwards allowed himself the pleasure of repeating the whole of the order according to the menu : ' Potage printanier , turbot , sauce Beaumarchais , boeuf , poularde à l 'estragon , macédoine de fruits ... ' and immediately , as if moved by springs , he put down the bill of fare in one cardboard cover , and seizing another containing the wine-list *held* it *out* to Oblonsky .
' Why , of course , I always *write* them *down* .
But I 'll *draw* him *out* , I do love to make a fool of him when Kitty 's about , and I will . '
Do I *draw* them *on* ?
' And you 'll *find* it *out* , but too late , just as with poor Dolly . '
*Think* it *over* , Anna , help me !
' I 'm afraid you will be cold upstairs , ' remarked Dolly to Anna . ' I want to *move* you *down* , and then we shall be nearer to one another . '
' Goodness knows if they have quite *made* it *up* , ' thought Anna on hearing her tone , which was cold and calm .
And yet I , instead of *looking* him *up* , dined out and came here . ' Levin went up to a lamp-post and read his brother 's address which he had in his pocket-book , and then hired a sledge .
He recalled how despite the ridicule of his fellow-students his brother had lived like a monk while at the University and for a year after , strictly observing all the religious rites , attending service , fasting , avoiding all pleasures and especially women ; and then how he suddenly broke loose , became intimate with the vilest people and *gave* himself *up* to unbridled debauchery .
' Here , here , *put* it *down* here , ' he said crossly , and at once poured out a wineglass full of vodka and drank it greedily . ' Have a drink , will you ? ' he said to his brother , brightening up at once .
When he had settled in the arm-chair in the little drawing room where he always had his tea , and Agatha Mikhaylovna had *brought* it *in* for him and had sat down at the window with her usual remark , ' I will sit down sir ! ' he felt that , strange to say , he had not really forgotten his dreams and that he could not live without them .
He patted her a little , and she *curled* herself *up* at his feet with her head on her outstretched hind paw .
Completely to regain her composure , she went to the nursery and spent the evening with her son . She put him to bed herself , made the sign of the cross over him , and *tucked* him *up* .
When he rang the bell , while still outside , he heard men 's laughter , a woman 's lisping voice , and Petritsky shouting : ' If it is one of the villains , do n't *let* him *in* ! ' Vronsky told the servants not to announce his arrival , and softly entered the first room .
And your wife ? ' the Baroness said suddenly , interrupting Vronsky 's conversation with his comrade . ' We here have been *marrying* you *off* !
They wink at him , nod , frown , to make him *give* it *up* ...
`` Here , this is one of the new ones , '' says the Grand Duchess , *turning* it *over* , and - just fancy ! - out tumbles a pear and sweets - two pounds of them ! ... The dear fellow had collected them in his helmet ! '
' Oh ! I ca n't *make* anything *out* !
' I am going home now and shall have to *shut* myself *up* , and you wo n't be able to come to me , ' said Dolly , sitting down beside her sister . ' I want to talk to you . '
Mama takes me to a ball : and it seems to me she only takes me there to *marry* me *off* as quickly as possible and get rid of me .
Wenden himself , having returned from his office and hearing the front-door bell and voices , went out , saw the tipsy officers with the letter , and *hustled* them *out* .
She had scarcely time to go to her dressing-room , put powder on her long pale face and *rub* it *off* again , *smarten* herself *up* , and order tea to be served in the big drawing-room , before one carriage after another began to arrive at the door of her immense house on the Great Morskaya .
' I must think it over , come to a decision , and *throw* it *off* , ' he said aloud .
*Thinking* it *over* , he regretted having to spend his time and powers of mind on inconspicuous domestic affairs ; but nevertheless , clearly and definitely , as though it were an official report , the form and sequence of the speech he had to make shaped itself in his mind . ' I must make the following quite clear : First , the importance of public opinion and propriety ; secondly , the religious meaning of marriage ; thirdly , if necessary , I must refer to the harm that may result to our son ; fourthly , allude to her own unhappiness . '
While the horse was being saddled Levin again called the steward , who was hanging about within sight , in order to *make* it *up* with him , and began to talk about the spring work that lay before them and his plans for the estate .
He was not irritated either by the sight of a peasant 's horse and colt treading down the young growth ( he told a peasant he met to *drive* them *off* ) , nor by the jeering and stupid answer the peasant , Ipat , whom he happened to meet , gave him in reply to his question : ' Well , Ipat , will it soon be time to sow ? ' ' We must plough first , Constantine Dmitrich , ' said Ipat .
' Oh , but we *crumble* it *up* , ' said Vasily , taking a handful and rubbing the earth between his palms .
' Constantine , please leave word that if the dealer Ryabinin comes ( I told him to come here to-day ) they should *ask* him *in* and let him wait . '
' Because he and the other dealers are in league , and he has *bought* them *off* .
' I can do that , ' said Ryabinin , sitting down and putting his arm on the back of his chair in a most uncomfortable way . ' You must *let* me *off* something , Prince .
There was one question he wanted to put to Oblonsky , but could not bring himself to ask , nor could he find the form to *put* it *in* or the moment to ask it .
The orderly stood before him with vodka and pickled cucumbers on a tray . ' Yashvin here has ordered vodka to *freshen* me *up* . '
In her open box Frou-Frou stood ready saddled . They were just going to *lead* her *out* .
After crossing the brook Vronsky had the mare quite under control , and *held* her *in* , intending to cross the big barrier behind Makhotin and then to try and pass him on the flat 300 yards before the next obstacle .
He alighted first and *helped* her *out* .
Madame Stahl learnt afterwards that Varenka was not her daughter , but continued to *bring* her *up* , the more readily because it happened that very soon Varenka had no relations left .
Varenka did not seem at all abashed by the fact that strangers were present , and she *went* straight *up* to the piano .
With French exaggeration she at once began talking to him , admiring him for having such a delightful daughter , and in Kitty 's presence *praised* her *up* to the skies , calling her a treasure , a pearl , and a ministering angel .
' I do not know whether you will remember me , but I must recall myself to you in order to thank you for your kindness to my daughter , ' he said , raising his hat and not *putting* it *on* again .
Kitty took from the table a little box which held the corals , and with a proud look , without having *made* it *up* with her friend , went to where her mother was .
You have made an attempt , and because according to your judgment it was a failure , you *gave* it *up* .
All those Zemstvo institutions of ours , ' he said , again jumping off to a subject that had no bearing on the case in point , ' are like those little birches that are cut down for decorations at Whitsuntide , and we Russians *stick* them *up* to imitate the woods that have grown up naturally in Western Europe . I can not water these birches or believe in them from my soul . '
' Go on , go on ! ' said the old man , hurrying after him and easily *catching* him *up* . ' Take care , I 'll mow you down ! '
The old man stooped each time he came upon one , *picked* it *up* , and put it inside his jacket , saying , ' Another treat for my old woman . '
Levin followed , and often thought he would certainly fall when climbing a mound with his scythe in his hand - a mound so steep that it would have been hard to climb even unencumbered . Still , he managed to climb it and to do all that had to be done ; and he felt as if some external force were *urging* him *on* .
Previously Miss Hull used to find one and *point* it *out* to her ; but this time Lily herself found a fine big one and there was a general shout of delight : ' Lily has found a mushroom ! '
One of the young women was watching the governess , who was dressing after all the others , and seeing her put on a third petticoat could not refrain from remarking : ' Look at her ! She 's *wrapping* herself *up* and *wrapping* herself *up* , and has n't got enough round her yet ! ' and the women burst out laughing .
See them *picking* it *up* , like ducklings picking up the food you 've thrown to them ! ' he added , pointing to where the hay was being loaded on the carts . ' They 've carted a good half since dinner time ...
One of the women with a strange gruff voice started a song and sang it to the end , when fifty powerful voices , some gruff and others shrill , all at once *took* it *up* with a will .
How am I to do it ? ' he again asked himself . , and could find no reply . ' However , I have not slept all night and ca n't render a clear account of myself now , ' he thought , ' but I 'll *clear* it *up* later .
But since the gauntlet had been thrown down , he would *take* it *up* boldly and would demand the appointment of a special Committee to investigate and report upon the work of the Committee of Irrigation in the Zaraysk Province , but at the same time he would not yield an inch to those gentlemen who had raised the question .
Just as he was going away I wished to *call* him *back* and tell him , but changed my mind , because my not having done so at first would have appeared strange .
He despises that feeling of mine , but he knows that I will not give up my son , that I can not *give* him *up* , that without my son I can not live even with the man I love , - that if I forsook my son I should act like a horrid disreputable woman . He knows that and knows that I have not the power to do it . '
No , I shall *break* it *off* , *break* it *off* ! ' she exclaimed , jumping up and forcing back her tears .
And she went to the table to write him another note , though she knew in the depths of her soul that she would not have the strength to *break* anything *off* , nor to escape from her former position , however false and dishonest it might be .
And in spite of his ridiculous position as Lisa 's old admirer , you should see how he *carries* it *off* .
I shall be there at six . ' She closed it , and Betsy returning *sent* it *off* in her presence .
Every one , knowing intimately all the complexities of his own circumstances , involuntarily assumes that these complexities and the difficulty of *clearing* them *up* are peculiar to his own personal condition , and never thinks that others are surrounded by similar complexities .
He had made this proposal , but now , *thinking* it *over* , he saw clearly that it would be better to avoid that plan , and yet , while he told himself so , he feared that this might be wrong .
Having proposed it , I must be ready to *carry* it *out* - that is to say I must find the money and leave the army . '
I *found* that *out* when I married .
' We 'll talk it over another time . I will *look* you *up* in Petersburg . '
' For God 's sake *hear* me *out* ! ' he added , with an air of entreaty that she would let him explain his words . ' I am glad because I know that it is impossible , quite impossible for things to remain as they are , as he imagines . '
The English ploughs turned out useless , because it never entered the peasant 's head to lower the upturned ploughshare , and as he *forced* it *through* at the turning he spoiled the ground and strained the horses , and Levin was told not to worry ! The horses were allowed to stray into the wheat-field because not one of the peasants wanted to be watchman , and in spite of its having been forbidden the labourers took turns to watch the horses at night ; so Vanka ; who had been at work all day , fell asleep , and confessed his guilt , saying , ' I am in your hands , sir ! '
' There in the passage , ' answered the old man , winding the reins into a ring and throwing them on the ground . ' *Fix* them *on* before we finish dinner . '
' But we see you do n't *give* it *up* , ' said Nicholas Ivanich Sviyazhsky , ' so it seems it has its advantages . '
' But why ? If your farming is rational you can *carry* it *on* with hired labour , ' said Sviyazhsky .
By means of whose labour am I to *carry* it *on* ? '
She did not remember the exact figure , though the German had *calculated* it *down* to a quarter of a kopeck .
Involuntarily submitting to Anna 's weakness , who , ready in advance to accept anything , *gave* herself *up* to him entirely and expected him to decide her fate , he had long ceased to imagine that their union could end in the way he had then expected .
His ambitious plans had receded to the background , and feeling that he had come out of the range of activity in which everything was definite , he completely *gave* himself *up* to his passion , and that passion bound him closer and closer to her .
And I went into Dusseaux 's hotel yesterday and saw `` Karenin '' on the board , and it never entered my head that it could be you ! ' said Oblonsky , thrusting his head in at the carriage window , ' else I should have *looked* you *up* .
Later on he *took* it *off* and stayed for an hour , talking to Levin about bear-hunting and also about personal matters .
I consider my ideas very important , yet they too turn out to be insignificant - and would be , even if it were as possible to *carry* them *out* as it was to surround this bear .
' I 'm awfully glad I have *found* you *in* ! Well , I hope ... ' began Oblonsky , cheerfully .
Well , before doing so , see my wife and *talk* it *over* with her !
For heaven 's sake , *talk* it *over* with her !
Do come , and above all , do *talk* it *over* with her .
On entering the drawing-room Oblonsky made his excuses , explaining that he had been kept by the particular Prince who was his usual scapegoat whenever he was late or absent , and in a moment he had reintroduced everybody , and having brought Karenin and Koznyshev together , he *started* them *off* on the subject of the Russification of Poland , and they immediately caught on , Pestsov joining them .
Oblonsky took his arm and *led* him *up* to Karenin .
' The guard ( regardless of the proverb ) [ The proverb is : ' At meeting you 're judged by your clothes , At parting you 're judged by your wits . ' ] judged me by my clothes and wished to *turn* me *out* , but I began to use long words and ... you too , ' he went on turning to Karenin ( whose Christian name and patronymic he had forgotten ) , ' judging me by my peasant coat were going to *turn* me *out* , but afterwards you took my part , for which I am very grateful . '
What will become of her if you *throw* her *off* ? '
Will they really *let* me *in* to the meeting ? '
It all happened at the same time ; one of the boys ran after a pigeon and *looked* smilingly *up* at Levin ; the pigeon flapped its wings and fluttered up , glittering in the sunshine amid the snow-dust that trembled in the air ; from the window came the scent of fresh-baked bread and the loaves were put out .
' *Are* they *up* ? '
' Whom shall I *announce* you *to* ? ' asked the footman .
As he entered the hall Karenin dragged forth his resolve as it were from a remote corner of his brain , and *conned* it *over* . It said :
I feel that I am *flying* headlong *over* some precipice but must not even try to save myself .
Only I hope you will not go *letting* it *off* accidentally any more , ' said she with an inquiring smile .
That now , having atoned for his guilt toward her husband , he would be obliged to *give* her *up* and never place himself between her with her remorse and her husband , was clear to his mind ; but he could not eradicate from his heart a regret for the loss of her love - could not efface from his memory the moments of happiness he had known with her , moments he had valued so lightly , but the image of which with all their charm pursued him still .
THE PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKAYA AT FIRST *CONSIDERED* it *out* of the question to have the wedding before Advent , to which there remained but five weeks , but could not help agreeing with Levin that to *put* it *off* until after the Fast might involve waiting too long , for Prince Shcherbatsky 's old aunt was very ill and likely to die soon , and then the family would be in mourning and the wedding would have to be considerably deferred .
Katavasov , feeling that his originality was observed and appreciated , *showed* it *off* .
For a long time Levin could not be made to understand what he had to do , and they were a long while trying to set him right . Just as they were going to *give* it *up* because he would either use the wrong hand or else take her by the wrong one , he at last comprehended that he with his right hand , without changing his position , must take her by her right hand .
He looked wearily and sadly at the bride and bridegroom , sighed , and disengaging his right hand from the vestments , *held* it *up* in blessing over the bridegroom , and then over the bride ; only in his manner when he placed his fingers on Kitty 's bowed head there was a shade of tenderness .
' *Put* it *on* , ' she whispered , smiling .
Golenishchev *pulled* himself *up* and unwillingly agreed , but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage .
Having *made* it *up* with his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar , and a hat , and went to the studio .
He did not even like looking at it , and had only *brought* it *out* because he was expecting an Englishman who wished to buy it .
How well he has *hit* it *off* , and how simply !
They *made* it *up* .
But when he took her face in his hands and said ' Kitty ! ' she suddenly recovered , cried a little , and then they *made* it *up* .
' Now *turn* me *over* on the left side and go to bed , ' he murmured .
*Turn* him *over* . It is unpleasant to call the servants , and I can not do it .
' It would have been so painful for you alone , ' she said , and raising her arms high so that they hid her cheeks , now flushed with pleasure , she twisted her braided hair and *pinned* it *up* at the back of her head . ' No , ' she continued , ' she did not know how to ...
And Levin noticed that all day long the sick man really kept catching at himself as if wishing to *pull* something *off* .
Their uncle , Karenin , a high official and at one time a favourite with the late Emperor , *brought* them *up* .
As soon as the secretary left , I announced him , ' answered the hall-porter with a wink . ' Let me *take* it *off* for you . '
' Serezha ! ' said his tutor , a Slav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' *take* it *off* yourself . '
' Korney has *taken* it *in* to your Papa .
' You know how fond I am of you , Alexis , ' she replied when she had *heard* him *out* , ' and how ready I am to do anything for you ; but I have kept silent because I knew I could be of no use to you and Anna Arkadyevna . ' She pronounced the formal ' Anna Arkadyevna ' with peculiar precision .
She would have ready in her hand some money to give to the hall-porter and the footman , in order that they should *let* her *in* . Without raising her veil she would say she had been sent by Serezha 's godfather to wish him many happy returns of the day and that she was to put the toys by his bedside .
' Would you like to wait ? ' said Kapitonich , *helping* her *off* with her cloak .
' *Let* me *in* , *let* me *in* ! ' she cried , and entered at the big door .
Korney , the valet , went down into the hall-porter 's room to inquire who had *let* her *in* , and hearing that it was Kapitonich who had done so , he reprimanded the old man .
' Yes , I daresay you would not have *let* her *in* !
' He 's *let* her *in* without telling anybody ; and Alexis Alexandrovich will be ready in a minute and will go to the nursery . '
The Italian nurse , having smartened up the baby girl , came in and *held* her *out* to Anna .
If I know it , then I know what I shall do , ' she told herself , powerless to imagine the position she would *find* herself *in* when she was convinced of his indifference .
I shall *catch* you *up* in a minute ! ' he shouted to Yashvin .
Send a waiter to *clear* it *up* , and get out my dress suit ! '
' I will do it , ' said Dolly , and she got up and began carefully sliding the spoon over the surface of the bubbling syrup , and now and then , to remove what had stuck to the spoon , she tapped it against a plate already covered with the yellowish pink scum , with blood-red streaks of syrup showing beneath it . ' How they 'll *lick* it *up* at tea-time ! ' she thought of the children , remembering how she herself , when a child , used to marvel that the grown-ups did not eat the scum - the nicest part .
*Boil* it *up* a little longer , Agatha Mikhaylovna . '
' No , excuse me ! ' her mother continued . ' And then you yourself would not let me *talk* it *over* with Vronsky .
' Well , Agatha Mikhaylovna , is the jam done ? ' asked Levin , smiling at her and wishing to *cheer* her *up* . ' Has it turned out well the new way ? '
The first to appear was Vasenka Veslovsky in new boots *reaching* half-way *up* his fat thighs , his green blouse girdled with a new cartridge-belt smelling of leather , and on his head the Scotch bonnet with the ribbons . He carried a new English gun without a sling .
' *Let* them *out* with the flock , ' he said , turning to the herdsman who was waiting for orders about some young sheep . ' Sorry !
But when heated with the work , and seeing Veslovsky pulling at the splashboard so strenuously and zealously that he actually *wrenched* it *off* , Levin reproached himself with being influenced by his sentiments of the previous day and with treating Veslovsky too coldly , and he tried to efface his unfriendliness by particular courtesy .
The other unpleasantness , which for a moment upset his good-humour , but about which he afterwards laughed heartily , was that of all the provisions that Kitty had provided so lavishly that it had appeared impossible to *eat* them *up* in a week , nothing was left !
' Masha has *worn* me *out* .
I will *turn* him *out* , ' said Levin .
Vasenka *drew* himself *up* .
Well , supposing the best : that none of the other children die , and that I somehow succeed in *bringing* them *up* ; at the very best they will only escape being ne 'er-do-wells . That is all I can hope for .
She had a small travelling looking-glass in her bag , and felt inclined to *take* it *out* ; but glancing at the backs of the coachman and the clerk who sat swaying beside him , she knew she would feel ashamed if one of them chanced to look round , and she did not *take* it *out* .
The breeze , which they had felt while driving , died down when they stopped ; and horseflies settled on the sweating horses , which angrily tried to *brush* them *off* .
' We have come a long way , ' replied the coachman , *climbing* back *on* to the box . ' And you say it 's not far ?
' There , you see , when you 've turned to the left you 'll *knock* straight *up* against it , ' said the peasant , evidently unwilling to let them go , and wishing to talk .
Anna , turning her eyes away from her friend and *screwing* them *up* ( this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dolly ) , grew thoughtful , trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark .
Mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien ! [ But I shall not *let* you *off* anything ! ]
Dolly was somewhat embarrassed and troubled by the quite novel circle she *found* herself *in* .
' It is not like having to do with the Local Authorities , ' said he . ' Where they would scribble over a whole ream of paper , I merely report to the Count ; we *talk* it *over* , and three words settle the matter . '
Her partner Tushkevich also *gave* it *up* , but the rest played for a long time .
He *threw* her *over* and took another .
She rose , *drew* herself *up* , sighed deeply , and with her light steps began pacing up and down the room , pausing occasionally . ' I not consider it ?
She bent her head and , *trembling* all *over* with emotion , looked from under her brows with moist , glittering eyes at the thin , piteous-looking little Dolly in her patched dressing-jacket and night-cap .
He waited for the venomous nobleman to conclude , and then said he considered the proper course would be to consult the wording of the Act and requested the Secretary to *look* it *up* .
You know , if we had to make a garden in front of our house , we should *plan* it *out* , and if a century-old tree is growing on that spot - though it may be rugged and old , yet you wo n't *cut* it *down* for the sake of a flower-bed , but will plan your beds so as to make use of the old tree !
He dictated it aloud , saying , ' I must *cheer* them *up* ! ' But Dolly , on receiving the telegram , only sighed over the rouble it had cost , and understood that it had been sent toward the end of a dinner .
Toward the evening of that day , being alone , Anna felt such terror on Vronsky 's account that she decided to go to town , but after careful consideration she wrote that contradictory letter which Vronsky received , and without *reading* it *over* she sent it by express messenger .
' Let 's *talk* it *over* , it bothers me . I do n't think I spend on anything superfluous , and yet the money simply flies away !
' They do ; please walk in , ' said the hall-porter , determinedly *helping* him *off* with his overcoat .
' No ! I believe Anna is *bringing* her *up* splendidly , but one does not hear about her .
Glancing in the mirror , Levin saw that he was red in the face , but he was sure he was not tipsy , and he *followed* Oblonsky *up* the carpeted stairs .
The horse was not yet ready , but feeling particularly energetic , physically strong and alert to meet what lay before him , so as not to lose a moment he did not wait for it but started off on foot , telling Kuzma to *catch* him *up* .
The dispenser asked in German whether he might sell it and receiving permission from some one behind a screen took out a bottle and a funnel , slowly poured it from a large bottle into a small one , stuck on a label , and in spite of Levin 's request that he should not do so sealed up the bottle , and was about to *wrap* it *up* .
But seeing her meek smiling face and hearing her say , ' I have *worn* you *out* , ' he blamed God ; but the thought of God made him at once pray for forgiveness and mercy .
When the baby had been swaddled and made into a firm doll , Mary Vlasevna *turned* it *over* as if proud of her work , and stepped aside that Levin might see his son in all his beauty .
He did not give me an answer , but said he must *think* it *over* ; and this morning instead of an answer I have received an invitation for this evening to go to the Countess Lydia Ivanovna 's . '
All the same , I think I have not done anything to *shock* them *up* till now .
He went up to the Frenchman and placed his hand in his . Oblonsky also rose and , opening his eyes wide to *wake* himself *up* in case he was asleep , looked first at one and then at the other .
To-day he had been away from home all day , and she had felt so lonely , and it was so painful to feel herself at discord with him , that she wished to forget it all , to forgive and *make* it *up* with him . Wishing even to blame herself and to justify him , she said to herself :
I will *make* it *up* with him and we will go back to the country . There I shall be calmer . '
' Is it possible that I ca n't ... ? Is it possible that I ca n't *take* it *on* myself ? ' she wondered , and began again from the beginning .
Thoughts of where she would now go : to the aunt who had *brought* her *up* , to Dolly , or simply abroad by herself ; of what he was now doing , alone in the study ; of whether this quarrel was final or whether a reconciliation was still possible ; of what all her former Petersburg acquaintances would say of her now ; how Karenin would regard it ; and many other thoughts about what would happen now after the rupture , passed through her mind , but she did not *give* herself *up* entirely to these thoughts .
Come home . We must *talk* it *over* .
She *stuck* it *down* and gave it to the man . Then , afraid to remain alone now , she followed him out of the room and went to the nursery .
' But how could he go away leaving me in this condition ? How can he go on living , without having *made* it *up* with me ? '
We can not *tear* it *out* but we can hide the memory of it . And I will hide it ! '
' Yes , but to-day there is something peculiar about her , ' said Dolly . ' When I was *seeing* her *out* , there in the ante-room , I thought she was going to cry . '
For me everything centres in him , and I demand that he should *give* himself *up* to me more and more completely .
She wished to rise , to throw herself back , but something huge and relentless struck her on the head and *dragged* her *down* . ' God forgive me everything ! ' she said , feeling the impossibility of struggling ...
' You too have come to *see* them *off* ? ' she asked in French .
And do you always come to *see* them *off* ? ' he asked with a slight smile .
Only his mother is *seeing* him *off* .
He wrote an answer and *sent* it *off* .
But my poor son had *given* himself *up* to her entirely .
' But why should he *let* anyone *off* ? '
' Yes , I must *clear* it *up* and understand it , ' he thought , gazing intently at the untrodden grass before him , and following the movements of a green insect that was crawling up a stalk of couch grass and was hindered in its ascent by a leaf of goutwort .
Tightly holding in the good horse , who snorted impatiently and pulled at the reins , Levin kept turning to glance at Ivan , who sat beside him not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hands and continually pushing down his shirt as the wind *blew* it *out* . Levin tried to think of some pretext for beginning a conversation with him .
But she would not have been able to discern its expression had not a flash of lightning that effaced the stars *lit* it *up* .
No answer . The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room ; then she *put* them *up* and looked out under them .
He ' pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up , and he knows if he can make out to *put* me *off* for a minute or make me laugh , it 's all down again and I ca n't hit him a lick .
Every time I *let* him *off* , my conscience does hurt me so , and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks .
Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man 's are to a man , but because a new and powerful interest *bore* them *down* and drove them out of his mind for the time -- just as men 's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises .
I dare you to *knock* it *off* -- and anybody that 'll take a dare will suck eggs . "
`` You 're a fighting liar and das n't *take* it *up* . ''
At last the stranger got out a smothered `` ' Nuff ! '' and Tom *let* him *up* and said :
*Come* -- *out* with your spring-line -- what 're you about there !
He *got* it *out* , rumpled and wilted , and it mightily increased his dismal felicity .
This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and *set* it *up* in new and varied lights , till he wore it threadbare .
And thus he would *die* -- *out* in the cold world , with no shelter over his homeless head , no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow , no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came .
Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap , and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there ; then he dipped the soap in the water and *laid* it *down* ; turned up his sleeves ; poured out the water on the ground , gently , and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door .
The girl `` put him to rights '' after he had dressed himself ; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin , turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders , *brushed* him *off* and crowned him with his speckled straw hat .
He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes , but the hope was blighted ; she coated them thoroughly with tallow , as was the custom , and *brought* them *out* .
The boy stammered , gasped , and *got* it *out* :
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and *got* it *out* .
He had but one marring thought ; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug , but he did not think it was upright in him to *carry* it *off* .
This was lucky ; he was about to begin to groan , as a `` starter , '' as he called it , when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument , his aunt would *pull* it *out* , and that would hurt .
So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and *held* it *up* for inspection .
He took a rest and then *swelled* himself *up* and fetched a succession of admirable groans .
Sid yawned , stretched , then *brought* himself *up* on his elbow with a snort , and began to stare at Tom .
Tom said : " Oh , please , auntie , do n't *pull* it *out* .
So at last , with a sigh and a yawn , he *gave* it *up* .
So he put Joe 's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom . `` Now , '' said he , `` as long as he is on your side you can *stir* him *up* and I 'll let him alone ; but if you let him get away and get on my side , you 're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over . ''
`` All right , go ahead ; *start* him *up* . ''
The tick tried this , that , and the other course , and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves , but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp , so to speak , and Tom 's fingers would be twitching to begin , Joe 's pin would deftly *head* him *off* , and keep possession .
`` Tom , you let him alone . '' `` I only just want to *stir* him *up* a little , Joe . ''
He *took* it *up* and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles .
He *laid* himself *down* and put his mouth close to this depression and called --
Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent , and within another minute or two the men had *hoisted* it *out* on the ground .
Tom 's heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession , not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else , but because an awful , unaccountable fascination *drew* him *on* .
She had him out at daylight every morning , *stood* him *up* in the wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water ; then she *scrubbed* him *down* with a towel like a file , and so brought him to ; then she *rolled* him *up* in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and `` the yellow stains of it came through his pores '' -- as Tom said .
She calculated his capacity as she would a jug 's , and *filled* him *up* every day with quack cure-alls .
Aunt Polly took it , *held* it *up* .
Because if he 'd had one she 'd a *burnt* him *out* herself !
He *gathered* himself *up* and sneaked off , crushed and crestfallen .
But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom , and had come to *hunt* him *up* for that purpose .
Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and *let* himself *down* after it , tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort .
The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon , and had about *worn* himself *out* with getting it there .
When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone , and the last allowance of corn pone devoured , the boys *stretched* themselves *out* on the grass , filled with contentment .
They tried to *argue* it *away* by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times ; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities ; it seemed to them , in the end , that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only `` hooking , '' while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing -- and there was a command against that in the Bible .
They were too hungry to stop to fish , but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham , and then *threw* themselves *down* in the shade to talk .
`` Oh , it ai n't the bread , so much , '' said Tom ; `` I reckon it 's mostly what they _ say _ over it before they *start* it *out* . ''
But when the shadows of night *closed* them *in* , they gradually ceased to talk , and sat gazing into the fire , with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere .
However , he reached the shore finally , and drifted along till he found a low place and *drew* himself *out* .
He *laid* himself *down* under the thwarts and waited , panting .
`` It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment , and up to every kind of mischief , but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be -- and laws bless me , to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream , never once recollecting that I *throwed* it *out* myself because it was sour , and I never to see him again in this world , never , never , never , poor abused boy ! ''
God 'll take care of _ him _ -- never you trouble _ your _ self , sir ! Oh , Mrs. Harper , I do n't know how to *give* him *up* !
I do n't know how to *give* him *up* ! He was such a comfort to me , although he tormented my old heart out of me , ' most . "
When they were well exhausted , they would run out and sprawl on the dry , hot sand , and lie there and *cover* themselves *up* with it , and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more .
Tom found himself writing `` BECKY '' in the sand with his big toe ; he *scratched* it *out* , and was angry with himself for his weakness .
He had a secret which he was not ready to tell , yet , but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon , he would have to *bring* it *out* .
Finally he said : " Oh , boys , let 's *give* it *up* .
Now you *think* it *over* .
Now they *stretched* themselves *out* on their elbows and began to puff , charily , and with slender confidence .
The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces , *burn* it *up* , drown it to the treetops , blow it away , and deafen every creature in it , all at one and the same moment .
They had no heart in their sports , and gradually *gave* them *up* .
This thought *broke* her *down* , and she wandered away , with tears rolling down her cheeks .
`` *Go* _ *on* _ , Tom ! ''
`` And you *shut* him *up* sharp . '' " I lay I did !
I 'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I 've got you back , that 's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word , though goodness knows I 'm unworthy of it , but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places , there 's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes . Go ' long Sid , Mary , Tom -- *take* yourselves *off* -- you 've hendered me long enough . "
It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him ; and so , instead of winning him , it only `` *set* him *up* '' the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about .
You just wait till I *catch* you *out* !
Tom conned the thing a moment longer , and then added : `` All right , though ; she 'd like to see me in just such a fix -- let her *sweat* it *out* ! ''
By and by , Mr. Dobbins *straightened* himself *up* , yawned , then unlocked his desk , and reached for his book , but seemed undecided whether to *take* it *out* or leave it .
Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while , then *took* it *out* and settled himself in his chair to read !
Fourth of July was coming ; but he soon *gave* that *up* -- *gave* it *up* before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours -- and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer , justice of the peace , who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral , since he was so high an official .
" My ! we could n't *get* him *out* , Tom .
They arrived hot and panting , and *threw* themselves *down* in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke .
Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I did n't hurry up , and I tell you he 'd *clean* it *out* pretty quick .
But wo n't the widow *take* it *away* from us , Tom ?
The boys gazed awhile , half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window ; then talking in a low tone , as befitted the time and the circumstances , they *struck* far *off* to the right , to give the haunted house a wide berth , and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill .
They had a smoke and a chat in the shade , and then dug a little in their last hole , not with great hope , but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it , and then somebody else had come along and *turned* it *up* with a single thrust of a shovel .
Injun Joe sat up , stared around -- smiled grimly upon his comrade , whose head was drooping upon his knees -- *stirred* him *up* with his foot and said :
He reached his hand in and *drew* it *out* --
But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of *thinking* them *over* , and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream , after all .
`` Well , so 'd I ; but I 'd like to see him , anyway -- and *track* him *out* -- to his Number Two . ''
There was not much to take away , for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls , and his heart would soon *wear* itself *out* , the way it was beating .
And why should he *give* it *up* , he reasoned -- the signal did not come the night before , so why should it be any more likely to come tonight ?
Why not *give* it *up* and turn in ?
Better *give* it *up* . "
" *Give* it *up* , and I just leaving this country forever !
*Give* it *up* and maybe never have another chance .
But I 'll *take* it *out* of _ her _ . "
" *Let* me *in* -- quick !
`` Huckleberry Finn -- quick , *let* me *in* ! '' " Huckleberry Finn , indeed !
`` Please *let* me *in* ! It 's only Huck Finn ! ''
Rest and sleep will *fetch* you *out* all right , I hope . "
Those fellows war n't likely to come again -- they had n't any tools left to work with , and what was the use of *waking* you *up* and scaring you to death ?
That 's the Lord 's mark . He do n't *leave* it *off* .
By-and-by Tom took Becky 's candle and *blew* it *out* .
Tin pans and horns were added to the din , the population massed itself and moved toward the river , met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens , thronged around it , joined its homeward march , and *swept* magnificently *up* the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah !
He described how he labored with her and convinced her ; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight ; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then *helped* her *out* ; how they sat there and cried for gladness ; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition ; how the men did n't believe the wild tale at first , `` because , '' said they , `` you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in '' -- then took them aboard , rowed to a house , gave them supper , made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home . Before day-dawn , Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out , in the cave , by the twine clews they had strung behind them , and informed of the great news .
The prisoner had *searched* them *out* and eaten them .
Will you go in there with me and help *get* it *out* ? "
If you *drove* them *out* they 'd turn right around and come back . It 's so in all the books . "
Let 's *snake* it *out* . Lem me see if I can lift the box . "
The money was soon in the bags and the boys *took* it *up* to the cross rock .
Mr. Jones said : `` Tom was n't at home , yet , so I *gave* him *up* ; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door , and so I just brought them along in a hurry . ''
He had to eat with a knife and fork ; he had to use napkin , cup , and plate ; he had to learn his book , he had to go to church ; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth ; whithersoever he turned , the bars and shackles of civilization *shut* him *in* and bound him hand and foot .
Tom *routed* him *out* , told him the trouble he had been causing , and urged him to go home .
Huck 's joy was quenched . " Ca n't *let* me *in* , Tom ?
You would n't *shet* me *out* , would you , Tom ?
