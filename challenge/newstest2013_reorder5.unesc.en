 Furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record . 
 In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State . 
 Students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution . 
 However , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 . 
 Indeed , the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions . 
 I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer . 
 Likewise , so do cured meat products , and these should be avoided . 
 In addition , new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure . 
 But let 's suppose that it really is the Higgs , since the chances of being mistaken seem slim , and see what it is . 
 The repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there wo n't be any . 
 They had an inkling of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest . 
 This sensor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an `` eye '' to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009 . 
 Courageous , he even manages to smile , talks to the strangers bustling around him , bringing him his medication , offering him a bath . 
 Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such regression . 
 A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy or Pepsi , whatever is their tipple . 
 This morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased . 
 And at the same time , some oncologists work relentlessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst prognoses . 
 It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in = depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Charest , had consented only reluctantly . 
 Mr Zambito has handed money out freely in the 2000s , giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the Liberals then in power . 
 Although this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal , Mr Duchesneau invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ... 
 The confidence he gives me also explains my performance . 
 First of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match . 
 In Ligue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ? 
 After we won 4 = 0 at home against Troyes and they still found things to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit frustrating . 
 He 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star . 
 I 've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour . 
 With Bitcoin , all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts , auditors , currency issuers , and buyers and sellers . 
 Pierre Noizat , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network . 
 They just need to provide an address that a phone can `` photograph and recognise '' says Pierre Noizat , who confirms he has thousands of users . 
 There is a general movement to reappraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems . 
 Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation , a return to safety . 
 They became profiteers , seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts . 
 The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , boys ' high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the archaeological Delegation . 
 While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke . 
 It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly , with a large Islamist majority , voted on the text yesterday . 
 In mid = November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had slammed the door , feeling they had failed to assert their views . 
 AiF [ Argumenti i Fakti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel . 
 It starts by the Antonia Fortress - Praetorium - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion , Stone of Unction and the place of Jesus ' burial . 
 Ruins of the Massada Fortress remain from a secret refuge from enemies , built by Herod in 25 BC for his family . 
 In the north of the country , at an elevation of 1600 = 2040 m , there is a famous ski resort called Hermon , which fills up with tourists in winter months . 
 In Akko , you can visit the bath museum Al = Basha , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath attendants of the time . 
 The most tragic section is the children 's memorial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers . 
 People come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wraps and medicinal muds , and to improve their health if they have dermatitis , allergies , asthmas , eczemas , arthritis , bronchitis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance . 
 City transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high = speed tram , and Haifa has the only subway line in the country , comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower . 
 Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home . 
 For the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail . 
 Seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language , Peoples ' Friendship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( MGU ) , St. Petersburg State University ( SPbGU ) , and other Russian education institutions . 
 First of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery . 
 Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers . 
 Migrants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems . 
 `` They are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their passports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , '' confirms the Head of the Main Migrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov . 
 Nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language . 
 Their families do n't even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies . 
 Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers , without registration , hence the extortion . 
 Naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them . 
 The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation 
 The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to toughen up the law for owners of civil weapons . 
 This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : CLICK shots at weddings , where there were no casualties , and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov , resulting in CLICK the death of seven people . 
 The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and Anti = Corruption , Irina Yarovaya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future . 
 According to the Ministry of the Interior 's statistics , 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,168,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period . 
 Nonetheless , the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control . 
 Half of all arms on the black market are there `` because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , '' states the report . 
 Former military man Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid = 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this . 
 It is shipped from long = term storage warehouses by the mid = level management of these warehouses . 
 Actions began last week after Thanksgiving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes . 
 On this day , some employees of the Walmart corporation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left = wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low = to = medium incomes . 
 These latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand = held scanners . 
 A typical Walmart employee , receiving 9.5 dollars / hour , can not afford this . 
 If Walmart fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more . 
 Fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.90 dollars / hour . 
 Once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald 's , working part = time after school , living with parents . 
 At first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . Then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too . 
 Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form . 
 - It clearly can not be called a cure = for = all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions . 
 Of course , it would be good to have eight mega pixels with 1000 k / s speed . 
 In my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second . 
 For now , one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of matrix for the image . 
 Moreover , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone 's spirit . 
 I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post = Gaza = Nevsky style artists ( `` post = gazonevschina '' ) , which led to Pushkinskaya = 10 , and the wave was no longer . 
 - And all this has been united in your Art = clinic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together . 
 In 1995 , I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya = 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Bohemian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemia . 
 In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . You can be popular , but not very cultural . 
 And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes . 
 We need cultural bedrock , but we now have more writers than readers . This is wrong . 
 The question of reproduction in space began with flora . 
 Then , insects were bred in orbit , small fruit flies . 
 Small amphibians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean . 
 It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults . 
 However , with time , it will become reality , when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their offspring , who were born in space . 
 The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application . 
 At the audit committee 's session in the House of Deputies , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared . 
 This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact . 
 Under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline . 
 In several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are icy and snowy . 
 In the Carlsbad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were icy and snowy . 
 The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day . 
 In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist , according to the local highway service . 
 Caution is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be icy and slippery . 
 The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher altitudes of the Pardubice region in particular . 
 Secondary and tertiary roads are wet , and may therefore also have icy patches . 
 Since this morning , the snowploughs have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Bohemia . 
 Besides certain snow = covered places , or some icy frost patches , the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the Usti nad Labem region is also closed , according to the police database . 
 They will end at around the time when Kiribati Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the Mayan calendar . 
 Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children . 
 The Tap Tap band , together with other artists , also recorded the so = called anthem against the end of the world , called `` The End of the World is cancelled . '' 
 It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us . 
 Equipping the wheelchair = accessible educational Studeo centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the Jedlicka Institute for the disabled . 
 We have five members in electric wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ... 
 Compared to Prague , Moscow is rather inaccessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own . 
 We realised that work , which goes on unseen can be like it never existed . 
 Things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of those things . 
 Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to rehearsals twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly disappears . 
 The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9pm . 
 Immediately prior to the War , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board ( Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo = Naukowy ) that coordinated all the work . 
 The Board was appointed in 1937 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War . 
 The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 1954 , in which four in = depth articles are on the subject of astronautics . 
 In one of these , by Prof. Subotowicz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedicate itself to astronautics . 
 Later , the improved RM = 1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two = stage RM = 2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert . 
 A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM = 34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds . 
 The rocket was designed as a two = stage rocket , with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg . 
 Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase . 
 On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long = term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace . 
 In Germany the situation is such that state ministries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry . 
 To address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state . 
 Whoever attempted to defy this family died . 
 Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state = issued ) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre . 
 JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 , after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929 . 
 Argo 's weakness is its divergence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places . 
 The lobby 's interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and `` anomalous curvature . '' 
 Here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation . 
 The Bankovnipoplatky.com server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association , Laissez Faire , also nominated , aside from the aforementioned absurdities , for example the Union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state . 
 We are asking the European Union for a refund , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jaroslav Palas ( CSSD ) . 
 His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so = called buy = out interventions , the state 's warehouses were full and were forced to export . 
 Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ? 
 Later , I added that if I were elected as senator , I would be standing for president . 
 And , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this . 
 I put myself forward , because people are really discontented , but now I have my doubts . 
 Nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents . 
 I have the Aston Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond , who drove the car , was gallant with women and also fought against evil and villainy . 
 However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 thousand a month . 
 The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg ( literally `` book mountain '' ) - 2 photos 
 Spijkenisse , a sleepy town outside the gates of Rotterdam , which barely merits a visit , is a special record = holder . 
 In order to counteract this asinine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete miniatures . 
 It is part of a revitalisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses , with a total of 50 dwellings . 
 There is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif , however , the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot . 
 The interior space , glazed throughout , is bright and open , the fired clinker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square . 
 You are already on the lookout for a park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing football . 
 The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a chess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room . 
 For the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four = centimetre = thick boards . 
 Under heat and pressure , the so = called Landbouw plastic ( KLP ) changes colour to a dark , homogeneous and robust material , that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers . 
 At the end of the 500 = meter = long journey , you are rewarded in the Literature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees . 
 `` You would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a showcase project in the area of ecology , '' said Trouborst . 
 The broad , laminated wood glue beams positioned at right = angles to the glass facade , provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight . 
 The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blinds . 
 As such , MVRDV have succeeded in mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity . 
 That is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy . 
 On the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States . 
 The USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto . 
 German companies are also ' legally ' copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting apparel , Puma . 
 Pattloch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere . 
 According to information from market research company CLSA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest growing . 
 However , the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty penny . 
 Pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objection is being raised has become a `` market reality . '' 
 In the past year , however , things reportedly `` returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . '' 
 To appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Freudenberg . 
 In the next two instances , Freudenberg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day . 
 The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spilling over , back into Europe . 
 In actual fact : if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained Wentzler . 
 First of all , the stamping : cowboy boots , basketball shoes , ladies ' pumps and men 's loafers attempt to find the beat on the parquet floor , and quickly do just that . 
 In this region , no = one can speak the Bantu language fluently , but they can sing it . 
 For an 8,733 = kilometre flight away from Heidelberg , in the north west of the Swaziland Kingdom , lies the village of Esitjeni , which relies on the vocal power of the German choir . 
 In Esitjeni you get a small foreshadow of the illness from which all of Swaziland is suffering : according to Unicef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world . 
 However , just one year later , the choir established the `` Voices for Africa '' Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni at an almost professional level . 
 This is because occasionally , the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and close bodily contact . 
 Therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations . 
 If diagnosed early , the majority of STIs can be cured and long = term consequences avoided . 
 This is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead . 
 Unknown to the majority of the Earth 's inhabitants , there are probes , telescopes and small robots such as the Phoenix , deployed to research the depths of the universe . 
 This image section from an infrared recording by the Spitzer telescope shows a `` family portrait '' of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are seen as blue dots , while more difficult to identify are the pink = coloured `` new = borns '' in the star delivery room . 
 This star = forming region - rather unromantically named W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation , at a distance of 6,500 light years away . 
 The name Trifid stems from the Latin word trifidus ( divided into three parts ) , as dark stripes of dust divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts . 
 In the Ophiuchus constellation , astronomers have photographed the signs of a cosmic collision : 400 million light years from the earth , the cores of two merging galaxies move rapidly towards one another , destined to collide . 
 The nebula , 1,400 light years away , consists of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust . 
 Likewise to be located at the ESO Observatory in Chile , the European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned . 
 It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres , as too much of the route is just a single track . 
 `` A strikingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan , '' said Scholz , `` while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sardinia . '' 
 Eight people live here under this roof , including one of Mirzayeva 's sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time . 
 They are fearful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood . 
 This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the woolly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sharia law . 
 From a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinematic art and literature . 
 Open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by Mursi to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyptians for referendum `` very soon . '' 
 `` The revolution is back and we are going to be victorious , '' said Hamdin Sabbahi , third place candidate in the presidential elections . 
 Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority , Mohamed El = Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belongs `` on the rubbish tip of history . '' 
 `` We have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for , '' stated the Egyptian media , quoting opposition politician Chaled Ali . 
 The well = organised Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counter = demonstration , although acting cautiously they did not choose the Tahrir Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile , outside the Cairo University . 
 Quite clearly , this was something that Mursi 's followers did not want to risk . 
 It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists ' draft . 
 As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes devoted to this most , well , captivating of foods . 
 Then in the depths of winter , well and truly fermented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten . 
 Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations . 
 The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rakfisk dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nasally challenging - fish . 
 The aim , however , was n't to stop commuters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament . 
 Before rubbing shoulders with the US president , Mr Pena Nieto 's previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico . 
 To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pena Nieto 's new motorways , a vast improvement on the cracked and bumpy roads it replaced . 
 As her mother recounts the story , a picture of Mariana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : Justice . 
 He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules . 
 The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme . 
 The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with rules governing all maximum = custody detainees at Quantico . 
 It 's ethnic shorthand in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as `` Irish '' or my friends in New York describe themselves as `` Italian . '' 
 Our identity might sometimes be fuzzy , but our loyalty is clear . 
 We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico . 
 Despite killing some of its leaders and bottling up Gaza 's 1.7m people in one of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas . 
 Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction . 
 As Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends . 
 Better to keep them behind that wall and smite them if they raise their heads . 
 Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home . 
 That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and might just mark the start of something . 
 It is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up . 
 After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online . 
 `` If you are a tobacco marketer and you 've only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , '' said Becky Freeman , a public health researcher at Sydney University . 
 `` The government should have just banned them altogether and then we 'd go OK , fine , we ' re done , we 'll shut up shop , '' he said , throwing his hands up in the air . 
 Sometimes we think we ' re bored when we just have difficulty concentrating . 
 Using such scales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls , said Stephen Vodanovich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stimulation . 
 He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bored when they were n't in school . 
 But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term . 
 They say that Colorado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana , first for medical use and now recreationally . 
 Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple . 
 `` It 's a cultural barrier '' with district attorneys , said Sean McAllister , a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws . 
 `` They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still do n't really accept that this is legal , '' he said . 
 We ' re looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for . 
 My first one involved translating 18th = century French texts into English , and I was unprepared for what followed . 
 `` Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? '' he demanded . 
 Most Tory freshers pretend they ' re Labour . 
 The three years before me stretched out as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation . 
 The only openly Tory don was Norman Stone , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college . 
 He was hated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers . 
 I told my father I hated Oxford and why . 
 Inwardly blushing with shame , I admitted to being `` brainwashed by my parents '' and called them `` old fools . '' 
 Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in Voghera , northern Italy , to idol of the international jet = set . 
 The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola d ' Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino . 
 For four euros , the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths . 
 At 27 years old , Anto has been risking his life for three years in the Kawah Ijen volcano , and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and goggles . 
 Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur does n't stop flowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark . 
 Singaporeans blame their careers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
