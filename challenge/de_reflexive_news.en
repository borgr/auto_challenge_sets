One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn = out .
Furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
Of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn = out .
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long = term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
Also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or `` less worse '' explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically .
But for physicists , it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs .
But let 's suppose that it really is the Higgs , since the chances of being mistaken seem slim , and see what it is .
However , even though particle physics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pauli exclusion principle , which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same `` quantum state '' - this `` state '' consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
While lurking in the other are the bosons , a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
These bosons are then divided into two groups , according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mesons , which we will not discuss here , and `` force particles '' by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related .
The same applies to the Higgs boson , with the difference that it is another field , the Higgs field , which must be `` disturbed '' for the boson to appear .
Just imagine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research .
Sitting in front of an appetising lunch , he consents to being helped to eat , resigned .
At this stage , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so = called `` curative '' care .

Mayor of the borough of Rivi√®re = des = Prairies , to the East of the island , she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resold for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
I was just coming back from a series of injuries .
To become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
Look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
Unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I 've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour .
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
Everybody fought for everybody .
The bitcoin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site ) .
This is a file hashing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital imprint .
`` It will take time for Bitcoin to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , '' he predicts .
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
And ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wounded , the maimed .
They want to defend their traditions , both ancient and archaic , even though they have been joined by Jihadists , Pakistanis , Arabs , Uzbeks , Tajiks .
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996 .
Afghanis paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of Al = Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
They became profiteers , seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts .
They have become discredited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of thieves .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American largesse will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
Former commanders of the anti = Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will escape the central power .
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it .
To be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
The Holy Land combines the splendour of biblical truths , modern comfort and primeval nature .
It starts by the Antonia Fortress - Praetorium - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion , Stone of Unction and the place of Jesus ' burial .
It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees .
When you go to Israel , do n't worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population speaks Russian .
Nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
Naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Turks , Uzbeks , and Tajiks can afford even a basic education .
Naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
Authors of the open letter are certain that the toughening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the `` black '' market .
`` There are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional , in order to cover the shortage , '' says the former military man .
According to him , dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods .
I looked at sites , blogs , till someone responded , offering me to go to Begovaya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the `` corner '' so we can negotiate .
There are salesmen on labour markets , but one needs to `` come '' there conditionally `` from John Doe , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth . ''

- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public , unlike Google .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Ironman , but to a regular person .
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these `` images in the air '' a sense of tangibility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultrasound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation , but very weak right now , as if someone blew on your fingertip .
It conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limitless space ; we are working on the concept of treadmills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant balloons .
Recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg 's music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence , philosophy and image .
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .

To save humanity , the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet ?
In 1979 , quail eggs were sent to space , to check how an embryo develops in weightlessness .
`` The problem is related to the fact that this chick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , '' explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems ( IMBP ) RAN Vladimir Sychev .

There is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in amniotic fluid in the womb ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
This confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new `` fiscal failure risk detection '' system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not penalise those , who make a mistake on a technicality , which does not affect the final decision .
Drivers should expect mist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
Temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snowy and icy . In the lowlands , however , particularly southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
Together with The Tap Tap band , we tend to joke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely .
The Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people .
Nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public , and they can use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead !
Public respect or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
I began my job as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mistaken ?
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tutors , equipment and so on .
In 1933 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs .
Three models were developed ( designated Meteor = 1A , -1B , and -1C ) , which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus .
On this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods , `` the rug is pulled '' from under the competition 's prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In Germany there are already a host of food hand = out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
Liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin .
Thereupon , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
The current state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude , can expect its next cycle .
We must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation 's lifespan .
They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either waging or preparing for war ( before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
Whoever attempted to defy this family died .
These solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vide establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated ) .
World War II broke out , and whether Hitler broke free from the leash , which international bankers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world 's acceptance of the Jewish State .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of discord and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Israel 's current prime minister , Netanyahu ' the hawk ' , is a typical example of a fascist politician , loyal to the international bankers , who does everything to instigate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hormuz Strait , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy .
" He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of his name .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah overboard , because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries .
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail = biting scenes for the film .
`` We were prompted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , '' Patrik Nacher , the poll 's organiser , told Pravo .
The EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
Funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , Pavel Nemec ( US = DEU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .

You have already reached the Senate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
When I lobbied , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The advantage I hold is that without the political pigeonholing or dogmas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
Do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
From the Czech viewpoint , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the KSCM or the ODS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
People would like me to be a Samaritan , who saves the Republic .
In the vote on the incorporation of Palestine , Germany abstained from voting .
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to establishing a no = fly zone .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a `` more normal '' foreign policy .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by abstaining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect .
The USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto .
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu , Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahu 's policies .
If we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti = German feelings become apparent .

On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Zegna DF Puma there , an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Ermenegildo Zegna .
This refers to women who latch onto rich men .
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing .
The process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing .
Particularly if imitators secure unprotected brand names there .
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register `` everything '' that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , " said Wentzler .
More than forty percent of people in the Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus , and dying in you mid = thirties is by no means rare .
However , just one year later , the choir established the `` Voices for Africa '' Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni at an almost professional level .
How has the number of infections developed ?
According to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 , to 3,698 cases in 2011 .
Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
Among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle .
So did Shirali Muslimov miscalculate his age by a couple of decades ?
I have always washed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .

The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
Now you have the nose = numbing smell of rakfisk , one of the great Norwegian delicacies .
I am in the small town of Fagernes , about three hours from Oslo .
All around us people are eating little cubes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink .
If you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
It is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
Instead , the shootings are referred to as `` the July the 22nd incident . ''
As Mexico 's incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office , the BBC 's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon , but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo , for example , he is remembered fondly .
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
Bradley Manning did n't complain about mistreatment , prosecutors contend
Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning -- charged in the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he 's alleging he suffered in military custody .
Manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they did n't record the issues .
The judge , Army Col. Denise Lind , also asked Manning why he did n't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
Manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count .
Under questioning from the judge Friday , Manning said that he inferred from his guard 's order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he was n't a danger to himself .
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip = flops to hurt himself but had n't done so .
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
On a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stumped .
It 's ethnic shorthand in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as `` Irish '' or my friends in New York describe themselves as `` Italian . ''
Later , I settled on `` Mexican = American . ''
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican president = elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Union = style trading bloc in North America .
And we would n't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain , living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless .
While she 's a U.S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
And , with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Jubilant Hamas people say an Islamist crescent is curving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the Hizbullah party = cum = militia holds sway , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bashar Assad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas 's allies are menacing the king .
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that can not be shut out even by Israel and America .
Mr Netanyahu , whose Likud party has merged with an even more hawkish lot under Avigdor Lieberman in the run = up to an election on January 22nd , is sitting pretty .
Maybe the hardliners will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demography exacerbates this as the Arab population swells .
While Australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
The potential hitch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting .
We have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
It forces the brain to go on interesting tangents , perhaps fostering creativity .
First of all , like many people , I assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more leisure time .
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of `` wanting to , but being unable to engage in satisfying activity . ''
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression .
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can be related , people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
The ones who heard the low = level TV reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to boredom .
When you ' re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , disruption of attention can lead to boredom , said Mark J. Fenske , an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when you ' re doing something dull , `` such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line , distracting music can help you not be bored . ''
We all experience boredom at some points - my flight delay , a droning speaker , a particularly tedious movie .
But he said he did know that `` adolescence is a peak period for boredom , '' largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad , he may not be bored anymore , but he has n't learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , Professor Fenske said .
Your kid does n't just learn to entertain himself , but gets more self = control in other areas .
What people are really searching for , he said , is a way to unplug and enjoy down time .
`` In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated , '' he said , `` it 's hard to find ways to engage when the noise shuts down . ''
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
Right now , 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
`` Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred , '' Mr. Buck said in a statement .
`` I do not think I 'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , '' he said .
`` It 's a cultural barrier '' with district attorneys , said Sean McAllister , a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales , they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes .
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug , they are likely to balk at allowing the state = regulated recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kevin A. Sabet , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration .
We ' re looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for .
I was persecuted for one reason only , and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric : my father , the late Woodrow Wyatt , was a high = profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter .
People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us . "
`` Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? '' he demanded .
At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
It was a second = year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA .
Later , at a local pub , I cravenly attempted to dissimulate .
This ploy proved unsuccessful .
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Sixties .
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
Would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inclinations ?
The only openly Tory don was Norman Stone , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
During a tutorial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that I was an `` enemy of the people , '' I decided to do the same .
Inwardly blushing with shame , I admitted to being `` brainwashed by my parents '' and called them `` old fools . ''
You may call me a snivelling wimp .
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers , but , to this day , hides behind an ill = deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
I remember it perfectly .
This is the case of Anto Wijaya , one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano , east of the Indonesian island of Java .
To do so , he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater , where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air .
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level , but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there , at snail 's pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then , lugging their heavy baskets , they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,850 metres above sea level .
Defying the shadows , Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money .
Although the sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano , they are so hardy that no = one complains of serious illnesses ... apart , of course , from their common respiratory problems , osteoarthritis , knee pain and sores on the shoulders , which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets .
The phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as `` Let 's put a bao ( bun ) in the oven '' to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
We are the world 's worst at reproducing our own progeny , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
In Singapore , there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
But , Lim Yew Soon , managing director of the real estate company EL Developers , says his `` shoe boxes '' sell much faster than larger units .
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary , it means the quality of private life or `` the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . ''
The child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write humiliating or aggressive comments .
`` The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed '' he says .
He says that the issue is complex , `` because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose , publish or divulge , at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this . ''
The Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the `` final statement '' of the summit , but this was Humala 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
The ASPA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday .
`` Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts '' added Pi√±era , greeting Humala with a handshake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
Confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogot√° Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
`` The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega '' Santos said .
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country 's new President , Enrique Pe√±a Nieto .
Correa , who took part in the Eleventh Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) held in Lima , told Peru 's state television that Europeans `` killed one another in the Second World War '' and other conflicts , `` but are now practically one country . ''
`` I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious '' said the Ecuadorian President .
