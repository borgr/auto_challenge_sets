you shall not listen to the words of that prophet , or to that dreamer of dreams : for Yahweh your God proves you , to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .

but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .

and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his wickedness , by number .
forty stripes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then your brother should seem vile to you .
how he met you by the way , and struck the hindmost of you , all who were feeble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he didn 't fear God .

the fruit of your ground , and all your labors , shall a nation which you don 't know eat up ; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always ;
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
the foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
these are the words of the Covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .

if your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens , from there will Yahweh your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :

Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow : a very great confusion .
now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishvi , and Malchishua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :

David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .

Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spear into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Abner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .

it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .

David struck the land , and saved neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the cattle , and the donkeys , and the camels , and the clothing ; and he returned , and came to Achish .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .

then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on camels and fled .
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa , behold , Saul was leaning on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him .
they mourned , and wept , and fasted until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Yahweh , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .

the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . they told David , saying , " The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead , and said to them , " blessed are you by Yahweh , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .

Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .

it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall stir yourself up ; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "

Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the office of trust over the things that were baked in pans .
these are the singers , heads of fathers ' households of the Levites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
so David didn 't move the Ark to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . "
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed @-@ Edom with joy .
so he left there , before the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @-@ eight .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons : Shimri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him chief ) ,

Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness .
moreover the bronze altar , that Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where Yahweh appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engraved cherubim on the walls .
the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : the wing of the one was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
he set up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent ; these the priests the Levites brought up .
King Solomon and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled to him , were before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and cattle , that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
" now , my God , let , I beg you , your eyes be open , and let your ears be attentive , to the prayer that is made in this place .
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
as for all the people who were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ;
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen .
however I didn 't believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me : you exceed the fame that I heard .
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
it happened , when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established , and he was strong , that he forsook the law of Yahweh , and all Israel with him .
King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
ought you not to know that Yahweh , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebelled against his lord .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it happened , that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yahweh gave them rest all around .
in the thirty @-@ ninth year of his reign ASA was diseased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he didn 't seek Yahweh , but to the physicians .
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Judah , the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand ;
it happened , when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
it happened after this , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them some of the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , the Levite , of the sons of Asaph , in the midst of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites , stood up to praise Yahweh , the God of Israel , with an exceeding loud voice .
now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and various also of the princes of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab ; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh .
it happened , when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab , that he found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah , ministering to Ahaziah , and killed them .
they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the heads of fathers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yahweh 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yahweh , except the priests , and those who minister of the Levites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Yahweh 's instructions .
the Levites shall surround the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . whoever comes into the house , let him be slain . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then Amaziah separated them , the army that had come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in fierce anger .
the children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem . he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and killed him there .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yahweh , God made him to prosper .
he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
the whole number of the heads of fathers ' households , even the mighty men of valor , was two thousand and six hundred .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he didn 't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , like David his father ;
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh , and out of the house of the king and of the princes , and gave it to the king of Assyria : but it didn 't help him .
Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they didn 't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty @-@ five years old ; and he reigned twenty @-@ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh , and turned their backs .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshiped .
they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
for Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
all the assembly of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Judah , rejoiced .
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to frighten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his good deeds , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz , in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , as did Manasseh his father ; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh ; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house ;
" thus says Yahweh , ' behold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
but to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Yahweh , thus you shall tell him , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : " as touching the words which you have heard ,
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fathers ' house of the Levites .
they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Yahweh , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all one hundred thirty @-@ nine .
of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings .
I decreed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
then when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to Darius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
then the same Sheshbazzar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land , to seek Yahweh , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
now these are the heads of their fathers ' households , and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king :
watch , and keep them , until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites , and the princes of the fathers ' households of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the rooms of the house of Yahweh . "
when I heard this thing , I tore my garment and my robe , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down confounded .
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days ; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven ,
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
Malchijah the son of Rechab , the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem repaired the Dung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bolts , and its bars .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
they all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
of the priests : the children of Hobaiah , the children of Hakkoz , the children of Barzillai , who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name .
moreover , in a pillar of cloud you led them by day ; and in a pillar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept your law , nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their kingdom , and in your great Goodness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their wicked works .
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
and to bring the first fruits of our ground , and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yahweh ;
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Colhozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of the Shilonite .
the sons of Levi , heads of fathers ' households , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets : Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them ; so that the Levites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
there lived men of Tyre also therein , who brought in fish , and all kinds of wares , and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus ( this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @-@ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not compulsory ; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
in those days , while Mordecai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthan and Teresh , who were doorkeepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus .
then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king 's eunuchs , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mordecai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart , but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he didn 't stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wrath against Mordecai .
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
on that night , the king couldn 't sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
then Esther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
they killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
Yahweh said to Satan , " Where have you come from ? " then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , " From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . "
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its twilight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the morning ,
" my soul is weary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the womb ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune . it is ready for them whose foot slips .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the soles of my feet ,
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the neck , and dashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
that for which he labored he shall restore , and shall not swallow it down . according to the substance that he has gotten , he shall not rejoice .
in the fullness of his sufficiency , distress shall overtake him . the hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him .
he draws it forth , and it comes out of his body . yes , the glittering point comes out of his liver . Terrors are on him .
he works to the north , but I can 't see him . he turns south , but I can 't catch a glimpse of him .
then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . his wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God .

for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt treacherously with you ; even they have cried aloud after you : Don 't believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
it shall happen , after that I have plucked them up , I will return and have compassion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
then I went to the Euphrates , and dug , and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it ; and behold , the belt was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Judah is carried away captive , all of it ; it is wholly carried away captive .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sorrows take hold of you , as of a woman in travail ?
I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have bereaved them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they didn 't return from their ways .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday : I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly .
for thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bore them , and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land :
and you have done evil more than your fathers ; for , behold , you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart , so that you don 't listen to me :
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is engraved on the tablet of their heart , and on the horns of your altars ;
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the Potter , he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them .
if they do that which is evil in my sight , that they not obey my voice , then I will repent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the gate Harsith , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you ;
then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yahweh .
behold , I am against you , O inhabitant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Yahweh ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
say , Hear the word of Yahweh , king of Judah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel ? is he a vessel in which none delights ? why are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into the land which they don 't know ?
I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
concerning the prophets . my heart within me is broken , all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yahweh , and because of his holy words .
the anger of Yahweh shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly .
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : like these good figs , so will I regard the captives of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans , for good .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not listened , nor inclined your ear to hear )
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the Uz , and all the kings of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gaza , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings .
to listen to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not listened ;
and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Yahweh , saying ,
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh ,
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
thus says Yahweh of Armies , the God of Israel , to all the captivity , whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon :
out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
behold , the storm of Yahweh , his wrath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall burst on the head of the wicked .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thigh : I was ashamed , yes , even confounded , because I bore the reproach of my youth .
behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of animal .
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terror ;
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , by which they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , by which they have sinned against me , and by which they have transgressed against me .
the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty to them ;
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess , go free ; that none should make bondservants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus says Yahweh , the God of Israel : I made a Covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab , our father , in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , or our daughters ;
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
the princes were angry with Jeremiah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe ; for they had made that the prison .
so they drew up Jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
then came all the princes to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city , the deserters also who fell away to him , and the residue of the people who remained .
but Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yahweh ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yahweh .
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him , with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans who were found there , the men of war .
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
now it happened that , when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
Don 't be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don 't be afraid of him , says Yahweh : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
it happened that , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God , with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Judah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they didn 't obey the voice of Yahweh : and they came to Tahpanhes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mortar in the brick work , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
they are not humbled even to this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
for I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
then Jeremiah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
of Egypt : concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah .
why have I seen it ? they are dismayed and are turned backward ; and their mighty ones are beaten down , and have fled Apace , and don 't look back : terror is on every side , says Yahweh .
the nations have heard of your shame , and the earth is full of your cry ; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty , they are fallen both of them together .
therefore behold , the days come , says Yahweh , that I will send to him those who pour off , and they shall pour him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles in pieces .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bozrah : and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
your mother shall be utterly disappointed ; she who bore you shall be confounded : behold , she shall be the least of the nations , a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
I have laid a snare for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you weren 't aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have striven against Yahweh .
Yahweh has opened his armory , and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation ; for the Lord , Yahweh of Armies , has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans .
against him who bends let the archer bend his bow , and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail : and don 't spare her young men ; utterly destroy all her army .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don 't be cut off in her iniquity : for it is the time of Yahweh 's vengeance ; he will render to her a recompense .
her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man dwells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be confounded ; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
for through the anger of Yahweh it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
and he burned the house of Yahweh , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
the Chaldeans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty @-@ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
she weeps bitterly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; they are become her enemies .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! he has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel , And hasn 't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has swallowed up Israel ; He has swallowed up all her palaces , he has destroyed his strongholds ; He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground , they keep silence ; They have cast up dust on their heads ; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
look , Yahweh , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are dandled in the hands ? shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
the tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these pine away , stricken through , for want of the fruits of the field .
the anger of Yahweh has scattered them ; he will no more regard them : they didn 't respect the persons of the priests , they didn 't favor the elders .
rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwell in the land of Uz : the cup shall pass through to you also ; you shall be drunken , and shall make yourself naked .
now it happened in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures . this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot ; and they sparkled like burnished brass .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above .
not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . surely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another , and the noise of the wheels beside them , even the noise of a great rushing .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me .
but you , son of man , behold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bind you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
and lay siege against it , and build forts against it , and cast up a mound against it ; set camps also against it , and plant battering rams against it all around .
for I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred ninety days : so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all your abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remnant of you will I scatter to all the winds .
he who is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty ; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be profaned .
then I looked , and see , in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh 's glory .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone .
as for the likeness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar , their appearances and themselves ; they went every one straight forward .
and you shall know that I am Yahweh : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh .
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
as for your birth , in the day you were born your navel was not cut , neither were you washed in water to cleanse you ; you weren 't salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
you also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the prostitute with them ;
that you have slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
you have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians , your neighbors , great of flesh ; and have multiplied your prostitution , to provoke me to anger .
they shall burn your houses with fire , and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute , and you shall also give no hire any more .
your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who dwells at your right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their abominations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
that you may bear your own shame , and may be ashamed because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfort to them .
that you may remember , and be confounded , and never open your mouth any more , because of your shame , when I have forgiven you all that you have done , says the Lord Yahweh .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
and has not wronged any , but has restored to the debtor his pledge , has taken nothing by robbery , has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
neither has wronged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hooks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
in that day I swore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
I said to their children in the wilderness , Don 't walk in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their ordinances , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with wrath poured out ;
it is given to be furbished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpened , yes , it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner ; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow .
one has committed abomination with his neighbor 's wife ; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter @-@ in @-@ law ; and another in you has humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
and they played the prostitute in Egypt ; they played the prostitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bosom of their virginity .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bosom of her virginity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
for thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate , into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated ;
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
then set it empty on its coals , that it may be hot , and its brass may burn , and that its filthiness may be molten in it , that its rust may be consumed .
she has wearied [ herself ] with toil ; yet her great rust doesn 't go forth out of her ; her rust doesn 't [ go forth ] by fire .
in your filthiness is lewdness : because I have cleansed you and you weren 't cleansed , you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more , until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest .
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth Jeshimoth , Baal Meon , and Kiriathaim ,
she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yahweh ; and she shall become a spoil to the nations .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the sword ; and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they were the merchants of your hand ; in lambs , and rams , and goats , in these were they your merchants .
all who handled the oar , the mariners , [ and ] all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust on their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall defile your brightness .
they shall bring you down to the pit ; and you shall die the death of those who are slain , in the heart of the seas .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and tore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thighs . "
and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the base of the kingdoms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
in that day will I cause a Horn to bud forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst ; and they shall know that I am Yahweh .
in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid ; and there shall be anguish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , behold , it comes .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break the arms of Pharaoh , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field ; and its boughs were multiplied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his wickedness .
they also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations .
it happened in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yahweh came to me , saying ,
when I shall extinguish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall ; the terrible of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multitude shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste , a land destitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Yahweh .
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the earth , with those who go down into the pit .
whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit , and her company is around her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Edom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with those who go down to the pit .
nevertheless , if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he doesn 't turn from his way ; he shall die in his iniquity , but you have delivered your soul .
I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , so that none shall pass through .
they were scattered , because there was no shepherd ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were scattered .
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet .
I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the animals of the earth devour them ; but they shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plantation for renown , and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land , neither bear the shame of the nations any more .
because you have had a perpetual enmity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time of the iniquity of the end ;
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more , says the Lord Yahweh .
I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your doings that were not good ; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
the hand of Yahweh was on me , and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh , and set me down in the midst of the valley ; and it was full of bones .
you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
it shall happen in that day , when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yahweh , that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one Reed broad ; and the other threshold , one Reed broad .
and a border before the lodges , one cubit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cubit on that side ; and the lodges , six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
[ from ] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside , one hundred cubits , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty @-@ five cubits .
the arches of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around .
as for the temple , the door posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temple ] .
the doors had two leaves [ apiece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it all around .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shined with his glory .
you shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yahweh , a young bull for a sin offering .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh : and I fell on my face .
thus says the Lord Yahweh : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without blemish ; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who errs , and for him who is simple : so you shall make Atonement for the house .
when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part westward .
now when I had returned , behold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh , to the Brook [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Issachar , one ; the gate of Zebulun , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ reeds ] , with their three gates : the gate of Gad , one ; the gate of Asher , one ; the gate of Naphtali , one .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's dainties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's dainties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the enchanters , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tunics , and their mantles , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his concubines , drank from them .
in the same hour came forth the fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thighs were loosened , and his knees struck one against another .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very displeased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and behold , there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
as I was considering , behold , a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth , and didn 't touch the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two horns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fury of his power .
yes , it magnified itself , even to the prince of the army ; and it took away from him the continual [ burnt offering ] , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the continual [ burnt offering ] through disobedience ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleasure ] and prospered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
yes , while I was speaking in prayer , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me didn 't see the vision ; but a great quaking fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty @-@ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his reproach to turn on him .
in his place shall stand up a contemptible person , to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall profane the sanctuary , even the fortress , and shall take away the continual [ burnt offering ] , and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many [ countries ] shall be overthrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
from the time that the continual burnt offering shall be taken away , and the abomination that makes desolate set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days .
Lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
therefore the land will mourn , and everyone who dwells therein will waste away. all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
let us acknowledge Yahweh . let us press on to know Yahweh . as surely as the sun rises , Yahweh will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he doesn 't realize it . indeed , gray hairs are here and there on him , and he doesn 't realize it .
for they sow the wind , and they will reap the whirlwind . he has no standing grain . the stalk will yield no head . if it does yield , strangers will swallow it up .
" all their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them . because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
I drew them with cords of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks ; and I bent down to him and I fed him .
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger . I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of you ; and I will not come in wrath .
they will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yahweh .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor , and like the smoke out of the chimney .
the sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him . he is an unwise son ; for when it is time , he doesn 't come to the opening of the womb .
a fire devours before them , and behind them , a flame burns . the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them , a desolate wilderness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obeys his command ; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yahweh , your God , who has dealt wondrously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah , and they will sell them to the men of Sheba , to a faraway nation , for Yahweh has spoken it . "
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it will devour its palaces , with shouting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the whirlwind ;
neither shall he stand who handles the bow ; and he who is swift of foot won 't escape ; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself ;
can a bird fall in a trap on the earth , where no snare is set for him ? does a snare spring up from the ground , when there is nothing to catch ?
" for in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him , I will also visit the altars of Bethel ; and the horns of the altar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
Woe to those who are at ease in Zion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samaria , the notable men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
who lie on beds of Ivory , and stretch themselves on their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
thus the Lord Yahweh showed me : and behold , he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and behold , it was the latter growth after the king 's harvest .
it will happen in that day , " says the Lord Yahweh , " that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day .
they will wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yahweh , and will not find it .
" for , behold , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations , as grain is sifted in a sieve , yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth .
in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
but don 't look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don 't rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction . Don 't speak proudly in the day of distress .
Don 't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity . Don 't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity , neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity .
the news reached the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and took off his royal robe , covered himself with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with sackcloth , both man and animal , and let them cry mightily to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
then Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a booth , and sat under it in the shade , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yahweh God prepared a vine , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shade over his head , to deliver him from his discomfort . so Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the vine .
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then they will cry to Yahweh , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their deeds evil . "
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not divine ; and the sun will go down on the prophets , and the day will be black over them .
but as for me , I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh , and of judgment , and of might , to declare to Jacob his disobedience , and to Israel his sin .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh 's temple will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be exalted above the hills ; and peoples will stream to it .
he shall stand , and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh , in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the earth .
they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in its gates . he will deliver us from the Assyrian , when he invades our land , and when he marches within our border .
Don 't trust in a neighbor . Don 't put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your embrace , be careful of the words of your mouth !
for the son dishonors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law ; a man 's enemies are the men of his own house .
I will bear the indignation of Yahweh , because I have sinned against him , until he pleads my case , and executes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righteousness .
they will lick the dust like a serpent . like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens . they will come with fear to Yahweh our God , and will be afraid because of you .
Yahweh is slow to anger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished . Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
their horses also are swifter than leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves . their horsemen press proudly on . yes , their horsemen come from afar . they fly as an eagle that hurries to devour .
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ramparts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hurries toward the end , and won 't prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will surely come . it won 't delay .
Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of evil !
their wealth will become a spoil , and their houses a desolation . yes , they will build houses , but won 't inhabit them . they will plant vineyards , but won 't drink their wine .
Yahweh will be awesome to them , for he will famish all the gods of the land . men will worship him , everyone from his place , even all the shores of the nations .
but I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people , and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh .
the remnant of Israel will not do iniquity , nor speak lies , neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth , for they will feed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "
" speak now to Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua , the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
'Consider , please , from this day and backward , from the twenty @-@ fourth day of the ninth month , since the day that the foundation of Yahweh 's temple was laid , consider it .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , the prophet , saying ,
( and behold , a talent of lead was lifted up ) ; and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah basket . "
the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth : and he said , " Go around and through the earth ! " so they walked back and forth through the earth .
" take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah , where they have come from Babylon .
and speak to him , saying , ' Thus says Yahweh of Armies , " behold , the man whose name is the Branch : and he shall grow up out of his place ; and he shall build Yahweh 's temple ;
Ashkelon will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will writhe in agony ; as will Ekron , for her expectation will be disappointed ; and the king will perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon will not be inhabited .
Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for they are like the jewels of a crown , lifted on high over his land .
they shall be as mighty men , treading down muddy streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , because Yahweh is with them ; and the riders on horses will be confounded .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon ; and there won 't be room enough for them .
but he will say , ' I am no prophet , I am a tiller of the ground ; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth . '
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
so will be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the Camel , and of the donkey , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that plague .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , and to keep the feast of tents .
it will be , that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn 't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King , Yahweh of Armies , on them there will be no rain .
Yahweh will cut off , to the man who does this , him who wakes and him who answers , out of the tents of Jacob , and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies .
I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yahweh of Armies .
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and behold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and worshiped him . opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father , Herod , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Galilee ,
" even now the axe lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that doesn 't bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
" you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
agree with your adversary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
but I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you ,
" be careful that you don 't do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @-@ in @-@ law against her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and didn 't see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and didn 't hear them .
but because he couldn 't pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
" for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we wouldn 't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
then the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas .
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
those who passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads ,
now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat mending the nets .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the Mat that the paralytic was lying on .
it happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields , and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of grain .
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fetters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clothed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legion ; and they were afraid .
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
from there he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . he entered into a house , and didn 't want anyone to know it , but he couldn 't escape notice .
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
for whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna , into the fire that will never be quenched--
if your eye causes you to stumble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire ,
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first commandment .
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch .
it was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread , and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception , and kill him .

for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wouldn 't be able to give an account of this commotion . "

for Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hastening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .

on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caesarea . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .

embarking in a ship of Adramyttium , which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
after they had hoisted it up , they used cables to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars , they lowered the sea anchor , and so were driven along .
but when the fourteenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land .
casting off the anchors , they left them in the sea , at the same time untying the rudder ropes . Hoisting up the foresail to the wind , they made for the beach .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three taverns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .

now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
without being weakened in faith , he didn 't consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the deadness of Sarah 's womb .
knowing this , that our old man was crucified with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin .
or don 't you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwells no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don 't find it doing that which is good .
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don 't walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you . but if any man doesn 't have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
for if you live after the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
as he says also in Hosea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' beloved , ' who was not beloved . "
and how will they preach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace , who bring glad tidings of good things ! "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
be of the same mind one toward another . Don 't set your mind on high things , but associate with the humble . Don 't be wise in your own conceits .
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe 's household , that there are contentions among you .
for seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn 't know God , it was God 's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe .
but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to shame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don 't judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you didn 't receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sanctified . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
Don 't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the distress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
but food will not commend us to God . for neither , if we don 't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a vineyard , and doesn 't eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and doesn 't drink from the flock 's milk ?
Don 't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ?
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
the cup of blessing which we bless , isn 't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , isn 't it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
you can 't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . you can 't both partake of the table of the Lord , and of the table of demons .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord .
Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
who comforts us in all our affliction , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
for our boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in holiness and sincerity of God , not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more abundantly toward you .
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
while we don 't look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I listened to you , in a day of salvation I helped you . " behold , now is the acceptable time . behold , now is the day of salvation .
but I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
for though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they boast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bondage , if he devours you , if he takes you captive , if he exalts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don 't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? --unless indeed you are disqualified .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Good News which was preached by me , that it is not according to man .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
to an administration of the fullness of the times , to sum up all things in Christ , the things in the heavens , and the things on the earth , in him ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Good News of your salvation--in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
of which I was made a servant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their hearts ;
but if I live on in the flesh , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don 't know what I will choose .
who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and travail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man doesn 't obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
( but if a man doesn 't know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ;
for God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
by faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him .
by faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . he went out , not knowing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
by faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising its shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees ,
and the tongue is a fire . the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna .
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit .
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
for if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but the heavens that now are , and the earth , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
Don 't love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love isn 't in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , isn 't the Father 's , but is the world 's .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever doesn 't do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who doesn 't love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who doesn 't love his brother remains in death .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eternal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . to him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of my God .
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
" to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a flame of fire , and his feet are like burnished brass , says these things :
he who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments , and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life , and I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne , the living creatures , and the elders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
when he opened the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God , and for the testimony of the lamb which they had .
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
for the power of the horses is in their mouths , and in their tails . for their tails are like Serpents , and have heads , and with them they harm .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as sweet as honey in my mouth . when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
from among the peoples , tribes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
the great dragon was thrown down , the old serpent , he who is called the devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crowns , and on his heads , blasphemous names .
the beast which I saw was like a Leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
all who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into captivity , he will go into captivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the slave , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their foreheads ;
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished .
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , something like frogs ;
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
and on her forehead a name was written , " mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of the prostitutes and of the ABOMINATIONS of the Earth . "
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the prostitute , and will make her desolate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality , the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury . "
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great prostitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
