the Foundation has a tripartite Administrative Board , made up of representatives from public authorities ( governments and the European Commission ) , employer organisations and trade unions .
the EUMC operates a European information network on racism and xenophobia ( RAXEN ) which collects information at national level.Raxen consists of 25 national focal points , one in each EU Member State .
the Board is responsible for establishing the Authority 's draft budget and work programmes , monitoring their implementation , and agreeing to internal rules and regulations.It also appoints EFSA 's Executive Director and the members of the Scientific Committee and panels .
the Executive Director is the legal representative of the Authority and answers to the Management Board.Appointed for five years , which are renewable , he is responsible for the day @-@ to @-@ day management of the Authority and all staff matters .
EFSA 's scientific opinions and advice are provided by the Scientific Committee ( SC ) and eight scientific panels , each competent in a specific area of risk assessment.The Scientific Committee coordinates the work of the panels and addresses transversal issues relevant to all ( e.g.methodology for exposure assessment ) .

Requiringfirms to compete with each other fosters innovation , reduces production costs , increaseseconomic efficiency and , consequently , enhances the competitiveness of the European economy , particularly vis @-@ à @-@ vis its main trading partners .
the propagation of thecompetitive process thus helps to consolidate the industrial fabric of the internal market and , in so doing , provides clear back @-@ up to employment policies .
aid is in principle prohibited by the Treaty if , by favouring certain firms , it is liable to cause damage to their competitors in other Member States , which in some casesmight go as far as to jeopardise their very survival and , consequently , the jobs of their
I have asked for the establishment of an aid register listingall of the Commission 's decisions concerning State aid , and of a scoreboard which would enableit to be seen whether Member States are complying with the State aid rules .
given their knowledge of the day @-@ to @-@ day functioning of markets , in particular those in mass @-@ market consumer goods , consumerorganisations are able to provide the Commission with information of interest to the Community by raising complaints or through informal contact .
such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which distort competition .
Forexample , a price @-@ fixing agreement between Bakers in a given town will not haveany impact on the Community market , and European law is therefore notapplicable to this kind of situation .
in some cases , this power is shared with the Member States " own competitionauthorities and law courts ( articles 81 and 82 ) , while in others it liesexclusivelywith the Commission ( merger control , monitoring of State aid ) .
for the control of large @-@ scalemergers , the Member States considered it necessary to create a one @-@ stop shop.They appointed the European Commission to that end .
in the area of its anti @-@ trustoperations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibitan agreement orto issue an injunctionthat a restrictive practice be stopped , but also to imposefineson firms found guilty of anti @-@ competitive conduct .
forms of distribution . in those circumstances , enterprises no longer have to be reallycompetitive and have no incentive to innovate or reduce production costs .
the crisis thus affects employees , subcontractors and traders.Moreover , artificially high prices affect the costs of intermediate consumers , who are adversely affected by their suppliers " anti @-@ competitive behaviour .
if an agreement fulfils the following conditions , it is void : it is concluded between firms or " undertakings " ;
under Community law , an individual agreement between firms can be exempted , and so can categories of agreements of the same nature , such as distributionagreements for example .
in this case , the anti @-@ competitive practice harmed firms outside the cartel , which were systematically excludedfrom calls for tenders , as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers .
after the new venture has been set up , businesses such asbanks , supermarkets or travel agencies will be able to offer British consumers interactive services via television . access to the services will be through a decoder .
in this case , the Commissionsought to make it easier for new digital interactive television services to developwhile at the same time ensuring that there was competition on the market .
on 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Frenchcommittee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 1998.The committee , the CFO , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event thatincluded ticket sales .
persons not resident in France who wished to see the finalswere thus at a severedisadvantage compared withpersons resident in France.The Commission thereforeruled against the CFO .
Mergers which create or strengthen a dominantposition , however , are prohibited by the Treaty inorder to prevent ensuing abuses . a firm is in adominant position when it is able to act on themarket without having to take account of thereaction of its competitors , suppliers orcustomers .
it must be borne inmind that the Commission 's objective in the merger control field is to preserve asituation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be aguarantee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
the Community dimension of a merger or acquisition isassessed using thresholds based on the turnover of the companies involved.The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EUR 5 000 million ) and the Community @-@ wide threshold ( EUR 250 million ) .
since theentry into force of the merger regulation , the Commission has seen thenumber of notifications grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
regulation authorise the transaction or , if it thinks that a dominant position might be created or strengthened , to initiate a four @-@ month investigation procedure .
( more than 90 % ) .
Insome cases , the merger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen adominant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a solutionto the competition concerns raised by the Commission .
in both the Finnish and Austrian cases , the Commissionconsidered that the merger of these retail chains would have created adominant position ; in the Finnish case , it decided to prohibit the transaction , while in the Austrian case it accepted the remedies proposed by the companies , which consisted essentially of the sale of certain outlets to competitors .
insurance policyholders and investors , especially in Italy , stand to benefit fromthe remedies proposed by the companies in the context of INA 's acquisition by Generali ; both companies are large international insurance firms .
the merging of theoperations of the two main players in the French petroleum products sector wouldhave created a dominant position onseveral markets . after the merger , TotalFina
lastly , TotalFina and Elfwould have become the leader on the market for LPG , used for heating . in orderto resolve the competition problems identified , TotalFina / elf undertook to sell alarge proportion of the operations concerned to competitors .
in a sector of the economy which is experiencingrapid growth driven by the emergence of the Internet and of electroniccommerce , the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is a source ofcompetitiveness and new jobs .

difference in the price of the same vehicle depending on whether it is bought in my country of residence or in the other Member State .
however , the purpose of monitoring aid is not to undermine the viability of firms . on the contrary , the goal is to ensure that firms recover a lasting vitality .
in some sectors , for example air transport and telecommunications , liberalisationhas clearly brought benefits to consumers , in terms of prices and the services on offer , without calling into question flight safety or access to telecommunications
so the public has gained agreat deal from the policy of liberalisation : lower prices , a wider range of services , more efficient services and a guarantee of government scrutiny .
you may bring the problem to the attention of a consumer organisation.If the restriction of competition appreciably affects the common market , it is likely that the consumer organisation will already have received a number of similar complaints or letters .

the benefits are estimated using several methods , for examplecalculating the " avoided damage " : the reduction in cases of asthma or use of primary materials .
the figures span a very wide range , simply because it is extremely difficult , for example , to measure the impact of air pollution . Inthe same way , it is almost impossible to give a monetary value toa human life .

candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU Member States and regions under Cohesion Policy instruments .
a significant share of IPA funds managed by the DGs for Regional Policy and Employment are allocated to Lisbon @-@ type expenditure ( roughly 15 to 20 % of the overall programme allocation , depending on the country ) .
components III , IV and V are open to candidate countries only ( namely the Republic of Croatia , the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
by gaining first @-@ hand experience at running these programmes , they will be well placed to absorb future structural , cohesion and rural development funds once they become available to them .
a quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Component III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance .
investment aid in candidate countries is only a fraction of the level of investment assistance available to Member States2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
it gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in devising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of Structural Fund programmes .
the project will serve a population of approximately 444 000 inhabitants
as a result of the Regional Development component of pre @-@ accession assistance , a precursor to the Structural and Cohesion Funds , a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a gear through pre @-@ accession funding from the countries concerned , is responsible for running the programme , supported by a Secretariat staffed from both sides of the border .
in this context , projects related to the Roma people , or to shared river basins like the Danube and Tisza , could be developed in the IPA crossborder programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local , crossborder area .
in line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future Structural Funds implementation , the IPA crossborder programmes will mirror Structural Funds rules as closely as possible. is means firstly that the programmes are run on a multiannual basis .

average ( 12 NUTS1 II Regions ) .
it then attributes a competitiveness index for each region by applying a coefficient to each one. e result is a map showing differing levels of competitiveness between regions. is is then colour coded into five groups , where the lightest shade represents the lowest level of competitiveness .

they should also commit themselves explicitly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assurance , in their work . "
the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
as will be explained in these chapters , external and internal evaluations are often very closely interrelated ; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other , or each might draw on the other 's findings .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out externally .
this chapter will therefore consider the following : the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evaluators ; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria ; the precise scope of external evaluation ; the procedures and mechanisms on which it relies ; the frequency of external evaluation .
the " Standard for initial Teacher Education : benchmark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have attained at the end of their programmes .
either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries , except in France , Latvia ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) and Iceland ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) .
Germany : only evaluations of bachelor 's- and master 's @-@ type programmes are used for the purpose of accreditation ( or re @-@ accreditation ) .
in Wales , the aim is to complete the current cycle of inspections by 2008 , after which a different cycle will be introduced . United Kingdom ( SCT ) : ( 1 ) relates to evaluation of all higher education institutions ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation of institutions for initial teacher education .
in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occurs at regular intervals and another whose frequency varies .
in teacher training colleges , internal evaluation is carried out by the college council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
Cyprus : the Figure relates solely to the internal evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education.Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Iceland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in Figure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the faculties or departments concerned .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should consist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
chapter 3 -Internal Evaluation of initial Teacher Education
while the use of the external evaluation criteria for annual evaluation is optional in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , internally devised criteria will generally not differ dramatically from them .
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification frameworks for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , the outcomes of the General Teaching Council for Scotland process will in turn feed back into the internal quality assurance processes of the university .
however , there is no explicit mention of this having to happen - simply an expectation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curriculum is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropriateness of the course workload and the teachers ' and assistants " ability to deliver the course .
although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school placements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the selfevaluation report .
Greece : the information relates to the law on quality assurance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
Alternatively , it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evaluations , but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation . in Ireland , on the other hand , the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation .
the following aspects are dealt with in this chapter : the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes ; the availability of evaluation findings for their staff , students and the general public ; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole .
the level of funding may also vary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) .
this generally involves an obligation on the part of the institution to draw up a plan for improvement and fresh external evaluation after a given period of time , which varies from one country to the next .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re- ) accreditation decisions , conditional or temporary accreditation may be awarded in the case of non @-@ compliance with accreditation requirements .
for schools in partnership with the institution concerned
Czech Republic : ( 1 ) relates to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occurs prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) relates to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
according to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) relates to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursues several aims .
Germany : only the results of external evaluations to ( re- ) accredit bachelor 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 Länder ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nationally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illustrated in the examples below .
figure 5.1 : types of provider and regulations for the accreditation and / or evaluation of inservice teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
teacher unions or teacher associations
Belgium ( BE Fr ) : the information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
these two projects are currently being implemented .
in these two countries , regulations on both accreditation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
those referred to as " compulsory " in Figure 5.2 are common to all Autonomous Communities , whereas those termed " optional " reflect the situation of just some of them .
Belgium ( BE Fr ) : the information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
Italy : ( 1 ) refers to higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education , and ( 2 ) to teacher unions or associations and private @-@ sector training providers .
Lithuania : the draft regulations include almost all procedures on a compulsory basis . Slovenia : data refer to accreditation only .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee , the ministry of education , an independent body ( e.g. an audit agency ) working on behalf of the public authority , an inspectorate specifically established for school education or inservice teacher education , external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country .
in line with the decentralised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accreditation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Autonomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of inservice teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 Länder .
as regards evaluation and accreditation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many Länder have established or appointed central institutes or agencies for this task .
Finland : Inservice teacher education of at least 30 ECTS provided by higher education institutions may be accredited by the FINHEEC at the request of the provider .
in Hungary , the process occurs at three levels . at preparatory level , the organiser of the programme asks an expert from the National Register of Experts to give an opinion on it .
in a second stage , an expert from the Pedagógus @-@ továbbképzési Akkreditációs Testület ( In @-@ service Teacher Training Accrediting Body ) evaluates the programme in accordance with a guideline based on legal regulations and then prepares a proposal to the minister on the decision of approval of the programme .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practising teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during afternoons , weekends or summer .
an inspectorate for inservice teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @-@ Service Teacher Training ) , where it participates in evaluation along with other bodies .
in the French Community of Belgium , the Institut de la formation en cours de carriere , a community @-@ wide institution , organises and evaluates inservice teacher education , notably through its operators .
however , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in Figure 5.4 are not usually covered .
participants " opinions on the training they receive
Inservice teacher education abroad
the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accreditation of inservice teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
furthermore , the SuliNova Kht ( a non @-@ profit organisation ) monitors inservice teacher education programmes by means of a selfevaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervises and approves the National Centre of Inservice Training activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educational Authorities ( kuratoria ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of inservice teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the REA
the results of the accreditation and evaluation of inservice education may be used in different ways , with repercussions for institutions or programmes , similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education ( Chapter 4 ) .
in the Czech Republic , accreditation is awarded by the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Accreditation Commission .
the Ministry has the right to control the accredited programmes during the period of accreditation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in Poland , negative evaluation findings can result in the accreditation for a given institution to be withdrawn and the financial means planned for inservice courses to be channelled into other training institutions .

a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
the introduction of the two @-@ cycle ( bachelor / master ) structure in several Länder in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure .
later , it was established in a resolution passed in April 2005 that , in order to be granted this recognition , courses had to be structured in modules , accredited and therefore evaluated beforehand .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and compulsory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the definition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of inservice teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curriculum of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be attained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredited or certified .

monitoring the drug situation
starting from a highly heterogeneous group of drugs observatories across different continents , the endeavour is to extract the essence of their experience and to transmit the final result in such a way that it can be reinterpreted in other realities and conditions .
since the mid @-@ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @-@ based policy @-@ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
• countries that are or that may become candidates to EU membership ( 3 ) , and neighbourhood countries ( 4 ) that wish and / or need to prepare themselves to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ;
• countries that are part of other regional data collection systems on drugs , such as the Interamerican Drugs Observatory CICAD @-@ OAS , to assess their situation and to build strategies so as to improve and / or to consolidate their national observatories ;
) , and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities .
we must inform the reader of the following in relation to this publication :
• we do not offer a single model to be copied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sorts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a structured analysis of each national context .
a national drugs observatory ( NDO ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - factual , objective , reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and
) , and their consequences .
in 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
as such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transposition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .
to further this effort , the OID is embarking on a collaborative endeavor with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction to develop a methodological tool to
it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " elevator pitch " in Chapter 6 ) .
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the EMCDDA 's five key epidemiological indicators ;
however it is important to bear in mind that knowing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are merely long @-@ term goals .
• other national organisations for some ad hoc surveys and / or qualitative studies among drug users • laboratories for the identification of new drugs and their consequences • the national drugs observatory in its role of coordinator of the whole network .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see Figure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
• Carry out a formal review of data quality and availability at national level with an expert panel • compare results with international guidelines and standards
• working with quantitative data ; • analysing qualitative information ; • interpreting and putting together all sources of information .
while assessing the validity of the studies or surveys , special attention must be paid to possible biases , or non @-@ random or systematic errors , entering into the data .
• interpreting statistical data and placing it in context ; • providing insight into the problems and needs associated with a range of drug @-@ using patterns ; • assessing the context in which interventions may be more effective ; and • helping to evaluate the drug users experience of interventions ; • understanding new drug using phenomena ; • providing insight into drugs markets .
6 working @-@ day and seasonal variation from a time series (
to ensure sustainability and " buy @-@ in , " it is vital that the NDO ensures that it is perceived to be providing added value by its stakeholders and audiences - both at national and supranational level .
the reporting activity should be oriented towards the " clients " or stakeholders : the content and the structure of the report or output , its format , its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it .
once the stakeholders have been identified , it is necessary for the NDO to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
information covering a wide range of technical and methodological issues , structured and well documented contents , in a not @-@ too @-@ detailed format ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a compilation of documents ) .
every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @-@ defined. ned .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports questionnaires ( ARQ ) and it had been regularly reported to the CND ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
• clarify the process for delivery and identify the end benefi ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national coordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs coordinating body , etc . )
in countries where the NDO is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see Figure 7 ) :
when the NDO is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confidential note to the national drug coordinating body ( NDC ) - if relevant - or transmits the information through the normal channels .
get to know key journalists , build a long @-@ term relationship with them , be simple , try to understand their constraints and the way they think , so as to format the information for them .
• the organisational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @-@ production ) " ( 3 ) .
• when it is set up , in order to identify existing resources and means , as well as clarify the mandate for its establishment ;
• ensure that its partners derive mutual benefit from the data collection and reporting system : it is important partners are motivated to provide the data , as this has an impact on the quality of the data collected ;
are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confrontation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?
building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook of their clients , needs assessments or programmes / projects evaluations that could be useful to understand the situation ?
• to better combine the resources from national and local level , both in terms of data and of expertise , so as to consolidate the co @-@ production processes and the quality of publications and other outputs .
however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the choices to be made .
however , these tools are based on a pre @-@ requisite : do think about what you can already do with what you and your partners have , Don 'T say " I cannot do anything until I get more . "
• within national drug Coordination bodies or under government departments ; • within the Ministry of Health or within the National Institute for Public Health ; • within the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security ; • within a university or a non @-@ governmental organisation .
the latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution 's position than its performance .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the NDO will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the NDO 's capacity to deliver outputs and be accountable for the use of funds .
if the NDO is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
there are no institutional models to be copied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to formalise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region .
the Inter @-@ American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICAD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) in 1986 as the western hemisphere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
the 2007 ESPAD report substance use among students in 35 countries
summary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bundesländer ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( Flanders ) .
country sample sizes were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
in all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime , with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited comparability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
the total amount of alcohol consumed during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequencies .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom .
however , there are countries in which many students report heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days , while they were rather low on the ranking list for drunkenness for the same period .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more evenly distributed pattern , with spirits as the most important type , constituting about one third of the total consumption .
on average 43 % of the ESPAD students reported heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days , and this was more common among boys ( 47 % ) than among girls ( 39 % ) .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
there were gender differences in the frequencies of drunkenness within countries , with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others , while on the average ESPAD level there were no gender differences .
the most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal , where the proportion of students reporting heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 % , i.e. by 31 percentage points .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
countries in which many students report drunkenness this often include Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man , the United Kingdom and Austria , with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days drunkenness .
lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use .
in the two top @-@ prevalence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Isle of Man ) one in six students reported cannabis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular cannabis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @-@ 2 % in Armenia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @-@ prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe .
countries where many students report past 30 days cannabis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try cannabis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illicit drugs at least once during their lifetime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @-@ year cannabis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis @-@ related problems , and the average prevalence of high @-@ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from cannabis were found , and the percentage of high @-@ risk users in a population corresponds to the cannabis use prevalence rates in the single countries .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report nonprescribed use of these drugs ( 8 % versus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @-@ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @-@ variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level , quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illicit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ESPAD countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of cannabis between 2003 and 2007 .
students from Cyprus , the Isle of Man , Malta and Slovenia report the highest lifetime prevalence of inhalants in 2007 ( 16 % ) , while only 3 % mention this in Bulgaria , Lithuania and Ukraine .
the rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lifetime use relatively well across countries .
it is well known that , on the individual level , there is often a relationship between the use of different substances .
the overall substance @-@ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the variable in focus .
the upward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lifetime use of illicit drugs - predominantly cannabis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
the Faroe Islands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the variables .
summary western Europe and countries displaying increases are often found in eastern Europe .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illicit drug use is rising .
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult choices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
• the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , the WHO Regional Office for Europe , Interpol , the World Customs Organisation , the Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and other Drugs ( CAN ) , and the Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS ;
nearly 25 % of opioid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ageing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
overall range 0.8 % to 11.3 %
it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .
although data are limited , in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being causally related to cocaine use , and cocaine @-@ related deaths appeared to be increasing in all highprevalence countries .
sources : price data : Reitox national focal points.Infl ation and population data : http : / / epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu /
among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004 , cannabis was the primary reason for referral to treatment in about 15 % of all cases , making it the next most commonly reported drug after heroin .
the emergence of mCPP illustrates the fact that those involved in the production of illicit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chemicals that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to potentiate or modify the effects of MDMA ( ecstasy ) .
there are similarities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001 @-@ 04 action plan , conducted externally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and internally by the Institute for Drugs and Addiction ( IDT ) .

it is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the EMCDDA and Europol , will present annual progress reviews .
finally , the process will be participative , involving an evaluation steering group whose task will be to define the methodology , output and provisional calendar .
as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the steering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the EMCDDA and Europol , as well as representatives of the Member States .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise definition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
directive 91 / 308 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( 6 ) , adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modified in 2001 , attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among Member States .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
possession of more than 10 doses must be charged under Section 172 , which , depending on the aggravating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
in addition , the age of criminal liability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years .
difficulties in defining the quantity of a single dose and evidence that the exception has been misused in court to benefit drug dealers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors @-@ General dealt with cannabis @-@ related infringements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offenders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guideline on cannabis , " according to which possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the aforementioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder ( Schäfer and Paoli , 2006 ) .
see " The role of the quantity in the prosecution of drug offences , " an ELDD legal report , and Table 1 in " illicit drug use in the EU : legislative approaches , " an
other sentencing statistics showed that the waiving of reports as statutory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convictions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used cannabis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by stealing ( Kivivuori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed compulsory treatment , effectively decreasing the involvement of the probation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
statistics on sentencing , or avoidance of sentencing , give a far more accurate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see EMCDDA , 2002a ) .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
in most EU Member States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
over the same five @-@ year period , the number of offences for use / possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries , except Italy , Portugal , Slovenia , Bulgaria and Turkey , which reported a declining trend ( 19 ) .
countries where this is the case , cannabis @-@ related offences in 2004 accounted for 34 @-@ 87 % of all drug law offences .
chapter 1 : policies and laws at presenting a first insight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to underpin , support and explain to the population at large the rationale underlying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical guidance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @-@ based prevention ( e.g. in France and Ireland ) .
in this regard , it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense .
several Member States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the epidemiological situation that has been achieved by the EMCDDA @-@ driven development and implementation of indicator @-@ based monitoring , standardised reporting on responses is limited .
although the overall provision of substitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indications of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( Figure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see Chapter 6 ) .
32 receiving such treatment stabilised or decreased (
the reduction of drugrelated deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
according to the reports by NFPs ( 35 ) , objectives and target groups in national strategies also show a high level of synergy at the European level . besides drug injectors , target groups include sex workers and prisoners .
in the new central European Member States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @-@ injectors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent infectious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies widen the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services .
a similar specialised programme for amphetamine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA @-@ correlation project , supported by experts from the national focal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @-@ 08 action plan calls on Member States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes . "
although social measures are still a less well @-@ established response to problem drug use than treatment , interventions combining treatment , health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug user rehabilitation .
nonetheless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
the service most commonly offered to homeless problem drug users is access to " generic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries combine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from Member States converge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and precarious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social reintegration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the cannabis resin seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Senegal , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; INCB , 2006a ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe shows a continuous increase over the period 1999 @-@ 2004 , although in 2004 a majority of countries ( but not Spain )

( 52 ) See Table PPP @-@ 5 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ( 53 ) The average proportion was computed as the average of national prevalence rates weighted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illicit drugs , with the standard time frames , and frequency of use .
by contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 40.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lifetime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
50 % in the Czech Republic , Spain and France (
countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @-@ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lifetime prevalence ranges from 32 % to 40 % .
the lowest lifetime prevalence estimates ( less than 10 % ) occur in Greece , Cyprus , Sweden , Romania , Turkey and Norway ( 61 ) .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( EMCDDA , 2004a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily cannabis users .
other countries are also working on scales to assess intensive forms of cannabis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the EMCDDA is promoting collaboration in this area .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment ( 78
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @-@ onset users ( pre- to mid @-@ adolescence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( Von Sydow et al . , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2005 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe prevention for young people should not focus on cannabis alone , but should be aimed at preventing use of alcohol and tobacco too .
brief interventions are cost @-@ effective and may be particularly appropriate to cannabis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interventions may take the form of counselling , " cannabis courses " or even self @-@ help websites .
for example , the German website @-@ based counselling programme , Quit the Shit ( www.drugcom.de ) , is an innovative approach , using telematics , for cannabis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .
the average purity of amphetamine in 2004 varied from
93 and EUR 63 per gram , while its average purity (
ecstasy on average amphetamine purity for the period 1999 @-@ 2004 reveal overall downward trends in Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Finland and Norway and upward trends in Belgium , Germany , France , Italy , Hungary and Austria .
although the Netherlands remained in 2004 the main source of ecstasy for Europe and the world as a whole , ecstasy laboratories were also uncovered in Belgium , Estonia , Spain and Norway ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; UNODC , 2006 ) .
data on both number of amphetamine seizures and quantities of amphetamine seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on quantities of amphetamine seized were not available for Slovenia in 2004 ; data on number of amphetamine seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .

1 14 from 0.3 % to 12 % , with the Czech Republic ( 12 % ) and Estonia ( 6.1 % ) reporting the highest figures ( Figure 5 ) .
although the number of demands for treatment relating to the use of amphetamines and ecstasy is increasing , in general , this form of drug use is rarely the primary reason for
demands for treatment related to ecstasy use are reported to account for less than 1 % of all treatment demands in most countries , with the exception of Cyprus , Hungary , Ireland and Turkey , where ecstasy clients constitute between 4 % and 6 % of all clients seeking treatment .
reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people .
for example , in the United Kingdom , during the early 2000s , the number of shops selling hallucinogenic mushrooms increased , and by 2005 it was estimated that they were being sold in about 300 shops and market stalls across the country .
this is a common feature of hallucinogenic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to confine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for recreational purposes ( 130 ) .
in March 2001 the UN drug control system added GHB to the list of internationally controlled drugs , and as a result all EU Member States have been updating their legislation on this substance .
the shortage of prevalence data on GHB and ketamine suggests that use of these substances has stabilised at low levels in most countries .
Council Decision 2005 / 387 / JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange , risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances ( 1
however , the absence of accurate and comparable systems for recording deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of these substances limits the data available in this area .
the decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances so that measures applicable in the Member States for the control of narcotic and psychotropic substances ( 2 ) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances if appropriate .
the decision broadens the scope of , and replaces , the 1997 joint action ( 3 ) , which was devoted exclusively to new synthetic drugs .
assessment and control of new psychoactive substances was published in the Official Journal of the European Union ( OJ L 127 , 20.5.2005 , pp. 32 @-@ 37 ) and took effect on 21 May 2005 .

the first official notifications of the detection of mCPP were received by the EMCDDA and Europol in February / March 2005 , concerning samples collected in France and Sweden .
most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes directly from South America ( mainly Colombia ) or via Central America and the Caribbean . in 2004 , Suriname , Brazil , Argentina , Venezuela , Ecuador , Curaçao , Jamaica , Mexico , Guyana and Panama were reported as transit countries for cocaine imported into the EU ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; CND , 2006 ; INCB , 2006a ; Europol , 2006 ) .
although Spain and the Netherlands still play an important role as distribution points for the reporting countries (
data on both number of cocaine seizures and quantities of cocaine seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on number of cocaine seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .
data from diverse sources ( e.g. market indicators , treatment demands , deaths ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe better identified by focusing the analysis on groups in which drug use is concentrated , in particular young people living in urban areas .
among clients reporting primary use of opioids , 31 % in Italy , 42 % in the Netherlands and 44 % in the United Kingdom report a secondary cocaine use . among primary cocaine users , 28 % in Italy and 38 % in the United Kingdom report secondary use of opioids .
overall , most cocaine treatment demands in Europe are not related to crack cocaine : around 80 % of new outpatient cocaine clients are reported to be using cocaine hydrochloride ( cocaine powder ) , with less than 20 % using
the value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely unexplored , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
as cocaine use can escalate quickly , brief interventions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth exploring .
for example , one study of an innovative outreach treatment programme in Rotterdam ( Henskens , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for treating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .
Netherlands ( 167 ) . the average purity of heroin products has been fluctuating in most reporting countries ( 168 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
) See Table PPP @-@ 6 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ) In the period 1999 @-@ 2004 , data on heroin purity were available for at least three consecutive years : for brown heroin in the Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain ,
for example , in countries with a high proportion of stimulant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of injecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
despite their importance for public health , few countries provide estimates of injecting drug use at national
in some EU @-@ 15 Member States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
Opioid clients are reported to be marginalised in society , with low levels of education , high unemployment rates and often unstable accommodation ; Spain reports that 17 @-@ 18 % of opioid clients are homeless .
countries where a sizeable proportion of opioid clients are using substances other than heroin include Hungary , where the use of home @-@ made opium poppy products is widespread , and Finland , where most opioid clients are misusing
excluding the Czech Republic and France , where high @-@ dose buprenorphine treatment ( HDBT ) is reported to be the most common option , more than 90 % of treatments in all other countries were with methadone .
in France , where HIV cases have been recorded only since 2003 , there has been an increase in the incidence of HIV among IDUs ( albeit from a low level ) , from an estimated 2.3 cases per million population in 2003 to 2.9 cases in
41 % of a sample of 964 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and exceptionally high in another ( Kohtla @-@ Järve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
in Latvia , two time series of seroprevalence data among IDUs show a continued increase until 2002 / 03 while a third series suggests a decrease since the peak in 2001 .
since the mid1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see Chapter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of epidemic spread of HIV among injectors .
in 2003 @-@ 04 , prevalence rates of over 60 % among IDU samples were reported from Italy and Poland , while samples with prevalence rates of less than 20 % were recorded in Belgium , Ireland , Cyprus , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
in the Nordic region , the great majority of notified acute cases of hepatitis B occur among IDUs , and hepatitis B outbreaks have coincided with increases in drug injecting in several countries .
in Finland , hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years , possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system .
chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
the purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors , and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists .
mortality and drugrelated deaths
the study found a very high mortality among opioid users compared with their peers : 6 @-@ 20 times higher among males and 10 @-@ 50 times higher among females .
it was estimated that in six of the locations ( Amsterdam , Barcelona , Dublin , London , Rome and Vienna ) 10 @-@ 23 % of the overall mortality among adults aged 15 @-@ 49 years could be attributed to opioid use , mainly overdoses , AIDS and external causes ( accidents , suicides ) .
in this section , and in the EMCDDA protocol , the term " drugrelated deaths " refers to those deaths caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs and , generally , occurring shortly after the consumption of the substance ( s ) .
this trend is common in EU @-@ 15 Member States and has been observed since the early 1990s , although in Sweden and the United Kingdom it is less marked .
methadone deaths and Finland .
the EMCDDA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 203 ) .
national trends in drugrelated deaths can provide some insight into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country such as heroin epidemics and high @-@ risk behaviours ( e.g. injection ) , as well as treatment provision and even differences in heroin availability .
deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare , a fact that is attributed to the agonist @-@ antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives , although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important .
210 which should be considered as a minimum estimate (
although interpretations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries , these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection ( 209 ) .
research into the circumstances of overdoses has supported the development of interventions that target high @-@ risk situations or high @-@ risk individuals .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe methadone substitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce overdose deaths .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
nonetheless , it is linked to the various concepts of addiction by the understanding that someone behaving in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem user . "
while the PDU indicator still gives us a useful window on an important element of the drug problem , it is increasingly apparent that it needs further development to meet the requirements of monitoring today 's more heterogeneous
in terms of the current implementation of the PDU indicator across the EU , countries have adapted the definition to cover the practicalities of their local situation and the position is therefore heterogeneous .
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorporated into the monitoring exercise , beyond PDU monitoring .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods complement population survey work , which , for a range of methodological and practical reasons , is less suitable for estimating the prevalence of drug use that is of low prevalence , stigmatised and largely hidden .
under these circumstances , any monitoring of the component parts of problem drug use would need to include polydrug use as one of these separately measured components .
a second drug with a functional or pharmacological rationale is not confined to simultaneous use but may also be used consecutively , as a replacement or as a complementary drug .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
moreover , it should be borne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
these sorts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes , but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the composite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can encompass the target concept .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging Member States to develop and expand harm @-@ reduction activities .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most commonly consumed illicit drug by young and very young people .
drug use among those who are developing both physically and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompanying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings .
although some Member States have introduced schemes to divert offenders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
Europe remains the main global market for cannabis resin , most of which is produced in North Africa . herbal cannabis is also available in Europe ,
Coordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new intergovernmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine interdiction .
each year , around 400 cocaine @-@ related deaths are reported in Europe , and there is a suspicion that cardiovascular deaths in which cocaine has been an aggravating factor may go largely undetected .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher proportion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tripled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
the EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
increased prevalence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest prevalence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Worryingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @-@ 6 % in 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds ) .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
across Europe , HCV rates are high among injecting populations , and studies show that young injectors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @-@ using careers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems arising from lack of security .
reductions in cultivation can be achieved quickly but are reversed equally quickly .
overdose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoidable mortality among young adults .
of drug treatment data and drug overdoses suggests that the heroin @-@ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
this approach , which has been in place in other Member States ( e.g. Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benefited from the experience of earlier ones .
a noticeable trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two complementary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the new regulation clarifies the countries to which the EMCDDA can transfer its know @-@ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interventions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interventions and the importance given
there is also some activity in the area of developing indexes designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
however , a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess Coordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Coordination outcomes ( Kenis , 2006 ) .
the conceptualisation of both instruments has involved interesting methodological developments and has allowed a first insight into the use of overall indexes to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
a first observation is that such instruments can be useful for a longitudinal follow @-@ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be contextualised with the analysis of individual indicators within the indexes .
at the regional or local level , drug Coordination agencies and / or drug coordinators exist in most countries .
this figure is likely to underestimate the full extent of drug @-@ related public expenditure , given the high level of under @-@ reporting . the six countries included in Table 1 account for 76 % of the total public expenditure reported by EU Member States
and Norway . based on the data supplied by these six countries , the total drug @-@ related public expenditure by European countries is calculated to lie somewhere between

annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe on drug law offences , especially in relation to reporting and recording practices , i.e. what is recorded , when and how .
the Netherlands , Turkey and Norway , drug law offences related to dealing and trafficking are predominant , with these offences accounting for up to 92 % ( the Czech Republic ) of all drug law offences reported in 2005 .
in the Czech Republic , methamphetamine @-@ related offences predominated , accounting for 53 % of all drug law offences , while in Luxembourg cocaine was the most reported substance ( implicated in 35 % of drug law offences ) .
the term " reports " for drug law offences is given in quotation marks because it describes different concepts in different countries ( police reports of suspected drug law offenders , charges for drug law offences , etc . ) .
countries lacking data for two or more consecutive years are not included in the trend calculations : the overall trend is based on 24 countries ; the trend for heroin is based on 14 countries , cocaine on 14 , and cannabis on 15 .
the few references to neuroscientific research are primarily Dutch ; however , the French MILDT has also financed a series of research projects in this area .

approximately half ( 53 % ) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular cannabis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
about 80 % of outpatient treatment clients are male , with a mean age of around 30 years ( 28 years among those new to treatment ) , and their living conditions are generally poor compared with the general population of the same age .
residential services are , however , of growing importance in the care of elderly and long @-@ term drug users with complex treatment needs because of the coexistence of serious somatic and psychological co @-@ morbidity .
the philosophy of inpatient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .

it aims to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on a range of outcome measures and focuses on the analysis of which types of treatment pathways produce the best outcomes for particular subgroups of drug users .
however , it is of particular importance for the target group as it provides not only economic stability but also self @-@ esteem , status and a regular rhythm of life .
new ways of getting clients into paid work include forming partnerships with private enterprises , mentoring schemes and providing incentives such as Subsidising trainees " wages or giving business start @-@ up loans .
the reintegration of marginalised , ageing heroin users with high levels of somatic and mental illness poses a particular challenge .
in some countries ( e.g. Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , structured reintegration programmes are provided only as a follow @-@ on from successfully completed abstinence @-@ based drug dependence treatment , and specific reintegration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
one important element in this picture is the different cannabis products now available on the European market . historically , three main forms of cannabis have been common in Europe : cannabis resin ; herbal cannabis ; and , far less frequently , cannabis oil .
this is reflected in the fact that not all measures have gone in the direction of easing penalties and , in some countries , penalties have been made more severe or the current situation is under critical review .
young people increased in virtually all countries . however , some of the more recent data suggest that the upward trend is levelling off , albeit at historically high levels .
three measures of drug use over time are commonly used for reporting survey data . lifetime use or prevalence is the broadest .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using cannabis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in cannabis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10 @-@ 25 % ( 32
developing psychometric scales to identify intensive , dependent and problematic cannabis use in survey data there are important temporal differences between countries and waves of popularity observable in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 1960s ( 38 ) .
an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Reitox national report ) where a relatively high level of experimentation was reported in the 1970s among conscripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 1970s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
and , the approach of restricting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any precision .
however , this still provides only a blunt tool for identifying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of cannabis .
however , last year prevalence levels among young adults ( 16 @-@ 34 ) stabilised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 ( 20.0 % to 16.3 % ) .
levels of cannabis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom prevalence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time .
however , there are interesting variations between countries , with cannabis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France . for the remaining countries , in 12 the proportion of
see Tables TDI @-@ 22 and TDI @-@ 23 ( part i ) and ( part IV ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
there are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
concerns have been raised that it may be inappropriate to treat young cannabis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
in Denmark , smash is an anonymous support and counselling project for young cannabis users , intended to reduce the harmful effects , provide information and support to help them stop smoking cannabis ( 52
in 2005 , however , a majority of reporting countries recorded a downward trend in the number of amphetamine seizures made . this picture
data on seizures and quantities seized of amphetamine , ecstasy and LSD are not available for all countries for 2005 ; see the seizure tables in the 2007 statistical bulletin for more information . )
the ecstasy seized in Europe in 2005 is reported to come from these two countries and to a lesser extent from Poland and the United Kingdom .
in terms of measures of recent use , ecstasy is now the most commonly used synthetic drug in 17 European countries , and amphetamines in nine ( 63 ) .
in recent school surveys , increases in lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a progressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .
clients entering treatment for use of stimulants other than cocaine are on average around 27 years old ( 26 if they enter treatment for the first time ) and used the drug for the first time at an average age of 19 ( 83 ) .
see Table TDI @-@ 4 ( part II ) and TDI @-@ 5 ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversifying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .
estimates of cocaine use for shorter reference periods ( 98 ) suggest that in the last year , of the 3.5 million ( 2.4 % ) young adults who have used the drug , 1.5 million ( 1 % ) have used it in the last month .
the reported increase in last year cocaine prevalence in Spain since 2001 can be attributed to increased levels of use in the 15 @-@ 24 age group , rather than across 15 @-@ 34 year olds as a whole .
Netherlands indicate that , in some municipalities , cocaine has outstripped ecstasy among club @-@ goers as the most commonly used stimulant , with the drug gaining increased acceptability among some groups .

although small in number , crack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services .
detecting trends in both price and purity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 118 ) .
estimates of problematic cocaine use are scarce and the PDU indicator is , except in few high @-@ prevalence countries , likely to be less reliable for this drug . ) See Figure PDU @-@ 4 ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
of the other countries able to provide data , the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland and the United Kingdom , at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 , and the lowest figures from Cyprus , Hungary and the Netherlands , at under one case per 1 000 .
generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( TDI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requesting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 123 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
in the EU Member States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug substitution treatments was at least 585 000 . this estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service availability .
for EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005 , the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated ( Figure 10 ) .
based on the most recent data available , opioid users make up 40 @-@ 70 % of all treatment demands in 12 countries , less than 40 % in seven countries and more than 70 % in six countries ( 130
the percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen , decreasing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005 . the only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the
the absolute decrease of new opioids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the proportion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .
figure 10 : number of opioid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem opioid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be homeless .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initiation of opioid use before the age of 20 ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 was very uncommon ( 133 ) .
there are , though , no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to BZP . in March 2007 , the EU responded to rising concern over the use of BZP by

in Latvia , Lithuania and probably also in Estonia , rates of reported new IDU @-@ related infections have strongly declined since the epidemic peaks in 2001 @-@ 02 , although they are still high in comparison with most other countries .
in interpreting this data , a number of considerations should be borne in mind : infected IDUs may not be diagnosed if they are not in contact with health services ; new infections may not necessarily be attributed to drug injection ; and , the number of cases
support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analysing levels of HIV infection in samples of new IDUs ( those injecting less than two years ) and young IDUs ( those under age 25 ) .
most available time series for the EU show stable prevalence , suggesting that the numbers of infected IDUs dying are balanced by the numbers of IDUs contracting HIV infection .
among young IDUs ( under age 25 ) in these samples , a high prevalence ( over 40 % in at least one sample ) was found in seven countries and among new IDUs , for whom data are not available for many countries , in Poland and the United
) , although specific data for IDUs are not available . AIDS incidence data remains important as it indicates the level of symptomatic disease and the introduction and availability of HAART .
in the case of hepatitis B , the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases appears generally to have declined , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes . no general trend is visible for the proportion of IDUs among notified cases of hepatitis
for those who are drug @-@ dependent , treatment programmes in prison can provide an opportunity that may benefit not only the individual 's health , but may also reduce the likelihood of future offending .
in general , syringe provision outlets are located in specialised drugs agencies , and in all but three countries this type of provision is complemented by mobile services that can reach out to groups of drug injectors in marginalised neighbourhoods .
" drug @-@ induced deaths " and " acute drug deaths " ( 155 ) .
although the comparability of European data has improved in recent years , differences in the quality of reporting between countries still mean that direct comparisons should be made with caution .
Opioids are present in most cases of acute drug @-@ related deaths due to illegal substances reported in the EU , accounting for 46 % to 100 % ( Figure 12 ) , mainly heroin or its metabolites .
in Europe , most opioid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benzodiazepines , or other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .
the Czech Republic , Denmark , Germany , Latvia , Malta , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal and the United Kingdom .
overdose deaths due to cocaine are more difficult to identify than those caused by opioids , and are often considered to be the result of a combination of causes , rather than from cocaine toxicity itself ( 166 ) .
) depending on country , figures refer to 2004 or 2005 , for ecstasy and cocaine . )
see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine for a more detailed report on deaths related to this drug . )
figure 13 : overall trend in acute drug @-@ related deaths , 1996 @-@ 2005 for all Member States with available data account for a decreasing proportion of overdoses ( 170 ) .
a collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
suggested to account for this recent increase , among which are polydrug use by opioid users , or a possible increase in the availability of heroin .
there is a marked discrepancy in trends in drug @-@ related deaths between the EU @-@ 15 Member States and those who have joined since 2004 .
increases in the proportion of drug @-@ related deaths in drug users aged under 30 years have been observed in Greece and among those aged under 25 years in Estonia , Luxembourg and Austria , and to a lesser extent in Latvia and
the European project Isadora ( " integrated services aimed at dual diagnosis and optimal recovery from addiction " ) was concluded in 2005 after a three @-@ year research period ( 1 ) .
easier accessibility of treatment and greater variety of approaches , including substitution treatment , improve rates of retention in treatment , which makes an important contribution to reducing drug @-@ related deaths and mortality .
a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction , which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality , is currently underway in Italy ( Bargagli et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose , if they relapse back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
research suggests that concurrent use of other drugs , particularly alcohol and sedative drugs , may increase the risk of fatal opioid overdose and , therefore , polydrug use is an important issue for services to address .
an approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms , whereby drug users may consume their drugs in a designated space where

this report is only possible through the hard work and dedication of our partners in the Reitox network of national focal points and the experts throughout Europe who have contributed to the analysis .
a strong voice from Europe in an important year for reflection and policy formation the user is often difficult , and Member States vary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @-@ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflections on how drug policies have performed to date , and what directions should be pursued in the future .
however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly cannabis users , the likelihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
this distinction has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .

an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care tailored to the needs of a more heterogeneous population of drug users .
the portal , which includes a prevention module , provides an overview of the latest evidence on programme efficacy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions .

local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conceal and do not necessitate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more recreational basis .
however , patterns of stimulant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most commonly used stimulant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fifty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States , as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with input from the EU Member States , Europol and the EMCDDA .
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in Chapter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level .
following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will renew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will renew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will renew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
chapter 1 : policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
these expenditures are not necessarily labelled as drugrelated in official accountancy documents .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison , as for a trafficking offence .
most of the expenditures identified were originally " labelled " as drug related , and were generally traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents , thus possibly reflecting the voluntary engagement of the States in the field of drugs .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all widen the scope for directing drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @-@ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @-@ enacted it after 12 years without , and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 doses .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
ELDD 's " Topic overview " and " Legal reports " sections ( 8
though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .
for additional information on the methodology , see Figure DLO @-@ 3 in the 2008 statistical bulletin . Reitox national focal points and , for population data , Eurostat ( http : / / epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu / ) .
in the five @-@ year period 2001 @-@ 06 , the number of drug law offences involving cannabis increased or remained stable in most reporting countries , resulting in an overall average increase of 34 % in the European Union ( Figure 2 ) .
based on reports from 25 Member States , Croatia and Norway , it is possible to give an overview of the organisation of drugrelated research in European countries .
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the EMCDDA through its network of Reitox national focal points .

in addition to publications specialising in illicit drugs and addiction , articles on illicit drug use are also published in peer @-@ reviewed journals from a wide array of disciplines and in professional magazines .
several research studies have shown that interventions delivered during the early school years , aimed to improve educational environments and reduce social exclusion , also have a moderating effect on later substance use ( Toumbourou et al . , 2007 ) .
recent literature reviews ( 19 ) , however , show that certain
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only ineffective but may carry risks of unwanted effects ( Werch and Owen , 2002 ) .
around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .

in Hungary , where NSPs and outreach work have been increasing , a study among the out @-@ of @-@ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
due to the specific profile of the Baltic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .
financial support for harmreduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among injecting drug users and in prison settings . "
after methadone , buprenorphine is the second most commonly prescribed opioid substitute , and its use in the treatment of opioid dependence has increased in recent years ( see Chapter 6 ) .
the prevention and reduction of drugrelated harm is a public health objective in all Member States and in the EU drug strategy and action plan ( European Commission , 2007a ) .
of users , particularly women , heroin and crack users , those who belong to ethnic minorities and those with co @-@ morbid psychiatric problems .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of inmates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of inmates have injected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social reintegration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wales in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
however , there is no such entitlement if the offender is expected to be released within three months or is considered unfit or not motivated for treatment .
in the early and mid @-@ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high prevalence , whereas the European norm was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .
( Reitox national reports ) . herbal cannabis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Nigeria , Angola ) , south @-@ east Asia ( Thailand ) , south @-@ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americas ( Colombia , Jamaica ) ( CND , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
the area under cannabis resin production declined from 134 000 hectares in 2003 to and the Netherlands have been noted as source countries
seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal seizures both in terms of number and quantity : with twice as many seizures ( 325 000 ) and the amount intercepted ( 713 tonnes ) eight times higher .
after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @-@ 03 , the number of cannabis resin seizures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities intercepted increased until 2003 @-@ 04 , but thereafter have been declining .
in the recovery of about 2.3 million cannabis plants ( and 22 tonnes of cannabis plants ( 64 % accounted by Spain ) .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 , SZR @-@ 2 , SZR @-@ 3 , SZR @-@ 4 , SZR @-@ 5 and SZR @-@ 6 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
in 2006 , the reported THC content of resin samples ranged from 2.3 % to 18.4 % , while that of herbal cannabis ranged from under 1 % to 13 % .
however , there are still differences between countries in the methodology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conservatively estimated that cannabis has been used at least once ( lifetime prevalence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15- to 64 @-@ year- olds ( see Table 2 for a summary of the data ) .
generally being reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) have ever used cannabis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
group have used cannabis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
for example , the ratio of males to females among those reporting use of cannabis in the last year ranged from 6.4 males for each female in Portugal to 1.3 in Italy .
as with lifetime experience , there is a wide variation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
in some countries it is virtually unreported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among males .
after tobacco and alcohol , cannabis also continues to be the psychoactive substance most commonly used by school students .
ever in lifetime use of cannabis by 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students may be taken to reflect recent or current use as first experimenting with this substance often occurs at or around this age .
data from the 2005 / 06 HBSC survey of 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed large variation in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use across 27 countries .
estimating intensive and long @-@ term patterns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
the comparison shows that , on average , students who have used cannabis are more likely to have used other substances .
although among cannabis users the last month prevalence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and binge drinking among cannabis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
in an Australian study , 92 % of long @-@ term cannabis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life , with more than half of them judged to be dependent at the time of the study .
a follow @-@ up study carried out one year later suggested that , among long @-@ term users , measures of cannabis use and dependence may be stable for this length of time ( Swift et al . , 2000 ) .
a comparison of HBSC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreasing trend in both lifetime and other more frequent cannabis use among 15 @-@ year @-@ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , cannabis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
client profiles in Denmark , Germany , France and Hungary ( 52 ) . those variations may be explained by differences in prevalence of intensive cannabis use , drug treatment organisation or referral practices .
overall , primary cannabis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequency of use : those who use it occasionally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
in addition , Belgium , Germany , France , the Netherlands and Switzerland are collaborating in an international study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive family @-@ based treatment for problematic cannabis use ( Incant ) ( 58 ) .
these Internetbased services are targeted at young people and focus on problems related to alcohol and cannabis .

seizures of safrole , which may replace 3,4 @-@ MDP @-@ 2 @-@ P in the synthesis of MDMA , remained marginal in 2006 , with 62 litres seized worldwide , mostly in Australia ; in Europe , only France reported a seizure of safrole ( 7 litres ) .
over the period 2001 @-@ 06 , with the exception of the Czech Republic , Spain and Romania , the retail price of amphetamine was reported to have fallen in all 16 countries reporting sufficient data for analysis .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 11 to SZR @-@ 18 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
in contrast , overall , consumption levels of synthetic hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) are lower and have been largely stable for a considerable period .
higher prevalence levels in some countries need to be understood in the context of , in simple terms at least , two distinct consumption patterns . in a limited number of
Stimulant markets in Europe : the relative prevalence of cocaine or amphetamines in seizures and population surveys , and the proportion of drug users in treatment reporting these substances as primary drugs
last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 2.9 % , with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.7 % and 1.9 % .
for example , recreational and less intensive and damaging patterns of use among socially wellintegrated users can coexist with intensive use among more marginalised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risky modes of administration , such as injection and smoking .
only one Member State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amphetamine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 12000 and 22000 problem amphetamine users ( 4.3 to 7.9 casesper1000 , aged 15 @-@ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem opioid users in the country .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amphetamine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ageing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) .
among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) , lifetime prevalence estimates area little higher ( 0.3 % to 7.1 % ) , although lower prevalence levels are reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
amphetamine use ( last 12 months ) among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 ) in the UnitedKingdom declined substantially between 1996 ( 6.5 % ) and 2002 ( 3.1 % ) , with the figures remaining
stable thereafter . a marked increase in amphetamine use is reported in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 , but the results of the 2005 survey indicate a decrease in the use of this substance since the beginning of this decade ( 73
countries with sufficient data on last year prevalence of amphetamine use among the 15 @-@ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
data from a few countries suggest that cocaine could be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy among some sectors of the drug @-@ using population . this may be the
994 tonnes of pure cocaine hydrochloride for the year 2007 , of which Colombia accounted for 61 % , Peru 29 % and Bolivia 10 % .
analysis of the number of laboratories dismantled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries , although it may also occur in other South American countries , before exportation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe .
West Africa : now a regional transit hub for trafficking to Europe amount seized in Portugal since 2005 , accounting for 28 % of the European total in 2006 , points to the growing use of the Iberian peninsula by cocaine traffickers as an entry point to the European market .
patterns of cocaine use can be correspondingly diverse , ranging from the occasional and recreational to the highly compulsive and dependent .
Spain continued to be the country reporting the highest seizures , accounting for 58 % of all seizures and 41 % of the quantity intercepted in Europe that year . the huge increase in the

UnitedKingdom ( 87 ) .
national estimates of problem cocaine use ( injection or long duration / regular use ) are available only for Spain and Italy , and regional estimates are available for the United Kingdom .
similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
ever in lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students is 2 % or lower in most countries , rising to 4 % in Spain and 5 % in the UnitedKingdom ( 89
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .
a multi @-@ city European study with targeted samples of cocaine users in nine cities ( Prinzleve et al . , 2004 ) found
overall the estimated lifetime prevalence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the USA .
the second is a more marginalised group of clients who are typically smoking or injecting cocaine ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either crack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 crack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom ( 102 ) .
frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non @-@ fatal myocardial infarctions than nonusers ( Qureshi et al . , 2001 ) .
following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several Member States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adapting their traditionally opioid @-@ oriented services to the varied cocaine and crack @-@ using populations .
Modafinil , a central nervous system stimulant , has shown particularly promising results as a psychostimulant substitution drug with the advantage that , compared to other potential substitute drugs ( e.g. d @-@ amphetamine ) , its abuse liability is low ( Myrick et al . , 2004 ) .
of the Member States that report high prevalence levels of cocaine or crack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evaluated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
in Italy , a largescale clinical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmaceuticals ( aripiprazole and ropinirole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abstinence . in this scenario , failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains .
according to a recent UnitedKingdom report ( nice , 2007 ) , cocaine @-@ related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to opioids .
once administered , the vaccine induces the production of antibodies that bind to cocaine molecules in the bloodstream and , thereby , allow naturally occurring enzymes to convert them in to inactive molecules .
the amount of heroin intercepted in an average seizure varied greatly between these two countries , with the size of the average seizure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom , reflecting different positions in the supply chain ( Figure 6 ) .
however , large seizures of morphine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CND , 2008 ; UNODC , 2007a ) .
global seizures of acetic anhydride ( used in the illicit manufacture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 litres in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 litres ) and Colombia ( 8 800 litres ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 litres ) ( INCB , 2008b ) .
Reitox national focal points .
for example , in some countries where problem opioid use has historically predominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level during the period 2002 @-@ 06 range roughly between one and six casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average prevalence of problem opioid use of between four and five casesper1000 of the population aged 15 @-@ 64 can be derived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it implies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
treatment found that primary opioid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
the EMCDDA , in collaboration with a group of national experts , has recently developed new guidelines for incidence estimation , in order to encourage further work in this area ( Scalia Tomba et al . , 2008 ) .
most drug clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other opioids ( 23 % ) and cannabis ( 18 % ) .
of the 387 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
Buprenorphine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of opioids other than heroin or methadone : mainly buprenorphine , painkillers and other opioids ( 112 ) .
figure 8 : estimates of the prevalence of injecting drug use ( casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ) an increase in the proportion of polydrug users among heroin clients and arise in the number of clients using opioids other than heroin .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use .
among opioid users entering outpatient treatment for the first time in 2006 , a slightly lower proportion report injecting the drug ( around 40 % ) .
see Tables PDU @-@ 104 , TDI @-@ 4 , TDI @-@ 5 and TDI @-@ 17 ( part V ) in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
the varying levels of new injectors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initiation as well as increasing injecting incidence among the younger or the older populations .
a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem opioid users and the reported number of treatments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving substitution treatment .
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequency of co @-@ morbid psychiatric disorders is noted .
about half of opioid users seeking treatment report initiation before the age of 20 and around one third between the age of 20 and 24 years ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 is uncommon ( 120
a buprenorphine / naloxone combination was launched on the EU market in 2006 as an alternative to buprenorphine alone , with the aim of reducing the potential and attractiveness for injecting use .
prescription of medical heroin ( diamorphine ) , as a treatment option for chronic treatment @-@ resistant opioid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 815 clients in 2006 ) , the UnitedKingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive diamorphine according to a special regulation .
additionally , a randomised trial of injectable opioids ( RIOTT ) is currently underway in the UnitedKingdom which will assess the effectiveness of injectable diamorphine , injectable methadone and oral methadone .
technical information on the substance is available on the EMEA website ( http : / / www.emea.europa.eu / humandocs / humans / EPAR / suboxone / suboxone.htm ) .
substitution treatment , generally integrated with psychosocial care , is typically provided at specialised outpatient centres and in shared @-@ care arrangements with office @-@ based general practitioners . the available data
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
however , a report issued by the European Commission ( 2007a ) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of intervening in this setting .
reviews of randomised controlled trials and observational studies conclude that methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) and buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) can both be effective for the management of opioid dependence .
more positively , prison drug programmes have become more widespread , and new initiatives are reported by many countries .
by the end of 2006 , the incidence of diagnosed HIV infection among injecting drug users ( IDUs ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
data on newly diagnosed cases related to injecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @-@ 02 , which was due to outbreaks in Estonia , countries , HIV prevalence remained unchanged during the period .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use with trends in HIV prevalence among IDUs suggests that the incidence of HIV infection related to injecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
however , vigilance is needed as some Member States continue to show high rates of new HIV infections linked to injecting drug use , and the situation is even more worrying in some neighbouring countries .
HCV antibody levels among national samples of IDUs in 2005 @-@ 06 vary from around 15 % to 90 % , with most countries typically reporting levels in excess of 40 % .
while estimates generated from non @-@ probability samples must always be taken with caution , the variations in prevalence levels found are likely to have important implications for the targeting and delivery of prevention and treatment programmes .
the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases of hepatitis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes targeted at IDUs .
access to HIV testing and treatment provision in Europe have increased considerably over the past decade .
prisons are important settings for interventions targeting infectious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see Chapter 2 ) .
the EMCDDA definition of druginduced deaths ( 136 ) refers to those deaths that are directly caused ( poisonings or overdoses ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substances present is an illicit
moreover , many druginduced deaths are , in fact , polydrug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
the second component is broader and covers deaths which cannot be directly attributable to the pharmacological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @-@ term consequences of infectious diseases , interactions with mental health issues ( e.g. suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e.g. road traffic accidents ) .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circumstantial reasons ( e.g. violence related to the drug trade ) .
there is still limited research on the morbidity and other consequences of non @-@ fatal overdoses and limited investment in prevention efforts , despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable .
however , other approaches are being explored whereby data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attributable to drugs in a community ( see " Overall drugrelated mortality , " P . 86 ) .
improvements in the quality and reliability of European data in recent years have allowed better descriptions of overall and national trends , and most countries have now adopted a case definition in line with that of the
most of these deaths are attributable to the misuse of methadone diverted from hospitals , pharmacies , practitioners and pain management physicians , while only a limited number of them are attributed to methadone obtained from substitution programmes ( 146 ) .
the role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @-@ related .
a recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths , overdoses , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
cohort studies area valuable tool for estimating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use , but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an overview at national level .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extrapolated from cohort studies to local ( Bargagli et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( Cruts et al . , 2008 ) .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clinical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths .
the number of deaths from other causes ( e.g. consequences of other infectious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and estimation in this area ( see preceding section ) .
elevated risk of druginduced death on completion of prison sentences or treatment attributed to drug overdoses or , more generally , to substance use disorders .
new substances under control example on the working methods of online shops ; the way that they respond to users " demands , and new trends among young people .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the EMCDDA conducted a snapshot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .

in particular , anxieties arose about the potential for surreptitiously adding GHB to drinks ( commonly referred to as " drink spiking " ) to facilitate sexual assault .
GBL is rapidly converted in to GHB
furthermore , there is an absence of an accurate and comparable system for recording the number of deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of GHB and its precursors .
Luxembourg : publications Office of the European Union , 2009
furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitutes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the EMCDDA 's future activities .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confronted .
• the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , the WHO Regional Office for Europe , Interpol , the World Customs Organisation , the ESPAD project and the Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and other Drugs ( CAN ) ;
the USA , for example , softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @-@ borne infections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @-@ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @-@ term data .
a lesson that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practitioners can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
the use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions , and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal , known as a " commission for dissuasion of drug abuse . "
in addition , developments in neuroscience have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addiction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
commentary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @-@ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young males . this represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
the estimates presented here relate to the adult population ( 15 @-@ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lifetime users Last month use : less than 1 million
problem opioid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
a caveat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug are considerable .
any indications that the situation may be worsening , especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties , are grounds for considerable concern .
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that substance use problems are best addressed holistically and in the context of healthy lifestyles and informed choices .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @-@ dimensional perspective is becoming increasingly unhelpful in understanding the developing nature of patterns of substance use in Europe .
in Europe today , polydrug patterns are the norm , and the combined use of different substances is responsible for , or complicates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly devalued if they simply open the door for the use of a substitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substances that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the availability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreases , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and proportion of treatment demands related to opioid drugs .
data on drugrelated deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreasing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Worryingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be diffusing into new populations .
the illicit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adapt quickly to control measures .
again , market factors and precursor chemicals appear important here , with methamphetamine production sites appearing now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilitates the import of precursors , in this case 1 @-@ phenyl @-@ 2 @-@ propanone ( BMK ) , from outside of the European Union .
the situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible outward diffusion of methamphetamine use beyond the Czech Republic .
in this country , methamphetamine problems are long established , but with production usually on a small scale for personal or local consumption .
changes in the ecstasy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals , and these efforts may also have important
this year , the EMCDDA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches , and it appears that , for some forms of prevention , treatment and harmreduction interventions , the web @-@ based approaches have considerable potential .
added to the concerns raised by the online marketing of alcohol and medicines are those about the appearance of a range of supposedly " legal " alternatives to controlled psychoactive substances .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @-@ based products , in particular herbal mixtures , as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds .
new substances appearing on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experimental chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans .
forensic analysis , however , has largely failed to detect the plant @-@ based substances declared on the labels , but did identify in some samples synthetic cannabinoids that had been added to the mixtures .
other topics addressed are the recent adoption and evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans , new data and trends on drugrelated public expenditure and developments regarding drugrelated research in Europe .
the enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking ) .
the new EU action plan identifies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving Coordination , cooperation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international cooperation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . the new plan is more
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which reviews current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN Member States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Member States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
the evaluation found that while not all actions had been fully implemented and not all objectives attained , progress had been made in almost all areas of the action plan .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that echo those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing convergence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better reflection of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursued in external agreements and programmes .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evaluator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of reflection in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dissuade young people from beginning to use drugs by reaffirming the prohibition of drug use and informing young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Drugs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 2008a ) .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of finalising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @-@ 08 programme with a 1 @-@ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UNGASS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narcotic Drugs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU Member States .
most countries could provide data on central government expenditure , and seven also reported expenditure by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
in some cases , the final report is a summary of annual implementation reviews ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only labelled expenditure .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
estimating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illicit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
in contrast , for those countries providing COFOG data for unlabelled
during this period , about a quarter of the texts authorised or regulated the use of substances such as methadone and buprenorphine .
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exempts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of syringes dispensed .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new offence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EUR 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
in 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe research efforts in those priority areas that are underrepresented , in particular drug supply .
analysis of drugs research in the European Union published by the EMCDDA in 2008 ( 10 ) .
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Reitox national reports .
the United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects , over 80 , followed by Germany and the Netherlands , each with over 30 , and the Czech Republic , Ireland and Finland , with over 20 .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @-@ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evaluating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combines training in life @-@ skills with normative education and knowledge acquisition on substances .
the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bullying , past @-@ week and past @-@ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drinks on one occasion and having tried cannabis .
new information on selective prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg .
both selective and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( EMCDDA , 2008c ) .
selective prevention intervenes with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scarce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavioural or psychological problems that may be predictive for developing problem substance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interventions .
similarly , the " Komet för föräldrar " method , which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden 's municipalities , targets parents of children showing externalising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive peer relations .
Psychosocial interventions form the foundation of communitybased outpatient and inpatient treatment , and they also normally complement opioid substitution treatment . drug detoxification is a
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe short @-@ term , medically supervised intervention aimed at resolving the withdrawal symptoms associated with chronic drug use .
in Turkey , substitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is permitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres . in 16 countries , specialised public outpatient services are the main providers of substitution treatment .
see Tables HSR @-@ 1 and HSR @-@ 2 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.See Table HSR @-@ 3 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
the mean age of drug users entering inpatient treatment is 30 years , but opioid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 28 ) and cannabis ( 26 ) .
the ratio is lower among primary users of non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.1 : 1 ) and cannabis ( 8 : 1 ) .
national experts estimate that inpatient psychosocial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1C ) .
single or irregular treatment outcome evaluations are also reported by some countries .
efficacy is ideally determined by carrying out controlled trials or randomised controlled trials where interventions are compared against specific outcome measures . most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
the new module also includes : links to other information sources , evaluated interventions , a glossary and a brief synopsis of the gaps in the current evidence base .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , infectious diseases testing and counselling , vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis .
the focus of harm reduction responses has expanded beyond the HIV / AIDS epidemic into the broader perspective of catering for the health and social needs of problem drug users , especially those who are socially excluded .
all Member States report the availability of housing schemes that can accommodate drug users .
in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their tenancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consensual crime , " where consenting individuals secretly participate in an unlawful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e.g. during a foot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a Scottish study , which found that recovering drug users who received employment @-@ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( McIntosh et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at disrupting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and searches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more generic tactic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
this involves processing importation and exportation requests as well as identifying and investigating suspicious transactions .

it is estimated that about 12 million Europeans used the drug in the last month , on average about 3.6 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .
however , upward trends in the mean THC content of cannabis resin were registered in Portugal and Luxembourg .
information on the potency of locally produced herbal cannabis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands , where a recent decline in the mean potency of nederwiet was observed , from a peak of 20.3 % in 2004 to 16.0 % in 2006 , remaining at that level in 2007 ( 47 ) .
the EMCDDA , in close collaboration with national experts , has developed a set of core items for use in adult surveys ( the " European Model Questionnaire , " EMQ ) .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country , which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007 .
the mean retail price of cannabis resin , in 2007 , ranged from EUR 3 to EUR 11 per gram in the 18 countries providing information , with half of them reporting values between EUR 5 and EUR 9 .
the mean retail price of herbal cannabis ranged between EUR 1 and EUR 12 per gram in the 17 countries supplying information , with about half of them reporting prices of between EUR 4 and EUR 9 .

as with adults , increases in cannabis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
only two of the countries monitored by the EMCDDA that participated in ESPAD school surveys in 2007 ( Lithuania , Slovakia ) report an increase of more than three percentage points in lifetime cannabis use since 2003 , while nine countries report an equivalent decrease during this period ( 54 ) .
different methodologies to estimate , within the general population surveys , the prevalence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use , mainly cannabis use , have been tested in recent years .
it was estimated that : nearly all those seeking specific treatment would obtain it in France , Greece and Slovenia ; more than half of them in Germany and the United Kingdom ; and only a minority in the remaining eight countries .

internet @-@ based treatment is developed by organisations in the treatment or prevention fields and aims at helping users to assess their substance use and to assist them in their attempts to change this behaviour .
the scientific literature suggests that a number of psychotherapies , such as motivational and cognitivebehavioural therapies , are effective for cannabis treatment but that none has been found to be more effective than the others ( Nordstrom and Levin , 2007 ) .

between 2005 and 2007 , both the number and the quantity of methamphetamine seized in Europe have been increasing , though both remain low in comparison to other drugs .
over the past 5 years , the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 20 countries where sufficient data are available to allow analysis of trends .
of the 11 countries where a comparison of data for 2007 and 2006 was possible , Spain , France and Austria reported increases in the retail price , while the rest reported stable or decreasing prices .

the fall in the total amount of cocaine seized is largely accounted for by Portugal , and to a lesser extent Spain and France , reporting smaller quantities seized in 2007 compared to the previous year ( 90 ) .
in countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Conversely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant , low levels of amphetamine use are reported .
the European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % ( 3 million ) and for last month use at 0.8 % ( 1 million ) .
overall , cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe , after cannabis , though levels of use vary greatly between countries .
it is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lifetime , on average 3.9 % of adults aged 15 @-@ 64 years ( see Table 8 for a summary of the data ) .
national figures vary from 0.1 % to 8.3 % , with 12 out of 23 countries , including most central and eastern European countries , reporting low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults ( 0.5 @-@ 2 % ) .
visiting nightclubs was also associated with increased cocaine use , as nearly 10 % of the 16- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds who visited a club on four or more occasions during the last month report last year use of cocaine , compared with 3.3 % among those who had not visited a club .

chapter 5 : cocaine and crack cocaine especially among clients with a primary heroin problem
crack cocaine use in Europe
in 2007 , around 8 000 clients are reported to have entered outpatient treatment for primary use of crack cocaine , representing 15 % of all cocaine clients and 2.7 % of all drug clients in outpatient treatment .
the first group typically reports snorting the drug , and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis , but not with opioids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
some countries ( e.g. Ireland , Italy , Spain ) , however , have implemented strategies or treatment programmes targeting cocaine users , and France is in the process of developing such programmes .
for this reason , in Ireland outreach work and other interventions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Connolly et al . , 2008 ) .
( 101 ) See Tables TDI @-@ 10 , TDI @-@ 11 ( part III ) , TDI @-@ 21 and TDI @-@ 103 ( part II ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin . ( 102 ) See Table TDI @-@ 17 ( part IV ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where opioid users are the main clientele . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
according to a recent Cochrane review , this combination has yielded the best results for the treatment of stimulant dependence ( Knapp et al . , 2007 ) .
in addition , 11 Member States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users .
programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
the most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 735 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
among these countries , the reported wholesale price of heroin ranges from EUR 12.5 to EUR 35.8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ranges from EUR 36 to EUR 62.7 .
at both wholesale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .
nonetheless , analysis in this area can be informative , especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market .
0 Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries during the period 2002 @-@ 07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ; overall prevalence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000 .

it has also launched , in collaboration with the University of Zurich , a study to test a new " one @-@ day " method using the distribution of " latency time " ( time to treatment ) in a cross @-@ sectional sample of treated heroin users .
similarly , a decline noted in the number of heroin seizures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase . in the most recent data on drug law offences , an increase in the number of heroin @-@ related cases may also be observed .
this is perhaps most clearly visible since 2003 among seizures and druginduced deaths , and after 2004 in new treatment demands related to heroin use .
injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @-@ borne infections ( e.g. HIV / AIDS , hepatitis ) or druginduced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem opioid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 114 ) . information from the
injecting drug use is one of the main determinants of serious public health problems among drug users , including HIV / AIDS , hepatitis C and overdose .
treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users , the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 % .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use .
the proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e.g. Czech Republic , Germany ) .
between 2002 and 2007 , the proportion of injectors among primary opioid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries , with statistically significant declines reported in 13 countries .
in France , for example , a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly

national experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
in seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
its findings highlight the difficulties of comparative analyses in this area , underlining the need for a more harmonised approach for diagnosis , treatment and study of co @-@ morbidity in Europe ( Baldacchino et al . , 2009 ) .
the German Phar @-@ Mon system , which monitors a wide range of medications that have potential for misuse , also recorded an increase in the misuse of prescription opioids , where substitution drugs play a more important role than analgesics ( Roesner and Küfner , 2007 ) .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substances is not compromised ( Cherny et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psychiatric disorders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a concomitant psychiatric morbidity were primary opioid users ( 125 ) .
almost all opioid users entering treatment report initiation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20 .
drug @-@ free and substitution treatment for opioid use are available in all EU Member States , Croatia and Norway . in Turkey , the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study .
NB : the percentage of substitution treatment clients receiving their treatment from general practitioners in the Community is indicated on the map.Sources : Reitox national focal points .
drug @-@ free treatment is a therapeutic approach , which generally requires individuals to abstain from all substances , including substitution medication .
in Greece for example , the waiting time for opioid substitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
in four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in substitution treatment .
according to expert estimates , the availability of opioid substitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of opioid users ( see Chapter 2 ) .
29 % and 60 % , while in Italy , different regional estimates range from around 36 % to 92 % .
the most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen ( antiHBc ) , which indicates a history of infection .
for 2006 @-@ 07 , three of the 10 countries providing data on injecting drug users report anti @-@ HBc prevalence levels of over 40 % ( 137 ) .
access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths drug users , involving peer educators , are also reported by 17 countries .
to reduce the burden of hepatitis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chronic carriers of the virus who are active drug injectors .
current treatments for chronic hepatitis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination therapy with longacting interferon and ribavirin - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained virological response .
the number of syringes provided through needle and syringe programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available .
ongoing increases over this period were reported from Belgium , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Austria , Slovakia and Finland .
a national survey conducted in the 120 French " CAARUD " harmreduction centres showed that they had been used by an estimated 40 000 individuals in 2007 ( Toufik et al . , 2008 ) .
it was also considered as a cost @-@ effective innovation , capable of operating within the country 's restrictive drug policy ( Arponen et al . , 2008 ) .
( 140 ) Experts from 26 EU countries , Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to drug users . ( 141 ) See Table HSR @-@ 5 ( part i ) and ( part II ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
known causes of deaths include acute toxicity , traffic accidents in particular when combined with alcohol ( EMCDDA , 2007c ) , violence , suicide among already vulnerable people , or chronic conditions due to repeated use ( e.g. cardiovascular problems in cocaine users ) .
during the period 1990 @-@ 2006 , between 6 400 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States , Croatia , Norway and Turkey , adding up to more than 135 000 deaths . in 2006 , the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for half of all reported deaths .
population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @-@ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( Figure 13 ) .
chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths instance , in the case of mortality related to HIV / AIDS , Eurostat and EuroHIV information is combined .
this suggests that the total mortality in this population could be around two to five times the number of registered druginduced deaths .
this type of study can determine overall and cause @-@ specific mortality rates for the cohort , and can estimate the group 's excess mortality compared to the general population .
both methods have been successfully pilot @-@ tested in the Czech Republic , and the EMCDDA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future .
France , Italy and Portugal . following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 , HIV / AIDS mortality decreased markedly in most EU countries , although the decrease was much less pronounced in Portugal .
deaths indirectly related to drug use
other diseases that also account for a proportion of deaths among drug users include chronic conditions such as liver diseases ( due to hepatitis C infection and heavy alcohol use ) , cancer and cardiovascular problems .
other causes have received much less attention , despite indications that they have a considerable impact .
) The year 2006 was taken as the more recent year for which information from almost all Member States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat .
for detailed information on sources , for the transmission groups , numbers and computations see Table DRD @-@ 5 ( part III ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin . )
in recent cohort studies in Europe , suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users . however , the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited availability of data .
reducing drugrelated deaths families of drug users to recognise and manage drug overdoses ; in eight countries , such materials are available for police officers ; and in seven countries , they have been developed for prison staff ( 155 ) .
education about overdose risk is reported by all countries , and in nine of them it exists in most relevant cities with a significant number of problem drug users .
drug users are informed about overdose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence , the effects and risks of polydrug use , in particular concomitant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
in England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 506 drug overdose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .
during the first 3 months , all 12 overdoses where naloxone was used had been reversed successfully , while one death had occurred in the six overdoses in which it was not used .
according to expert ratings from 24 countries , prison pre @-@ release counselling on overdose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries , only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries , and to less than half of them in a further six countries .
the appearance of synthetic cannabinoids marks the latest stage in the development of " designer drugs " : from those based on fentanyl in the 1980s ; to ring @-@ substituted phenethylamines in the late 1980s and tryptamines in 1990s ; to piperazines and cathinone derivatives in the 2000s .
products marketed on the Internet and in some specialised shops under the name " spice " have been available since at least 2006 . although " spice " may be advertised as incense , when smoked the effects are described by some users as similar to those of cannabis .

for the career criminal , drugs may form part of the deviant lifestyle , with spending on drugs being a
the effects of such drugs include excitability , irritability , fear / paranoia , disinhibition , drastic mood swings , cognitive distortions and impaired judgement , any of which may lead to criminal behaviour .
in practice , each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some subgroups of the population of drug @-@ using offenders or to some types of drug @-@ related crime .
it is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may vary even in the same person over time .
the use of opiates and cannabis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psychopharmacologically induced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tranquillisers ) tend to reduce violent impulses and aggression .
while the pharmacology of most illicit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behaviours are not fully understood although some substances , usually stimulants , are known to produce
the resulting conceptual model , composed of four categories of drug crimes , is the basis for the definition of the term " drugrelated crime " used here , the individual components of which are discussed below .
Studies of drug @-@ related crime have often overlooked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by definition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the proportion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
it produces euphoria and appetite suppression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .
acute and chronic cocaine use , often in combination with other substances , can cause multiple disorders ( cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , neurological , psychiatric , etc . ) .
cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
drug addiction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibiting a loss of control over their consumption . addicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
most neurobiological research on addiction has focused on the role a drug @-@ released neurotransmitter called dopamine has on the repeated activation of the " reward system " - circuitry made up of a complex set of cerebral structures which act as a barometer , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field , newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process , also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals .
Neurobiological research in addiction and that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse disrupts this regulation .
new technologies mean that neurobiological research can start to identify neuropsychological and genetic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addiction if they use drugs .
new technologies in addiction research non @-@ invasive techniques which may help to identify neuropsychological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual 's inability to stop using drugs .
this dysregulation would correspond either to an increased reactivity of dopaminergic neurons to specific stimuli linked to the pleasurable and addictive product or to a down @-@ regulation of dopamine signalling and a dampening of activity in the reward pathway .
animal studies indicate that noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons are coupled ( i.e. limit the activity of each other )
progress in neurobiological research on addiction has led to the use of drugs which target the dopaminergic system . however , this strategy has not yet proven effective in
a number of other novel treatment approaches are in development or are being researched which may provide new approaches to treating some forms of drug dependence .

DRUID aims to provide a solid basis for harmonised , EU @-@ wide regulations for driving under the influence of alcohol , drugs and medicine .
in contrast , laws in the Czech Republic , Estonia , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia penalise driving with any trace of a substance , even if medicinal .
in Latvia , impairment by a medicinal substance will incur a lower fine than any trace of an illicit substance .
they also show that many drivers are unaware of the effects of combining drugs and alcohol .
after stopping a driver , the police officer may need to perform an initial screening for drug use , by analysing behaviour or biological samples .

environment , health and quality of life - Water and air pollution have declined but not enough to achieve good ecological quality in all water bodies or to ensure good air quality in all urban areas .
these interdependencies and trends , many of them outside Europe 's direct influence , will have significant consequences and potential risks for the resilience and sustainable development of Europe 's economy and society .
increased resource efficiency and security can be achieved , for example , using extended life cycle approaches to reflect the full environmental impacts of products and activities .
Clustering sectoral policies according to their resource needs and environmental pressures would improve coherence , address shared challenges efficiently , maximise economic and social benefits and help avoid unintended consequences .

this continues to have considerable environmental and economic consequences .
the high use of resources to fuel economic growth increases the problems of ensuring supplies and sustainable yields , and managing the environmental impacts in relation to ecosystems ' absorption capacities .
a challenge for both policy and science is how best to measure environmental impacts that result from resource use ; several current initiatives aim to better quantify the environmental impacts of resource use .
the issues of water quantity and quality , irrigation water demand , water @-@ use conflicts , environmental and socioeconomic aspects and risk management aspects can be better integrated in the institutional and political systems .

in contrast to this economic growth , our environment has suffered .
the natural resources provided by the planet underpin our economic activity and the very cohesion of our societies . however , the way we organise our economies does not give sufficient recognition to the dependent nature of this relationship - there are no societies without environments ,
it was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in earnest . the summit resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change .

this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Cop 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNFCCC , is a first step in the long @-@ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @-@ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to Kyoto on time ) . ' Kyoto ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing

consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total greenhouse gases emissions in the EU .
different gases have different ' base years ' under Kyoto . for carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide ( 99 % of all emissions ) 1990 is used as the ' base year ' for all EU @-@ 15 Member States .
the buzz words , ' common but differentiated responsibility ' , first uttered at the Earth Summit in Rio , have popped up ever since in climate change circles .
next December , a major task of the Cop 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .

in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the EEA is also preparing an analysis of the CAP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsidy 's ' environmental ' spending .
in the EU @-@ 15 , farming causes almost half of the nitrogen pollution in rivers , 94 % of ammonia emissions and 9 % of total greenhouse gas emissions .
the Common Agriculture Policy ( CAP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @-@ war food shortages .
the subsidy has increasingly been decoupled from its original goal of increasing food
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the EEA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
the single farm payments , under Pillar I , are still very much targeted at farms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .

the Baltic was actually a freshwater lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
salinity in the Baltic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Baltic Sea .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
in response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Baltic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Baltic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integrating agricultural , fisheries and regional policies . this plan , adopted in
of the three major fished species , cod , herring , and sprat , cod is particularly sensitive to reduced salinity because salinity affects both their reproductive capacity and the availability of the preferred food for cod larvae .
as a result , despite its depth , it remains well oxygenated , even during autumn .

in this context , the EEA has been looking at how the impending bioenergy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from renewables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , etc. as well as bioenergy ) by 2020 .
the transport sector is also increasing greenhouse gas emissions and eating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . the Commission has therefore proposed that biofuels make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certified as sustainable .
however , a clear message still emerges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate mitigation , to prioritise bioenergy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the shipment of hazardous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment.Electronic waste , which is considered hazardous , is an important case .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' hazardous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
a ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .The EU 's long term aim is that each Member State should dispose of its own waste domestically ( the ' proximity principle ' ) .
driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher .

the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shipped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don 't know whether it is bad for the environment .
the simple act of making environmental information , gathered for research purposes , available to the passengers is a simple but important step - one that must be replicated on a much grander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and empower the public environmentally .
