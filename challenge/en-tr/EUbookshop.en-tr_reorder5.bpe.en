pre@@ face he competition policy pursu@@ ed by the European Commission has a direct impact on th@@ ed@@ a@@ ily life of the citizens of the European Union .
whether they be consumers , sa@@ vers , users of public services , employees or taxpayers , the Union 's citizens enjoy the fru@@ its of the competition policy in the@@ various aspects of their everyday life .
Re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing@@ firms to compete with each other fos@@ ters innovation , redu@@ ces production costs , increas@@ es@@ economic efficiency and , consequently , enhan@@ ces the competitiveness of the European economy , particularly vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis its main trading partners .
the propag@@ ation of th@@ ec@@ om@@ peti@@ tive process thus helps to consolidate the industrial fabri@@ c of the internal market and , in so doing , provides clear back @@@ -@@ @ up to employment policies .
only if aid is justified by the existence of a Community interest will the Com@@ mission@@ grant exem@@ ption from this general principle of prohibi@@ tion .
in some cases , State aid mer@@ ely leads to activities which no longer meet the requirements of economic efficiency being maintained arti@@ fic@@ ially , or to competition with efficient firms in the same sector being dist@@ or@@ ted .
I am convinced that transparency will enable the public and it@@ s@@ representatives to become more involved in aid @@@ -@@ @ monitoring policy .
it enhan@@ ces the quality and variety of good@@ sp@@ la@@ ced on the market , fos@@ ters technological innovation and economic performance and , finally , promotes fair prices for users .
it also seeks to preserve and stimulate their ability to operate on them@@ ar@@ ket in such a way as to contribute to the competitive process .
in conclusion , the Commission and its departments responsible for competition encourage the@@ active participation of consumers and their organisations .
such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which dist@@ ort competition .
it imp@@ acts not only on the economic environment but also on the organisation of@@ society at large .
it is in this way that competition policy is a " people 's " policy .
the Community 's competition policy pursu@@ es a precise goal , which is to defend@@ and develop effective competi@@ tion@@ in the common market .
demand seeks the@@ best rati@@ o between quality and pri@@ ce@@ for the products it requires . the mos@@ te@@ fficient response emer@@ ges as a result of a contest between suppliers .
thus , competition leads everybody individually to seek out the means of striking th@@ is@@ balance between quality and price in order to meet demand to the best possible
extent . competition is therefore a simple and effici@@ ent@@ means of guarante@@ eing consumers a level of exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce@@ in terms of the quality and price of products and@@ services .
this consol@@ i@@ dates the Community 's industrial and commercial fabri@@ c so that itis able to conf@@ ront the competitiveness of our main@@ partners and to put Community firms in a position tos@@ uc@@ ce@@ ed in markets around the world .
on the bas@@ is@@ of this body of law , competition policy focuses on four main areas of action .
• The control of mer@@ gers between firms ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . a mer@@ ger between two large group@@ s@@ which results in their domin@@ ating the market ) .
• The monitoring of State aid ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . the prohibi@@ tion of a State grant designed to keep@@ a loss @@@ -@@ @ making firm in business even though it has no prospect of recovery ) .
it does not enter into play until such time@@ as trade between M@@ ember States is aff@@ ec@@ ted@@ by the practices in question .
by contrast , it is exclusive when the legislative provision in@@ question expres@@ s@@ ly stipulates that this is the case .
finally , it should be added that most M@@ ember States have their own dome@@ sti@@ cla@@ w@@ s@@ to counter anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practices ( restric@@ tive agreements , abuses of ad@@ omin@@ ant position , and mer@@ gers ) .
national law makes it possible to take ac@@ tion@@ against practices which do not have any impact on trade between M@@ ember States .
in the area of its anti @@@ -@@ @ tru@@ st@@ operations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibi@@ tan agreement or@@ to issue an in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion@@ that a restric@@ tive practice be stopped , but also to im@@ pos@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ on firms found guilty of anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive conduct .
the amount of th@@ es@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ is calculated according to the gra@@ vity and dur@@ ation of the inf@@ r@@ ing@@ em@@ ent@@ .@@ Some of the most serious practices are price car@@ tels or ab@@ u@@ sive conduct by fir@@ m@@ sh@@ ol@@ ding a virtual monopoly .
an appeal against a Commission decision may be lo@@ d@@ ged with the Court of First In@@ stance or the Court of Justice of the European Commun@@ ities .
the most famili@@ ar@@ example is an agreement on prices , or car@@ tel , where@@ by firms fix price lev@@ el@@ s@@ jointly so that consumers are unable to take advantage of competition bet@@ we@@ en@@ suppliers to obtain competitive prices .
forms of distribution . in those circumstances , enterprises no longer have to be real@@ ly@@ competitive and have no incentive to innov@@ ate or reduce production costs .
the crisis thus affects employees , sub@@ contractors and tr@@ ad@@ er@@ s.@@ Mo@@ reover , arti@@ fic@@ ially high prices affect the costs of inter@@ mediate consumers , who are adver@@ sely affected by their suppliers " anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive behaviour .
the anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive behaviour of a few firms thus har@@ ms all operators and@@ justi@@ fies the intervention of the authorities .
if an agreement fulfil@@ s the following conditions , it is vo@@ id : it is concluded between firms or " under@@ tak@@ ings " ;
l@@ ast@@ ly , it may apply discrimin@@ atory conditions to firms that are not parties to the agreement , placing them at ac@@ om@@ peti@@ tive dis@@ advantage .
under Community law , an individual agreement between firms can be exemp@@ ted , and so can categories of agreements of the same nature , such as distribu@@ tion@@ agreements for example .
in this case , the anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practice har@@ med firms outside the car@@ tel , which were system@@ atically exclu@@ de@@ d@@ from calls for tenders , as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers .
the result of th@@ is@@ agreement , for the final consumer , was purchase prices that were higher than@@ they would have been with free competition .
in this case , the Com@@ mission@@ sought to make it easier for new digital inter@@ active television services to develop@@ while at the same time ensuring that there was competition on the market .
efficient businesses are run with a view to conqu@@ ering markets , to the poin@@ t@@ where they may establish very strong positions indeed .
citizens have good reason to be appre@@ hensive of abuses of this kind , wh@@ ich@@ result in higher prices , restrictions on the avail@@ ability of products and services and unfair trading conditions .
article 82 of the EC Treaty prohibi@@ ts the abuse of a dominant position . for the article to apply , the following conditions must be fulfilled .
abuse of a dominant position on the ice @@@ -@@ @ cre@@ am distribution market
abuse of a dominant position on the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies
the abuse cons@@ isted of@@ establishing a system of brand lo@@ yal@@ ty , which meant that the market in air@@ transport services provided by travel agencies was closed to British Airways '@@ competitors .
the effect of the system was to@@ reinforce agencies " brand lo@@ yal@@ ty to British Air@@ w@@ ay@@ s@@ and to dis@@ courage them from offering the services of
the Commission therefore considered that this practice , which affected the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies , constitu@@ ted an abuse of a dominant position .
abuse of a dominant position in the organisation of the Football World Cup
on 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Fren@@ ch@@ committee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 199@@ 8.@@ The committee , the C@@ F@@ O , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event th@@ at@@ included ticket sales .
the Commission found that the arrangements for tic@@ ket@@ sales for the final matches were discrimin@@ atory and constitu@@ ted an abuse of ad@@ omin@@ ant position .
persons not resident in France who w@@ ished to see the final@@ s@@ were thus at a sever@@ ed@@ is@@ advantage compared with@@ persons resident in Fran@@ ce@@ .@@ The Commission there@@ for@@ er@@ uled against the C@@ F@@ O .
for example , such a firm can increas@@ e@@ its prices above those of its competitors with@@ out@@ fearing any loss of profit .
that is why the European Union has set up an advance vet@@ t@@ ing@@ system for mer@@ gers with a Community dimension that enables it to prohibi@@ t ap@@ lan@@ ned mer@@ ger if necessary .
i@@ den@@ tical systems have been set up in the M@@ ember States for investigating mer@@ gers of national dimension .
it must be bor@@ ne in@@ mind that the Commission 's objective in the mer@@ ger control field is to preserve as@@ itu@@ ation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be agu@@ aran@@ tee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
the Community dimension of a mer@@ ger or acquisition is@@ assessed using th@@ res@@ holds based on the turnover of the companies invol@@ v@@ ed@@ .@@ The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EU@@ R 5 000 million ) and the Community @@@ -@@ @ wide threshold ( EU@@ R 250 million ) .
• Mer@@ gers and acquis@@ itions with a Community dimension have to be noti@@ fied to the Commission for its agreement before they are put into effect .
since the@@ entry into force of the mer@@ ger regulation , the Commission has seen th@@ en@@ um@@ ber of noti@@ fic@@ ations grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
• After an initial scrutiny period of one month , the Commission decides either to
• At the end of this procedure , the Commission may author@@ ise the mer@@ ger
( more than 90 % ) .
in a market in the process of integration , mer@@ gers wh@@ ich@@ create or strengthen a dominant position are , in fact , quite rare .
In@@ some cases , the mer@@ ger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen ad@@ omin@@ ant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a sol@@ u@@ tion@@ to the competition concerns raised by the Commission .
the mer@@ ger of Car@@ re@@ four and Pro@@ mod@@ è@@ s was authorised subject to the@@ div@@ est@@ ment of a maj@@ or@@ sharehol@@ ding in ac@@ om@@ peti@@ tor .
but the@@ analysis of competi@@ tiv@@ ec@@ on@@ di@@ tions at lo@@ cal@@ level was left to th@@ en@@ ational competi@@ tion@@ authorities , since th@@ emer@@ ger involved as@@ eries of very lo@@ cal@@ is@@ ed@@ competition problems .
the Commission thus ensured th@@ at@@ competition was@@ preserved or restored in order to allow consumers to continue to benefit from ac@@ ho@@ ice of outlets , attractive prices and a di@@ verse range of consumer goods .
insurance policy@@ hol@@ ders and investors , especially in Italy , stand to benefit fro@@ m@@ the re@@ medi@@ es proposed by the companies in the context of INA 's acquisition by Generali ; both companies are large international insurance firms .
it would have given the new firm siz@@ e@@ ab@@ le@@ shares of the market for the supply of various life @@@ -@@ @ assur@@ ance products in Italy .
in addition , the investigation revealed links between the two firms and the@@ ir@@ main competitors that could have indu@@ ced them to co@@ ordinate their behavi@@ our@@ in the insurance and investment fields .
the mer@@ ging of the@@ operations of the two main players in the French pet@@ ro@@ leum products sector wo@@ ul@@ d@@ have created a dominant position on@@ several markets . after the mer@@ ger , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina
the mer@@ ging of the@@ operations of the tw@@ om@@ ain players in the French pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ products sector wo@@ ul@@ d@@ have created a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position on sever@@ al@@ markets .
furthermore , the combination of To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina and el@@ f service stations on French motor@@ ways would have given the new group a market share of some 60 % .
the Commission considered that this level of market power would have pus@@ h@@ ed@@ up prices in a market where they were already high .
l@@ ast@@ ly , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina and El@@ f@@ would have become the leader on the market for L@@ P@@ G , used for heating . in or@@ der@@ to resolve the competition problems identified , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina / el@@ f under@@ took to sell alar@@ ge pro@@ portion of the operations concerned to competitors .
in this way , the Commission ensured that the French fuel markets remain@@ ed@@ competitive and that consumers continued to benefit from the supply of@@ pet@@ ro@@ leum products at fair prices .
however , the special rights must not go beyond what is necessary for the performance of that service .
otherwise , from the point of view of Community law , they would cre@@ a@@ tes@@ itu@@ ations that restric@@ t competition .
the public authorities in the M@@ ember States may gr@@ ant@@ special rights , in particul@@ ar@@ monopoly rights , to public or@@ private under@@ tak@@ ings top@@ er@@ form services of general@@ economic interest .
in these sectors , a distinc@@ tion must be made between the@@ infrastructure and the services provided over@@ this infrastructure .
while it is often difficult to@@ establish a second , competing infrastructure , for reasons linked to investment costs ande@@ con@@ om@@ ic efficiency , it is possible and desi@@ rab@@ le@@ to create competitive conditions in respect of@@ the services provided .
the process of opening up these sectors to@@ competition has a positi@@ ve@@ impact for inter@@ medi@@ ate@@ users , and also for final@@ consumers .
in a sector of the economy which is experi@@ en@@ cin@@ grap@@ id growth driven by the emer@@ gence of the Internet and of electron@@ ic@@ commerce , the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is a source of@@ competitiveness and new jobs .
depending on the circumstances , it may itself adopt a European liberalisation direc@@ tive , or propose that such a direc@@ tive be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament .
a direc@@ tive is a piece of Community legislation which sets a common objective to be at@@ tained by all M@@ ember States , one that each M@@ ember State will incorpor@@ ate
it was in this way that the European Uni@@ on@@ initiated the opening @@@ -@@ @ up of the telecommunications , transport , pos@@ tal , gas ande@@ lec@@ tri@@ city markets .

Un@@ subsidis@@ ed firms can even run in@@ to@@ difficulties that will impact on their competitiveness and ability to keep the@@ i@@ re@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in jobs .
ultimately , then , the entire market will suffer from State aid , and the general competitiveness of the European economy is im@@ per@@ il@@ led .
the Commission 's monitoring of State aid has a considerable impact on day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day life and offers three main beneficial effects .
by prev@@ ent@@ ing@@ dist@@ or@@ tions of in@@ tra @@@ -@@ @ Community competition that would be dele@@ ter@@ ious to th@@ es@@ ing@@ le market , it boos@@ ts economic growth in the Union and promo@@ tes@@ employment as a result .
aid can take a variety of forms : grants and interest relief , of course , but also tax@@ relief .
aid can be given in the form of a State guarantee or holding , or even@@ provision by the State of goods and services on preferential terms .
- promote culture and heritage conserv@@ ation ; where , in the last two cases , such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common
the Commission has adopted a number of documents to clar@@ ify its State aid policy .
they concern regions lagging behind in terms of development , R & D , employment and training , small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized businesses , protection of the environment and the rescue and and 88 restructuring of firms in difficulty .
the Commission generally takes a favourable approach to such sch@@ e@@ mes as long as they do not dist@@ ort competition to an ex@@ t@@ ent@@ in@@ compatible with the common interest .
it is@@ often ap@@ prised of such sch@@ e@@ mes via complaints from firms . in@@ compatible sch@@ e@@ mes@@ are banned , and the off@@ ending M@@ ember State may well be required to rec@@ over th@@ es@@ ums paid out .
certain forms of State financial support for firms can be an@@ ec@@ ess@@ ary means of tackling structural han@@ dic@@ aps and exc@@ ess costs flow@@ ing fro@@ m@@ location in such areas .
the objective of this aid is to help alleviate or even@@ remove a number of problems ( employment , development , et@@ c . ) facing certain@@ urban areas .
it ac@@ ted@@ with the t@@ wo@@ fold concern to preserve a company in@@ the process of return to vi@@ ability on the air transpor@@ t@@ market without jeopardis@@ ing competition : consum@@ er@@ s@@ would benefit both from Al@@ ital@@ ia 's services and from those of its competitors .
the effect of this balanced policy is to preserve competitiveness an@@ dem@@ plo@@ yment throughout the common market for the benefit of all th@@ os@@ e@@ employed in the motor industry .
in my local area , there are on@@ ly@@ two large super@@ markets , each belonging to one of the t@@ wo@@ cha@@ ins in question .
at the moment , there is keen competi@@ tion@@ between the two super@@ markets in prices and promotional offer@@ s.@@ A@@ m I right in fearing that , after the mer@@ ger , this situation will@@ change and local competition will dis@@ appear ?
community dimension , the domestic competition authorities will as a rule have the power to take similar action .

petrol prices went up by the same amount on the same day in al@@ l@@ the petrol stations in my region .
it may be the consequence of an increase in tax or in the price of crude oil , for example because of an international crisis .
where there is no explanation of th@@ is@@ kind , it might be that the price rise is the result of an agreement between fil@@ l@@ ing@@ station owners or oil companies .
an investigation would have to be conducted to@@ determine whether or not this was the case .
I usu@@ al@@ ly@@ take a fer@@ ry run by the U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses line , which offers the m@@ ost@@ attractive prices of the three companies operating at the port in question .
the combination of a price rise and the al@@ ign@@ ment of prices between the thre@@ ec@@ om@@ pan@@ ies - the only three operating at the port - would seem to indic@@ ate@@ concer@@ ted action by the three firms .
in the face of red@@ un@@ dan@@ cies , what justi@@ fication is there for the Commission
the firm is going to have to pay@@ back the aid to the government .
however , the purpose of monitoring aid is not to undermine the vi@@ ability of firms . on the contrary , the goal is to ensure that firms rec@@ over a lasting vit@@ ality .
thus , aid granted to a firm in order temporarily to save its business and the jobs it provides may cause difficulties for several firms and thousands of workers that receive no government aid .
however , the Commission is in favour of aid for the restructuring of firms in difficulty , provided that it leads to the long @@@ -@@ @ term restoration of the firms " competitiveness .
private firms have different objectives from public@@ services and I am afraid that the quest for profit may promp@@ t@@ these firms to abandon un@@ profitable activities or to be les@@ s@@ rigor@@ ous on matters of safety and public health .
in some sectors , for example air transport and telecommunications , liber@@ alis@@ ation@@ has clearly brought benefits to consumers , in terms of prices and the services on offer , without calling into question flight safety or access to telecommunications
X services in geo@@ graph@@ ically remote areas .
so the public has gained agre@@ at deal from the policy of liberalisation : lower prices , a wider range of services , more efficient services and a guarantee of government scrutiny .

in this article we look at how the original pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance has taken on new dimen@@ sions .
investment was implemented through the In@@ str@@ ument for
( 1 ) e legal basis for this assistance is Council Regula@@ tion ( EC ) No 10@@ 85 / 2006 , adopted on 17 July 2006 .
candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU M@@ ember States and regions under Co@@ hesion Policy instruments .
components III , I@@ V and V are open to candidate countries only ( name@@ ly the Republic of Croatia , the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
their design mir@@ r@@ ors closely the management and programming principles of structural , co@@ hesion and rural development funds .
by gaining first @@@ -@@ @ hand experience at running these programmes , they will be well placed to absor@@ b future structural , co@@ hesion and rural development funds once they become available to them .
in this relatively short period ( programme preparations and negotiations took less than a year ) , essential preconditions and principles for successful implementation were agreed .
a quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Com@@ pon@@ ent III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance .
investment aid in candidate countries is only a frac@@ tion of the level of investment assistance available to M@@ ember Sta@@ tes@@ 2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
it gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in dev@@ ising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of St@@ ruc@@ tural Fund programmes .
the project will serve a population of approximately 4@@ 44 000 inhabitants
as a result of the Regional Development component of pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance , a prec@@ ur@@ sor to the St@@ ruc@@ tural and Co@@ hesion F@@ unds , a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
one of the main objectives of the Regional Development operational programme is to contribute to sustainable development and the regional integration of the country into the Western Balkans .
heavy pollution caused by non @@@ -@@ @ treated waste water , as well as non @@@ -@@ @ treated urban and industrial water , is however a real threat for sustainable development and the quality of life for the inhabitants .
is article focuses on the first of these elements , which will support up to 12 programmes between the M@@ ember States and ( potential ) candidate countries ( see map ) .
regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a ge@@ ar through pre @@@ -@@ @ accession funding from the countries concerned , is responsible for running the programme , supported by a Sec@@ re@@ tariat staff@@ ed from both sides of the border .
in this context , projects related to the Roma people , or to shared river bas@@ ins like the Danube and T@@ is@@ za , could be developed in the IPA cross@@ border programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local , cross@@ border area .
finally , there is another lay@@ er of benefits that should also be taken into account - these can be described as the institutional benefits for the ( potential ) candidate countries .
in line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future St@@ ruc@@ tural F@@ unds implementation , the IPA cross@@ border programmes will mir@@ ror St@@ ruc@@ tural F@@ unds rules as closely as pos@@ si@@ ble@@ . is means fir@@ st@@ ly that the programmes are run on a multi@@ annual basis .

although starting up while Bulgaria was still a candidate for accession , the projects continued as planned , after the country had become a member of the EU .
it was not only the status of the country in its relation to the EU that under@@ went a change - the funding instrument changed its name , becoming the In@@ str@@ ument for P@@ re @@@ -@@ @ Accession Assistance ( IPA ) .
• 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 : Bulgaria and Romania are benefic@@ i@@ ary countries of ISP@@ A , Croatia since 1 January 2005 .
the Republic of Croatia is a good example of a candidate country facing up to the challenges of accession .
Croatia started the accession negotiations in October 2005 and , providing all pre @@@ -@@ @ accession criteria are met , is hoping to complete the process by the end of 2009 .
Croatia 's natural beauty is a potential source of economic ri@@ ches .

in this last phase of pre @@@ -@@ @ accession , Croatian SM@@ E@@ s are generally still finding it difficult to maintain competitiveness .

geo@@ graph@@ ically , the Programme concent@@ rates on the regions where income per capita is below 75 % of the Turkish national
average ( 12 N@@ U@@ T@@ S@@ 1 II Regi@@ ons ) .
within these regions , there is a strong focus on the 15 Growth Cent@@ res which have been identified in the Strategic co@@ her@@ ence Framework .

it has been difficult , but all the pieces are now in place for some exc@@ iting economic developments , as well as providing the tools for evalu@@ ating future projects under the IPA .
in regions with high competitiveness , the measures are targeted at increasing added value , and cop@@ ing with
advisory missions were carried out to provide assistance to the Croatian authorities in building up the necessary institutional , management and control capacities .

a number of recent initiatives reflect that quality control in education is an important issue on the political agenda of the European Commission as well as in many European countries .
within the Lisbon process , enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in Europe is one of the three main goals to be achieved in the period up to 2010 .
in this context , the European Commission has set up an expert group on " Im@@ proving the Education of Te@@ ach@@ ers and tra@@ in@@ ers . "
the group has identified the development of systems for the evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the initial and in@@ service education of teachers as one of the priorities involved in improving teacher education .
concern for quality assur@@ ance in teacher education is closely linked to the broader context of the development of higher education and the follow@@ up of the Bologna Process .
they should also commit themselves exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assur@@ ance , in their work . "
in light of the Lisbon and Bologna processes , the European Commission asked Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce in the autumn of 2004 to carry out a study on regulations for the evaluation of teacher education in European countries .
only types of evaluation focusing on the quality of provision of teacher education are taken into account .
the present compar@@ ative study carried out with reference to the rep@@ lies obtained from these questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res , has been commented on and checked by the 30 Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce Network member countries ( 1 ) .
they describe the various players involved , as well as their qualifications , the documents which have to be used in identi@@ fying criteria , the focus and procedures of evaluation and its frequ@@ ency .
however , the extent to which such evaluation procedures are regulated may differ from one country to the next .
if information is available on current quality assur@@ ance practices , it is provided in the appropriate sections of this report .
the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
it may provide either a basis for reform or an evaluation of newly implemented reforms , as shown in the examples below .
in the United Kingdom ( Wal@@ es ) , a review of the provision of initial teacher education on behalf of the Wel@@ sh Assembly Government has been under@@ way since 2005 .
this looks at how a certain aspect of initial teacher education is being dealt with across the whole of the system , rather than just within a specific institution .
apart from the legislative framework for the evaluation or accredi@@ tation of higher education , no specific evaluation systems are ge@@ ar@@ ed to teacher education .
in Germany , specific regulations apply solely to the evaluation of the final " on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ job " qualifying ( indu@@ ction ) phase , which is organised by the teacher training institu@@ tes ( Stu@@ di@@ en@@ semin@@ are ) .
in Poland , teacher education provided by universities is evalu@@ ated in accordance with general regulations for quality control in higher education , whereas specific regulations apply in the case of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
in England , Wal@@ es and Northern Ireland , there are separate arrangements , established by law , for the school inspec@@ tor@@ ates to evaluate programmes of initial teacher education .
additional notes Belgium ( B@@ E de ) : the figure rela@@ tes solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education .
General regulations apply to the evaluation of all higher education ( including initial teacher education ) .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
in several countries , regulations provide for more than one evaluation procedure , including external and / or internal evaluation . there are various reasons for this : different components or stages of education
however , in 2001 , the university requested the European University Association to organise an institutional quality review , which was repeated in 2004 .
evaluation undertaken by bodies or persons not directly involved in the activities of the particular programme or institution concerned is generally referred to as external evaluation .
in Cyprus , Poland ( in the case of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es ) and Iceland , the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for external evaluation .
in Spain , the external evaluation committee has to be well balanced in terms of the training and experience of its members .
legislation on higher education and a list of evaluation criteria are the official sources most often used in the context of external evaluation .
the " guidelines for initial Te@@ acher Education courses " in Scot@@ land give regulations on the requirements for initial teacher education and specify such things as the length of programmes , the amount of school experience and comp@@ ul@@ sory programme elements .
the " Standard for initial Te@@ acher Education : bench@@ mark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have at@@ tained at the end of their programmes .
the E@@ valu@@ ation Framework for the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of Program@@ mes of initial Te@@ acher Education and the Ar@@ ran@@ gements for the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of Program@@ mes of initial Te@@ acher Education give detailed gu@@ idance on how the accredi@@ tation process works .
however , these countries have all adopted lists of criteria , some of which may involve aspects directly relating to teacher education .

Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
the committee will ensure that its interviews with different groups focus on those aspects previously analy@@ sed which have yi@@ elded contra@@ dic@@ tory findings , or which seem especially important , are unclear or are not sufficiently conclu@@ sive .
class@@ room ob@@ servation ( in the institution providing initial teacher education ) can@@ not be regarded as among the main procedures in external evaluation .

regular evalu@@ ations for the renewal of accredi@@ tation are then generally planned within a period ranging from three to twelve years after the prec@@ eding evaluation .
Denmark : the Center for Vi@@ der@@ eg@@ å@@ en@@ de Ud@@ d@@ ann@@ else are given the possibility to participate in a single accredi@@ tation process allowing them to obtain the quality la@@ bel of University Col@@ leg@@ es .
Germany : only evalu@@ ations of bac@@ hel@@ or '@@ s@@ - and master 's @@@ -@@ @ type programmes are used for the purpose of accredi@@ tation ( or re @@@ -@@ @ accredi@@ tation ) .
France : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to evaluation carried out by the des ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation carried out by the C@@ NE and the IG@@ A@@ EN@@ R .
this will be applied to institutions for teacher education once they have designed their study programmes according to the Bologna requirements .
this is an excep@@ tional situation linked to the monitoring of the 2001 reform of programmes for initial teacher education ( see chapter 1 ) .
in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occur@@ s at regular inter@@ vals and another whose frequ@@ ency var@@ ies .
the legislation of the different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der states that all external evaluation should be carried out regularly without specif@@ ying its frequ@@ ency .
in Spain , the AN@@ EC@@ A issues a call for applications , annually or every two years , from higher education institutions w@@ ishing to be evalu@@ ated .
the decision whether to submit to evaluation is taken by the head of the institution .
in Austria , external evaluation may be conducted at the request of the universities or the Ministry for Education , Science and Culture .
internal evaluation ( self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation ) of teacher education may B@@ E defined as an evaluation process for which those working in a particular institution or programme are responsible .
internal evaluation offers opportunities for quality enhan@@ cement in so far as it is a collective app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of structures and practices existing within the institution concerned .
an over@@ view of the different kinds of internal evaluation in each country covered by this survey is provided in the an@@ ne@@ x .
however , in some L@@ ä@@ n@@ der , it may also include administr@@ ators from the office of teacher training ( Am@@ t f@@ ür Leh@@ r@@ er@@ bil@@ d@@ ung ) or similar institutions in the L@@ ä@@ n@@ der , and staff from the teacher training institu@@ tes to be evalu@@ ated .
in universities in Poland , the teacher education faculty or chair of the university is responsible for internal evaluation .
in teacher training col@@ leg@@ es , internal evaluation is carried out by the colle@@ ge council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the internal evaluation process has to be managed by a specific commission appointed by the rec@@ tor / de@@ an .
in some institutions , there is a special quality manager , while in others quality issues are the responsibility of the governing board or a council .
in Bulgaria , the evaluation committee presents its reports to the governing board of the institution .
Cyprus : the F@@ ig@@ ure rela@@ tes solely to the internal evaluation of col@@ leg@@ es providing initial teacher education for primary educ@@ ation@@ .@@ Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Hungary : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that takes place prior to external evaluation .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
these experts may either act on behalf of the principal or board of the institution , or simply give meth@@ od@@ ological / technical support to the staff responsible for conducting the evaluation .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in F@@ ig@@ ure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the fac@@ ul@@ ties or departments concerned .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should cons@@ ist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
it is recommended that committees should have a maximum of seven members .
in Hungary , the committee members are professors and researchers elected by the council of the institution for a period of three years .
the student self @@@ -@@ @ governing body may deleg@@ ate a representative to the committee , subject to the approval of the council .
in Iceland , the committee should comp@@ rise at least four and no more than six members drawn from faculty staff , students and administration .
chapter 3 -@@ Internal E@@ valu@@ ation of initial Te@@ acher Education
Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
several countries state that other participants may contribute to internal evaluation , including the institution 's non @@@ -@@ @ academic staff , external stak@@ ehol@@ ders from the business sector or academic life elsewhere , and former gradu@@ ates of the institution .
in Romania , it is recommended that representatives of the institution 's best gradu@@ ates and of employers should take part in the internal evaluation of P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical university col@@ leg@@ es and universities .
in Malta , for example , all academic staff members are encouraged to conduct an evaluation of their course programme by means of questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res or interviews with their students .
external experts from abroad serving as moder@@ ators are invited to review both the course content and assessed as@@ sign@@ ments . they may also put forward recommendations for possible improvements .
in Slovenia , the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the specific commission appointed by the de@@ an for managing the internal evaluation process should be composed of teachers , administr@@ ators and student representatives .
virtually all of the fore@@ going types of document are used to identify the criteria for internal evaluation in the French Community of Belgium , Greece , Lithuania and Poland .
almost all countries use legislation on higher education to establish the criteria of internal evaluation , always in con@@ jun@@ ction with several of the other documents referred to above .
in almost all cases , the use of such documents is comp@@ ul@@ sory , except in the French Community of Belgium and Romania , where their use is recommended .
the second , the Gu@@ í@@ a de Aut@@ o@@ evalu@@ ac@@ i@@ ó@@ n ( self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation guide ) , is intended to facilitate the start of the sel@@ f@@ evaluation phase .
in Slovakia , the list of criteria developed by the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Committee for purposes of external evaluation and accredi@@ tation is very often used for the internal evaluation of study programmes in general .
figure 3.3 : official documents to be used to establish criteria for the internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification fra@@ me@@ works for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , the out@@ comes of the General Te@@ aching Council for Scot@@ land process will in turn fe@@ ed back into the internal quality assur@@ ance processes of the university .
however , there is no exp@@ li@@ cit mention of this having to happen - simply an expec@@ tation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
of the countries with official regulations on the scope of internal evaluation , most cover all ( or almost all ) of the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned issues .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curricul@@ um is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
as well as the quality of teaching , other areas of interest were the organis@@ ational structure , administration , tasks of the department , research , the provision of services , public relations and the development plan .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropri@@ at@@ eness of the course work@@ load and the teachers ' and ass@@ ist@@ ants " ability to deliver the course .
the global reports established on this basis by the department and the faculty are used for ga@@ ug@@ ing how students ' perceptions v@@ ary over time or across discipl@@ ines , and for compar@@ ing student performance .
although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school pla@@ cements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the sel@@ f@@ evaluation report .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place before external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
in 13 countries and regions , there are no official regulations which lay down procedures and mechanisms for internal evaluation .
in the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) , internal evaluation is expected but is not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly required .
Greece : the information rela@@ tes to the law on quality assur@@ ance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
in ten countries or regions , higher education institutions have to undertake internal evaluation at fixed inter@@ vals of longer periods ranging from three to ten years .
in Ireland , internal evaluation , which has to be carried out every ten years , results in external evaluation of the quality assur@@ ance procedures adopted by higher education institutions .
in the nine countries or regions in which the frequ@@ ency of internal evaluation is not determined by regulations , different scenarios are possible .
Iceland : higher education institutions are obliged to introduce an internal quality assur@@ ance system , which may take a variety of forms .
internal evaluation oc@@ curr@@ ing only once , to enable new programmes or institutions to be accredi@@ ted for the first time , is not covered .
inadequate quality may , for example , mean that institutions have to draw up and implement a plan for improvement consisting of various measures , which may be subject to follow@@ up evaluation .
penalties are also possible , as when an institution is no longer granted the right to award qualifications , or when its funding is ad@@ jus@@ ted .
over and above their consequences for institutions , the results of evaluation may also be made available to their staff , students and the general public .
in just five countries or regions ( the French Community of Belgium , Denmark , Ireland , Austria and Finland ) , these aspects der@@ ive only margin@@ ally from regulations - if at all .
it is intended that they should - entirely on their own initiative - introduce a procedure for reform inspired by the findings of external evaluation ( which remain confi@@ dential ) .
however , in the end it is the government of the Community which decides on the possible consequences of external evaluation .
in the majority of countries , the findings of external evaluation provide the basis for a decision regarding the ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation of institutions or programmes .
in Lithuania , evalu@@ ations conducted by the centre for quality assessment in higher education are ge@@ ar@@ ed as a priority to enhancing quality , but their results also fe@@ ed into a ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation process .
if the results are not satisfactory , the institution concerned may continue to offer its existing programmes but may not introduce any new ones until it has improved its performance .
the level of funding may also v@@ ary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) .
the results of these evalu@@ ations are taken into account notably during negotiations to ren@@ ew the four @@@ -@@ @ year public funding contract .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation decisions , conditional or temporary accredi@@ tation may be awarded in the case of non @@@ -@@ @ compliance with accredi@@ tation requirements .
in the Czech Republic , if the accredi@@ tation awarded to study programmes is subject to certain conditions , the faculty has to submit ( generally within two years ) a report on the fulfil@@ ment of imposed conditions .
the publication of evaluation findings means that they are available de facto to all those involved in the functioning of higher education .
in Austria , the publication of external and internal evaluation results is not subject to any regulations , which may be due to a lack of regulations on evaluation in general .
in practice in this country , evaluation results are usually made available to the stak@@ ehol@@ ders .
publication of evaluation reports from each institution / programme

Czech Republic : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occur@@ s prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
according to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
Slovenia : according to internal institutional rules , internal evaluation results are published on the website of the faculty concerned .
they are also published in reports produced by the national higher education quality assessment commission .
in 11 countries , the results have to be available to academic staff and students .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursu@@ es several aims .
it is intended to help control the system , provide reports on its quality and enable adjustments to enhance its performance .
it imp@@ lies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole .

Germany : only the results of external evalu@@ ations to ( re@@ - ) acc@@ re@@ dit bac@@ hel@@ or 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nation@@ ally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in several countries , the design of in@@ service education programmes has become completely decentral@@ ised and is the responsibility of schools .
as a consequence , schools and local education authorities offer training based on the skills and development needs of teachers and schools .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illu@@ strated in the examples below .
in Greece and Cyprus , public authority in@@ service teacher education centres are the only bodies offering provision .
in Norway , higher education institutions are the sole providers of in@@ service teacher education .
public authority in@@ service teacher education centres
teacher unions or teacher associations
these two projects are currently being implemented .
Lithuania : draft regulations on the evaluation of in@@ service teacher education are in the final phase of legal approval .
their approval and a first evaluation are planned for 2006 . Iceland : evaluation of higher education institutions providing in@@ service teacher education has not yet been carried out .
in these two countries , regulations on both accredi@@ tation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
the contents of the course have to be relevant to the objectives and strategies of the institutions and the initial education of the participants .
although no regulations exist in Cyprus , evaluation of in@@ service education programmes is conducted by the P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical Institute of the Ministry of Education and Culture .
in Malta , organisers are encouraged to review their courses by asking participants to fill in questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res .
furthermore , in England , the Tra@@ ining and Development Agency for Scho@@ ols has an extended re@@ mit covering in@@ service education for teachers .
in Spain , depending on the legislation of the Aut@@ onomous Community concerned , the evaluation of in@@ service teacher education providers consists of different elements .
those referred to as " comp@@ ul@@ sory " in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.2 are common to all Aut@@ onomous Commun@@ ities , whereas those termed " op@@ tional " reflect the situation of just some of them .
Ireland : data refer to both the external evaluation of a samp@@ le of in@@ service teacher education courses and the peri@@ o@@ dic evaluation of in@@ service teacher education providers .
Lithuania : the draft regulations include almost all procedures on a comp@@ ul@@ sory basis . Slovenia : data refer to accredi@@ tation only .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
in line with the decentral@@ ised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accredi@@ tation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Aut@@ onomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of in@@ service teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der .
as regards evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many L@@ ä@@ n@@ der have established or appointed central institu@@ tes or agencies for this task .
an agency for evaluation or an evaluation committee
the ministry of education , a ministry department or commission
Lithuania : draft regulations include an agency for evaluation within the ministry of education .
Finland : In@@ service teacher education of at least 30 EC@@ T@@ S provided by higher education institutions may be accredi@@ ted by the FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC at the request of the provider .
in Poland , depending on the course evalu@@ ated , two different bodies carry out evaluation .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practi@@ sing teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during after@@ no@@ ons , week@@ ends or summer .
the heads of regional education authorities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) , which are subordin@@ ate to the ministry , evaluate and acc@@ re@@ dit qualification courses offered by all other providers .
in the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium and Ireland , the inspec@@ torate is part of the ministry of education .
an inspec@@ torate for in@@ service teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @@@ -@@ @ Service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining ) , where it particip@@ ates in evaluation along with other bodies .
however , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.@@ 4 are not usually covered .

participants " opinions on the training they receive
In@@ service teacher education abroad
in the majority of them , the content of the activity as well as the teaching methods and / or the compet@@ ences of the tra@@ in@@ ers are taken into account .
the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accredi@@ tation of in@@ service teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
consist@@ ency between content and organisation of the activity and the educational aims seems to be one of the most important aspects .
in Ireland , evaluation also focuses on the re@@ lev@@ ance of the course to the primary school curricul@@ um and the extent to which the activity comp@@ lies with official policy and guidelines .
the detailed content requirements are compared with the goals of the respective training programme and with the data given by the programme organis@@ er .
moreover , evaluation analy@@ ses whether the programme emphasises successful learning and how the issues presented can be put into practice .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
programmes are then accredi@@ ted for five years . if providers want to continue their programmes after the fifth year , they must go through the accredi@@ tation procedure again .
programme providers are also required to carry out sel@@ f@@ evaluation procedures .
furthermore , the Sul@@ i@@ Nova K@@ ht ( a non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisation ) monitors in@@ service teacher education programmes by means of a sel@@ f@@ evaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervis@@ es and approves the National Centre of In@@ service Tra@@ ining activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educ@@ ational Auth@@ orities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of in@@ service teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the R@@ EA
in Slovenia , according to regulations which have been in place since the 2004 / 05 school year , only part of in@@ service courses are accredi@@ ted each year .
in the Czech Republic , accredi@@ tation is awarded by the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Commission .
the Ministry has the right to control the accredi@@ ted programmes during the period of accredi@@ tation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in Latvia , the commission has the right to withdraw approval given to a programme if there is proof that it has failed to meet requirements .
this accredi@@ tation may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn if there is proof of irregularities .
in Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @@@ -@@ @ making with respect to the goals , processes and instruc@@ tors of the programmes .
in the Netherlands , accredi@@ tation results are published on the website of the N@@ eder@@ lands @@@ -@@ @ Vla@@ am@@ se Ac@@ credi@@ tati@@ e Organ@@ is@@ ati@@ e ( N@@ V@@ AO , or Ac@@ credi@@ tation Organisation of The Netherlands and F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
these reports are then sent to the Council for Program@@ mes of Contin@@ u@@ ing Education and Tra@@ ining of Profes@@ sional Staff of Scho@@ ols and kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens .
on the basis of these reports , an overall national report is prepared and is discussed and assessed by the Council before being sent to the minister of education .
in Romania , accredi@@ ted teacher training programmes are published in a list used by teachers for the selection of the in@@ service training course that they must attend every five years .
these reforms have been referred to in previous chapters .
the situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adap@@ t procedures for evalu@@ ating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
this last trend is becoming increasingly more widespread in Europe .
the previous system of evaluation sought to ensure that the regulations were comp@@ lied with .
ongoing debate on the evaluation of initial and in@@ service education is exam@@ ining how far evaluation of this kind should become general practice and whether it achiev@@ es its aims .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and comp@@ ul@@ sory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the defin@@ ition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of in@@ service teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
in the case of quality assur@@ ance , recommendations should be submitted to the Wel@@ sh Assembly Government by January 2007 .
at or near the end of this period of study , they en@@ rol in a programme of initial professional training , enabling them to qualify as teachers .
Syn@@ ony@@ ms : assessment , au@@ dit , pe@@ er review , quality assessment , review .
they describe the character@@ isti@@ cs of the requirements and conditions to be met , and therefore provide the ( quanti@@ t@@ ative and / or qual@@ it@@ ative ) basis on which an evalu@@ ative conclusion is drawn .
external evaluation : the process where@@ by a specialised external body collec@@ ts data , information and evidence about an institution or a programme , in order to make a statement about its quality .
internal evaluation : a process carried out under the responsibility of those working within an institution , consisting of the systematic collection of administrative data and the questioning of students , lec@@ turers and other staff .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curricul@@ um of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be at@@ tained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredi@@ ted or certi@@ fied .

the Union is for example not responsible for social security systems , usually a large part of national spending .
existing international standards on au@@ dit do not however cover the kind of compliance au@@ dit undertaken by the Court .
the largest single element of European Union spending is agriculture and rural development , accounting for almost half of the budget .
the European Court of Au@@ di@@ tors is the EU In@@ stitution established by treaty to carry out the au@@ dit of the EU 's finances .

the results of the Court 's work are used by the Commission , the Parliament and the Council as well as by M@@ ember States , to improve the financial management of the EU budget .
the Court 's work provides an important basis for the annual dis@@ charge procedure where@@ by the Parliament , bas@@ ing its decision on recommendations from the Council , decides whether the Commission has met its responsibility for the exec@@ ution of the previous year 's budget .

adding value to financial management
irregularities and fraud
the European Court of Au@@ di@@ tors reports on any irregularities and suspec@@ ted@@ fraud .
the Treaty also requires that the Court of Au@@ di@@ tors be requested to give a formal opin@@ ion@@ on each proposal to@@ introduce or amend legislation with a financial impact , including the fight against fraud .
the objec@@ tiv@@ e@@ is to ensure that transactions have been executed in accordance with the rele@@ van@@ tru@@ les andre@@ gula@@ tions , that they exist in reality , have been correc@@ tly calculated and that the benefic@@ i@@ aries of EU aid hav@@ eful@@ filled their obligations .
value for money : have the funds been managed in an economic , efficient and effective manner , provi@@ d@@ ing@@ value for money for the citizens of the Union ?
the Court , in common with other public au@@ dit bodies , has two different approaches to sound financial manag@@ em@@ ent@@ audi@@ ts , depending on the topic under au@@ dit and the risks involved .
the first approach is to evaluate the management of the expendi@@ ture , and particularly the measures taken to achiev@@ ev@@ al@@ ue for money .
the au@@ dit concludes on whether the approach tak@@ en@@ by management was likely to ensure value for money , and if not , how it could be improved .
this involves an exam@@ ination of whether , and how , the objectives of the specific expendi@@ ture w@@ er@@ e@@ achiev@@ ed@@ and an assessment of whether the minimum resources were used for that outcome .

the multi@@ annual plan allows the Court 's strategy to be defined and up@@ dated , and the ann@@ u@@ al@@ plan sets out the specific tasks to be under@@ tak@@ en@@ during the year in question .
for every au@@ dit undertaken , the audi@@ tors prepare an au@@ dit planning memorandum which sets out the au@@ dit scope , approach and objectives , and how these are to be achieved in the most efficient and cost @@@ -@@ @ effective way .
the audi@@ tors collect evidence in accordance with@@ the au@@ dit programme , both within the European Union institutions and on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ spot in M@@ ember and benefic@@ i@@ ary States .
the type of evidence needed depends on the trans@@ ac@@ tion@@ or au@@ dit subject in question and , in particular , on the conditions for receiving the EU aid .
however , the extent of this testing can be reduced when reli@@ ance is placed on the internal control systems , where it is possible and economic to do so .
if the au@@ dit testing shows that the systems are well conce@@ ived and operating effectively , the amount of direct test@@ ing@@ of transactions necessary to meet the au@@ dit objectives can be reduced .
the purpose of the statement is to allow the audi@@ tees to confirm the fac@@ tual accur@@ acy of the Court 's au@@ dit fin@@ d@@ ing@@ s@@ and to give them the opportunity to provide any further information or explan@@ ations that may be necessary .
the purpose of au@@ dit reports is to communicate the results of the Court 's work to the audi@@ tee , the dis@@ charge author@@ it@@ y@@ and the general public .

trans@@ lation Centre for the Bo@@ dies of the European Union ( C@@ D@@ T )
the I@@ AT@@ E project was launched by the Trans@@ lation Centre in 1999 and has brought together the termin@@ ological resources of all the EU trans@@ lation services .
S@@ TA : 75 makers for a wide range of applications .
its aim is to help create a common European security culture , to support the strategic debate by providing the best possible inter@@ face between Euro -@@ p@@ ean decis@@ ion@@ makers and the di@@ verse circles of non @@@ -@@ @ official specialists .
it was on this pre@@ mis@@ e , and in the face of an escal@@ ating drug phenomenon , that the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) was established in 1993 .
at the heart of the agency 's work is the promotion of scientific exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce .
this is essential reading for policymakers , scientists and practi@@ tion@@ ers in the drugs field or anyone seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .
monitoring the drug situation
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . key indicators , core dat@@ as@@ ets ) which offer countries a " common language " with which to interpre@@ t the drug phenomenon .
as well as monitoring the drug situation today , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is ever vig@@ il@@ ant to new drugs and trends that may pose a future threat to our societies .
this publication of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) and the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g Ab@@ use Control Commission of the Organ@@ ization of American States ( C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS ) is protected by copy@@ right .
starting from a highly het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous group of drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories across different contin@@ ents , the en@@ deavour is to extr@@ act the essence of their experience and to trans@@ mit the final result in such a way that it can be re@@ interpreted in other re@@ alities and conditions .
although this is the outcome of a long elabor@@ ation and ref@@ le@@ ction process , the hand@@ book itself should be considered more as a starting point , rather than as a final achievement .
these are only a few of the questions that this hand@@ book tries to address in a practical manner , starting with the most important one : why do we need a national drugs observatory ?
one of the first consequences of this form@@ alised approach was an acknowled@@ gement of the need to set up national monitoring systems and obser@@ vat@@ ories .
since the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @@@ -@@ @ based policy @@@ -@@ @ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
this change highlights the need for governments to take better informed decisions , and to assess whether the measures taken have been implemented and if they have been successful .
• non @@@ -@@ @ EU countries involved in a co@@ operation on drugs matters with the EU and with other
) , and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities .
we must inform the re@@ ader of the following in relation to this publication :
although it presents a concep@@ tual framework , it is based on practice in establishing the network 15 years ago , and in expanding it to more than 15 new countries since then .
• we do not offer a single model to be cop@@ ied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sor@@ ts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a struc@@ tured analysis of each national context .
• to provide its national audience with the information seen as essential for policy@@ making and for the organisation of drug @@@ -@@ @ related services , and on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues of general interest ;
a national drugs observatory ( N@@ D@@ O ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information concerning drugs and
) , and their consequences .
according to national priorities , the scope of the work of the N@@ D@@ O may focus only on illi@@ cit drugs , or could also cover alcohol , tobacco and other li@@ cit drugs ( such as pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs ) .
national audience : the N@@ D@@ O addresses the information needs of four groups of customers which make up its audience at national level : decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , the scientific community , professionals working in the drugs field , and the general public .
as far as the work of an N@@ D@@ O is concerned , we use the term " core functions " to describe the key processes to be developed and implemented by the N@@ D@@ O .
in order to present the core functions of an N@@ D@@ O , we have adap@@ ted the concept of " business process . "
in order to gather , produce , analy@@ se and dis@@ semin@@ ate information in a regular manner , the N@@ D@@ O must build a sustainable network that is able to work continu@@ ously on its own improvement .
one of the main tasks of the N@@ D@@ O is to establish a national drug information network together with the partners and resources identified in the information map .
in other words , developing the drug information network , and the related networking tasks , is part of an ongoing process that represents the N@@ D@@ O 's principal and most time @@@ -@@ @ consum@@ ing activity .
• shared ownership of the results by all partners involved .
in most cases , the main publication produced by the N@@ D@@ O on a ye@@ arly basis will be a national report or an executive sum@@ m@@ ary of the latest developments in the national context .
it is of particular importance that the N@@ D@@ O provides an up@@ date of the national drugs situation ye@@ arly , both for national and for international purposes .
in addition to the national report , the N@@ D@@ O may also be expected to produce reports on ad ho@@ c studies and to provide evidence for the evaluation of national strategies and action plans .
a critical issue for the development and strengthening of the N@@ D@@ O lies within its capacity and its processes for the production of reports and other public@@ ations in co@@ operation with its national and local partners .
in 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
1 sup@@ ran@@ ational organisations , called the Lisbon consensus (
O@@ AS ) , the National Institute on Dru@@ g Ab@@ use ( N@@ I@@ DA ) , the World Health Organ@@ ization , the International E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology Wor@@ k@@ group and the Global HIV Preven@@ tion Research Network .
• Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related crime ( violations of drug laws ; pro@@ portion of property crimes associated with drug consumption ; pro@@ portion of violent crimes associated with drug consumption ) ;
as such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transp@@ os@@ ition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .
) is struc@@ tured so as to cover two main areas : " monitoring the situation " which covers ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology , crime and markets , and " monitoring responses " which covers interven@@ tions , law and policies .
they are also used for the analysis of the coverage of responses or the assessment of the impact of policies and actions .
the data sources employed to calc@@ ulate the estimates differ in each country and are dependent on the rout@@ ine information systems used in the country .
the treatment demand indicator is used to describe the population of drug users entering treatment each year and the number continuing in treatment from one year to the next .
the gui@@ ding principle of this new clas@@ si@@ fication is the target population by ass@@ ump@@ tions concerning its risk for sub@@ stance abuse , but not the overall objective or content of a prevention intervention , as was the case previously .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has developed a monitoring tool which addresses the policies and interven@@ tions that M@@ ember States have established to protect drug users from further exclu@@ sion and to improve their social inclusion .
• the situation and assistance to drug users in prisons ; • law @@@ -@@ @ enforcement measures as an alternative to prison for drug offen@@ ders , and ;
• law @@@ -@@ @ enforcement measures especially targeting stat@@ ut@@ ory di@@ ver@@ sions addressed at young offen@@ ders , in order to avoid their pro@@ gres@@ sion into the criminal justice system .
in addition , the following research protocols to study the consequences of drug use have been developed or are currently under development : emergency rooms ; treatment centres ; and mortality associated with drug use .
E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ological research forms the foundation the O@@ ID 's work in Latin America and the Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an , and is the sine qu@@ a non of any drug information system .
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book solid ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology based network in each country , leading toward the development of trend data on drug use throughout the region .
the O@@ ID programme estimates the human social and economic costs of drugs in the
the meth@@ od@@ ology is based on the " International guidelines for esti@@ m@@ ating the costs of Dru@@ g Ab@@ use " ( 11 ) ; published by the Canadian Centre on sub@@ stance
to further this effort , the O@@ ID is embar@@ king on a collabor@@ ative en@@ deav@@ or with the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction to develop a meth@@ od@@ ological tool to
although local data collection may already exist , the process of establishing a national drugs observatory is usually linked to the need to provide sub @@@ -@@ @ regional or international organisations with data on the national drugs situation .
however , a problem frequently en@@ countered is that this information is not collected in a co@@ ordinated and systematic manner , which may be compo@@ unded when some of the actors involved do not work together .
data in relation to the complex drug phenomenon are of little value if not put into context and analy@@ sed .
to identify national experts and professionals who could contribute either to a better understanding or to a better reporting of the national situation is very important .
once the relevant contact people have been identified , this sum@@ m@@ ary document should be sent to them , in order to prepare the first meeting .
it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " in C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
indeed , at the start of the information map process , the objective is to initiate contact with persons identified before sending any explan@@ atory document .
people can facilitate or slow down the process , either because they find it interesting or because they feel threatened when sharing their data and possibly their responsibility .
by " system , " we mean a struc@@ tured organisation of het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous sources of information that is needed to produce a comprehensive picture of the drug situation .
the elements of this system are not bound necessarily by hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical relations and its financing does not come from a single source of funding .
• the process of construc@@ ting the system must be documented and monitored : this is the role of the national action plan for the drug information system ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS - see P . 46 ) .
this may also apply when experts from different institutions are going to take part in the work of the N@@ D@@ O , for instance for drafting the national report .
the next step of the process involves the preparation of a national action plan for the drug information system ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS ) , in which information is combined so as to identify objectives and actions to be undertaken .
the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS should give the guidelines for the work to be carried out over the years to come .
therefore , what matters here is to identify and estimate for the concrete actions that will be launched as additional resources become available .
• D@@ ata collection : it is the responsibility of the N@@ D@@ O to identify g@@ aps and needs for additional data collection exercises , and to conv@@ ey this information to the national authorities .
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's five key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators ;
with the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS , the N@@ D@@ O and its partners identi@@ fies what needs to be done long @@@ -@@ @ term in order to implement the drug monitoring reference framework , using the information map as a starting point .
however it is important to bear in mind that kno@@ wing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are mer@@ ely long @@@ -@@ @ term goals .
once the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS is endorsed by its main stak@@ ehol@@ ders , then the N@@ D@@ O can prepare a ye@@ arly work programme .
the relationship between the partners is non @@@ -@@ @ hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical , but the network exists around a project which is co@@ ordinated under the leadership of the N@@ D@@ O .
it is the role of the N@@ D@@ O to keep the project on track , ste@@ ering the collabor@@ ative process towards a common goal .
contributions by partners , especially in deliver@@ ables produced by the N@@ D@@ O , should be acknowledged ; compet@@ ences available in the network should be used and recognised .
for networks being established following the initiative or request of the N@@ D@@ O and / or the national authorities , the Co@@ ordination role of the N@@ D@@ O should be two @@@ -@@ @ way .
• the Inter @@@ -@@ @ Minist@@ erial Dru@@ g Committee ( funding of N@@ D@@ O staff who co@@ ordinate the production of the national report and who ensure national reporting obligations are met )
when possible , on the basis of the experts and institutions identified during the information map exercise , establish a national working group for each set of indicators and core data and for national reporting .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
• Pres@@ ent the missions of the N@@ D@@ O and the national drug information network : the ultimate goal is to meet national reporting obligations
• T@@ ry to arran@@ ge a meeting every 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 years with your partners to share information , discuss the conclusions of your reports , and reflect about current trends .
the N@@ D@@ O has a key role in raising awareness on this issue with partners and driving a consensus on concrete steps to take in order to improve the quality of data collected .
improving the quality of information on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues following an initial identification of potential problems or shortcomings may be achieved by establishing new sources of information , or capacity building .
• Car@@ ry out a formal review of data quality and avail@@ ability at national level with an expert panel • compar@@ e results with international guidelines and standards

• working with quanti@@ t@@ ative data ; • analy@@ sing qual@@ it@@ ative information ; • interpre@@ ting and putting together all sources of information .
it is also important that staff keep a record of all of the information related to the data used for any reporting .
while the data collected through surveys or through government records allow for some kind of meas@@ urement , there are some areas or some aspects of the drugs situation that can@@ not be directly meas@@ ured .
2 inform about " (
Met@@ ad@@ ata give us in@@ sight as to how data were collected , what they describe and refer to , and about the reli@@ ability and compar@@ ability of the information provided .
is this study part of other sets of studies that are being compared , or is it a one @@@ -@@ @ off study ?
Met@@ ad@@ ata are as important as the data themselves , and should be stored and kept up@@ dated by the national drugs observatory , under what is sometimes called the " statistical met@@ ad@@ ata system . "
when the N@@ D@@ O identi@@ fies problems on compati@@ bility of defin@@ itions and their application with international standards and protocols , it should explore with the data providers the reasons for these discre@@ pan@@ cies and try to find solutions .
where sam@@ pling has been employed , the method of sam@@ pling can determine whether the samp@@ le is representative of the target population , or some sub@@ set ( 3 ) .
central to which prob@@ abil@@ istic sam@@ pling method is employed is the avail@@ ability or not of a co@@ her@@ ent samp@@ le frame , or l@@ isting of the target population .
Pro@@ b@@ abil@@ istic methods , correc@@ tly implemented , allow gener@@ alis@@ ations to be made to the population listed in the samp@@ le frame , with statements of sam@@ pling er@@ ror in the form of confidence inter@@ vals .
if in principle the study findings are to be gener@@ alis@@ able , it is necessary to ensure that the samp@@ le is representative .
different discipl@@ ines may make reference to different types of val@@ idity , however with quanti@@ t@@ ative studies , what is important to ensure is that :
• the measure is relevant to the study population ; • the measure is relevant to the experts in the subject ;
while assessing the val@@ idity of the studies or surveys , special attention must be paid to possible bi@@ ases , or non @@@ -@@ @ ran@@ dom or systematic err@@ ors , entering into the data .
this criter@@ ion rela@@ tes to technical issues that may arise and that may have an impact on the study and bias the results .
was there any decision taken by the inter@@ viewers that may influence or affect the sam@@ pling method ?
the N@@ D@@ O is expected to use its statistical knowledge to assess the conclusions of the reports and surveys that it has received , and / or to conduct or contribute to the statistical analysis of primary data .
scientific objec@@ tivity and independence are essential conditions for the legitimacy and credibility of the work of the N@@ D@@ O and its partners - any compromise would undermine the vi@@ ability of the whole system .
qual@@ it@@ ative research gives us an opportunity to make sense of quanti@@ t@@ ative information , by further expl@@ oring :
the N@@ D@@ O plays an important role in making an invent@@ ory of such research results in its country , and in integr@@ ating these results in its analysis and reports .
it can also identify the areas where additional qual@@ it@@ ative research is needed , and launch a joint project with its partners if resources are available .
qual@@ it@@ ative research is characterised by a wide range of approaches and data collection techniques , and determining how to judge the quality of a qual@@ it@@ ative study will depend on the approach adopted .
efforts have been made to develop criteria within qual@@ it@@ ative research which are accepted broad@@ ly as re@@ pla@@ cements for what quanti@@ t@@ ative researchers call val@@ idity and reli@@ ability .
the strength of qual@@ it@@ ative research is that it addresses the relationship between the researcher and the research object , prec@@ lu@@ ding the no@@ tion of a common truth .
generally , qual@@ it@@ ative studies are not interested in an " average " - they gain an understanding of the experience of particular groups or individuals .
in any case , we need to understand how the samp@@ le was selected in order to understand the results and in order to draw conclusions .
describing methods is not an easy task in qual@@ it@@ ative research but you should be able to assess whether the methods were a sen@@ sible and adequate way of addressing the research question .
• W@@ as attention given to the reli@@ ability of inter @@@ -@@ @ observers and to the val@@ idity of findings ?
• - with other parts of the study ; • - with the results of other studies performed in the same environment ?
the information from key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts is never un@@ biased ; it is influenced by their position , their personal , political , or cultural interests : what is their motiv@@ ation ?
• Do@@ es the author ( s ) reveal his / her view point ( s ) and discuss how his / her view point ( s ) may affect the study ?
• Wh@@ o auth@@ ored and who reviewed the study ?

• developments in the music culture ( increase in popularity of music cultures that are associated with drug consumption ) ;
such studies can be used as additional sources of information , keeping in mind that the results can@@ not simply be transferred to other populations .
reli@@ ability and val@@ idity challenges for drug trend monitoring systems or potential for er@@ ror , lie in two broad areas : at the level of individual sources and at the whole system level .
a number of researchers have argued in favour of the use of mixed methods for drug trend
in the long run , a failure to build visi@@ bility and to demonstrate the added value of the N@@ D@@ O will automatically have a negative impact on its credibility .
this is one aspect of the N@@ D@@ O 's reporting that may sometimes be under@@ estimated , for instance when the focus of its work , or of its mandate , is to meet national reporting obligations of sup@@ ran@@ ational or international organisations .
instead , it should be possible to use particip@@ ative techniques such as focus groups with sub@@ groups of end @@@ -@@ @ users to assess in detail the re@@ lev@@ ance of specific out@@ puts .
• A@@ n assessment of the information needs of its stak@@ ehol@@ ders at national level , through regular dialogue with its direct " clients , " for instance by asking their fe@@ ed@@ back about their products
the N@@ D@@ O 's potential stak@@ ehol@@ ders and potential clients are decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , professionals working in the drugs field , the scienti@@ fi c community and the general public .
once the stak@@ ehol@@ ders have been identified , it is necessary for the N@@ D@@ O to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
their decision has an impact on the existence of the national drugs observatory and on the investment in the national drugs information network .
they are the N@@ D@@ O 's key partners and data providers ; they need to be motivated for maintaining or even increasing their contribution , and they should gain some benefit for their efforts .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
two additional groups could also be added to the list of stak@@ ehol@@ ders , although they are usually not the primary target for the N@@ D@@ O 's communication and dis@@ sem@@ ination strategy .
an N@@ D@@ O contribution to their work could either be in the form of providing information or contributing to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of their research results .
making clear and under@@ stan@@ dable information available to the general public is part of their fundamental rights : it is also an obligation for organisations that are being established with public money .
the same approach can be used at the end of the process , to check if the fi nal product matches the form@@ at and content needs identified in the mat@@ ri@@ x .
information covering a wide range of technical and meth@@ od@@ ological issues , struc@@ tured and well documented contents , in a not @@@ -@@ @ too @@@ -@@ @ detailed form@@ at ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a comp@@ il@@ ation of documents ) .
producing a report that goes beyond a simple descri@@ ption of the situation can be done either by being pro@@ active or by using the information available in a more cre@@ ative manner :
how can we present the results to our national authorities in a way that appeals to them ? "
in the first approach , additional information identified by the N@@ D@@ O may be needed , which may mean deciding how to obtain or produce the missing information .
a comple@@ mentary approach can be to cor@@ rela@@ te the information on the national situation together with the situation at regional or international level .
when the N@@ D@@ O produces reports and other out@@ puts , it should always be able to answer the ... " so what ? " question .
every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @@@ -@@ @ defin@@ ed@@ . ned .
• Be prospec@@ tive : on the basis of the available information , try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and per@@ spec@@ tives , or new risks
there are , however , some important differences between reporting systems , related to the purpose of the exercise , the procedures followed for data collection , and the role of the main actors .
this is what we will describe brief@@ ly , starting with the UN reporting system , which is used worldwide .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Ann@@ ual Re@@ ports questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res ( AR@@ Q ) and it had been regularly reported to the CN@@ D ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
the Commission on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs ( CN@@ D ) : is the central policy@@ making body of the United N@@ ations in drug @@@ -@@ @ related matters .
each of the protocols are stand@@ ardis@@ ed with the goal of producing information that is compar@@ able across countries .
the information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comp@@ rise the ME@@ M In@@ str@@ ument in the form of a questionnaire ( 5 ) .
• they are used to build a European picture , to analy@@ se the situation and the evol@@ ution of the phenomenon and responses ;
• these monitoring systems depend heavily on the quanti@@ ty and quality of the information provided by their respective M@@ ember States - this information needs to be accur@@ ate , provided on time , and reliable ;
• clar@@ ify the process for delivery and identify the end benef@@ i ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national co@@ ordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs co@@ ordinating body , et@@ c . )
• Be fac@@ tual and neutral , do not exceed your role : the N@@ D@@ O 's credibility reli@@ es on its objec@@ tivity , not the political opinions of its staff
indeed , the long @@@ -@@ @ term challenge for the N@@ D@@ O is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that its various " clients " are satis@@ fi@@ ed@@ . ed .
the next step is to consider whether the N@@ D@@ O 's mandate allows direct communication with s t the media , or not .
a more appropriate question would be " how can we integrate work with media professionals in the national drug observatory 's communication strategy , within the limits of its re@@ mit ? "
this does not prevent the head of the N@@ D@@ O answ@@ ering requests for information from journalists , but the internal procedure could imply li@@ a@@ ising with the press relations officer of the host institution .
in countries where the N@@ D@@ O is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug co@@ ordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 7 ) :
when the N@@ D@@ O is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confi@@ dential note to the national drug co@@ ordinating body ( N@@ DC ) - if relevant - or trans@@ mits the information through the normal channels .
the main concern here is to ensure that the political powers are informed in advance of any up and coming " hot " topics .
institutional issues are only one of the challenges faced by an N@@ D@@ O : the core operations are what give the sub@@ stance and legitimacy of the work of national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories .
1 ) : environment which is essential in order to achieve its goals and objectives (
we refer in particular to a study published by Al@@ ford in 2001 , in which he presents a few character@@ isti@@ cs that can apply to N@@ D@@ Os ( we ital@@ ic@@ ise ) :
• the organis@@ ational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @@@ -@@ @ production ) " ( 3 ) .
• N@@ D@@ O production depends on its co@@ operation with other national sources of information and of expertise , in most of the cases it can@@ not work on its own ( co @@@ -@@ @ production )
• the N@@ D@@ O buil@@ ds its capacity on the basis of di@@ verse resources and partners , at national , local and sup@@ ran@@ ational level ( combined resources )
• when it is set up , in order to identify existing resources and means , as well as clar@@ ify the mandate for its establishment ;
• the value of the N@@ D@@ O 's work is not always meas@@ ur@@ able - it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and out@@ puts ;
• the value of the N@@ D@@ O 's work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals ;
to conclude : try to identify and define the N@@ D@@ O 's perceived or potential added value from the point of view of its audience / stak@@ ehol@@ ders , rather than from one of its promo@@ ters ( see box below ) .
note : an " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " ( or ele@@ vat@@ or speech ) is an over@@ view of an idea for a product , service , or project .
the name reflects the fact that an ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch can be delivered in the time sp@@ an of an ele@@ vat@@ or ride ( for example , thirty seconds and 50 @@@ -@@ @ 100 words ) .
to support the perceived value of the N@@ D@@ O , we propose using three categories of criteria to identify additional actions / measures : added value of N@@ D@@ O 's products , credibility , and relations with its audiences and stak@@ ehol@@ ders .
is the N@@ D@@ O promoting itself as the reference organisation that can ta@@ il@@ or information according to the needs of its customers ?
is the N@@ D@@ O trying to address the needs of national " clients , " even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation ?
in fact , in many cases , most of the N@@ D@@ O 's products are the result of partnerships and co@@ operation , and external expertise may be needed also to val@@ idate its analy@@ ses and reports .
information map : is an information map drafted and permanently up@@ dated so as to identify any source of expertise and information available in the country , and is there any communication policy ge@@ ar@@ ed towards the strategic partners ?
are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confron@@ tation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?
content : do contents of reports and other public@@ ations reflect the need for a M@@ ulti@@ disciplinary and multi@@ fac@@ eted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon , or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem ?
does the N@@ D@@ O have a specific and exp@@ li@@ cit role in the national strategy document aimed at providing the evidence needed to monitor the implementation and evaluation of this national strategy ?
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book of their clients , needs assessments or programmes / projects evalu@@ ations that could be useful to understand the situation ?
a strategic plan aims to make sure that the N@@ D@@ O will consolidate or improve its situation and will maxim@@ ise its position as regards the three key strategic factors , which could be sum@@ mar@@ ised as follows :
• to improve and to diversi@@ fy the co @@@ -@@ @ production scheme so as to produce better products which are ta@@ il@@ ored to the needs of its different client groups ;
what matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame , in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients .
in the current context of general soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic difficulties , one should avoid the temp@@ tation of presenting exagger@@ ated objectives and excessive requests for funding .
these will not only be refused by the decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , but will also give the N@@ D@@ O and its promo@@ ters a negative image that might prove fatal for the organisation 's survival .
however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the cho@@ ices to be made .
in this chapter we will present and provide some elements of response to common questions frequently asked about national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories , and to which there is usually no single answer .
it is important to ensure that co@@ operation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the supply side .
it is important to ensure that co@@ operation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the demand side .
if the N@@ D@@ O is established at a too low structural and hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical level within an existing institution , this presents the same dis@@ advantages and also gives no visi@@ bility to the N@@ D@@ O and its products .
it then becomes extremely difficult for the N@@ D@@ O to fulfil its mandate and address the needs of its stak@@ ehol@@ ders at national level .
the latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution 's position than its performance .
• limiting the scope of the N@@ D@@ O 's work to illi@@ cit drugs , for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of sup@@ ran@@ ational and international organisations such the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and UNODC ;
it can also provide the opportunity to observe and analy@@ se possible cor@@ relations between
• The technical and scientific know @@@ -@@ @ how of the N@@ D@@ O and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity ;
• The N@@ D@@ O needs to attract and to keep competent staff , and it needs to be stable so as to ensure both its scientific capacity and the quality of its processes and deliveries ;
if the N@@ D@@ O is established as a small unit , it often ten@@ ds to rely too heavily on external expertise and sometimes poorly @@@ -@@ @ organised national networks .
if the N@@ D@@ O is given an important national mandate as an observatory , this imp@@ lies that the compet@@ ences required need to cover the full range of core functions as described in chapters 3 to 5 .
if this is the case , special attention must be paid to institutional relations and co@@ operation , and to communication and public relations .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the N@@ D@@ O will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the N@@ D@@ O 's capacity to deliver out@@ puts and be accountable for the use of funds .
the objective of this review is to ensure that there are neither mistakes nor any mis@@ interpre@@ tation of the data , and to val@@ idate the publication .
the N@@ D@@ O is primarily operational in the area of information and is not involved in politics .
if the N@@ D@@ O is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories may contribute to the evaluation of national drug policies or of specific aspects of national strategies , at the request of their respective national authorities .
• the N@@ D@@ O should reserve the right to accept - or to propose a technical modi@@ fication in order to accept - to perform the evaluation ;
• the N@@ D@@ O 's contribution to the evaluation should be on scientific grounds ( fac@@ tual , neutral , objective , reliable ) and should avoid making political conclusions that are the re@@ mit of national authorities ;
• the N@@ D@@ O should clar@@ ify what are the questions of the evaluation for which there is no evidence available .
when the scope of the work carried out by the N@@ D@@ O within the evaluation is clearly limited , this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the N@@ D@@ O .
the time has now come to develop your own vision and to take this forward into practice .
as you start on this process , we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in .
taking on board the ideas , concep@@ ts and experiences that have been shared with you in this hand@@ book , you must now build a vision of what your national drugs observatory should be like .
there are no institutional models to be cop@@ ied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .
our pri@@ ced public@@ ations are available from the EU bo@@ ok@@ shop ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bo@@ ok@@ shop@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u ) , where you can place an order with the sales ag@@ ent of your choice .
looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to form@@ alise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concep@@ ts and principles that remain valid ir@@ respective of country or region .
the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g Ab@@ use Control Commission ( C@@ IC@@ AD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organ@@ ization of American States ( O@@ AS ) in 1986 as the western hem@@ is@@ phere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
as well as gathering information on the demand and reduction of the demand for drugs , the agency in recent years has extended its monitoring and reporting on drug supply , supply reduction and illi@@ cit drug markets .
data collection in the C@@ IC@@ AD system takes place within the context of the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Ob@@ ser@@ vatory on Dru@@ gs ( O@@ ID ) .
one of the agency 's key aims is to ren@@ der drug information more compar@@ ab@@ le@@ across Europe .
although the Centre can@@ not propose any kin@@ d@@ of policy model , it is now making a clear impact on decision @@@ -@@ @ making throug@@ hits analy@@ ses , instruments and standards .
the 2007 ES@@ PA@@ D report sub@@ stance use among students in 35 countries
a great deal of additional information on the European Union is available on the Internet .
it can be acc@@ essed through the Europ@@ a ser@@ ver ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u ) .
the work of the ES@@ PA@@ D project would not have been possible without the gener@@ ous support of the Swedish Government , the Swedish National Institute of Public Health and the P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou Group .
sum@@ m@@ ary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bun@@ des@@ l@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
country samp@@ le siz@@ es were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
a small number of questions regarding cigarette smoking are given at the beginning of the questionnaire .
in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
on average , 7 % of the students said that they had been smoking cigarettes on a daily basis at the age of 13 or younger .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
only four countries give a contrary image regarding the long@@ term down@@ ward trend in recent smoking , dis@@ playing higher levels in 2007 than in 1995 .
hence , the overall picture of the trend in past 30 days smoking in the ES@@ PA@@ D countries is one of a decrease , or at least of a stabil@@ ized situation .
the total amount of alcohol consu@@ med during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequ@@ encies .
in nearly all countries boys drink larger quantities than girls . the most pronounced contrast to this is Iceland , where girls report larger quantities than boys .
in a large majority of the countries , beer is the dominant be@@ verage among boys while spir@@ its is the most important be@@ verage among girls in a little more than half of the countries .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man and the United Kingdom .
boys also dominated in a large majority of the countries .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
on average , half of the ES@@ PA@@ D students have been in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ated at least once during their lif@@ etime , to the point of stag@@ gering when walk@@ ing , having s@@ l@@ urred speech or thro@@ wing up .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
students reported problems related to their alcohol consumption include Bulgaria , the Is@@ le of Man , the United Kingdom and Latvia .
however , for some of the problems the aver@@ ages are about the same and for one ( " serious problems with friends " ) it is even slightly higher among girls .
in the two top @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Is@@ le of Man ) one in six students reported can@@ na@@ bis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular can@@ na@@ bis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
one @@@ -@@ @ third of the students in the ES@@ PA@@ D countries find can@@ na@@ bis read@@ ily available .
countries where many students report past 30 days can@@ na@@ bis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try can@@ na@@ bis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illi@@ cit drugs at least once during their lif@@ etime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from can@@ na@@ bis were found , and the percentage of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users in a population correspon@@ ds to the can@@ na@@ bis use pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the single countries .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report non@@ pres@@ cri@@ bed use of these drugs ( 8 % ver@@ sus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
slightly more girls than boys did so ( 8 ver@@ sus 5 % ) .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
the average for lif@@ etime use of in@@ hal@@ ants for all ES@@ PA@@ D countries is 9 % and there are no gender differences on the ag@@ gre@@ gate level .
the rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lif@@ etime use relatively well across countries .
it is well known that , on the individual level , there is often a relationship between the use of different substan@@ ces .
the overall sub@@ stance @@@ -@@ @ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the vari@@ able in focus .
no changes in gender differences are apparent for illi@@ cit drugs or the other substan@@ ces mentioned .
individual country pre@@ val@@ ence rates for the key@@ vari@@ ables are compared to the aver@@ ages for all countries .
the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the vari@@ ables .
sum@@ m@@ ary western Europe and countries dis@@ playing increases are often found in eastern Europe .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illi@@ cit drug use is rising .
we hope that still more European countries will join in the next survey , in addition to the over 40 countries that are part of the ES@@ PA@@ D project already .
European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction
sum@@ m@@ ary - the 2007 ES@@ PA@@ D report
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult cho@@ ices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
the global debate on the drug problem is not short on rhetoric regarding the need for a balanced and evidence @@@ -@@ @ based approach .
drug use is a complex issue , and it is not one that len@@ ds itself to simple conclusions .
a ref@@ le@@ ction on the information available also remin@@ ds us of the need for continued vig@@ il@@ ance and of the dangers of compla@@ cen@@ cy .
non@@ e@@ theless , in Europe as a whole , a tre@@ mend@@ ous effort has been made to address these sor@@ ts of problems ,
• the Mem@@ bers of the Management Board and the Scientific Committee of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ;

the 2006 statistical bul@@ letin ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / stat@@ s@@ 0@@ 6.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
a continuous programme of evaluation is envis@@ aged for the strategy , with annual progress re@@ views and impact assessments at the end of each of the two action plan periods .
nearly 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
the strategy can be seen as representing a European consensus on how the drug problem should be addressed .
non@@ e@@ theless , the new drug strategy suggests that the European policy debate on drugs is increasingly characterised by agreement on a common framework for activities .
among those new to treatment , the numbers with a primary op@@ i@@ oid problem have been decreas@@ ing in most countries .
non@@ e@@ theless , this is an area where waves of ep@@ i@@ demic use have been seen in the past , and therefore compla@@ cen@@ cy must be avoided .

elsewhere , while some moderate increases in levels of cocaine use have been noted in a few countries , dramatic increases are not being reported .
typical range 0.@@ 3 % to 1.5 % ( 15 countries )
it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .
in Europe , cocaine use is at histor@@ ically high levels , and studies suggest that it is a common pat@@ tern for increases in problems relating to a drug to la@@ g some years behind increases in pre@@ val@@ ence .

a common theme running through this report is the increasing need to develop responses that are sensitive to the complex and multi@@ fac@@ eted nature of today 's drug problem .
while g@@ lob@@ ally meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine problems continue to grow , within Europe the drug remains restricted to a few countries with long @@@ -@@ @ established problems .
in 2006 , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA published a technical paper on hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms , and this issue is again sum@@ mar@@ ised in our annual reporting .
the avail@@ ability and use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms appears to have been increasing since the late 1990s but to a large extent has passed un@@ noticed .
such innovation requires a response as the potential for these substan@@ ces to cause severe health problems is unknown .

on the other hand , it also found that there has been a fall in the age at which people first experim@@ ent with drugs and an increase in dru@@ g@@ related deaths linked to substan@@ ces other than op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
in addition , the Ministry of Health and Con@@ sum@@ ers " Affairs has approved an action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 to mobil@@ ise resources and implement initiatives with the aim of pro@@ g@@ ressing and rev@@ it@@ alising the national drug strategy .

it is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , will present annual progress re@@ views .

possession of more than 10 dos@@ es must be charged under Sec@@ tion 17@@ 2 , which , depending on the ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
in addition , the age of criminal li@@ ability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years .
the maximum sentence for theft of a large amount of drugs or theft by an organised group has been extended to 15 years .
exem@@ ption from penalty and postpon@@ ing the exec@@ ution of the penalty can now be applied to drug law offences .
several countries legisla@@ ted on threshold quantities of drugs during the reporting period .
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offen@@ ders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guide@@ line on can@@ na@@ bis , " according to which possession of up to 10 gram@@ s of can@@ na@@ bis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the Minister of Health of Lithuania amended recommendations on what shall be regarded as small , large and very large amounts of narco@@ tic and psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces , re@@ defining these quantities .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .
other sent@@ encing statistics showed that the w@@ ai@@ ving of reports as stat@@ ut@@ ory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convic@@ tions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed comp@@ ul@@ sory treatment , effectively decreas@@ ing the involvement of the prob@@ ation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
statistics on sent@@ encing , or avo@@ idance of sent@@ encing , give a far more accur@@ ate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 2@@ a ) .
data on " reports " ( 11 ) of drug law offences are available in all the European countries analy@@ sed in this report .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .

chapter 1 : policies and laws at presenting a first in@@ sight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
a slow integration , strate@@ g@@ ically or institu@@ tionally , of li@@ cit drugs into policy and measures against illi@@ cit drugs appears to be more and more common .
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to under@@ pin , support and explain to the population at large the ration@@ ale under@@ lying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical gu@@ idance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . in France and Ireland ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe four countries ( Belgium , Germany , Italy and Luxembourg ) reporting on new projects in this area .
with the recognition and development of the selec@@ tive prevention approach by most M@@ ember States , vulnerable groups are increasingly being targeted .
approaches not based on abst@@ in@@ ence are effective in reducing not only consumption but also initi@@ ation among those groups in which in@@ cip@@ i@@ ent drug use is already oc@@ curr@@ ing .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .

the new M@@ ember States and candidate countries account for only a small frac@@ tion of the clients in sub@@ stitution treatment in the European region , which can partly be explained by lower levels of op@@ i@@ oid use in these countries .
although the overall provision of sub@@ stitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indic@@ ations of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
32 receiving such treatment stabil@@ ised or decreased (
in the Czech Republic , Italy , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , local or regional policies are reported to exist , and in Bulgaria strategies have been drawn up at local level in nine cities .
in the new central European M@@ ember States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @@@ -@@ @ in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent inf@@ ec@@ tious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies wi@@ den the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
however , in 10 countries ( 37 % ) , inf@@ ec@@ tious disease strategies exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly mention the prevention of hep@@ ati@@ tis C infection among drug

the common strategic platform on the reduction of health@@ related harm that the EU drug strategy provides is mir@@ ro@@ red in many national policies across the EU and has supported a main@@ stream@@ ing of evidence @@@ -@@ @ based responses in this area .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
units that speci@@ alise in tre@@ ating can@@ na@@ bis or cocaine users have been reported from 13 countries , and specific treatment programmes for these groups in drugs agencies exist in eight countries .
a similar specialised programme for amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 action plan calls on M@@ ember States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social re@@ integration programmes . "
non@@ e@@ theless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
in 2004 / 05 , in response to the EU action plan , 20 of the
the main provider of funds is to be found at state / national level in 11 countries , whereas funding is predominantly at regional / local level in eight countries .
under the current economic circumstances , many countries may find it difficult to meet the voc@@ ational re@@ integration needs of older heroin users , even if they are stabil@@ ised in drug maintenance treatment .
the service most com@@ mon@@ ly offered to home@@ less problem drug users is access to " gener@@ ic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries comb@@ ine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from M@@ ember States conver@@ ge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and prec@@ ar@@ ious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social re@@ integration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
) Social re@@ integration is defined as " any social intervention with the aim of integr@@ ating former or current problem drug users into the community . " the three
" pil@@ lars " of social re@@ integration are housing , education and employment ( including voc@@ ational training ) .
as facilities are currently available in most countries , and as some countries continue to implement new structures , the effect of these measures will depend on ensuring that home@@ less problem drug users can access these services .
quantities seized may f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ate widely from one year to the next , for example if in one year a few of the seiz@@ ures are very large .
data on quantities seized in 2004 provided by the Netherlands were only estimates , which could not be included in the analysis of trends to 2004 .

participation in ES@@ PA@@ D has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU M@@ ember States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .

chapter 3 : can@@ na@@ bis continuation and from 10 % to 25 % for last 30 days
this could represent an important long @@@ -@@ @ term change in can@@ na@@ bis use pat@@ ter@@ ns that mer@@ its further attention .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
other countries are also working on scal@@ es to assess intensive forms of can@@ na@@ bis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is promoting collaboration in this area .
it has been hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ ised that use may be spreading to smaller towns or rural areas , and Poland documented this trend in its 2005 national report .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the early 1990s on@@ wards , and some of these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sights into trends over time .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
this bench@@ mark has often been used in studies and can be der@@ ived from the European model questionnaire .
in addition , school surveys can give valuable information about trends in drug use among the younger members of the population , which may predict future trends among young adults .
in most countries , since 1995 , there has been an overall increase in the number of school students who have ever tried can@@ na@@ bis .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78
75 out@@ patient sett@@ ings (
although the number of these requiring interven@@ tions is unknown , the number of can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related treatment demands is small in relation to this figure .
a number of factors are likely to be associated with the increased demand for can@@ na@@ bis treatment , and this remains an area requiring research scrutiny .
the available data suggest that can@@ na@@ bis clients in out@@ patient treatment centres tend to be relatively young : virtually all can@@ na@@ bis clients new to treatment are under 30 years old .
almost no one seeking treatment reports having used can@@ na@@ bis for the first time after the age of
well @@@ -@@ @ implemented universal prevention programmes can delay or reduce the initi@@ ation of young people into the use of substan@@ ces such as tobacco , alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis .
an additional consideration in stri@@ ving to prevent or delay the on@@ set of initi@@ ation into can@@ na@@ bis use is the fact that ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents are more vulnerable to can@@ na@@ bis to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity .
some clients seek treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use in combination with other drug or alcohol problems , and sometimes the request for treatment is related to more general problems , such as conduct dis@@ order among young people . furthermore ,
the pro@@ files of young can@@ na@@ bis users , at least in the early stages of consumption , do not differ from those of young alcohol or tobacco users .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe prevention for young people should not focus on can@@ na@@ bis alone , but should be aimed at preventing use of alcohol and tobacco too .
it is known that one reason for intensive consumption of alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis among boys is that they find it difficult to approach girls , and thus these projects offer training in f@@ li@@ r@@ ting .
brief interven@@ tions are cost @@@ -@@ @ effective and may be particularly appropriate to can@@ na@@ bis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
brief intervention is an approach that aims to make people reflect on their use of drugs and to provide them with skills to control it .
there is evidence for the effectiveness of brief intervention in preventing alcohol and tobacco misuse , and there is growing interest in the value of this approach for other substan@@ ces .

six countries have tigh@@ tened up their legislation on mus@@ h@@ rooms in the last five years ( Denmark , Germany , Estonia , Ireland , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) .
this is a common feature of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to conf@@ ine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for rec@@ re@@ ational purposes ( 130 ) .

the value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely un@@ explo@@ red , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
in a number of cities cr@@ ack cocaine users have been targeted by out@@ reach sch@@ e@@ mes that attempt to engage with what is often viewed as a difficult group to work with .
a more controversial approach has been adopted in some cities in Europe , where the concept of safe consumption rooms , usually targeting drug in@@ j@@ ection , has been extended to drug in@@ hal@@ ation .

based on the most recent data available , countries can be classified into three groups according to the pro@@ portion of drug users seeking treatment who report problem use of heroin , as follows :

the number of repeat requests has generally not declined , and in most countries the total number of treatment demands for heroin has remained roughly stable .
research has also suggested that levels of criminal activity may be reduced and that sufficient provision of sub@@ stitution treatment may have an impact on the number of dru@@ g@@ related deaths .

in Latvia , two time series of ser@@ op@@ re@@ val@@ ence data among I@@ D@@ U@@ s show a continued increase until 2002 / 03 while a third series suggests a decrease since the peak in 2001 .
in Spain and Italy , national data from case reporting are not available .
a robust body of available evidence shows that interven@@ tions can be considered effective and that access to treatment of all types provides protection ( Far@@ rell et al . , 2005 ; WHO , 2005 ) .
in the Nordic region , the great majority of noti@@ fied ac@@ ute cases of hep@@ ati@@ tis B occur among I@@ D@@ U@@ s , and hep@@ ati@@ tis B out@@ breaks have coinci@@ ded with increases in drug in@@ j@@ ecting in several countries .
in Finland , hep@@ ati@@ tis B noti@@ fic@@ ations among I@@ D@@ U@@ s have fallen ste@@ ep@@ ly in recent years , possibly as a result of vacc@@ ination programmes and a comprehensive ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange system .
chapter 7 : Dru@@ g@@ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases and dru@@ g@@ related deaths
the purchase of sy@@ r@@ inges through pharmac@@ ies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , and the potential to explo@@ it this contact point as a con@@ du@@ it to other services clearly exists .
mortality and dru@@ g@@ related deaths
from these data , it is possible to make a crude esti@@ mation of the annual number of sy@@ r@@ inges available per in@@ j@@ ec@@ tor ( 1 ) .
the meas@@ urement of sy@@ rin@@ ge coverage is an important component of understanding the likely effects of sy@@ rin@@ ge distribution in disease prevention and for assessing un@@ met needs .
a collabor@@ ative study that started within an E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA project examined mortality among op@@ i@@ oid users recru@@ ited in treatment in eight European locations ( 19@@ 6 ) .
the study found a very high mortality among op@@ i@@ oid users compared with their pe@@ ers : 6 @@@ -@@ @ 20 times higher among mal@@ es and 10 @@@ -@@ @ 50 times higher among fem@@ al@@ es .
mortality 9.@@ 5 times higher than in the general population , but with a decreas@@ ing trend .

the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 20@@ 3 ) .
the termin@@ ology used var@@ ies between countries , and in some cases it is difficult to determine what role meth@@ ad@@ one played in the death .

deaths due to bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine po@@ is@@ oning appear to be rare , a fact that is attributed to the ag@@ on@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ ant@@ ag@@ on@@ ist pharmac@@ ological character@@ isti@@ cs of this drug .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreas@@ es in the numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment avail@@ ability and harm reduction initiatives , although dec@@ lines in the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use may also be important .

ec@@ st@@ asy deaths cause considerable concern as they often occur un@@ expec@@ tedly among socially integrated young people .
in Europe as a whole , there were refer@@ ences to 77 deaths ,
210 which should be considered as a minimum estimate (
in Spain , ec@@ st@@ asy was present in 2.5 % of drug po@@ is@@ on@@ ings .
although interpre@@ tations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths in some countries , these pat@@ ter@@ ns could be related to the trends in heroin in@@ j@@ ection ( 20@@ 9 ) .

further research is needed in this area .
research into the circumstances of over@@ dos@@ es has supported the development of interven@@ tions that target high @@@ -@@ @ risk situations or high @@@ -@@ @ risk individuals .
such measures may achieve an important reduction in the deaths attri@@ but@@ able to the immediate effects of drug taking .
the data that do exist indicate that many deaths involving cocaine also involve op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .

chapter 8@@ Im@@ proving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
European drug situation . increasingly , we are seeing a more complex picture with respect to chron@@ ic drug problems in Europe .
included in the defin@@ ition , by convention , is the use of other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids such as meth@@ ad@@ one .
this defin@@ ition of P@@ D@@ U is a pu@@ rely behavi@@ our@@ al one based on drug consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns and does not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly measure problems in any sense .
non@@ e@@ theless , it is linked to the various concep@@ ts of addi@@ ction by the understanding that someone be@@ having in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem us@@ er . "
this changing position must be seen against the background of greatly expanded treatment provision for those with op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ related problems as well as increased reporting coverage of treatment services .
non@@ e@@ theless , in many countries it appears that those developing a drug problem today in Europe are likely to be , in terms of the substan@@ ces they are using at least , more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous than has histor@@ ically been the case .
in terms of the current implementation of the P@@ D@@ U indicator across the EU , countries have adap@@ ted the defin@@ ition to cover the prac@@ tic@@ alities of their local situation and the position is therefore het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous .
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorpor@@ ated into the monitoring exercise , beyond P@@ D@@ U monitoring .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods comple@@ ment population survey work , which , for a range of meth@@ od@@ ological and practical reasons , is less su@@ itable for esti@@ m@@ ating the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use that is of low pre@@ val@@ ence , sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ sed and largely hidden .
the way forward in this area requires the form@@ alising of the concept of frequent , intensive use of can@@ na@@ bis and other illi@@ cit drugs as a specific target for monitoring .
this pat@@ tern of use seems to exist among some chron@@ ic users , possibly among margin@@ alised groups , possibly among people with psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric conditions .
a second drug with a functional or pharmac@@ ological ration@@ ale is not con@@ fined to simultane@@ ous use but may also be used consecu@@ tively , as a replacement or as a comple@@ mentary drug .
increased risks through pol@@ y@@ drug use
survey results do show considerable use of more than two drugs by individuals in the same time period .
figure 15 : use of drugs in the last year by different us@@ er groups in the general population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34
Pol@@ y@@ drug use could be us@@ efully defined oper@@ ation@@ ally as the frequent use of more than one sub@@ stance over a minimum specified time period , for example one month .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
given that many of the data sources available are based on behavi@@ our@@ al reports of drug consumption , the concept of frequent or intensive use needs to be developed on this basis .
they recognise that the way forward lies in analy@@ sing the available evidence regarding both the size and nature of the problem and the costs and benefits of different intervention approaches .
this is our role , and as Chairman of the Management Board and Director we accept no compromise on this position and take pride in the high standards we maintain .
but while scientific ri@@ g@@ our is essential to our work , we must never forget that behind the figures we report are real human be@@ ings whose lives have been affected and sometimes ru@@ ined by drug problems .
to develop effective responses to the drugs problem requires us to be dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate about our data , but we must never become dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate about the topic .

this annual report is based on information provided to the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA by the EU M@@ ember States and candidate countries and Norway ( participating in the work of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA since 2001 ) in the form of a national report .

Europe plays an increasingly important role in supporting global actions to reduce drug problems
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe in this area show promise .
moreover , it should be bor@@ ne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently collabor@@ ating with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) to establish a database for the collection of prison health indicators .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
not only do many of those entering prison have drug problems , but studies show that drug use often continues in prison .
the new regulation of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA emphasises the importance of identi@@ fying and dis@@ semin@@ ating good practice .
a key difficulty here is the real world sett@@ ings in which demand reduction interven@@ tions are applied .
the complex@@ ities of assessing evidence for effectiveness and identi@@ fying quality control standards are addressed in this report .
can@@ na@@ bis : popularity may have pe@@ aked - as recognition of public health issues gro@@ ws
there are still considerable differences between European countries in the nature and scale of their national drug problems and also in the range and config@@ ur@@ ation of response .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most com@@ mon@@ ly consu@@ med illi@@ cit drug by young and very young people .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
although some M@@ ember States have introduced sch@@ e@@ mes to di@@ ver@@ t offen@@ ders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
and , although the data are still relatively weak , there is some evidence that the popularity of the drug among the younger age groups is decreas@@ ing in some countries .
over 7 500 ac@@ ute drug deaths , with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2004 data )
Europe remains the main global market for can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in , most of which is produced in North Africa . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis is also available in Europe ,
Co@@ ordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new inter@@ governmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine inter@@ diction .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher pro@@ portion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tri@@ pled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
during the 1990s , the experience , or potential threat , of a widespread HIV ep@@ i@@ demic among drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors was a cataly@@ st for the development of services for this group .
increased pre@@ val@@ ence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest pre@@ val@@ ence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @@@ -@@ @ 6 % in 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds ) .
as a result , especially in areas where pre@@ val@@ ence has been high , the burden of infection resulting from in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is likely to be decreas@@ ing .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
( H@@ C@@ V ) - including a significant pro@@ portion who are no longer using drugs .
across Europe , H@@ C@@ V rates are high among in@@ j@@ ecting populations , and studies show that young in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @@@ -@@ @ using care@@ ers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
this raises the question for Europe : what effect will this increase have on the drug problem ?
in the north and north @@@ -@@ @ east of the country , not only have increasing wage rates and falling op@@ ium prices deter@@ red pop@@ p@@ y plan@@ ting , but also some high @@@ -@@ @ value vegetables actually generate greater returns than pop@@ p@@ ies .
in these areas , cro@@ p diversi@@ fication has been supported by counter @@@ -@@ @ narcotics efforts and greater governmental involvement - leading to a general perception that op@@ ium prohibi@@ tion measures will be enforced .
reductions in cultiv@@ ation can be achieved quickly but are rever@@ sed equally quickly .
over@@ d@@ ose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoi@@ dable mortality among young adults .
reducing drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths is an important public health target and the reasons for the f@@ alter@@ ing in the down@@ ward trend needs to be identified .
in Austria , a growing pro@@ portion of treatment demand clients are under 25 and are seeking help for problems due to the use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids di@@ ver@@ ted from legitimate uses .
this approach , which has been in place in other M@@ ember States ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benef@@ ited from the experience of earlier ones .
esti@@ m@@ ating the cost of drugs to society is discussed in a section on drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture .
the objective of preventing and reducing the individual and collective harm resulting from the use of drugs is also shared by all countries .
the " balanced " approach , which aims to give priority both to supply reduction and to demand reduction , is also very widespread .
a noti@@ ce@@ able trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two comple@@ mentary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the policy of combin@@ ing a drug strategy with action plans facilit@@ ates more detailed defin@@ itions of objectives , actions , responsibilities and deadlines . some countries , for example
the new regulation clar@@ i@@ fies the countries to which the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA can transfer its know @@@ -@@ @ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
moves towards the integration of li@@ cit and illi@@ cit drugs policies have been evident in some countries for several years ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Germany ,
in two M@@ ember States ( Belgium , Slovenia ) , the scope of the evaluation has been limited to a number of selected projects .
in most other countries , and at EU level , the implementation of the actions set out in the national drug strategy is system@@ atically monitored .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interven@@ tions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interven@@ tions and the importance given
almost all European countries mention the objective of evalu@@ ating their national drug strategy .
there is also some activity in the area of developing inde@@ x@@ es designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
drug policy inde@@ x@@ es countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Finland , Portugal ) , Co@@ ordination at regional or local level is directly supervised by the national Co@@ ordination bodies .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
the concep@@ tu@@ alisation of both instruments has involved interesting meth@@ od@@ ological developments and has allowed a first in@@ sight into the use of overall inde@@ x@@ es to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
nevertheless , some general features can be described .
at the regional or local level , drug Co@@ ordination agencies and / or drug co@@ ordin@@ ators exist in most countries .
six countries provided detailed information of expendi@@ ture associated with tackling drugs ( T@@ able 1 ) .
the analysis of a State 's public expendi@@ ture provides useful information regarding the ability of its government to spend effectively and effici@@ ent@@ ly@@ . ci@@ ently .
indirect costs are the value of productive services not performed because of drug use , and typically cons@@ ist of lost productivity due to drug @@@ -@@ @ related mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related social costs are the total of all the costs to society , direct and indirect , caused by drug use .
second , it identi@@ fies the different components of cost and th@@ es@@ ize of the contribution of each sector in society .
such in@@ form@@ ation@@ can help to determine funding pri@@ or@@ iti@@ es@@ by highligh@@ ting areas where ine@@ ffici@@ encies may exist and savings can be made .

P@@ sy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces can imp@@ air a person 's ability to drive a car to the extent that the risk of accidents and injuries is increased .
EU funding for drug @@@ -@@ @ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
Germany , the Netherlands and Norway have extended information coverage .
treatment and harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction measures are also available to drug users and drug ad@@ dicts , and in a considerable number of countries their effectiveness has been evalu@@ ated through outcome studies .
in the sections below , the effectiveness of different types of prevention strategy is discussed , based on the results of this study and others .
the effects of individual prevention strategies can@@ not , in general , be meas@@ ured by changes in population @@@ -@@ @ level pre@@ val@@ ences of drug use .
however , every prevention strategy can be compared against the acc@@ um@@ ulated body of evidence , to determine whether or not it is an evidence @@@ -@@ @ based intervention .

criteria com@@ mon@@ ly used to determine whether an intervention can be considered an evidence @@@ -@@ @ based practice are e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness ( Brown et al . , 2000 ; F@@ lay et al . , 2005 ) .
it remains a challenge to determine how to evaluate and we@@ igh the different sources of evidence in the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process .
this will be even more difficult in the case of interven@@ tions for which a comprehensive evidence base has not yet been established but the experience of which would suggest may be effective .
frequently , interven@@ tions that have shown promise in controlled trials are implemented in the community to investigate how well they work under rout@@ ine conditions .
mass media campaigns ) to the provision of social @@@ -@@ @ emo@@ tional information ( trying to change perceptions about , for example , can@@ na@@ bis use ) .
for example , in the Netherlands a campaign put across the message " You are not ma@@ d if you are not smoking can@@ na@@ bis , because 80 % of all young people
it has , however , been found to raise information levels and to lend support to policy initiatives . "
national drug prevention campaign in Ireland seek to disp@@ el some of the my@@ ths that sur@@ round can@@ na@@ bis , such as claims that it is " organ@@ ic " and " natural . "

such sch@@ e@@ mes princip@@ ally take the form of information events and , to a les@@ ser extent , the provision of alternative le@@ is@@ ure @@@ -@@ @ time pursu@@ its .
member States are increasingly dev@@ oting attention to prevention strategies targeted at entire vulnerable
once target communities have been identified ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . France recognises " sensitive urban zones " or , in the case of schools , " educational priority zones " ) , supp@@ le@@ mentary funds can be directed towards these under@@ privileged groups .
in Ireland , Cyprus and the United Kingdom , selec@@ tive prevention projects are already delivered to most of these areas , and Portugal is in the process of implementing such a strategy .
in many M@@ ember States ( Bulgaria , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Austria , Romania ) the content of prevention
access to out@@ patient treatment is easier and less selec@@ tive in most countries , it is appropriate to extra@@ po@@ late from this group of clients to drug users as a whole .
these un@@ intended effects , which are caused by the intervention itself , can lead to increased sub@@ stance use or risk behaviour .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the out@@ patient clients are treated for primary op@@ i@@ oid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular can@@ na@@ bis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
the philosophy of in@@ patient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .
legal fra@@ me@@ works of sub@@ stitution treatment pharmac@@ ological treatment options have been expanded to meet the needs of specific us@@ er groups with the aim of increasing treatment coverage .
new communication strategies , for example making use of the Internet , are being implemented in an attempt to reach can@@ na@@ bis users whose drug use falls somewhere between experim@@ ental and problematic .
in some countries , sanctions for violating treatment rules are set out in national laws while in others the issue is at the discre@@ tion of each individual treatment centre .

in Italy , the V@@ ede@@ t@@ te study ( 1998 @@@ -@@ @ 2001 ) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment offered in public treatment centres across the country .
there were some positive findings , such as increased rates of abst@@ in@@ ence from illi@@ cit drug use , a reduction in the frequ@@ ency of drug use , a reduction in crime and improved health .
to avoid " loc@@ king " clients into longer @@@ -@@ @ term service dependence , innovative approaches in the area of supported housing or financial management are being explo@@ red .

interpre@@ ting seiz@@ ures and other market data
can@@ na@@ bis is the world 's most com@@ mon@@ ly used illi@@ cit drug and a sub@@ stance that has been at the centre of the drugs debate in Europe since the 19@@ 6@@ 0s when its use became virtually syn@@ ony@@ mous with a growing youth counter@@ culture .
for many , the smoking of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in with tobacco remains the usual route of administration for the drug , though , elsewhere in the world , this pat@@ tern of use is relatively un@@ common .
in recent years , this picture has grown more complicated still with the increasing avail@@ ability of can@@ na@@ bis produced within Europe ; some of which is grown under controlled conditions and can be of relatively high poten@@ cy .
this kind of can@@ na@@ bis has become a specific product in its own right in many countries and complic@@ ates the assessment of the public health impact of changing pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis consumption .
the re@@ ader should note that there are difficulties in comp@@ iling information of this sort and , in many parts of the world , information systems are poorly developed .
because can@@ na@@ bis can be grown in a range of different environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , it is extremely difficult to produce convincing estimates of global production .
this can be seen in the findings of the recent Euro@@ baro@@ meter survey ( 2006 ) , which asked European citizens if they agreed with the statement that personal consumption of can@@ na@@ bis should be leg@@ alised throughout Europe .
young people increased in virtually all countries . however , some of the more recent data suggest that the up@@ ward trend is lev@@ elling off , al@@ be@@ it at histor@@ ically high levels .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available , which in most cases will be between 2003 and 2006 .
three measures of drug use over time are com@@ mon@@ ly used for reporting survey data . lif@@ etime use or pre@@ val@@ ence is the bro@@ ade@@ st .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using can@@ na@@ bis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in can@@ na@@ bis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the range 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % ( 32
moving the point of reference from lif@@ etime to last year , the levels of reported can@@ na@@ bis use fall but still remain considerable .
it is estimated that 13.@@ 4 million Europeans adults used the drug in the previous month , on average about 4 % of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
total numbers were compu@@ ted by multi@@ plying pre@@ val@@ ence among the population concerned in each country and , in countries for which no information was available , imp@@ ut@@ ing the average pre@@ val@@ ence .
there are additional esti@@ m@@ ations for Scot@@ land , Northern Ireland and a combined esti@@ mation for the United Kingdom is available ( presented in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin ) . )
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently working closely with a number of M@@ ember States on the development of a better meth@@ od@@ ological approach to this issue .
it is planned that this esti@@ mation can be up@@ dated in the near future .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
and , the approach of restric@@ ting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any prec@@ ision .
in fact , nearly all EU countries now collect information on how many days the drug has been used in the month prior to interview .
however , this still provides only a b@@ lun@@ t tool for identi@@ fying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of can@@ na@@ bis .
during the early 1990s , the United Kingdom stood out as a high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence country , reporting on most measures the highest pre@@ val@@ ence figures in Europe .
however , last year pre@@ val@@ ence levels among young adults ( 16 @@@ -@@ @ 34 ) stabil@@ ised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 ( 20.@@ 0 % to 16.@@ 3 % ) .
levels of can@@ na@@ bis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom pre@@ val@@ ence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
tr@@ acking trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence in many countries of reliable time series data .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s on@@ wards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sight into trends over time .
42 can@@ na@@ bis use is usually in out@@ patient sett@@ ings (
see T@@ ables T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 22 and T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 23 ( part i ) and ( part I@@ V ) in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin . )
see F@@ ig@@ ure T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 2 in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin . )
missing data were inter@@ po@@ lated for each country by maintaining the average EU trend in the available data for each year .
overall , can@@ na@@ bis clients can be divided into three groups : those who use it occasi@@ onally ( 34 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 27 % ) and those using it daily ( 39 % ) .
the increase in the demand for can@@ na@@ bis treatment does not appear to have a simple explanation .
there are differences between countries in the frequ@@ ency of can@@ na@@ bis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily can@@ na@@ bis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
see T@@ ables T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 13 , T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 14 and T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 21 ( part i ) and ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin . )
in some of the programmes , the ori@@ entation is as much towards prevention and harm reduction as towards the treatment of drug problems .
for can@@ na@@ bis users referred from court services , treatment interven@@ tions are not the only kind of response noted .
one European initiative in this area is the In@@ can@@ t project , where Belgium , France , Germany , the Netherlands and Switzerland have co@@ operated on expl@@ oring the value of multi@@ dimen@@ sional family ther@@ ap@@ y ( M@@ D@@ FT ) with can@@ na@@ bis users .
concerns have been raised that it may be in@@ appropriate to treat young can@@ na@@ bis users in general drug services if this leads to clients

it is interesting to note that the European Foundation of Dru@@ g Hel@@ pl@@ ines reports an increase in the number of calls related to cocaine during 2005 and 2006 ( 1@@ 14 ) .
in contrast to op@@ i@@ oid treatment , pharmac@@ ological options for cocaine treatment are limited , although pres@@ cri@@ bing can be hel@@ p@@ ful in providing relief for related symp@@ t@@ oms .

annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
detec@@ ting trends in both price and p@@ urity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 1@@ 18 ) .
in the few countries where problematic use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines is reported , well @@@ -@@ @ documented estimates are available .
the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among all primary heroin users entering drug treatment ( 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 05 ) shows marked differences in levels of in@@ j@@ ecting between countries .
it should be noted that trends in in@@ j@@ ecting in non @@@ -@@ @ heroin users may be different .
generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
many countries have taken these concerns seriously , and Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom all report that re@@ views are under way with the objective of improving the quality of care provided .
one reason for interest in the use of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is that it is arguably a more su@@ itable pharmaceutical option than meth@@ ad@@ one for use in community practice .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is mar@@ ke@@ ted in the form of sub@@ lin@@ gual tab@@ lets , and although it is not considered a particularly attractive sub@@ stance to in@@ ject , reports exist that tab@@ lets have been dis@@ solved and in@@ j@@ ected .
the potential for misuse of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is supported by reports from some countries of the di@@ version of the drug onto the illi@@ cit market .
to de@@ ter illi@@ cit use of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , a new formu@@ lation of the drug , in combination with n@@ alo@@ x@@ one , has been developed .
the e@@ ffic@@ acy of heroin as a sub@@ stitution ag@@ ent has also been explo@@ red in experim@@ ental research in both Spain ( March et al . , 2006 ) and Germany ( Nab@@ er and Ha@@ as@@ en , 2006 ) .
and in Hungary , where the use of home @@@ -@@ @ made op@@ ium pop@@ p@@ y products has a long history , around 4 % of treatment requests are related to op@@ ium .
in the few countries reporting data on treatment demand in low @@@ -@@ @ threshold agencies , a significant pro@@ portion of drug clients seek treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use ( 1@@ 27 ) .
for EU countries where estimates of problem op@@ i@@ oid use were available for 2005 , the extent of sub@@ stitution treatment among problem op@@ i@@ oid users was calculated ( F@@ ig@@ ure 10 ) .
however , the data does suggest the need to review the avail@@ ability of treatment options in all countries in order to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet estimated needs .
the percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen , decreas@@ ing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005 . the only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the
United Kingdom ( 1@@ 31 ) .
the levels of clients " repeat treatment demands and the numbers of clients in drug maintenance programmes is determined by historical developments in op@@ i@@ oid use inci@@ dence and pre@@ val@@ ence , as well as treatment service organisation and type .
figure 10 : number of op@@ i@@ oid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be home@@ less .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initi@@ ation of op@@ i@@ oid use before the age of 20 ; first use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids after the age of 25 was very un@@ common ( 13@@ 3 ) .
furthermore , perceived safety of B@@ Z@@ P is fos@@ tered by the fact that the products are often sold by designated retailers or in specialised shops rather than on the street .
there are , though , no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to B@@ Z@@ P . in March 2007 , the EU responded to rising concern over the use of B@@ Z@@ P by

cases of sexual assault by means of cover@@ tly adding a drug to a drink in order to inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ itate a victim have been increasingly reported in the media and medical literature since the 1980s .
a lack of information makes trends in G@@ H@@ B use difficult to assess , although the available evidence suggests that use of G@@ H@@ B remains limited to some small sub@@ population groups .
if young people do go online seeking drug information , a real question ar@@ ises as to the extent to which the information they access will be un@@ biased and accur@@ ate .
the main health risk associated with the use of G@@ H@@ B appears to be the high risk of loss of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , especially when the drug is combined with alcohol or other sed@@ ative drugs .
in Am@@ sterdam , the reported number of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies due to the use of G@@ H@@ B was 76 in 2005 , exceeding , as in previous years , the medical emer@@ gen@@ cies attributed to use of
a c@@ av@@ eat to this analysis is that in several high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries , recent case reporting data is not available ( Estonia , Spain , Italy , Austria ) .
higher figures were reported by Ireland and Luxembourg , with 16 and 15 new cases per million respectively .
in Latvia , Lithuania and probably also in Estonia , rates of reported new I@@ D@@ U @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ections have strongly declined since the ep@@ i@@ demic pe@@ aks in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 02 , although they are still high in comparison with most other countries .

there is a marked discre@@ pan@@ cy in trends in drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths between the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States and those who have joined since 2004 .
the European project Is@@ ad@@ ora ( " integrated services aimed at dual diagnos@@ is and op@@ ti@@ mal recovery from addi@@ ction " ) was concluded in 2005 after a three @@@ -@@ @ year research period ( 1 ) .
easier acces@@ sibility of treatment and greater variety of approaches , including sub@@ stitution treatment , improve rates of re@@ tention in treatment , which makes an important contribution to reducing drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths and mortality .
a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al study on the effectiveness of treat@@ ments for heroin addi@@ ction , which will examine the association between re@@ tention in treatment and mortality , is currently under@@ way in Italy ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from op@@ i@@ oid drugs are at an ele@@ v@@ ated risk of an over@@ d@@ ose , if they rela@@ p@@ se back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
this approach has not been widely developed in Europe to date , but may have potential .
an approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms , where@@ by drug users may consum@@ e their drugs in a designated space where
drug consumption rooms have been criticised by the IN@@ C@@ B in their recent annual reports , but are viewed by some EU M@@ ember States as a useful component of their responses to some forms of highly problematic drug use .

for most forms of drug use , our overall assessment is that we are not seeing increases , and in some areas the trends appear to be down@@ ward .
it is grati@@ fying to note that , by international standards , Europe stands out as one of the parts of the world where monitoring capacities are most developed .
non@@ e@@ theless , we are aware of the limit@@ ations of our current information resources , and are constantly working with our partners to improve the quality and re@@ lev@@ ance of the data available .
an acceptance that our activities can , and do , make a difference is a prerequisite to securing investment and policy support .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA would like to than@@ k the following for their help in producing this report :
• the European Parliament , the Council of the European Union - in particular its Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal Wor@@ king Party on Dru@@ gs - and the European Commission ;
• the Trans@@ lation Centre for the Bo@@ dies of the European Union and the Office for Official Pub@@ lic@@ ations of the European Commun@@ ities .
graph@@ ics and tables in this report may reflect a sub@@ set of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .

in reports on treatment demand , " new clients " ref@@ ers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and " all clients " ref@@ ers to all those entering treatment .
clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
where the pro@@ portion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denomin@@ ator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .
analysis of trends is based only on those countries providing sufficient data to describe changes over the time period in question .
figures for 2005 may sub@@ stitute for missing 2006 values in trend analysis of drug market data ; for the analysis of other trends , missing data may be inter@@ po@@ lated .
the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / stat@@ s@@ 08 ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
a strong voice from Europe in an important year for ref@@ le@@ ction and policy formation the us@@ er is often difficult , and M@@ ember States v@@ ary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflec@@ tions on how drug policies have performed to date , and what direc@@ tions should be pursu@@ ed in the future .
however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly can@@ na@@ bis users , the lik@@ elihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
this distinc@@ tion has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
drug use prevention : evidence base gro@@ ws but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving re@@ integration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tic value .
the challenge for policymakers may be that those programmes that are known to deliver benefits often require both a greater investment of resources and more attention to training and quality control .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care ta@@ il@@ ored to the needs of a more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous population of drug users .
it is therefore likely that European drug treatment services will have to develop an increasingly differ@@ enti@@ ated set of responses in the future if they are to match the increasingly differ@@ enti@@ ated needs of their clients .
the portal , which includes a prevention mo@@ dul@@ e , provides an over@@ view of the latest evidence on programme e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interven@@ tions .
examples of evalu@@ ated practices across Europe are also provided .
recent data from school and ad@@ ult population surveys suggest that overall can@@ na@@ bis use has stabil@@ ised or is declining in some countries .
the number of drug users receiving treatment for their dependency has grown considerably in recent years , and many countries now have a significant pro@@ portion of their problem op@@ i@@ oid users in long @@@ -@@ @ term sub@@ stitution treatment .
this trend has led to a wi@@ den@@ ing of the available pharmaceutical options and has resulted in an increased focus on treatment quality and outcome , as opposed to treatment up@@ take , as a primary policy concern .

the extent and relative market share of dome@@ sti@@ cally produced her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis remains unknown , and in response to this the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is carrying out a study on m@@ apping the can@@ na@@ bis market in Europe .
Meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use remains rare outside the Cz@@ ech@@ Republic and Slovakia , although the avail@@ ability or use of the drug is spor@@ adi@@ cally reported by other countries .
this would imply that , as well as targeting individual substan@@ ces , interven@@ tions need to consider sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs as a group rather than only as individual problems .
typically , the production of one kilo@@ gram of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or M@@ D@@ MA results in around 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 kilo@@ gram@@ s of waste material , including to@@ xic and inf@@ lam@@ m@@ able chem@@ ic@@ als which constitute an environmental haz@@ ard .
commen@@ tary : the drug situation in Europe the relative pro@@ portion of op@@ i@@ oid users - but not their actual numbers - had been falling , but this trend now appears to have lev@@ elled out .
in Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia , for example , there are indic@@ ations of a growing problem caused by the avail@@ ability of 3 @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ yl@@ f@@ ent@@ any@@ l that is il@@ lic@@ it@@ ly manufac@@ tured outside the EU .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fif@@ ty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initi@@ ation also appear to be still oc@@ curr@@ ing in some M@@ ember States , as indicated by studies among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users that show a relatively high pro@@ portion of young and new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
given the speed at which new products can appear and be distributed , the monitoring of online activities is becoming an important area for development .
consequently , successful interven@@ tions in this area require the involvement of a broad alliance of participants and can benefit from the support of the communities in which they are implemented .

in this year , both the United N@@ ations and the European Union assess the results of their drug policies on the use of , and har@@ ms caused by , illi@@ cit drugs .
this assessment is to be followed by a one @@@ -@@ @ year ref@@ le@@ ction period , during which discussions will first be held among inter@@ governmental expert working groups and then in inter@@ ses@@ sional meetings .
this " drug summit " set a new agenda for the international community through the adoption of three key documents ( 2
chapter 1 : policies and laws
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with in@@ put from the EU M@@ ember States , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA .
all of these documents cover a time sp@@ an of three to four years and , with the exception of the Turkish action plan , they have been prece@@ ded by previous plans or programmes .
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in C@@ hap@@ ter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .
chapter 1 : policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
a further two countries provided roug@@ h estimates of overall public expendi@@ ture related to the drug problem ( Spain , Malta ) , though with no information on the activities on which the money was spent .
these figures must , however , still be taken as indic@@ ative because of the limited data on which they are based .
total general government expendi@@ ture in the year . in Ireland , government departments and State agencies are invited to report their annual dru@@ g@@ related expendi@@ ture to the co@@ ordinating Department of Community , R@@ ural and G@@ a@@ el@@ tac@@ ht Affairs .
these expenditures are not necessarily la@@ bel@@ led as dru@@ g@@ related in official accoun@@ tancy documents .
asks the question : do the changes in legal defin@@ itions and responses to drug users indicate a new , wider trend in how countries view users of drugs ?
however , M@@ ember States differ considerably in how they have chosen to define these categories in the new laws that they have adopted in recent years .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all wi@@ den the scope for direc@@ ting drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @@@ -@@ @ enacted it after 12 years without , and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal defin@@ itions of personal use were wi@@ dened from a maximum of one d@@ ose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 dos@@ es .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
further descri@@ p@@ tions of the various treatment alternatives to punishment and the extent of their use can be found in the

crimes committed that are , in some way , linked to drugs (
though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .

among the problems identified were : organis@@ ational aspects , such as a lack of Co@@ ordination and sc@@ at@@ tered resources ( Germany , France , Austria ) ; the

in addition to public@@ ations speci@@ alising in illi@@ cit drugs and addi@@ ction , articles on illi@@ cit drug use are also published in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed journ@@ als from a wide array of discipl@@ ines and in professional magaz@@ ines .
in 2006 , research findings in the drugs field were published in more than 100 such European journ@@ als .
a total of 25 European pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed journ@@ als speci@@ alising in the drugs field and publishing in 11 languages other than English were identified .
the majority of these national journ@@ als publish English
the European Commission , Eurostat , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA are working to improve this situation in the framework of the next EU action plan on drugs ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
the changes in reported objectives may reflect the adoption of a more r@@ ational and evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based approach , but the extent to which this change in objectives reflects actual provision is unclear .
these include stand@@ ardis@@ ed programmes , pe@@ er approaches or interven@@ tions specifically for boys ; all of which aim

drug use among children and in families remains the main focus of targeted prevention in Europe .
recent literature re@@ views ( 19 ) , however , show that certain

the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA " Best practice " portal content of prevention projects .
the first mo@@ dul@@ e of the portal focuses on universal prevention , in particular on evidence of e@@ ffic@@ acy which is based on several re@@ views published since 2000 .
the portal provides information on the e@@ ffic@@ acy of various interven@@ tions , but it should be noted that the evidence base remains sometimes limited and that making cho@@ ices between different interven@@ tions requires caution .
the new edition of the E@@ D@@ D@@ RA dat@@ aban@@ k , available on the portal , features examples of evalu@@ ated interven@@ tions in different countries and sett@@ ings , and may provide additional gu@@ idance .
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only in@@ effective but may carry risks of un@@ wanted effects ( W@@ er@@ ch and O@@ w@@ en , 2002 ) .
out@@ patient sett@@ ings , including general practice , account for most of the treatment for drug use in Europe , mainly because sub@@ stitution treatment is usually delivered in these sett@@ ings .

in Hungary , where N@@ SP@@ s and out@@ reach work have been increasing , a study among the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
due to the specific profile of the Bal@@ tic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .

Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of in@@ mates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of in@@ mates have in@@ j@@ ected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social re@@ integration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
prisons represent an important setting for the delivery of health and social interven@@ tions to drug users .
from the data available , it can be estimated that more than 400 000 people with past or current experience of illi@@ cit drug use pass through EU prisons every year .
the responsibility for healthcare in prison lies , in most countries , with the Ministry of Justice .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
in Belgium , a 2006 direc@@ tive from the Ministry for Justice states that in@@ mates have the right to the same range of treatment options as are available outside prison .
however , there is no such enti@@ t@@ lement if the offen@@ der is expected to be released within three months or is considered un@@ fit or not motivated for treatment .
the aim of this law is to provide drug users with such services at the time when they are most needed , at the time of enforced withdrawal immediately upon entering custody .
these estimates have some important limit@@ ations linked , for instance , with vari@@ ations in yield figures or with the difficulty of monitoring crops which are not grown in restricted geographical areas , like can@@ na@@ bis .
in the early and mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high pre@@ val@@ ence , whereas the European nor@@ m was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .

can@@ na@@ bis that is produced loc@@ ally also has the advantage for the producer that it does not need to be transported across national borders .
seiz@@ ures of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in in Europe exceed her@@ bal seiz@@ ures both in terms of number and quanti@@ ty : with twice as many seiz@@ ures ( 3@@ 25 000 ) and the amount inter@@ cep@@ ted ( 7@@ 13 tonnes ) eight times higher .

in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evalu@@ ated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
in Italy , a lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e clin@@ ical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als ( ar@@ ip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and ro@@ pin@@ ir@@ ole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .

Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .
for example , in some countries where problem op@@ i@@ oid use has histor@@ ically pre@@ dominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use at national level during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 06 range roughly between one and six cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use of between four and five cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 of the population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 can be der@@ ived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it imp@@ lies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
in 2003 , the down@@ ward trend in the number of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths reported in Europe , mostly related to the use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , ce@@ ased and between 2003 and 2005 most M@@ ember States have been reporting an up@@ ward trend .
this is an important issue for further investigation as available data do not allow a clear picture to be drawn .
treatment found that primary op@@ i@@ oid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
furthermore , these models can provide only a partial estimate of inci@@ dence , as they are based on only those cases that come in to contact with treatment .
most drug clients entering out@@ patient treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 23 % ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 18 % ) .
of the 3@@ 87 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin or meth@@ ad@@ one : mainly bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , pain@@ kil@@ lers and other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 112 ) .

that among clients already in treatment the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors at treatment entrance was relatively high .
the var@@ ying levels of new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initi@@ ation as well as increasing in@@ j@@ ecting inci@@ dence among the younger or the older populations .
the latest available samp@@ le for each country during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 06 has been used , subject to there being at least 100 in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .

a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users and the reported number of treat@@ ments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving sub@@ stitution treatment .
O@@ pi@@ oid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequ@@ ency of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders is noted .

a bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine / n@@ alo@@ x@@ one combination was launched on the EU market in 2006 as an alternative to bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine alone , with the aim of reducing the potential and attr@@ ac@@ tiveness for in@@ j@@ ecting use .
in Turkey , the future use of sub@@ stitution treatment is currently under study .
additionally , a r@@ and@@ om@@ ised trial of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( R@@ I@@ O@@ T@@ T ) is currently under@@ way in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom which will assess the effectiveness of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , in@@ j@@ ec@@ table meth@@ ad@@ one and oral meth@@ ad@@ one .
in February 2008 , it was also decided to introduce a di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine pres@@ cri@@ ption scheme in Denmark .
technical information on the sub@@ stance is available on the E@@ M@@ EA website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / human@@ doc@@ s / hum@@ ans / E@@ PA@@ R / su@@ box@@ one / su@@ box@@ on@@ e@@ .h@@ t@@ m ) .

treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
however , a report issued by the European Commission ( 200@@ 7@@ a ) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of interven@@ ing in this setting .
re@@ views of r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials and ob@@ serv@@ ational studies conclude that meth@@ ad@@ one maintenance treatment ( M@@ M@@ T ) and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance treatment ( BM@@ T ) can both be effective for the management of op@@ i@@ oid dependence .
a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review concluded , however , that bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is less effective than meth@@ ad@@ one delivered at adequate dos@@ es ( Mat@@ tic@@ k et al . , 2008 ) .
a number of studies have also found that di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance can be effective for people failing to respond to M@@ M@@ T ( Sch@@ ul@@ te et al . , in press ) .
more positively , prison drug programmes have become more widespread , and new initiatives are reported by many countries .
in many countries , de@@ to@@ x@@ ification is the preferred and sometimes the only treatment option available .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
for details on methods and defin@@ itions , see the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
although in two of these , regional increases were also reported : in Bulgaria , one city , Sofia ; and in Italy , eight out of 21 regions and one city .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnos@@ ed inf@@ ections related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use with trends in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among I@@ D@@ U@@ s suggests that the inci@@ dence of HIV infection related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
however , vig@@ il@@ ance is needed as some M@@ ember States continue to show high rates of new HIV inf@@ ections linked to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use , and the situation is even more wor@@ rying in some neighbouring countries .

the pro@@ portion of I@@ D@@ U@@ s among all noti@@ fied cases of hep@@ ati@@ tis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vacc@@ ination programmes targeted at I@@ D@@ U@@ s .
as a result many of those who become infected with the virus will not have the advantage of early treatment and care .

Dru@@ g@@ related deaths and mortality a majority of countries , although services in this area are still being developed .
moreover , many dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths are , in fact , pol@@ y@@ drug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circum@@ stan@@ tial reasons ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . violence related to the drug trade ) .
there is still limited research on the mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and other consequences of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal over@@ dos@@ es and limited investment in prevention efforts , despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable .

cocaine @@@ -@@ @ indu@@ ced deaths are more difficult to define and identify than those related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine ) .
the role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related .
while similar studies in other countries would be very useful , the available evidence suggests that meth@@ ad@@ on@@ er@@ e@@ lated deaths are more likely to be linked to defic@@ i@@ encies in pres@@ cri@@ bing practices than to overall levels of sub@@ stitution treatment .
most deaths with " presence of ec@@ st@@ asy " are reported in the United Kingdom , but in many cases the drug has not been identified as the direct cause of death .
Europe had a very high mortality rate compared to pe@@ ers of the same age ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) .
a number of factors could be associated with this , including : increases in pol@@ y@@ drug use , a possible growth in the avail@@ ability of heroin or an ag@@ eing population of chron@@ ic drug users ( 15@@ 2
a recent Norwegian study of a co@@ h@@ ort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 18@@ 9 recorded deaths , over@@ dos@@ es , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .

as well as making an important contribution to a mature and informed debate on the drug problem , the existence of this monitoring system , we believe , results in better and more effective policies .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confron@@ ted .
the conference also identified a number of important issues that are echoed in the analysis presented here .
in this year 's report , we give greater pro@@ min@@ ence to an analysis of supply @@@ -@@ @ side indicators and the drug market .
we do this cau@@ ti@@ ously , as insufficient efforts have yet been made to improve the quality , reli@@ ability and compar@@ ability of the European data set in this area .
this can be seen in the development of a trans@@ versal drug monitoring system that en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es 30 countries with a combined population of more than half a billion people .
it can also be seen in the EU drugs strategy and action plan , tools that are designed to take stock of the information available and elabor@@ ate it into practical and collective action .

graph@@ ics and tables in this report may reflect a sub@@ set of EU countries ; the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
reports of the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged from 15 to 64 years .
clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
where the pro@@ portion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denomin@@ ator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .

policy consensus permits a more targeted drug action plan to be moving closer to the European model .
the reporting mechanism developed to assess the implementation of the UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS action plans has been criticised .
this approach is concre@@ tely illu@@ strated in the attention given to specific areas of practice such as the prevention of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , working in prison sett@@ ings and improving the quality of treatment and other interven@@ tions .
and although the data are difficult to interpre@@ t , this ob@@ servation raises questions about the extent to which law enforcement practice is in step with policy objectives in this area .
this has helped to ensure that , in the final agreement , the key pro@@ gressive elements of the original 1998 UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS documents were preserved .
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
broad@@ ly speaking , the European policy debate has moved towards the view that priority should be given to inter@@ diction activities targeting the supply rather than the use of drugs .
reflecting this , in some countries the legal penalties applic@@ able to supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences have been raised or minimum tariffs have been introduced .
the extent to which this shift in emphasis away from users and towards drug suppliers is being translated into policing practice is difficult to ga@@ uge .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @@@ -@@ @ term data .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe integrated package of care .
cust@@ odi@@ al sentences are common for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences , but they tend to be given at the lower end of the available tariffs , aver@@ aging 3 years or less .
a les@@ son that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practi@@ tion@@ ers can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
despite the fact that in most countries it is the@@ ore@@ tically possible to continue or start sub@@ stitution treatment within the prison setting , in practice this is often difficult .
as those charged with drug offences are likely to be a di@@ verse group , needs assessment is a particularly important issue for service development in this area .
the tribunal can issue fines , but sanc@@ tioning is not its main objective .
in addition , developments in ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addi@@ ction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
examples here include a cocaine vacc@@ ine , now undergoing a large @@@ -@@ @ scale trial in Europe .

services for drug users in Europe are becoming increasingly diversi@@ fied and offered as part of an
the estimates presented here rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , just as different tempor@@ al pat@@ ter@@ ns could be seen in the up@@ ward trend in can@@ na@@ bis use in the past , this pat@@ tern now appears to be repe@@ ating itself in rever@@ se .
the United Kingdom , for example , one of the first countries to record high pre@@ val@@ ence levels was also one of the ear@@ li@@ est to report a decline in use .
standing out in the European picture is a small group of countries , mainly in the north or south of Europe , where levels of can@@ na@@ bis use have remained low and stable for some time .
last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : less than 1 million
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.@@ 0 % to 1.3 %
problem op@@ i@@ oid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
principal drug in more than 50 % of all drug treatment requests
a c@@ av@@ eat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
although to what extent this reflects pat@@ ter@@ ns of use or the capacity of services remains unclear .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA estimates that somewhere between 2 % and 2.5 % of young adults are using can@@ na@@ bis on a daily

heroin and cocaine : no strong signs of a dimin@@ ishing problem trend in heroin @@@ -@@ @ related problems is no longer sustained .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the ep@@ i@@ demic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems ar@@ ising from the use of this drug are considerable .
any indic@@ ations that the situation may be worsening , especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties , are grounds for considerable concern .
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that sub@@ stance use problems are best addressed hol@@ isti@@ cally and in the context of healthy lif@@ est@@ y@@ les and informed cho@@ ices .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional perspective is becoming increasingly un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful in understanding the developing nature of pat@@ ter@@ ns of sub@@ stance use in Europe .
in Europe today , pol@@ y@@ drug pat@@ ter@@ ns are the nor@@ m , and the combined use of different substan@@ ces is responsible for , or complic@@ ates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly dev@@ alu@@ ed if they simply open the door for the use of a sub@@ stitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substan@@ ces that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
however , there is evidence of the further di@@ ff@@ usion of the drug into other countries . treatment demands related to cocaine are also growing .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the avail@@ ability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreas@@ es , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and pro@@ portion of treatment demands related to op@@ i@@ oid drugs .
data on dru@@ g@@ related deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreas@@ ing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be di@@ ff@@ using into new populations .
among older , regular drug users , pol@@ y@@ drug use is a major issue in drug over@@ d@@ ose , it complic@@ ates drug treatment and is associated with violence and off@@ ending .

EU drugs action plan ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) : new features
the new UN document is similar in content to the original UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS declar@@ ations and action plans agreed in 1998 .
it also examined the action plan 's impact on the national drug policies of EU M@@ ember States and looked at recent trends in Europe 's drug situation .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial co@@ operation between M@@ ember States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that ech@@ o those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing conver@@ gence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better ref@@ le@@ ction of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursu@@ ed in external agreements and programmes .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evalu@@ ator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of ref@@ le@@ ction in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dis@@ su@@ ade young people from beginning to use drugs by re@@ affir@@ ming the prohibi@@ tion of drug use and in@@ forming young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of non@@ governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the prepar@@ atory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in most cases , a progress report based on data collected from service providers and ministries involved in drug policy is submitted to the government or parliament .
most countries could provide data on central government expendi@@ ture , and seven also reported expendi@@ ture by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
la@@ bel@@ led and un@@ la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture
in some cases , the final report is a sum@@ m@@ ary of annual implementation re@@ views ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the countries taking the more in @@@ -@@ @ dep@@ th approach to evaluation , two ( Luxembourg , Cyprus ) have decided to work with external evalu@@ ators from outside the country .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is also developing guidelines to help M@@ ember States assess and interpre@@ t the results of their drug policy documents .
the results of earlier studies show that , in most cases , un@@ la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture represents the greater part of the national expendi@@ ture on the drugs problem .
esti@@ m@@ ating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illi@@ cit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
public expendi@@ ture related to drugs can be categor@@ ised according to the clas@@ si@@ fication of the functions of government ( C@@ O@@ FO@@ G ) system ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ e ) .

hal@@ f@@ way through the period , two EU instruments gave added impetus to these processes .
ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exemp@@ ts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of sy@@ r@@ inges dis@@ pen@@ sed .
overall , police confis@@ cation of ster@@ ile sy@@ r@@ inges or ne@@ ed@@ les is reported to be rare across the European Union .

European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports .
participation in European research activities was found to v@@ ary considerably between countries , with much of the international co@@ operation taking place on an informal basis .
the effectiveness of this type of intervention , however , is not supported by the available evidence .
the responses developed in the framework of drug law enforcement are also addressed in a new section which includes the most recent data on drug law offences .
the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
gender @@@ -@@ @ dependent effects also came up in a Danish controlled trial on a life @@@ -@@ @ skills programme .
it aims to de@@ ter or delay the on@@ set of drug use and dru@@ g@@ related problems by providing young people with the information and skills necessary to avoid starting to use drugs .
selec@@ tive and indicated prevention
new information on selec@@ tive prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg .
both selec@@ tive and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ c ) .
selec@@ tive prevention interven@@ es with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scar@@ ce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
the evidence base for this approach is presented in a new section of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's Best practice portal ( 12 ) .
indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavi@@ our@@ al or psychological problems that may be predic@@ tive for developing problem sub@@ stance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interven@@ tions .
its evaluation found that negative social norms against can@@ na@@ bis smoking were rein@@ forced and that there were no negative effects on intention to use and on norm@@ ative beli@@ efs ( W@@ am@@ mes et al . , 2007 ) .
there was , however , evidence that the campaign had un@@ intended effects in favour of can@@ na@@ bis , and individuals who had previously been un@@ interested in the drug , reported an intention to use it ( Hor@@ nik et al . , 2008 ) .

national experts estimate that in@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
the scar@@ city of national guidelines is probably due to the limited evidence available , and this points to the need for more mul@@ tis@@ ite r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials in these fields .
it is com@@ mon@@ ly , but not exclusively , an in@@ patient intervention provided in hospitals , specialist treatment centres or residential facilities with medical or psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric wards .
five M@@ ember States evaluate sub@@ stitution and de@@ to@@ x@@ ification treatment , and only Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom evaluate the outcome of psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment interven@@ tions on a regular basis .

public institutions are the main providers of de@@ to@@ x@@ ification in 21 countries .

e@@ ffic@@ acy is ide@@ ally determined by carrying out controlled trials or r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials where interven@@ tions are compared against specific outcome measures . most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
Studies in Europe are now becoming more common , and include some ground @@@ -@@ @ breaking work on new agents for op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment .

as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at dis@@ rup@@ ting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and sear@@ ches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more gener@@ ic tac@@ tic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
this involves processing impor@@ tation and expor@@ tation requests as well as identi@@ fying and investigating suspicious transactions .

population surveys : an important tool for understanding drug use pat@@ ter@@ ns and trends in Europe
drug use in the general or school population can be meas@@ ured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the pro@@ portion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .
the extent to which the samples analy@@ sed reflect the overall market is unclear and , for this reason , data on poten@@ cy should be interpreted with caution .

the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , in close collaboration with national experts , has developed a set of core items for use in ad@@ ult surveys ( the " European Mo@@ del Qu@@ esti@@ onnaire , " E@@ M@@ Q ) .

almost one quarter ( 22 % ) of primary cr@@ ack clients also use heroin , and these clients report high levels of unemployment and home@@ les@@ s@@ ness ( 1@@ 04 ) .
it has been fear@@ ed that a similar phenomenon could happen in Europe but , until now , a serious cr@@ ack ep@@ i@@ demic has not been observed .
cr@@ ack cocaine is , however , used in some European cities , although it is difficult to know the exact size of the phenomenon .
the first group typically reports s@@ nor@@ ting the drug , and sometimes consum@@ ing it in con@@ jun@@ ction with other substan@@ ces such as alcohol or can@@ na@@ bis , but not with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
siz@@ able cr@@ ack problems have also been reported by cities in other European countries .
for this reason , in Ireland out@@ reach work and other interven@@ tions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly et al . , 2008 ) .
among them , 42 % also use alcohol , 28 % can@@ na@@ bis and 16 % heroin . cocaine is also often mentioned as a secondary drug ,
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where op@@ i@@ oid users are the main cli@@ en@@ te@@ le . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
in the United Kingdom , a clin@@ ical trial is investigating the effectiveness of cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y in con@@ jun@@ ction with contin@@ gency management ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ b ) in primary cocaine users .
according to a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review , this combination has yi@@ elded the best results for the treatment of sti@@ mul@@ ant dependence ( K@@ n@@ ap@@ p et al . , 2007 ) .
it is the largest trial conducted on this vacc@@ ine to date , with several hundred volunteers participating .
these difficulties can be tack@@ led by the development of specific treatment programmes and training courses adap@@ ted to the problems associated with cocaine and cr@@ ack use .
cocaine @@@ -@@ @ specific training for treatment staff is reported from Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom .
in addition , 11 M@@ ember States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine users .
programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
a decline in heroin use and associated problems has been observed in the last 10 years , though more recent data suggest that , in some countries , the trend may have changed direction .
the most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 7@@ 35 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
among these countries , the reported who@@ le@@ sale price of heroin ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 12.@@ 5 to EU@@ R 3@@ 5.@@ 8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 36 to EU@@ R 6@@ 2.7 .
at both who@@ le@@ sale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .
the rati@@ o between retail and who@@ le@@ sale price also var@@ ies considerably , from 1.6 : 1 in the Czech Republic to 2.8 : 1 in the United Kingdom .
non@@ e@@ theless , analysis in this area can be in@@ form@@ ative , especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market .
overall , of the around 3@@ 25 000 treatment ent@@ ries for which the primary drug is known , 49 % cited heroin as their primary drug ; if other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids are included , time ( 112 ) .
1 11 those clients who were in treatment for more than 1 year was reported to be over 50 % in all countries participating in the study .
clients entering treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use often report the use of other drugs .
a recent analysis of data on clients in drug treatment in 14 countries found that primary op@@ i@@ oid users and alcohol ( 7 % ) ( 1@@ 13 ) .
in at least five regions , the inci@@ dence estimates allowed the der@@ iv@@ ation of pre@@ val@@ ence estimates that were in a good accordance with other existing estimates ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . by the capture @@@ -@@ @ rec@@ ap@@ ture method ) .
this is perhaps most clearly visible since 2003 among seiz@@ ures and dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths , and after 2004 in new treatment demands related to heroin use .
in@@ j@@ ecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . HIV / AIDS , hep@@ ati@@ tis ) or dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem op@@ i@@ oid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 1@@ 14 ) . information from the
in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is one of the main determin@@ ants of serious public health problems among drug users , including HIV / AIDS , hep@@ ati@@ tis C and over@@ d@@ ose .
the lowest propor@@ tions of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among op@@ i@@ oid users entering treatment are reported by Denmark and the Netherlands , and the highest by Lithuania , Latvia and Romania ( 120 ) .
treatment reports also suggest that among op@@ i@@ oid users , the popularity of in@@ j@@ ecting may v@@ ary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among new op@@ i@@ oid clients ran@@ ges from 0.@@ 9 % to 47.@@ 2 % .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .
an increase was also observed in Cyprus .
the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Czech Republic , Germany ) .
between 2002 and 2007 , the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among primary op@@ i@@ oid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries , with statisti@@ cally significant dec@@ lines reported in 13 countries .
in France , for example , a decrease in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initi@@ ation of heroin use has become increasingly
Com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ty : drug use and mental dis@@ orders
pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids may enter the illi@@ cit drug market through the di@@ version of sub@@ stitution drugs from their proper use .
internet pharmac@@ ies seem also to play a substantial role in the avail@@ ability of pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids in the United States ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 9@@ a ) , but their role in Europe appears to be limited .
the mental dis@@ orders most com@@ mon@@ ly reported among drug users in Europe include de@@ pression , anx@@ iety , s@@ chi@@ z@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia , person@@ ality dis@@ orders , attention deficit and hy@@ per@@ activity .
national experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
in seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
a European prospec@@ tive multi @@@ -@@ @ centre study ( Is@@ ad@@ ora ) has recently been conducted involving dual @@@ -@@ @ diagnos@@ is patients
its findings highlight the difficulties of compar@@ ative analy@@ ses in this area , under@@ lining the need for a more harmon@@ ised approach for diagnos@@ is , treatment and study of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty in Europe ( Bal@@ d@@ ac@@ ch@@ ino et al . , 2009 ) .
in the M@@ ember States that have joined the EU since 2004 are on average younger than their counterparts .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substan@@ ces is not com@@ promised ( Ch@@ ern@@ y et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty were primary op@@ i@@ oid users ( 125 ) .
almost all op@@ i@@ oid users entering treatment report initi@@ ation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20 .

the range of options available in Europe for the treatment of op@@ i@@ oid dependence is broad and increasingly differ@@ enti@@ ated , though it var@@ ies geo@@ graph@@ ically in terms of acces@@ sibility and coverage .
drug @@@ -@@ @ free and sub@@ stitution treatment for op@@ i@@ oid use are available in all EU M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway . in Turkey , the future use of sub@@ stitution treatment is currently under study .

drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment is a ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic approach , which generally requires individuals to abst@@ ain from all substan@@ ces , including sub@@ stitution medi@@ cation .
in Greece for example , the waiting time for op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
in four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in sub@@ stitution treatment .
according to expert estimates , the avail@@ ability of op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of op@@ i@@ oid users ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
in those countries , drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment is the treatment of choice for between 10 % and 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid users .

ten of these 23 countries also report existing strategies to prevent inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases at local or regional level .
access to ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment through ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and coun@@ selling for inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases by 16 countries and the dis@@ sem@@ ination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .

to reduce the burden of hep@@ ati@@ tis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chron@@ ic carriers of the virus who are active drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes exist in all EU M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway .
current treat@@ ments for chron@@ ic hep@@ ati@@ tis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination ther@@ ap@@ y with long@@ acting inter@@ fer@@ on and ri@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ in - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained vir@@ ological response .
the number of sy@@ r@@ inges provided through ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available .
ongoing increases over this period were reported from Belgium , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Austria , Slovakia and Finland .
M@@ ulti@@ disciplinary teams , which can manage drug dependence , li@@ ver treatment and co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid mental problems , improve treatment out@@ comes ( Gre@@ bel@@ y et al . , 2007 ) .
a national survey conducted in the 120 French " C@@ A@@ AR@@ U@@ D " harm@@ reduction centres showed that they had been used by an estimated 40 000 individuals in 2007 ( T@@ ou@@ fik et al . , 2008 ) .

population mortality rates due to dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced death v@@ ary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( F@@ ig@@ ure 13 ) .
among Europeans aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 39 years , drug over@@ d@@ ose accounted for 4 % of all deaths ( 1@@ 45 ) .
an ep@@ i@@ demic of f@@ ent@@ any@@ l po@@ is@@ on@@ ings in Estonia caused the death of 1@@ 17 in@@ j@@ ecting drug users in 2005 / 06 ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ b ) .
this suggests that the total mortality in this population could be around two to five times the number of registered dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths .
this type of study can determine overall and cause @@@ -@@ @ specific mortality rates for the co@@ h@@ ort , and can estimate the group 's exc@@ ess mortality compared to the general population .
both methods have been successfully pilot @@@ -@@ @ tested in the Czech Republic , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future .
in Italy , France and Latvia , HIV / AIDS mortality and over@@ d@@ ose mortality are of similar levels ( 15@@ 3 ) .
deaths indirectly related to drug use
other diseases that also account for a pro@@ portion of deaths among drug users include chron@@ ic conditions such as li@@ ver diseases ( due to hep@@ ati@@ tis C infection and heavy alcohol use ) , cancer and cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular problems .
other causes have received much less attention , despite indic@@ ations that they have a considerable impact .
for instance , tra@@ uma ( accidents , hom@@ ic@@ ides and other violence ) and suicide could account for 25 % or more of the mortality of problem drug users . a literature review

in recent co@@ h@@ ort studies in Europe , suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users . however , the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited avail@@ ability of data .
thir@@ teen countries have neither a specific strategy or a section of the national drug strategy dedicated to the reduction of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths , and two countries reported no information .
drug users are informed about over@@ d@@ ose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abst@@ in@@ ence , the effects and risks of pol@@ y@@ drug use , in particular con@@ com@@ it@@ ant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .

the chemical make @@@ -@@ @ up of the two plants reported - kr@@ atom and kav@@ a - is relatively well known from the literature .
they have been traditionally used in other parts of the world and their presence on the European drug scene seems to be limited .
the main active principles of kr@@ atom are mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine , mit@@ ra@@ phy@@ l@@ line and 7 @@@ -@@ @ hydro@@ x@@ y@@ mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine ; though mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine is probably responsible for kr@@ atom 's anal@@ ges@@ ic activity and for reli@@ ev@@ ing the op@@ i@@ oid withdrawal symp@@ t@@ oms .

in this policy brief@@ ing the different types of offences that might be en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ed under a general heading of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime are explo@@ red .

the effects of such drugs include exc@@ it@@ ability , ir@@ rit@@ ability , fear / par@@ ano@@ ia , dis@@ in@@ hibition , dras@@ tic mood sw@@ ings , cogn@@ itive dist@@ or@@ tions and imp@@ aired jud@@ gement , any of which may lead to criminal behaviour .
it is also important to include in this category crimes indu@@ ced by the victim 's own drug use . such crimes are less visible , because many go un@@ reported .
however , such a defin@@ ition of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime is essential to any attempt to assess its extent , pat@@ ter@@ ns and trends .
in practice , each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some sub@@ groups of the population of drug @@@ -@@ @ using offen@@ ders or to some types of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
it is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may v@@ ary even in the same person over time .
this category of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime also includes the for@@ ging of pres@@ crip@@ tions and the bur@@ gling of pharmac@@ ies by drug users , both of which provide medicin@@ es that can be used as sub@@ stitu@@ tes for illi@@ cit products .
however , ir@@ rit@@ ability associated with the withdrawal syn@@ dro@@ me , as well as related mental health problems , may be linked to increased violence .
although many acquis@@ itive crimes committed by drug users are opportun@@ istic , some require more sk@@ ill and others involve some speci@@ alisation .
while the pharmac@@ ology of most illi@@ cit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behavi@@ ours are not fully understood although some substan@@ ces , usually sti@@ mul@@ ants , are known to produce
additionally , from a policy perspective , it is hel@@ p@@ ful to include a legal defin@@ ition model , in which crimes against drug laws are considered to be another type of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
many studies have been carried out on the links between drug use / tra@@ ff@@ i cking and crime , mostly in the United States .
however , some studies have attempted to estimate the pro@@ portion of different types of off@@ ence that are drug @@@ -@@ @ related and then apply this frac@@ tion to produce overall estimates of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
in drug production and transit countries where the rule of law is challenged , system@@ ic crimes may also en@@ comp@@ ass , for example , corruption of businesses , governments and banking systems or crimes against humanity by drug traffic@@ ker@@ s@@ . c@@ kers .
system@@ ic violence is linked to prohibi@@ tion as it stems mainly from the illi@@ cit nature of a market characterised by huge profits and whose participants can@@ not resort to standard business law .
the four categories of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime suggested , and the models on which they are der@@ ived , are not mutually exclusive .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the pro@@ portion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
this would make such crimes relatively less costly ( through reduced prob@@ ability of arrest and shor@@ tened inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation ) and therefore may increase their inci@@ dence .
cocaine use in Europe : implications for service delivery
no proven effective sub@@ stitution or pharmac@@ ological treatment options currently available for cocaine users .
pow@@ der cocaine is typically s@@ nor@@ ted ( in@@ su@@ ff@@ lated ) and , less frequently , in@@ j@@ ected .
it produces e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia and appe@@ ti@@ te sup@@ pression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .
three core groups of problem cocaine users can be identified : socially well @@@ -@@ @ integrated individuals ; op@@ i@@ oid users , some of whom are sub@@ stitution treatment clients ; and margin@@ alised cr@@ ack users .
ac@@ ute and chron@@ ic cocaine use , often in combination with other substan@@ ces , can cause multiple dis@@ orders ( cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular , ne@@ ur@@ ological , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric , et@@ c . ) .
cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
this group is mainly composed of mal@@ es , often referred to treatment by the criminal justice system or under the pressure of social and family networks .
different groups of users
for example , surveys in rec@@ re@@ ational night@@ life sett@@ ings show pre@@ val@@ ence rates 5 to 20 times higher among clu@@ b@@ bers than among
the second group uses both op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and cocaine .
the number of treatment demands related to cocaine use has increased in recent years , notably among those entering treatment for the first time ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .
United States , research on their transfer@@ ability to Europe is urg@@ ently required .
they might seek treatment and support at a later stage of their dependence and thus be more difficult to treat .
it is the smal@@ lest of the three groups ( 2.5 % of all European clients in treatment ) and has only been identified in a few locations .
research on pharmaceutical agents should also be supported and the results made rapidly available , both for positive as well as negative out@@ comes .
finally , cocaine users who are undergoing op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment should be assessed to make sure that their cocaine use is not linked with too low a dos@@ age of meth@@ ad@@ one or bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine .
however , as these approaches and the research about their effectiveness come almost exclusively from the

a growing body of research suggests that chron@@ ic drug use can produce long @@@ -@@ @ term dis@@ rup@@ tions in the mo@@ du@@ lation of ne@@ ur@@ o@@ cogn@@ itive cir@@ cu@@ its involved in motiv@@ ation and attention , decision @@@ -@@ @ making and the ability to in@@ hibi@@ t imp@@ ul@@ ses .

animal studies and other evidence suggest great vari@@ ability in vulner@@ ability to addi@@ ction .
new technologies mean that ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research can start to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological and gen@@ etic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addi@@ ction if they use drugs .
new technologies in addi@@ ction research non @@@ -@@ @ inv@@ asive techniques which may help to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual 's in@@ ability to stop using drugs .
in natural situations , dop@@ am@@ ine is released when a re@@ war@@ ding experience is new , better than expected or un@@ anticipated .
this release of dop@@ am@@ ine helps the individual to memor@@ ise signals announcing a reward .
animal studies indicate that nor@@ ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gic and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ er@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons are coup@@ led ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . limit the activity of each other )
progress in ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research on addi@@ ction has led to the use of drugs which target the dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic system . however , this strategy has not yet proven effective in
ca@@ usal models of addi@@ ction tre@@ ating addi@@ ction , possibly because the wrong dop@@ am@@ ine rec@@ ep@@ tor has been targeted ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . D@@ 2 ) or because other mo@@ du@@ lat@@ ory ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter systems also require consideration .
cho@@ ices or act upon them . drug use en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es a complex set of behavi@@ ours and even the autonomy of dependent individuals is vari@@ able .
even today , some authors remain sceptical about the existence of addi@@ ction , and the extent to which dependent individuals have autonomy over their actions remains a question of fundamental importance .
a number of other novel treatment approaches are in development or are being resear@@ ched which may provide new approaches to tre@@ ating some forms of drug dependence .

patients will need to be given information on different treatment options , and the costs and benefits of any new ther@@ ap@@ y should be carefully considered along with its potential e@@ ffic@@ acy .
a generally accepted ethical principle is that care available in prison sett@@ ings should be equivalent to that available to the wider community .
the data for sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs such as cocaine , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and ec@@ st@@ asy are more mixed , but suggest that high dos@@ es are associated with imp@@ air@@ ment .
the challenge to legisla@@ tors is to design sound and effective laws that can be enforced , and that give a clear message to the public .

ultimately , the use of non @@@ -@@ @ renewable natural resources , such as fos@@ sil fuels , is at the heart of the debate about climate change .
ultimately , environmental pressures that result from , for example , climate change , bio@@ diversity loss , or the use of natural resources , are linked with people 's wel@@ l@@ being ( chapters 2 to 5 ) .
many of the links described above and in the previous chapters are direct , i@@ .@@ e@@ . changes in the state of one environmental issue can trans@@ late directly into pressures of another .

unprecedented change , inter@@ connected risks and increased vulner@@ abilities pose new challenges
as in the past , future climate change imp@@ acts are expected to affect dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately the most vulnerable in society : children , the elderly , and the poor .
however , this too raises the question about the sharing of access and benefits , since often sp@@ ati@@ al planning and investment decisions favour the rich at the expense of the poor .
crises such as these have also shown how difficult it is for society to deal with risks . well sign@@ posted and numerous early warnings

the desire to make economic and social progress that does not come at the expense of the natural environment is not new .
in some cases , natural capital that is dep@@ le@@ ted can be sub@@ stitu@@ ted by other types of capital , such as non @@@ -@@ @ renewable energy resources that are used to develop and invest in renewable energy sources .
since the industrial revolution there has been a shift away from using renewable resources to non @@@ -@@ @ rene@@ w@@ ables to fuel our economy .
the Water Framework Direc@@ tive , for example , has the aim of protecting ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems - aqu@@ atic and ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al - at its core .
this creates a need for accounting techniques - including , in particular , comprehensive accounting of land and water resources - that make transparent the full costs and benefits of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem use and maintenance .

the European Environment Agency is working to improve data by ensuring there is complete coverage over time for all member countries and that data delivered are as accur@@ ate as possible .
Europe 's environment should be considered in the context of soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic agen@@ das , such as the Lisbon process and sustainable development , that also have a strong global dimension .
the main barriers to progress in environmental protection and sustainability are the complex , inter @@@ -@@ @ sec@@ toral , inter @@@ -@@ @ disciplinary and international nature of both the problems and the solutions .
the Lisbon economic agenda aims to deliver higher growth and more and be � E@@ R jobs , but progress towards its objectives is mixed .
reducing regional dis@@ par@@ ities , the main goal of the European Union 's co@@ hesion policy , is expected to further enhance ' be � E@@ R ' growth ( see European Commission 3rd Co@@ hesion Report , February 2004 ) .
these in turn are influ@@ encing consumption PA � er@@ ns and sp@@ ati@@ al planning decisions , with transport in particular playing an increasingly pi@@ vo@@ tal role in the economy and people 's lives .
the pressures on urban ag@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ations across Europe are expected to increase further as people seek to improve their living standards by moving to where the employment opportunities are greatest .
the consumption demand PA � er@@ ns of older people tend to Sh@@ i � towards services such as social and le@@ is@@ ure activities , including tourism , with consequ@@ ent environmental imp@@ acts .
so , for example , the explosive increase in air travel , which is the fas@@ test growing source of green@@ house gas emissions , reflects in part these changes in demo@@ graphy .
semi @@@ -@@ @ natural and exten@@ sively far@@ med areas are very vulnerable to changes in land management such as the c@@ ess@@ ation of gra@@ z@@ ing and mo@@ wing , which contribute to the maintenance of high biological diversity in these areas .
the continued potential for saving energy is widely recognised .
in the energy supply sector the opportunities for improvement focus in the short term on further swit@@ ching to more efficient natural gas @@@ -@@ @ pow@@ ered production , and in the longer term on increasing use of combined heat and power and dec@@ entr@@ alising electricity generation .
in particular the domestic sector 's demand for electricity and transport are rising in line with increasing wealth and the growing number of smaller households .
the current policy tools for dealing with waste are inadequate and need to be comple@@ mented by approaches that promote s@@ mar@@ ter resource use by changing production and consumption PA � er@@ ns and through innovation .
most new areas have been created at the expense of agricultural land , but are also en@@ cro@@ aching on fo@@ rested land .
built @@@ -@@ @ up areas have a heavy impact on soil function : where the top@@ soil is taken off during construction , removing the built sur@@ face would not restore the soil to a useful resource .
urban sp@@ ra@@ w@@ l can also lead to economic se@@ gre@@ gation , seen in areas of in@@ ner @@@ -@@ @ city der@@ el@@ ic@@ tion and extensive per@@ ip@@ h@@ eral es@@ ta@@ tes , o � en with sub @@@ -@@ @ standard housing .
however , by 2003 the sites designated by
both these trends have negative environmental consequences , especially on bio@@ diversity .
as well as taking a higher share of the total agricultural budget it is important that rural development expendi@@ ture , and in particular the agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes , is properly targeted at areas of high bio@@ diversity .
Spain and Greece , for example , spent around EU@@ R 4 per hectar@@ e on AG@@ RI @@@ -@@ @ environmental sch@@ e@@ mes in 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2002 while in Finland and Austria the figure was around EU@@ R 80 per hectar@@ e .

Dec@@ ou@@ pling transport demand from economic growth has been a key aim of EU transport policy for several years but has yet to show results .
fre@@ ight vol@@ u@@ mes are growing faster than the economy ( at around 3 % a year compared with 2 % , for the 15 older EU M@@ ember States ) ( 31 ) .
this largely reflects the pan @@@ -@@ @ European production and consumption PA � er@@ ns that are accompan@@ ying the expansion of the EU internal market .
air transport is growing by 6 @@@ -@@ @ 9 % per year in both the old and new EU M@@ ember States .
prices are an important factor for ste@@ ering demand in a market economy , and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of us@@ er prices are relevant .
there is clear agreement that transport prices do not fully cover the external costs caused by transport activities , although consensus is lacking on the exact figure to be paid .
the most important vari@@ able element is taxation on fuel , but fuel prices have remained within the same price range for more than 20 years .
implementing full @@@ -@@ @ cost pri@@ cing could help reduce environmental imp@@ acts in the same way as regulating air poll@@ ut@@ ants has led to substantial decreas@@ es in the regulated emissions .
the reasons are complex but largely linked to soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic factors such as the expansion of the EU internal market , which is driving the rise in fre@@ ight transport .

further improvements will take place as even stricter regulations come into force in the coming years and as older vehicles are replaced with new@@ er ones .
sul@@ ph@@ ur di@@ ox@@ ide is a different case : large reductions in road transport emissions ( 61 % ) have been off@@ set by a similar increase in emissions from international maritime transport .
further action is needed to bring down pollution , especially as limits and targets may be tigh@@ tened in response to growing evidence of health imp@@ acts at concentr@@ ations below the current values .

the emis@@ sion cuts achieved so far have been mainly due to the introduction of cataly@@ sts on new cars and to the implementation of the EU sol@@ ven@@ ts direc@@ tive , which has led to lower emissions from industrial processes .
discussions are under way within the framework of the EU C@@ le@@ an Air for Europe process ( 35 ) that may lead to present limits being re@@ considered and eventually tigh@@ tened .
the urban population for which exposure estimates can be made increased from 51 to 1@@ 03 million people over the same period .

other imp@@ acts include an increase of about ten days in the average growing season in Europe over the past 20 years .
however , projections indicate that this positive development may in some areas be counter@@ acted by an increased risk of water shortage , which would harm veget@@ ation .
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col has set a target of reducing green@@ house gas emissions from industri@@ alised countries to 5 % below 1990 levels by the period 2008 @@@ -@@ @ 2012 .
a recent study confirms previous estimates that to m@@ iti@@ gate climate change in the longer term much larger global emis@@ sion reductions would be needed ( 37 ) .
for example , the United Kingdom and Germany have reduction targets of 60 % and 30 % ( from 1990 levels ) , to be met by 20@@ 50 and 20@@ 30 respectively .

green bi@@ om@@ ass ( ne@@ ed@@ les and leaves ) of veget@@ ation increased by 12 % , an indicator of enhanced plant growth .
these positive effects of rising temper@@ ature on plant growth may be off@@ set by an increased risk of water shortage that would harm veget@@ ation .

it also illu@@ strated that for successful implementation of environmental policies we need to engage at a global and regional level with all actors .
over the last few years environment policy questions have again moved up the political agenda , which is lasting proof of the E@@ EA 's work , and that its contribution is now more relevant than ever .
in addition , and looking to the next five years , I would like to highlight some of the E@@ EA 's strategic issues .
the 5 @@@ -@@ @ year State of Environment reports and the pan @@@ -@@ @ European assessments produced by the Agency have helped shape the priorities of the research framework programmes .

new ways of identi@@ fying emerging environmental problems
through our newly form@@ at@@ ted publication S@@ ign@@ als , we will bring to the attention of our readers those issues that we consider likely to we@@ igh heavily on the agenda for the coming year .
our work is based on the precautionary principle , evaluation of the burden of evidence , decision @@@ -@@ @ making under var@@ ying degrees of uncertainty and the use of decision @@@ -@@ @ support models and scenarios .
at the E@@ EA , we will be building the equivalent of official statistics for ecological services and environmental assets ; to set alongside the traditional assets of our economy .
in the future we will be able to demonstrate how companies and governments can em@@ bed ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services to restructure the global economy .
as more and more people become convinced about the importance of the environment in their lives , the demand for reliable local information has grown explos@@ iv@@ ely .
providing information through the E@@ EA 's networks has been a unique and positive experience .
the E@@ EA has been extending and building its networks and sources for obser@@ ving and knowledge @@@ -@@ @ gathering through its global citizen environment observatory .
today , the majority of Europeans agree that the environment has a significant impact on their quality of life and that global trends play a significant part in this .
at the same time , citizens remain concerned about climate change , the quality of air they bre@@ a@@ the , how to deal with waste and the imp@@ acts of chem@@ ic@@ als .
they have many questions about what is happening to the environment and how it will affect them and future generations .

the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C , is a first step in the long @@@ -@@ @ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
they must achieve this target during the period 2008 @@@ -@@ @ 2012 ( 2 ) .@@ Countries are expected to meet their K@@ yo@@ to targets mainly by cutting emissions at home .
immediately after the hand @@@ -@@ @ over of the ' invent@@ ory ' report , the E@@ EA 's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culmin@@ ating in the ' Tren@@ ds and projections ' report .
the first E@@ EA green@@ house gas report comes out each spring and is called the ' invent@@ ory ' report .
green@@ house gas@@ es in this context refer to a collection of the most serious climate changing gas@@ es including : car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide , me@@ than@@ e , nit@@ ro@@ us ox@@ ide as well as f@@ lu@@ or@@ inated gas@@ es .
consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total green@@ house gas@@ es emissions in the EU .
within this , each EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember State has a differ@@ enti@@ ated reduction target : some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase .
the EU ' emissions Tr@@ ading scheme ' ( EU E@@ T@@ S ) is another tool , which helps

in simple language the ph@@ r@@ ase reflects the fact that developed nations have a greater responsibility for the green@@ house gas@@ es in our atmosphere .
next December , a major task of the Co@@ p 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .

current d@@ rough@@ ts and water crisis must be dealt with in the short term to ensure that people have water .
governments at local and national level , desper@@ ate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s for st@@ oring water , water transfer and de@@ sal@@ ination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .
Ex@@ tre@@ mes of heat and drought , rain and flooding are affecting many parts of Europe .
however , even if emissions stop today , climate change will continue for a long time due to the historical build up of green@@ house gas@@ es in the atmosphere .

at a cost of G@@ BP 200m , more than EU@@ R 250m , the facility could supply 140 million lit@@ res of water a day , enough to supply 400 000 homes .
this means taking action to reduce and manage demand instead of simply trying to increase the supply of water .

the C@@ AP currently has two ' pil@@ lars ' : production and there is a stronger focus on rural development and environmental objectives .
in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the E@@ EA is also preparing an analysis of the C@@ AP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsi@@ dy 's ' environmental ' spending .
• P@@ il@@ lar II recognises the central role of far@@ ming as a supplier of food and goods , as the cor@@ ner@@ stone of rural societies and as a potential environmental manager .
in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 , far@@ ming causes almost half of the nit@@ ro@@ gen pollution in rivers , 94 % of am@@ mon@@ ia emissions and 9 % of total green@@ house gas emissions .
many of our rar@@ est species are actually dependent on the continuation of traditional far@@ ming practices .
high nature value ( H@@ N@@ V ) far@@ m@@ land is land that is particularly rich in ha@@ bit@@ ats and species of conserv@@ ation concern .
most farmers have intensified production or abandoned far@@ ming altogether - trends that threaten natural habi@@ tat@@ s.@@ A@@ n important agriculture policy challenge is to provide economic incentives to farmers for a continuation of w@@ ild@@ life friendly far@@ ming practices .
the Com@@ mon Agriculture Policy ( C@@ AP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @@@ -@@ @ war food shortages .
the subsi@@ dy has increasingly been dec@@ ou@@ pled from its original goal of increasing food
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the E@@ EA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
however , spending on AG@@ RI @@@ -@@ @ environment sch@@ e@@ mes - the element most related to conserv@@ ation - is not strongly connected to the amount of H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land in the areas studied ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .
conclusions from this example could be applied to the entire C@@ AP budget in terms of its environmental improvement efforts : the C@@ AP is having an effect but it 's not effective enough .

in almost every year when the co@@ d stock has been assessed , the TA@@ C has been set higher than the recommended level .
the Bal@@ tic was actually a fres@@ h@@ water lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
sal@@ in@@ ity in the Bal@@ tic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Bal@@ tic Sea .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
it has been estimated that an additional 30 % is lan@@ ded illegally in this part of the Bal@@ tic Sea .
quite a small reduction in the sal@@ in@@ ity is already ti@@ pping the balance and changing the composition of the Bal@@ tic ha@@ bit@@ at .
of the three major f@@ ished species , co@@ d , her@@ ring , and spr@@ at , co@@ d is particularly sensitive to reduced sal@@ in@@ ity because sal@@ in@@ ity affects both their re@@ productive capacity and the avail@@ ability of the preferred food for co@@ d lar@@ va@@ e .
over time , there has been a steady increase in the area affected by hydro@@ gen sul@@ p@@ hide in the East and West Got@@ land bas@@ ins , and the ou@@ ter Gul@@ f of Finland .

so@@ ils and plants are damage our soil and water resources .
however , risks within Europe could be les@@ sen@@ ed with the right choice of crops and management .
in this context , the E@@ EA has been looking at how the im@@ pending bio@@ energy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from rene@@ w@@ ables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , et@@ c@@ . as well as bio@@ energy ) by 2020 .
at the moment , rene@@ w@@ ables account for 6.@@ 7 % of European energy consumption .
two thirds of this comes from bi@@ om@@ ass@@ .@@ The European Commission is also keen to promote bi@@ of@@ u@@ els - fuel for transport - as diversi@@ fication is particularly important in transport because of its dependence on oil .
the European Parliament has recently called for a guarantee that 40 % of the 10 % target will come from sources that do not compete with food production .
promoting bi@@ of@@ u@@ els and other bio@@ energy in Europe inev@@ it@@ ably tri@@ ggers direct and indirect effects elsewhere .
in this way the EU can take the lead in building a truly sustainable bio@@ energy sector .
this process har@@ nesses the heat that is a by @@@ -@@ @ product of energy production .
however , a clear message still emer@@ ges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate m@@ iti@@ gation , to pri@@ or@@ iti@@ se bio@@ energy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
the factors driving the export and import of waste v@@ ary : avail@@ ability of special treatment technology ; a shortage of materials ; differences in prices for disposal or recovery .
as long as this waste is not for disposal at its destination and does not contain haz@@ ard@@ ous materials , it is deemed to be an acceptable trade .
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the ship@@ ment of haz@@ ard@@ ous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment@@ .@@ Electronic waste , which is considered haz@@ ard@@ ous , is an important case .
waste of all descri@@ p@@ tions is on the move .
increasing amounts , especially of waste paper , plas@@ tics and met@@ als are being shi@@ pped from developed countries to countries where environmental standards are less str@@ ingent .
the ban contained in this Convention has not been signed by enough countries to bring it into force g@@ lob@@ ally .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' haz@@ ard@@ ous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .

driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher .
using European trade statistics it is possible to identify the amounts , size and value of exports of used electronic and electrical products shi@@ pped from the EU to other regions ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) .
for over a decade , the cost of raw materials has been very high and this , in turn , has increased the value of secondary raw materials rec@@ la@@ imed through recycling .
the amount of plastic pack@@ aging recy@@ c@@ led has increased from about 10 to 14 million tonnes in the same period .
in general , recycling therefore contributes substan@@ tially to the reduction of energy @@@ -@@ @ related emissions of cost and

waste paper from EU M@@ ember States to other EU M@@ ember States and non @@@ -@@ @ EU countries
the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shi@@ pped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don '@@ t know whether it is bad for the environment .
in 2005 20 % of the waste shi@@ pped was for disposal while 80 % was shi@@ pped for recovery operations .
two new EU initiatives , in which the E@@ EA is playing a leading role and which will be further developed throughout 2009 , are at the heart of this drive .
