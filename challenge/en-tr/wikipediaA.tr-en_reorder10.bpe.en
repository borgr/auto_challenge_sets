to add another elec@@ tr@@ on to a given volume requires raising an elec@@ tr@@ on 's energy level to make room , and this requirement for energy to com@@ press the material manif@@ ests as a pressure .
when the pressure due to this " He@@ is@@ en@@ berg motion " exceeds that of the pressure from the thermal mo@@ tions of the elec@@ tr@@ ons , the elec@@ tr@@ ons are referred to as de@@ generate , and the material is termed de@@ generate matter .
there are a few key differences between the Fer@@ mi level and Fer@@ mi energy , at least as they are used in this article : * The Fer@@ mi energy is only defined at absolute zero , while the Fer@@ mi level is defined for any temper@@ ature .

for example , the La@@ ur@@ ent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number 1 , and the series with only the lin@@ e@@ ar term " x " is thought of as the simp@@ lest in@@ fin@@ ite@@ si@@ mal , from which the other in@@ fin@@ ite@@ sim@@ als are constructed .
since a Tay@@ lor series evalu@@ ated with a La@@ ur@@ ent series as its argument is still a La@@ ur@@ ent series , the system can be used to do cal@@ cul@@ us on trans@@ cen@@ d@@ ental functions if they are analy@@ tic .
in such cases , a sens@@ ation of weight , in the sense of a state of stress can occur , even if the gra@@ vit@@ ational field was zero .

= = = Ob@@ serv@@ ational fra@@ mes of reference = = = A@@ n ob@@ serv@@ ational frame of reference , often referred to as a " physical frame of reference , " a " frame of reference , " or simply a " frame , " is a physical concept related to an observer and the observer 's state of motion .
in order to catch up to the first car , it will take a time of , that is , 25 seconds , as before .
the meas@@ ure@@ ments that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer 's frame of reference ( you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three , when in fact it arrived at three ) .
in his frame of reference , Alfred defin@@ es the spot where he is standing as the origin , the road as the x @@@ -@@ @ ax@@ is and the direction in front of him as the positive y @@@ -@@ @ ax@@ is .
Bet@@ sy , in choosing her frame of reference , defin@@ es her location as the origin , the direction to her right as the positive " x " -@@ ax@@ is , and the direction in front of her as the positive " y " -@@ ax@@ is .
if Bet@@ sy 's v@@ el@@ o@@ city " V " is constant , she is in an iner@@ tial frame of reference , and she will find the acceler@@ ation to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference , " a " in the negative " y " -@@ direction .
fra@@ mes of reference are especially important in special rela@@ tivity , because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant frac@@ tion of the speed of light , then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame .
that is , there exists a " universal " time and all other times in all other fra@@ mes of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time ir@@ respective of their position and v@@ el@@ o@@ city .
seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manif@@ est@@ ation of iner@@ tia appears to ex@@ ert a force ( either in cent@@ rif@@ ug@@ al direction , or in a direction or@@ th@@ og@@ onal to an object 's motion , the Cor@@ i@@ ol@@ is effect ) .
a common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and transla@@ ting ( an example is a frame of reference att@@ ached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried ) .

the conventional w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th window , known as the C band , covers the w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th range 1.@@ 53 @@@ -@@ @ 1.@@ 57 µ@@ m , and " d@@ ry fi@@ ber " has a low @@@ -@@ @ loss window promising an extension of that range to 1.@@ 30 @@@ -@@ @ 1.@@ 65 µ@@ m .
because of the high complex@@ ity with modern w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th @@@ -@@ @ division multi@@ p@@ lex@@ ed signals ( including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20 km ) , the cost of these repe@@ at@@ ers is very high .
this value is a product of b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th and distance because there is a trade off between the b@@ and@@ w@@ id@@ th of the signal and the distance it can be carried .
in Europe , and among tel@@ co@@ s in the United States , B@@ P@@ O@@ N ( AT@@ M @@@ -@@ @ based Broad@@ band P@@ O@@ N ) and G@@ P@@ O@@ N ( G@@ ig@@ a@@ bit P@@ O@@ N ) had roots in the F@@ SA@@ N ( Ful@@ l Service Acc@@ ess Network ) and I@@ TU @@@ -@@ @ T standards organiz@@ ations under their control .
